smell yummy feel luxurious lip say game changer like idea using lip mask routine like others said lip arent supple morning anything crazy like theyre still dry dry would didnt use maybe thats issue people drier skin type actually recommend using lip balm throughout day instead since make lip look plump juicy freshly applied better as a daytime lip balm?
