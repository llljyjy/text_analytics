honestly love cleansing apply small amount slightly damp skin feel like really prep skin rest routine fairly lightweight absorbs quickly doesnt feel heavy greasy skin really nice use something know going little harsher drying skin like clay mask treatment acne also like use thin texture sunscreen make formula little hydrating necessity sure love perfect for oily skin!
