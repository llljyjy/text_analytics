never tried product lactic acid using tret even though using tret consistently still make really dry peely however one night using woke next day skin super soft hydrated using consistently week skin isnt dry fact feel visibly softer smoother day one pump serum need absorbs quickly feel nice also laser treatment cant say much product contributed glow even texture however huge fan like gentle enough use everyday without making super dry works like a charm
