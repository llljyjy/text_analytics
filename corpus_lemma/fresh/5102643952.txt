texture pretty creamy reminds medium weight moisturizer labeled overnight treatment expecting heavier consistency tried using alone moisturizers found using alone didnt much moisture level next morning face didnt feel like retained extra moisture prefer use conjunction regular night cream someone combo oily skin think would prefer use summer skin doesnt need much moisture scent wise light floral scent like Light weight & did not wow me
