first wasnt fan smelled like paint glue rubbing skin could smell chamomile balm however moisturizing without feeling thick application skin feel smooth without feeling like put thick lotion find bit pricey use body would limit face hand overall find okay like formulated without synthetic fragrance worth price nan
