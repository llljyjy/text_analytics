first time trying bit wowed tbh would apply night morning find face glowing although effect faded time started using week worked way everyday use either night morning seeing dramatic result yet though dark eye circle freckle high cheek post pimple mark jaw none discolouration lightened far month almost daily use ingredient good well researched bought full sized tube hoping see result month smell find offensive overpowering smell medicinal headache triggering nauseating like perfumed cream actually highly sensitive artificial smell get nauseous dizzy around strong perfume cream absolutely fine use cream treatment expecting medicinal smell fine also small tube last quite long time glow at first, stalled thereafter
