far enjoying using serum fragrance strong make product feel high end luxurious reminds rose maybe little bit sandalwood serum reminds mineral sunscreen sort white cast dissipates minute also light sunscreen feeling applying putting something noticed skin look healthier little glowy week use day night would repurchase wasnt expensive end day dont think price justify result Luxurious but too pricy
