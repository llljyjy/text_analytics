wasnt terribly impressed night cream nice hydrating woke soft skin repeat use never saw drastic change appearance skin scent cream absolutely atrocious hate put fragrance overpowering also epitome old lady fragrance dont usually aversion scent skincare cream particularly offensive This night cream is just okay
