overrated experience whole well rounded luxe packaging nice texture light spa scent fall short price hair better moisturizers range great slightly sun wind burned skin happens soothing sped skin recovery made comfortable tolerable mean would definitely great gift someone special unless making per month really cant justify every day moisturizer little kind go long way usually overrated
