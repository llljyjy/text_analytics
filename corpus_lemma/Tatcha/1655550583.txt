one best sunscreen ive ever used check box clean mineral higher spf etc look feel amazing light medium olive complexion leaf white cast give beautiful dewy glow actually surprised havent heardseen hype sunscreen issue many others product overflowing however issue outer layer packaging flaking getting face running low also realized since top part bottle right nozzle bit kind squared lot product probably sitting invert bottle instead flowing nozzle make sense packaging super annoying honestly love product much continue repurchase hope figure better packaging without changing formula Great spf, crap packaging
