received sample product influencer exchange honest review dont love packaging sample sized product seems like lot plastic packaging waste little difficult get component serum however think full size packaging would solve problem nicely since look like pump would expel component evenly like texture serum lightweight moisturizing without feeling oily greasy cant really tell difference fine line versus product used time scent light fresh wont fight product would consider buying particularly winter need little extra moisture boost nan
