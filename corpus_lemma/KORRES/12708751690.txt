really enjoyed moisturizer kinda actually surprised cause usually fond gel moisturizers dont get wrong blow mind rare however probably one thickest gel moisturizers ever used preference good thing definitely gave great hydration however far blurring pore didnt really notice much abnormally large pore honestly yet find moisturizer doesnt contain dimethicone like lot people try avoid actually noticeably blur pore something however notice face feel fresh clean using moisturizer think gentle exfoliation going salicylic acid also enjoyed light scent moisturizer overall think great moisturizer know maybe use may actually see pore look diminished Hydrating!
