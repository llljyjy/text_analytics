got sample free review thought moisturizer really nice gel cream texture soak skin quickly left skin feeling velvety soft using week noticed pore look bit smaller hoping would help acne since salicylic acid didnt didnt make worse either plus using moisturizer oily skin scent nice overwhelming kinda smell like grapeswine faintly really enjoyed cream would purchase future Great moisturizer!
