used trial size made skin feel supple soft next day lightweight oil wont make mess dab well would compare drunk elephant marula oil term skin felt afterward isnt heavy definitely made impact gave subtle glow smell downside smell strong smell exactly like robitussin dont know worth buy full sized product might even inclined listen review try rosehip oil instead Decent “skin drink”
