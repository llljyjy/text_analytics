really wanted like product loving discontinued product ptr cream spf vitamin sadly far heavy preference unless extremely dry skin would heavy layer moisturizers definitely wouldnt bother using morning unless want greasy look personally didnt notice much result little brightening ive used bottle thinner formulation probably wouldve enjoyed product result instead feeling shiny Too heavy for a serum
