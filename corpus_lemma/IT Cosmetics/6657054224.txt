really like face cream first wasnt sure kind thick little heavy feeling skin absorbs quickly though sink skin made skin plump feel hydrated seemed fill small line woke skin still looked plumped hydrated light fresh scent kind citrusy maybe lemon grass overpowering wish cream bit lighter could use daytime perhaps dryer winter month would work daytime make skin look great definitely recommend stuff Great face cream, you need to try it!
