ive chance use time since skin doesnt tolerate retinol every night well overall really nice thin texture applies easily doesnt sting applying dry skin much overnight like airless pump retinol stay stable longer irritation sensitive skin also use every night know skin skin look refreshed morning havent using long enough see reduction fine line seems promising though Good packaging for a retinol
