overall liked patch first one ive used retinol nervous keeping minute might cause irritation however havent noticed taking definitely made skin feel immediately smoother firmer fine line slightly softened definitely work feel great say struggled little bit opening package separating patch little mesh piece especially there lot product make process messygoopy also experienced little bit sliding around patch needed reposition multiple time next time apply lay prevent sliding slight mess worth overall end result though Good patches, just a little messy
