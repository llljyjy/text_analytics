devout user dennis gross extra strength peel pad many year staple skincare routine ive started get small amount fine wrinkle forehead sadly slightly deeper line around eye excited see product using time per week week ive noticed modest improvement line face nice glow smoothness first use woke next morning flaky skin uncomfortable dryness lasted day skin adapted couple us prepared biggest probably complaint price dont much regular peel pad yet significantly expensive realize arent every day use like pad make sense come smaller quantity price justifiable dont mind spending money quality product unless price per pad come get sale wont repurchase Noticeable improvement but doesnâ€™t justify price.
