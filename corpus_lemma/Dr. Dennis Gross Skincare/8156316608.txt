product okay already use ddg peel pad looking alternative could possibly cost efficient know ironic neither product cheap lol anyways used nightly month didnt notice dramatic difference find peel pad work better keep skin even toned breakout free consistency serum like lightweight oil absorbs quickly although favourite formulation also doesnt smell pleasant either one discontinue using product smell bad delivers great result however wasnt impressive just okay
