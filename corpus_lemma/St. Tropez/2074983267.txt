ill start saying used every self tanner always struggle using tanner face usually wash next day dont think skincare routine overly aggressive know self tanner didnt last either unfortunately even tried applying directly face moisturizer etc still washed next day also pale like almost seethrough pale would think colour would stay however like colour develops may work returned Fades Away Quickly
