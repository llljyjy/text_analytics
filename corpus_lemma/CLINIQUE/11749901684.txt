used face neck week reading excellent review see others might ill write thought unfortunately product didnt much anything extremely chronically dry skin didnt really sink skin didnt feel like getting moisture skin felt like coated something still tight dry product isnt juicy enough severely dehydrated skin lightweight reason giving product low rating simply didnt work dramatically different lotion better day cream option skin similar mine however giving two star opposed one think product could maybe better match normal combo oily skin heavy also skin stupidly sensitive didnt see redness feel stinging burning there recommend product whose skin need lot extra help term moisture dont think terrible product someone else Bad for super dry skin, but maybe good for others.
