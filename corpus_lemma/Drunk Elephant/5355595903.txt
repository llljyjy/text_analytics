let start saying believe oil stand true claim however would advise sensitive skin use cautiously first see skin reacts frequently skin handle serum ive found oil doesnt work well combination serum wait awhile let soak finishing skincare routine ive definitely noticed dryness peeling using product everyday ive decreased every day definitely think work little well sensitive skin everyday use definitely great product overall really love retinol oil absorbs quickly It definitely works!!
