honestly surprised didnt burn skin afraid try retinaldehyde niacinamide always reaction use salicylic acid knew going similar wrong used every day start feeling confident enough try every week definitely smoothed skin texture could tell difference hour later dry skin around lip usually reaction zero burning would recommend using cactus serum like yttp suggests make sure use lip balm least twice day overall would definitely try Sensitive Skin here
