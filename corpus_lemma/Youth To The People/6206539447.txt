overall ive used better eye cream price wouldnt buy dislike product lotion doesnt sink skin doesnt leave feeling moist product like thick body butter requires rubbing soak delicate eye shouldnt rub much didnt feel added firmness smooth dont feel like hydrated skin prefer kiehls avocado eye cream using simple body lotion Too expensive and didn't work for me
