without doubt good moisturizer thick moisturizing absorbs quickly doesnt sit skin fragrance smell smell like medicine herb tbh would prefer faint scent cover smell product doesnt smell bad personally dont like cant say noticed difference skin using could might restock overall decent product slightly higher price point one star smell dont love nothing else wrong really not my fav but not bad either
