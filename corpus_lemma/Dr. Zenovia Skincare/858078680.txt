expecting little product biggest complaint thin formula would liked thick cream instead price point absorb quickly though definitely made skin feel firmer plumped didnt irritate skin next day using one friend told skin glowed sure result product nice hear helped make makeup application easier would loved spf add morning would love see pump applicator instead cleaner type application rather putting finger jar use formula day night great need extra product nan
