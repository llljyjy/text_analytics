truly hope producer read review reconsider fragrance recipe one worst scent ive ever experienced beauty product stinky product maybe like old rose water scent look review enough warrant overpowering use want like since go nicely velvety touch honestly also quite heavy cant get past smell stay since face rarely ever thrown away sample one Smell is just terrible :(
