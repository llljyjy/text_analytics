excited get free honest review unfortunately moisturizer packaging look nice except bottom rounded need store upside found another review remove rounded casing wasnt instruction would never figured upset though additional packaging reason find wasteful eco friendly cream slight medicinal smell didnt really bother didnt linger cream light feel nice smooth going absorbs well could use night matter layered product whatever put cream would completely ball even waited minute dry didnt notice noticeable difference skin using month doesnt really mattify isnt moisturizing enough dry skin dont think cream worth price tag Doesnâ€™t Work For Me
