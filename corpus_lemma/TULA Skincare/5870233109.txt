amazed many review mention stench although somewhat unique absolutely enjoy perhaps genetic trait like cilantro people adore including others claim taste like soap used using retinol treatment dried face got pretty excellent result although review claimed product strong odor odor low maybe unless sensitive put using product long time pleased adore since calming touch doesnt clog pore absorbs quickly feelthink see result already mo repurchasing Smell is not as bad as people complaining
