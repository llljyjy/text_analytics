actually wanted try happened receive exchange reviewing super excited thought sunscreen texture watery kind difficult put used hand apply left streaky mark didnt absorb well enough would really liked kept skincare routine different consistency tint would even skin maybe normal super dry like anyway skin would work wonderfully Ok mineral sunscreen
