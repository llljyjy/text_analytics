surprised actually enjoyed product fairly sensitive skin bit weary using exfoliating wash actually gentle also smelt good always plus use twice week even though say use every day safe made skin feel super clean refreshed wasnt drying either always concern mine felt hydrating without making oily skin oily overall great product Definitely recommend
