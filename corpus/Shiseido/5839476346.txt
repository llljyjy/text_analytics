I received this complimentary from Influenster! I really like this brand, and the serum from the same line is great! This cream feels nice, and I like that it has SPF which is always useful. It appears to be thick, but it is actually breaks down like a lotion/serum, so it will absorb into the skin fairly quickly depending on the amount applied. I don’t like that it leaves my face a little oily. I think the price is about average for the brand, and the container is pretty big compare to other Sephora brands ($50 for 50mL). However, I’m not super in love with this cream in comparison to other creams I have tried. The added oiliness to my skin is kinda a bummer for me. I think this is a good buy for dry to normal faces.
