Thank you @shiseido and @influenster, I am so happy to get to try these sunscreens for freeeee because i am on the hunt for my HG to work in this TX heat!  The Urban Environment Oil-free feels a little more thicker on the face vs the Fresh Moisture one but both have the same amount of sunscreen-y smell that dissipates after a while. Ive tried (and have) most drugstore and the ones found at sephora as well as some k beauty brands. I work outdoors and so far these two have been the most comfortable and effective even if I don’t reapply in my 5hr shifts. Best of all, both formulations work so well with make up! I have large pores and oily skin, and these sunscreens dont clog my pores and with the right primer, my pores actually disappear. My make up doesn’t run even with sweat and it even looks decent after a 5hrs running around outdoors. My mid40s oily skin seems to prefer the moisture one vs the oil-free one, though I don’t mind using both. Sun protection-wise, i do feel like i get better  protection with Is**n but i still noticed that i reach for the Shiseidos more since I received them. Will definitely purchase once I run out. I love this!
