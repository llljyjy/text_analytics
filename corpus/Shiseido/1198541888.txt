I received this product for free from #influenster in exchange for my honest review. I rarely wear SPF on my face due to having oily t-zone. I like the mattifying effects of this lotion and how far the product goes. And it did not make me break out. However, the price is far too steep for me to justify actually buying it. great mattifying spf but far too pricy
