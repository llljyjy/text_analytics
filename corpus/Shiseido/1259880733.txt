Yes I was given this by Influenster and shiseido for my honest review and I can honestly say I love this sunscreen. I was pleasantly surprised to find the consistency thin, comfortable and a perfect match as a primer for my pat mcgrath foundation. I have sensitive skin and this didn’t break me out at all. It’s odorless and colorless. Best of all it works great! No sun burn. I will now buy this as my new sunscreen. I was surprised to find I love it even more than my usual sunscreen from Goop! It’s perfect. nan
