I love the way this sits on my skin beneath my makeup. So many sunscreens leave behind a shiny, almost greasy finish, but this one seems to absorb very well and doesn’t mess with the finish or consistency of the products being worn on top. It does have a smell to it that I don’t enjoy, but I do find that it fades much faster than most. It’s quite potent and spreads easily so I don’t feel wasteful when I’m using it or as though I’ll be going through it too quickly, which speaks to the value of the product.  I’ve had the opportunity to use other Shiseido suncare products and this one is easily the best. Easily Shiseido’s best sunscreen…
