This concealer has a nice lightweight formula, is hydratingand buildable. It has good coverage and provides a bit ofluminosity that helped cover up my dark under-eyes so alittle goes a long way. The texture is very smooth and not atall tacky (which happens sometimes with waterproofformulas) so it was easy to quickly blend. This has about 6-7hours of staying power before you *might* feel the need totouch up. Great coverage
