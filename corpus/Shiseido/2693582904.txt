After hearing such rave reviews about the previous formula I was eager to try this, so I immediately purchased! As someone with combo skin finding the perfect sunscreen is hard. Upon first trying this it is very hydrating, and takes some time to fully absorb into the skin. At first this feature made me think it was too oily but I assume it is probably just the HA soaking in. After the initial application it does create a nice natural dewy look. After a few weeks of daily use without makeup, I have grown to like it more however, it does have a significant pilling issue. Not as bad as the Paula’s Choice youth-extending, but it’s still noticeable and makes me want to reach for another sunscreen as my daily. Could be the fault of the products layered underneath but still unfortunate. I would recommend giving it a try because the hydration is great, but purchasers beware. Hydrating BUT pills.
