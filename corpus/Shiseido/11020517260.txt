It is very difficult for me to rate this Sunscreen, as it has huge pros and huge cons.Let’s start with the benefits of this product:the sunscreen is perfectly absorbed, not greasy, not sticky, does not leave white marks and does not create a mask effect, doesn’t cause any irritation. I absolutely do not notice or feel this product on my skin.Cons of this product:the sunscreen has an unpleasant smell, and this smell is felt throughout the day. This product does not protect the skin from the sun enough, by the end of the day I noticed the manifestation of my dark spots. I live in Michigan, spring is just beginning and the sun is not yet strong, but the sunscreen could not protect my face. This sunscreen clogs pores a lot, if you have porous skin, this product is definitely not for you. Strongly clogs pores
