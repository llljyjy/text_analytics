This product is easily absorbed into the skin and leaves your skin completely hydrated while also adding a beautiful glow to your skin. This product is great if you goin to be out in the sun for long periods of time especially because it can hold moisture of to 12 hours their for keeping your skin protected and looking hydrated all day. I love this product and definitely recommend for anyone looking for a great sunscreen for this coming summer! Love it!
