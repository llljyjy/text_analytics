This sunscreen is very watery and thin. It makes it a little difficult to apply evenly however it dries super fast and wears under makeup beautifully. I did notice a slight white cast but wasnâ€™t extreme to the point that I would not purchase. I received this product for free for my honest review. Good sunscreen
