First off, I like the texture of the cream. It is thicker and hydrating for normal to dry skin. It does have a sunscreen scent but I don’t mind it. My skin felt very plump once using it. It’s great for no makeup days but may be a little thick under makeup. Overall a great day cream and I would purchase again! For normal to dry skin. Would purchase again!
