I received this product in exchange for an honest reviewCompared to the version of this with SPF, the scent is much milder and the consistency a tad bit more gel like. I really liked this for those reasons, especially since the spf the other version came with wasn’t very high anyway, so I’d use a separate spf. It’s very hydrating and leaves me skin feeling hydrated and protected. My skin doesn’t feel dry during the day, which it can with some moisturizers in the desert and after wearing a mask all day. I don’t know if I’d repurchase, purely because I have other moisturizers that I like more, but the product itself is definitely one that works well for me! nan
