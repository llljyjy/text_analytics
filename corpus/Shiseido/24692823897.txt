#shiseidoskincare #complimentary @shiseido @Influenster I recieved the Shiseido Essential energy hydrating day cream complimentary from Shisedo & #influenster in exchange for my honest review. This product states that it has -! anti pollution,  & hyaluronic acid RED . it reads on the packaging “ With Shiseido original hyaluronic acid RED 24 hour moisture rushes into skins deeper layers ** vital nutrients are delivered throughout kickstarting a healthy hydrated condition that sustains itself. it claims ideal for prepping makeup. In my honest opinion this product is amazing. it really was just what my skin needed. Upon application it also came with an application wand!!!!! the luscious cream, ITS SO LIGHT WEIGHT, just absorbs absolutely melts into the skin, it has no greasy feeling but a serious hydrating effect. my skin literally glows when I use this I have been using it about a week and a half now I notice my skin is radiant and glowing with consistent use I noticed softer skin with hydration also.. the price point seems beyond fair. The results I’m getting are phenomenal compared to other creams I have tried. i will purchase when i run out.#influenster @shiseido #shiseido #ShiseidoSkincare #face #moisturizer #skincare Obsessed.
