I am person that uses sunscreen daily, not just during the summer months. This sunscreen comes out fevers fast and runny liquid, so be fast. My experience with the product when placing on my face, felt chalky rather than a smooth lotion like feel. I was very excited to try this product because it has hyaluronic acid.   I hope to give an update after to weeks of usage. Chalky Feel
