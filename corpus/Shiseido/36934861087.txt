This sunscreen sure came at the right time, the temps are already reaching the 80s and it is so sunny out! The product felt so light on my skin and it doesn’t have that extreme sunscreen smell. It protects my skin and doesn’t feel heavy or come off white! It absorbed into my skin fast and kept me feeling moisturized!! Love it! nan
