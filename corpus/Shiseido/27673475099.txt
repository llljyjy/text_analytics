I am typically not a fan of cream moisturizer as they tend to not be absorbed by my skin as quickly nor as completely as gel type moisturizers. This one has a nice packaging—it’s super heavy and visually worthy of being on display right on top of a vanity. I didn’t mind how the cream felt during application and it sank into my skin evenly, quickly and without leaving me feeling as if I had a greasy filmy residue whatsoever. It leaves my skin feeling and looking nice and healthy! Approved!
