Some of the best sunscreen lotion I’ve ever used.  A very subtle light floral scent, not oily or heavy very lightweight and blends in well.  It does have a slight dewy finish but not enough to make this oily girl feel like an oil slick. I had no bad reaction and reapplication is easy and stress less no oil stains on your clothing or seats.  You should try this.  I used it all over my body I love it. It’s not watery either and does not leave a casting.  I was given this free to try by Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Best sunscreen ever even for oily skin
