This sunscreen is comfortable and hydrating. It is scented but the scent isnâ€™t offensive. This rubs in more like a moisturizer than a sunscreen which is really nice, but it does leave a bit of a white cast. This formula contains ascorbyl tetraisopalmitate which is an ingredient I try to avoid using on my face because of fungal acne so for that reason I would not personally repurchase but other members of my household really enjoyed using this on their faces and I would imagine those without fungal acne would also enjoy this. nan
