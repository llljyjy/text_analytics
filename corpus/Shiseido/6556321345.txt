I was so excited to try this daily moisturizer with SPF! I use it in the morning before I put on makeup and sometimes even at night because I like it so much.  My makeup goes on smooth and it doesn’t cause any streaks or oiliness. I also love the smell.  It’s not heavy, but does have some smell which I personally like to have. I also like the consistency as it’s thick, but not too thick.  It’s just right. I have combination skin and this helps the dry patches so much right before I put my makeup on.  Definitely will purchase on the future. Moisturizing but not oily
