This product is lightly tinted, but it still left a white cast on my fair face. This is not a problem when using it as a primer under makeup. The worst thing about this sunscreen is that it contains high amounts of fragrance. My eyes burn when I apply it close to my eye area. The best thing about this sunscreen is that you can jump into the water right after application. It is water-resistant for up to 40 min.It doesnâ€™t have a matte finish which is good for dry skin. It gives you a nice glow as it contains hyaluronic acid. It is worth mentioning that it has an eco-friendly bottle.To sum up, I have tried so many sunscreens this summer. There are far better-performing sunscreens out there. For this price range, I would expect a better formula. nan
