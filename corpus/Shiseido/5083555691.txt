Is 12 dollars pricey for single use cotton pads? Absolutely, but these are hands down the best cotton pads I have ever used. They’re so soft, don’t scratch at my skin, and are perfect for removing eye makeup, or pretty much anything you can think of. As I’ve gotten older, my skin has become more sensitive(I’m 23), and these don’t irritate my dry patches the way other cotton rounds do. Also, the square shape is nice and fits perfectly into my cotton pad dispenser. I’ve purchased these over and over, and will continue to do so for as long as they are in production. A weird holy grail to stand by, but I love these an unreasonable amount. nan
