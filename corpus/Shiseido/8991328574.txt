I was gifted this in exchange for an honest review. I’ve enjoyed and purchased the original version of this Shiseido sunscreen, and really like the new version as well! I find the new version just a bit easier to apply and spread than the original, and it’s lightweight enough for me to wear daily under makeup! nan
