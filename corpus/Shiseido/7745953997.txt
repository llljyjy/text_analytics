I am in my mid 40s and I am suffering the consequences of not wearing sunscreen in my younger years (so please always wear sunscreen!) Now I use it every day, sunny or rainy, outdoors or indoors, all the time.I tried this sunscreen and I didn’t like it for me. I consider it a beautiful sunscreen, don’t get me wrong, but it is not good for what I want/need from a sunscreen.PROS:- Lightweight formula: it is so easy to spread- It is a translucent formula that doesn’t leave a white cast.- It has a beautiful scent: if you don’t like perfumed products, stay away from this one.- The brand claims that it offers more protection with water and heat, which activates the formula increasing the protection.CONS:- It is a pure chemical sunscreen. I don’t have sensitivity so I can use it on my face but not around my eyes. I prefer physical sunscreens but that’s only my preference.- It has a lot of silicon in the formula. While it makes it very pleasant to apply, it feels wet and slippery all day long. - To get the SPF the brand claims on this product, you need to apply a considerable amount (a nickel-size amount on your face at a minimum is the brand’s suggestion) and applying that, you end up with a shiny slippery face that doesn’t set. If you just apply a very thin layer, it looks really beautiful, but you won’t be getting SPF50 (maybe a 15…, not more)- It didn’t work with my makeup: it is not a good base for my foundations, not even the more matte ones. In the pictures you can see a drop of the product not spread together with the product spread after one hour (still super shiny) The other picture shows the sunscreen completely spread between both hands leaving a beautiful finish, feeling still slippery, but too thin to provide enough protection for me.I will probably use it just on my neck and chest.I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador This one is not for me
