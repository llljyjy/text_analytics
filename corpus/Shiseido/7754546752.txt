I have used the Shiseido sunscreen as a make up primer for about a week. I give the bottle a little shake before applying it. It is nude in color and thinner than other make up primers. It leaves a nice dewy tone on my skin and the smell is very light compared to other sunscreens. I love that this product has hyaluronic acid to retain my skins moisture. I received this product for my honest review but I would purchase it again! nan
