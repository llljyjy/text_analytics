Once you buy these you will never go back to the drug store ones! They are soooo soft on your face and absorb toner so well. I love using them to take off eye makeup too, so gentle and soft! I’ve never felt anything like them and have re-ordered several times. Can’t live without them now! Yes, you do need these! So soft!
