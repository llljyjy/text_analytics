I really enjoyed this serum and it did seem to help with my fine lines that are starting to develop. I can say that it is worth the price if you can afford it, I used it every night for about two month so it does last. I would recommend if youâ€™re looking for a new retinol or a serum to add to your night skincare routine. nan
