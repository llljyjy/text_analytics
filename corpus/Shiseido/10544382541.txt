This is one of the best sunscreens that I have tried. I like to glide it on my face and then rub it in with my fingers a little bit to make the application more even. It seems greasy at first but once it sets it doesn’t feel greasy anymore. I also don’t break out from this sunscreen as I do with other sunscreens. Since it’s a clear stick, it doesn’t leave any white cast. This product also has a nice light and fresh smell. nan
