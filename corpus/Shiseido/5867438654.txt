This is definitely an effective sunscreen as I was outside all day without reapplying and didnâ€™t get burnt. It went on smoothly and blended nicely. However, it does smell like cheap sunscreen and this is NOT reef safe as it has chemical sunscreen ingredients. Really wish this was just a  mineral sunscreen as it would be perfect. Not reef safe, but does work!
