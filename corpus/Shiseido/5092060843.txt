I received this product for free from Influenster for review and testing purposes.First off; I was SO impressed with the packaging upon first impression. The jar is comes in is a great quality heavy duty plastic with cute details that doesn’t leak or make a mess. The box included a little spatula which I love to keep from introducing bacteria into the lotion pot.The lotion has a heavenly whipped consistency that keeps it in place in the jar even when it rolls around in my make up bag on the go. The cream goes on so smooth and feels so good. It has a light fragrance which I love with sunscreen. It doesn’t feel overly oily or heavy, I didn’t find that I sweat more than normal with the product even on the hot summer days. I do not wear foundation so I couldn’t say how it wears under make up but it didn’t leave my natural skin too shiney for my taste. I wish it had a higher SPF since 20 barely gets me to work before I need to reapply. Also, I would not recommend putting anywhere near the eye area as it will burn if the aroma/product runs into your eyes.Overall I would rate this product an 8/10. Some improvements and I would definitely buy this product again. Great overall product; wish it had a higher SPF
