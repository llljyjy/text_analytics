I’m definitely a shiseido fan, but their products is such a high quality, everything that I tried is nothing less than amazing, and it wouldn’t be different with this one. The texture is very fluid, it’s so easy to apply and blend so well that you only need one pump to do your whole face and neck. After use it my skin really feels like satin, it’s so soft. Smells good to me, it’s not a strong scent, what I like for skincare product.It’s one of the best serum’s I’ve ever tried, there’s a “dry touch”, it’s not oily like most of the serums, then is very comfortable to use. Just FYI my forehead and nose used to be oily while the rest of my face is dry, I don’t have problems with pimples or a sensitive skin, and I feel like the serum is great on my dry and oily skin. Very good quality
