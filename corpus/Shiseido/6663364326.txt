I received this free for review. This product comes in a really luxe looking glass bottle with a pump, which I like to control how much product I use. It is lightly fragranced like floral. I personally think it’s not too offensive. The scent does not linger after it dries. It is a very liquidy cloudy serum that spreads easily and absorbs quickly. I did not have any irritation, especially when my skin was sensitive from masks. It claims to be hydrating, radiant, and reduce wrinkles. I do think it hydrates the skin. After 4 weeks of daily use, I don’t think it made any drastic changes. The experience was nice, and I will use it up, but of all the claims, it is mainly just hydrating. nan
