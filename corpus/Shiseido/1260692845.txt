This has a nice milky texture and leaves no greasiness behind. It soaks in so easily that it almost feels like a powder.  For that reason I’m not sure I agree with the “hydrating” claim since it dries down so matte. I will keep this in my rotation because of the consistency but it also leaves quite a white cast. Definitely not for darker skin tones.  I received this product from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review. nan
