So far I have really liked using this Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Day Cream daily since I received it. I like that it doesn’t leave your face feeling sticky like some other creams can. There’s a nice glow or dewiness when you use it. Keeps my face feeling great all day. A good price for the 50mL size because you don’t need to use a lot so it can last longer. Would recommend. Good Option
