This product can be worn with makeup and is a excellent source of skincare! This is a white substance but easy to rub in and has a very light and airy fragrance. Nothing too noticeable or overbearing. It can be worn alone or prior to applying makeup. It is already in the 80-90s in NC so the sun is brutal! This also contains a very high amount of SPF which is pretty convenient for being outside more than a few mins. This is okay to use on my body and makes my skin super soft! This is t to the perfect choice for being at the beach or lake because it stays on such a long time and is waterproof. Also, with the added benefits inside such as the hylauronic acid, it helps to keep my skin hydrated without being too oily. Protects a long time
