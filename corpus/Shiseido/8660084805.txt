This serum absorbs quickly and is very hydrating yet lightweight thus, leaving your skin feeling very soft after application. This serum isn’t heavy under foundation. I do have the occasional break out however, I haven’t experienced any since I’ve started using this product. The scent is very subtle and the packaging is very sleek. So far, I have enjoyed the results of this serum. nan
