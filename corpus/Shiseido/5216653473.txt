I have dry medium tone skin. Love that I can just use one product for both moisturizer and SPF. On days when I’m working from home or studying at home and go out too much, I like using this so I don’t have to layer on so many products. Surprisingly blends easily and thankful doesn’t leave a white cast!Keeps my skin moisturized but it might be better for summer use. Since my skin gets super dry during winter, this isn’t as great to replenish my dry skin (thats why I took off a star)Feels thick at first but blends out and feels very light and comfy on my face. Also not very oily feeling considering it has SPF! Overall I like it but I wouldn’t say it’s my go to all the time since my skin is too dry. Might be better for normal or slightly oily skin!Disclaimer: I received this product for free to try and give my honest opinion. nan
