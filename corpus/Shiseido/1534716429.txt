I have always believed in the superior quality of Japanese skincare brands and Shiseido is the reason why. We can never have enough SPF in our skincare to prevent sun damage. I would still layer another sunblock on top of this cream. The texture is light, lightly scented, and moisturizing enough without feeling oily for my combo skin. nan
