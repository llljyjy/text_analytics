I received this from an Influenster voxbox. I’m not sure what my favorite part is. This was a great moisturizer as it was lightweight and didn’t have a scent. It was gentle on my skin and probably smoother out some wrinkles. Would recommend, the only thing I’d change is the packaging because it’s about 3 times bigger than I needs to be with the amount of product it has (this made it more difficult to travel with). I also wish it included SPF Almost perfect
