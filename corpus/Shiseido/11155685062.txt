I received this product for free, to try out and give my honest review, I really wanted to love this product but after I applied the sunscreen my face was completely white, I looked like a ghost, the white cast is too strong, at least for my skin color, then at the end of the day when I washed my face, my skin felt extremely dry, my type of skin is a combination. nan
