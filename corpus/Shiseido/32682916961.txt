I feel this one is better for days that you will be out with bigger sun exposure. Especially since it’s waterproof. It’s a little but thicker but still absorbs super fast and no residue. Can also be used under your make up. I really liked that both had hyaluronic acid! It makes them super hydrating! Perfect spf for a day outside
