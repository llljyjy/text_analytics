I received these products for free fromInfluenster and Shiseido Urban Environment in exchange for my honest review. This sunscreen scared me at first. It came out of the bottle a watery and went on feeling a little oily. After about 2 minutes it just went into my skin and didn’t feel oily anymore. It felt very light on the skin. I wore it under my makeup and my makeup sat perfectly on my skin. I would recommend this to people because it isn’t like other sunscreens. I feel like it’s really hard to find one that doesn’t make me feel oily, since I have combination skin. It also didn’t leave a white cast, but that could just be me because I am very pale. Beautiful under makeup
