I’ve received this product for free for review purposes, but I intentionally was waiting to give this more time to review to see if more days of use would finally show some kind of effect worth reporting...like, anything at all? but I saw literally no difference from my previous serum use when keeping my routine as-is and switching that serum for this one. I even did change some other items on a few select occasions, like my moisturizer or night cream, just to see if the things I paired it with were holding it back. There were no-makeup days I wore it at home. No matter what, there was no activity to report. I’m grateful to have been allowed to try this for free, because this otherwise would have felt for paying like legit nothing in return except high expectations from a high-hype, high-end brand name. I’m disappointed because people really do seem to praise this brand as among the best in luxury skincare, but I can’t even stretch a small effect into something good to say -- the best I can say is that nothing got noticeably worse. Giving a second star since it at least smelled very good, but smell can be very sensitive for people. No effect
