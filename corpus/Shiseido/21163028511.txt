I received this product complimentary to test. And I am so glad I did. After having my second daughter I’ve noticed my skin to be very sensitive. I’ve also noticed that I feel almost allergic to sunscreen. So of course I was hesitant to try this, however my skin seems to be fine with it! I love the ingredients and it feels like I have nothing on! Love it!
