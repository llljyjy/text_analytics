I have dry/sensitive skin and have been trying to find the right moisturizer to replace my previous one which has been discontinued from the Ohui Korean brand. And i have tried almost everything from drug store to high luxury brands without success until now. I  was hesitant to purchase, because of the fragrance and mixed reviews. Iâ€™m very glad to have given this and their cleanser a chance. This cream is moisturizing through out the day and without any negative reaction what so ever like(watery eyes, swelling, itchiness). Very Supple, dewy without the shine and got compliments on my skin the day after. Highly recommend for those who have similar sensitivity as i do. Please Shishido, do not discontinue this cream! Holy grail for dry sensitive skin
