Iâ€™ve been eyeing this sunscreen for a while and was super excited to try a sample of it complimentary of Influenster!!This sunscreen comes out a runny, light beige liquid that is easy to apply and feels super lightweight and comfortable on skin. However, it does leave a chalky white tint on my Fenty 170 skintone so I will only be wearing this under foundation. I probably would not recommend this to people who do not wear makeup over sunscreen especially if you have a deeper skintone. nan
