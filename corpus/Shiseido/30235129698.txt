This is my new favorite Moisturizer! The fact that it is a sunscreen that contains hyaluronic acid is just icing on the cake. I received this product for free from influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have combo skin and my skin did not get oily one bit, nor did I have any negative reaction such as breakouts or rash. My makeup sat beautifully on top as well. I would ten out of ten recommend to all! Sunscreen plus hyaluronic acid!
