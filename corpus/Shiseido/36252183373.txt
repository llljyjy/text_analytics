After using it for a few weeks, it has exceeded my expectations. This light moisturizer has 20spf which is great for the spring/ early summer time. The hyaluronic Acid in the product gives a smooth feeling on the skin leaving ur face feeling refreshed. My skin seems brighter and moisturized, however, I do wish it has a stronger SPF for the hot sunny summer days. I would recommend this to my family and friends! A great spring/ early summer moisturizer!
