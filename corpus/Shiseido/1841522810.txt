I have super dry skin due to being on adapalene and I’m always looking for the most hydrating skincare items. The main stuff - it blends in easily, no white cast, feels hydrating. I’ve used it by itself and with my regular moisturizer and both times it remains very glowy and somewhat tacky, it doesn’t absorb into my skin very easily (*especially* with moisturizer underneath). My other sunscreen is Shiseido’s Ultimate Protector lotion and this feels way more hydrating than that one. It does look really nice under makeup which I appreciate. It is noticeably scented but not overpowering to me. I think that this is a nice sunscreen, but it probably won’t work for everyone. nan
