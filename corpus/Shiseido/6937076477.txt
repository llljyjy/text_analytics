I don’t write fake reviews and I’m going to tell you the truth. I’ve been reviewing products for more than 10 years. I’ve tried almost everything. The consistency and appearance of this is like semen. Now you can’t unsee that!  On two different occasions the concentrate broke my skin out. Just to make sure it wasn’t a purge, I made sure to use products that would heal my skin and clear it up. Sure enough, using the concentrate a week later it did the same thing. I don’t think this line from Shiseido is for my skin. It’s harsh making my skin look a bit leather like. The softness that I usually have is not there so I have to work on my skin with steaming, masks, sleeping packs and cleansing care products. You can see in my pic that I have white spots and freckles since childhood. The bumps are on my forehead between between my eyes, under my eyebrows and along my cheeks and above my lip was a result of this product. I do not see myself using this on my face any more. Breakouts were not from a purge!
