so far Iâ€™m really enjoying this product! I have extremely dry skin, especially in the winter and fall time and I have loved the hydration and plumpness this product has given my skin. I also really love that it includes SPF 20. I feel comfortable wearing this not only as is during the day but also under make up. The packaging has some serious weight to it and it feels like true luxury. Hydrating!
