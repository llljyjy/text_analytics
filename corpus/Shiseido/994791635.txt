I loved the texture of this moisturizer and that it has spf 20.  However, I have not noticed a difference in my skin.  If anything, by skin seems drier and not more moisturized even though it had HA in it.  My skin is normal to dry, and this just hasn’t done much for it.  The moisturizer has a light scent that isn’t too overwhelming.  I like that the product is refillable, but I wanted more from the performance. It’s just fine but not fantastic
