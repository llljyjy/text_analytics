I have heard and seen that Shiseido products never disappoint. And now that I’ve tried Shiseido Urban Environment Oil-Free Mineral Sunscreen Broad-Spectrum SPF 42 I can certify and claim that it doesn’t really disappoint. When I apply the cream to my face, I feel silky. The texture is excellent, creamy and super light. It doesn’t make my face look oily or greasy, and it doesn’t burn or burn my eyes like some sunscreens I used to wear.  I am very satisfied with this product. I will definitely buy this and other Shiseido brand products again. Amazing
