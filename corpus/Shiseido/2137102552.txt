My skin type: sensitive, dehydrated-normal skin.I received this part of an Influenster VoxBox during the peak of Midwest winter. The day cream didn’t hold up too well with the super dry climate - just not enough moisture for me, personally. BUT, the weather here as warmed up a bit, so I revisited this recently. And this worked much better for me! Light-weight, moisturizing without being sticky, and wears well under my current makeup routine. It does have a light sunscreen scent that fades quickly with wear. I still wear spf50+ ontop, so can’t really vouch for the sun protection in this cream. But overall, really nice day cream if you have normal to oily skin. Perhaps not the best for dry skin though… nan
