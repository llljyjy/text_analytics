Thank you @Influenster and @Shiseido  for sending this #Shiseidovoxbox for free in exchange for review! The Shiseido  Urban Environment Fresh Moisture with Hyaluronic Acid SPF 42 did great job protecting my skin for these long days out in the sun. I did like this one better than the Shiseido Urban Environment Oil Free Sunscreen because it didn’t leave a white cast on my med/tan skin and didn’t feel heavy like most sunscreens, even after reapplying a few times. This one also has more of a matte finish compared to the oil free sunscreen. Definitely  recommend ! Passed the test in this FL sun
