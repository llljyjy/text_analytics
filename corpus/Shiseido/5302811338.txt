I think it’s worth the money. A little goes a long way, it lathers well and it really does a good job getting the makeup off. It’s not the best with waterproof makeup however, but this is still my preferred face wash with a ton of makeup on. I wouldn’t recommend this for a daily wash without makeup however, it can be drying if you have combination or dry skin. But it lathers and cleans really well Great to remove a ton of makeup
