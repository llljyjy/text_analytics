I love how light weight this product is! I struggle with oily skin so the oil-free is great, and the older I get I try to be more mindful of the aging effects the sun has on my skin so this is my go to grab for sunscreen coverage without feeling left greasy like I do with other SPF skin care products, this one is quite the opposite it mattifies instead of leaving a shine from oil. I love that itâ€™s a mineral sunscreen so no harsh chemicals and it doubles as a face primer! My holy grail!
