I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. The first time I tried this I didn’t like it (I failed to shake it) it has a ball inside and must be shaken like nail polish; so it felt greasy and oily and provided a shiny finish. The next few times I did shake it and actually like it. It acts an SPF Protectant and a primer. It does give a somewhat shiny finish so if you’re not using a full coverage foundation or no foundation, the shine is apparent.   It left no white streak or thick spots. But all in all, makeup goes on great over it and it does provide sun protection so it’s a thumbs up from me. Fantastic SPF Protection
