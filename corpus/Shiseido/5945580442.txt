I love this cream! I use it every morning with my regular acne soap and routine. I have oily acne prone skin and haven’t had any break outs, my skin has been super soft! The smell isn’t too bad either and I like there is sun screen already in the moisturizer, just one last step in my morning skin care routine. Amazing
