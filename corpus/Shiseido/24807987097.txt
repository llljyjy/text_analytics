I’ll be honest, I am pretty picky when it comes to putting stuff on my face because I have very sensitive skin, so I’m always hesitant to try new items. Influenster and Shisedo sent me this day cream in exchange for my honest opinion. I love that it has a light scent, because I love to smell good but again my skin is sensitive so I’m always worried about scents. I’m happy to report that my skin had no reactions whatsoever to the light scent it had. It’s also very hydrating without feeling greasy. It goes in very smooth and dries pretty quickly so you aren’t feeling icky. I will most definitely purchase this again, it’s light and hydrating. Light and hydrating
