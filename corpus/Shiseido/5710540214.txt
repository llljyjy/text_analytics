Bought this specifically for reapplication of sunscreen throughout the day. i saw some reviews saying this was good for reapplication over makeup, which the product also says it’s for. But whenever I tried to put it over makeup, be it full glam or even light tinted moisturizer/skin tint days, it removed everywhere i swiped. i even tried warming up the top on my hand before applying to my face to try to get it to slide over more easily. i dont even use heavy pressure. This just doesn’t work for me to reapply over makeup. Without makeup, this thing is still greasy, like I have a layer of oil over my face, and for some reason my skin texture looks worse after applying this. I did have high hopes for this and I do love the smell and concept but it just simply didn’t work for me. Didn't work for me
