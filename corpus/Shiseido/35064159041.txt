I have been using this product for the last 4 days and I’m so impressed. I love everything about it, its the perfect daily facial sunscreen and it also hydrates my skin at the same time. I was a little skeptical at first because it was really watery and pale colored but it doesn’t leave a white hue and it makes my skin so soft. This is my new favorite product! My new favorite Sunscreen!
