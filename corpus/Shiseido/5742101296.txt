The scent reminds me of a Kamikaze shot! It’s not a strong scent and dissipates quickly. The serum is fast absorbing and leaves skin soft and radiant. A slight tackiness that doesn’t interfere with makeup application. I use twice a day. In the morning I follow with primer and foundation. It doesn’t cause any piling. Look forward to using and seeing the results I get. nan
