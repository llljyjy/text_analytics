I give this about a 4.7. I LOVE how it feels so light and silky when applied. It does not have a strong scent and does not make my skin oily. The only thing that is an issue for me is that it didnâ€™t necessarily make my skin more hydrated even after applying daily. I am on some medications that dry my skin out so that may be why. Regardless, I would buy this again because it feels so nice and refreshing on my skin! Would buy again
