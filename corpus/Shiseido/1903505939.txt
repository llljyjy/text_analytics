My hubby hates sunscreen because of the way it feels. He tolerates this and for how pale he is, he hasn’t burned yet. And lately it’s been 90-102 here. Because it’s a mineral based, I’ve also used it on my baby’s face instead of the roll on one we have. A+ for protection and feel. Also, bonus points for having no scent. Hubby approved
