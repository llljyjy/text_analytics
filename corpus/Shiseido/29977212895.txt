I received the Shiaeido VoxBox and I was super excited to try it out! This has SPF 20 which helps to protect your skin from sun damage. It does smell a little like sun screen. The day cream gives the perfect hydration and moisture for your skin. This time of year my skin is on the dry side and this gives me the hydration my skin needs. I am looking forward to how my skin changes with continued use. Hydration
