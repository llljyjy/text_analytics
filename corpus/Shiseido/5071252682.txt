I mostly enjoyed this lightweight moisturizer although I did find myself needed a serum or two to make up the additional hydration I was getting from my previous product. And i wish it included sunscreen. This might be the product for you if you already have a sunscreen you love and you only need a little bit more hydration.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. nan
