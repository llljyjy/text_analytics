*I have received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.*It was a nice sunscreen to use very lightweight and thin to apply to the skin. Easily applied to my skin but it does leave a bit of a white cast on the face which you need to try and remove it as much as you can. But it gets the job done and didnâ€™t leave me sunburn. Decent!
