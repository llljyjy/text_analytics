I liked that the formula is watery and it has a slight tint so it unifies my skin tone, it can be used under makeup and as it has SPF 42 +  hyaluronic acid it’s supposed to protect against UVA/UVB rays and pollution while boosting hydration. It also feels nice and light on the skin and it’s water resistant. I just wish the SPF was higher. Also, by my experience, I recommend to be generous when applying otherwise it comes off the skin when rubbing. Nice and light feel
