Iâ€™ve been trying out this Award Winning serum that I received complimentary from @influenster & @shiseido. Ultimune is good for all skin types, especially my dry skin. The serum claims to strengthen skin against daily damage and visibly reduce signs of aging. Ultimune has a gel texture which goes on the skin smoothly. There is a scent to product. This product(50ml) retails for $110 in Sephora. This serum has been added to my skincare routine. It keeps my skin hydrated and looking plump. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for a more expensive skincare product. nan
