I received this complimentary from Influenster and Shiseido for my honest review. I actually am pregnant and my midwife suggested I don’t put this on my skin especially during the 1st trimester so that tells me something about the ingredients/chemicals in this product… I wasn’t able to use it so I can’t tell you much else except I won’t be trying/buying it even after I give birth. nan
