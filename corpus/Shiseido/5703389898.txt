Thicker consistency in the jar, but goes on smooth, lays flat, great under makeup. The SPF is such a plus. No strange smell or oddly super shiny skin after applying (which tends to happen with SPF products). Packaging is sturdy - well made, it’s taken some tumbles off my counter just fine. Lasts all day. I live at high altitude, closer to the sun + dry = I usually get a sunburn - even on my short commute to work. Shiseido solved that problem for me. Don’t let the thicker consistency throw you off - give it a try. as always Shiseido is worth every penny.
