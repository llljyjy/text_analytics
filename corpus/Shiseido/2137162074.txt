I give this eye cream an A+ for hydration, smoothing, curing itchiness and dryness around the eye. I would not rate it as high for reducing fine lines or reducing under eye darkness. The formula is so rich, hydrating and thick that you only need a rice grain sized amount for the whole eye area. The price isn’t too bad considering how many months you can stretch this to last. The packaging is very luxurious, heavy and high quality. I found that it reduces under eye fine lines a little bit, but if you skip using it for a few days they will come back. I do believe that this cream helped with the prevention of additional fine lines This is a good night cream but it is so thick I’m not sure if I’d recommend wearing this underneath make up  during the day. It seems to sit on top of the skin. I noticed an overall improvement in texture after a few months of using this product. Good For Improving Texture
