I received the Shiseido Ginza Tokyo Urban Environment Oil-Free MineralSunscreen SPF 42 from Influenster to review. I was very keen on receiving this product as I really like mineral sunscreen for my sensitiveskin and this product is also free of oxybenzone and octinoxate. I agree that Shiseido Urban EnvironmentMineralSunscreen does everything it claims initâ€™smarketing description.Shiseido Urban ENvironmentMineralSunscreen is infused with hyaluronic acid to deliver and retainmoisture andleft my skin feeling hydrated and not dried out. Thelotion was fast-absorbing and dried completely on my face within 5 minutes. Protecting my skin against the sun andmy urban air pollution is important to me and I really feel like Shiseido Urban ENvironmentMineralSunscreen will get the job done. Shiseido Urban ENvironmentMineralSunscreen controlled my oily T zone areas and left my skin with a matte finish and I was excited that Shiseido can be used as a primer as well. I really like this product and would definitely think of getting it myself and recommending it to others. Remember to reapply after 2 hours or40 minutes after swimming and sweating. Great Skin Protectant!
