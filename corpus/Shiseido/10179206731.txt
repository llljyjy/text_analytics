I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. This is my go to hydrating cream! I put this on every night before bed and on days where my skin is feeling a little extra dry. It contains hyaluronic acid and ginseng root extract, which gives my skin 24 hour moisture as well as strengthening my skins barrier. A little goes a long way and it is so fast absorbing, you won’t have to worry about it just sitting on top of your skin. Plus it is sensitive skin friendly so it doesn’t burn or irritate the skin when it’s applied. My only complaint is that the jar it comes in is a little bulky and hard to situate in my cabinet. (Pro tip: pop it in your fridge for 10 minutes before applying for an extra soothing application) Love it
