I was so happy to receive this for free from Influenster to review. The bottle is so pretty and the product is awesome. For weeks I have been able to stick to my skin care routine ever since I received this product. I put this on my skin first before the rest of my products and it makes so much difference. I feel like it makes my other products work better so I call it my essence. It feels so good on my skin and makes my skin feel soft when applying the product. It absorbs quickly into my skin. It’s non greasy. I will be purchasing this product. It’s costly but worth it. Skin so soft.
