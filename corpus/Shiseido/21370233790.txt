Your skin drinks up that sunscreen like a 30-year old water after a rough party night. It absorbs with no white cast and creates a shiny glass skin surface. Shiseido fresh moisture sunscreen acts feels like a luxury skincare serum, rather than just a simple spf. Itâ€™s easily absorbed and I had no problems layering some illuminating primer and a foundation on top. It is also easy to renew throughout the day. Just make sure you like the scent before purchasing - some may find t too strong. Glass skin in a bottle!
