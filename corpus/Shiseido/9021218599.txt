This product is easy to apply under moisturizer and makeup. It has a slick texture that is easily absorbed into the skin. It has a gentle, but pleasant, scent. I am not sure how effective this is for skin health, but it is so easy to use that it doesnâ€™t feel like it is adding a huge step into my skincare routine. Easy to Use
