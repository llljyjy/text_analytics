I loved the first set of creams that I was sent bc it had spf added. This new cream is just the same ultra hydrating formula without the spf. I love it! It glides onto skin like a dream and slowly melts into skin. usually that be a bother but if you’re like me and using this as an additional layer in your night routine, then that’s great! it sits on skin and doesn’t dry down. my skin is softer and very hydrated after I wake up in the morning. nan
