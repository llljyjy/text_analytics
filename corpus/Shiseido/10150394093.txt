I tried a lot of creams, and a big issue for me is to find a good cream which will lay perfectly without feeling heavy under my make up. I was shocked how fast it absorbed, it feels so lightweight, though my skin is plump and moisturized. I can definitely see the hyaluronic acid work here. It has a light fragrance, but it’s not irritating in any way. It doesn’t feel sticky or heavy. The skin gets a nice natural dew. Another great perk is that the package is not only luxurious, but also environmentally friendly as the cream is refillable. It comes with a small spatula to help to prevent the contamination. I definitely recommend this cream. lightweight
