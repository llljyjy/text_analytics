I’m currently pregnant so I’m not able to use this product right now because eim being extra cautious. BUT I gave this to my fiancé who enjoys skincare, to test for me! We live in SoCal where it’s very sunny so the extra SPF protection is perfect. He said that he enjoys the consistency as well. Personally I like the packaging a lot (it comes with a tool to apply it) and his skin looks glowy so I’d say it’s nice! I plan to use this after giving birth this summer! nan
