As an Esthetician, I am always excited to try out new products for myself and to recommend to my clients. Shiseido did not disappoint with this light-weight sunscreen. Great for my combination skin, this product kept me hydrated and moist throughout the day. If you are a stickler with SPF, I was able to re-apply with no issues. As a Fitzpatrick 5, I often worry about SPF’s leaving a white/grayish cast on the face and I haven’t had that issue when using this. The eyes may get a bit irritated but all in all, this is a great sun protection product to use! Light and Hydrating
