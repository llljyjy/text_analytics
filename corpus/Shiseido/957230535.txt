A big thank you to Shiseido and Influenster for giving me the opportunity to test out Shiseido’s Urban Environment Oil-free Mineral Sunscreen SPF 42. Sunscreen is important!When used on bare skin, this sunscreen did not go on as smoothly as it did over primer or prepped skin, and it looked quite lavender until it dried down. I have a light skin tone, so the lavender tint showed me where I had applied the sunscreen, then after it quickly dried it matched my face as long as I didn’t use too much. I preferred using this sunscreen on top of hydrating skincare or a primer, even though it *itself* is formulated to be a primer. It spread more evenly and easily on top of prepped skin. Applying foundation on top covered the slight leftover tint from the minerals in the sunscreen.While it is supposed to control oil and mattify skin, I don’t think it did either for my skin. I always looked dewy when I wore it alone, if not greasy, right off the bat and especially after several hours of wear. It didn’t feel oil-free to me. The shininess especially magnified my larger than usual pores, and I don’t need help to illuminate that skin texture. Applying foundation on top did help with the immediate shininess, but this sunscreen does not fill in your pores so your texture will still show.It is as lightweight as advertised, both in application and in wear. I definitely feel like it has helped protect my skin from sun exposure, as well as protection from darkening existing spots and creating new ones.Most people don’t apply enough sunscreen. I can see this sunscreen not working for darker skin tones, especially if lots of sunscreen is applied and no foundation or tint is applied on top. If most people aren’t applying enough sunscreen, and the ocean is diluting their sunscreen when they swim, reef safe/ocean safe sunscreen is a step in the right direction but not the one thing that will save our coral reefs. I do appreciate Shiseido trying to help our environment. I wish I liked it more
