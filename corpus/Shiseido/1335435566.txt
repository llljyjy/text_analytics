This sunscreen has a nice gel cream texture that sinks into the skin nicely. I think it leaves behind a slight glow but overall dries down to a pretty natural finish. I’d really enjoy this if it wasn’t for the fragrance. I find it very strong and it lingers for hours after application. It’s very floral smelling to me which I don’t love. Such a shame because it is a nice hydrating sunscreen that’s not greasy. Beware of fragrance
