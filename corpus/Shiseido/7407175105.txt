I love this sunscreen! It comes out looking beige and watery, which scared me up first. However when I put it on my face it only took about five drops for my face and neck and it went on completely clear with no white cast. I really wanted to test out its primer capabilities so I put it underneath the morphe 2 skin tint and concealer and it looked perfect. The sunscreen primer really made my skin look dewy. New Fav!!
