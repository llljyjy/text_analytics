I have very dry sensitive skin and didn’t love this product. It didn’t feel super moisturizing or make my skin feel improved with application. I did really like the inclusion of the spatula for easy application. I like that the product has spf but it isn’t moisturizing enough for me to switch from my usual products. Nothing Special
