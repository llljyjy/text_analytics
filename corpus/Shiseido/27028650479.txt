I’m going to be honest I was super excited when I got this because I love shiseido. The lip sticks are my go to every day. I tried this serum out for weeks because I wanted to really test it to see what it does. I am very prone to dry skin on my eyes and face so I thought this would be great. It says that you will see a difference in three days but I feel like I never saw a difference and I’m still not sure what this is supposed to do for my skin. When I put it on it does feel instantly Dewey and has a slight nice smell, but a lot of people are smell sensitive. The packaging is cute but not worth it overall imo Really wanted to love this product, does hydrate
