I did really want to like this serum, it made my skin look and feel amazing. Did have a very fragranced smell to it, didn’t bother my skin, packaging was very cute and appealing. After studying and researching a little more on the ingredients that are used in their products, I found that they use pretty high concentrations of denatured alcohol in a lot of their products. I wasn’t so happy about that since this type of alcohol masks the signs of aging, doesn’t correct it. Long term use of products that contain high concentrations of denatured alcohol end up doing more damage than good for your skin, ie more dryness and can cause more irritations. Just be cautious!
