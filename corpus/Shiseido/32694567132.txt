I was really hesitant to try this because I haven’t had a ton of luck with mineral sunscreens working well, but I was pleasantly surprised that this one has worked out well! After getting a sample to try I went and bought more because I liked it so much! It goes on smooth, with almost a matte texture. It doesn’t clog your pores or feel greasy when you put it one, I can put it on my face or whole body. I have used it swimming and just every day use and it lasts as long as any other sunscreens I’ve liked, with typical need to reapply after swimming or sweating or so many hours. Overall I will continue to use! New favorite sunscreen
