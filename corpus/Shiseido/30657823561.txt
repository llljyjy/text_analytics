I love love love this day cream. I apply it to my face in the mornings after my shower. The cream is so smooth and just feels luxurious when applying it to your skin. The winter season is upon us right now and my face doesn’t feel dried out or itchy from the dry heat of being indoors. I don’t particularly like the smell of the sunscreen, but I guess it’s expected with a SPF product. The jar itself has some heftiness to it, which is nice in my opinion, but the lid does like to “roll“ around because it’s curved. My mom also tried the cream and said it was one of her favorites. I would recommend it to others. I received this product from Influenster and Shiseido complimentary for my review. Luxury in a Jar
