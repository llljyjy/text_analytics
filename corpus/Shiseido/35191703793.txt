I’ve been one to struggle with my facial skin. Acne and super dry. I’m now battling laugh lines and bags.  This mama is tired and it was reflecting. Well not so much any more, since adding ultimune to my skin care routine I’m finding I’m a little less tired looking and more fresh, especially around my eyes. No break outs or reactions! My husband has even notice a difference, and that in its self says something. The price makes me a little skittish but now I’m seeing results, this is permanently added to my daily skin care routine.
