I am tempted to fully replace my higher end brands for this! Try this before you purchase similar serums of other brands... You know! I still love their products however, this performs better on my skin & I get faster results. My skin has improved significantly! Less texture, more hydration & smoothness. I love the way this plumps my skin. This serum is very lightweight, fast absorbing and does have a slight fresh floral scent. This does not irritate my skin, hasnâ€™t caused any breakouts nor makes me feel oily. I hope Shiseido discusses the fragrance in this and reformulates for those who have highly sensitive skin or those who are worried about fragrance. This should have more hype!
