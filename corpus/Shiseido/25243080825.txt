I usually love minerals sunscreen and wear one every day!!! I received this product as a free sample and my honest opinion is that there are definitely better mineral sunscreens. This leaves a thick white obercast on your skin which is greasy. It’s watery when applying then turns greasy. It doesn’t last and will come off easily if yous sweat. I suggest trying superfood! I am not impressed with this product, although I love the line. Not worth the money,try a better mineral sunscreen
