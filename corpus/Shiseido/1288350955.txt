I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I legit enjoy this serum and it definitely has improved my skin after constantly using it 2x per day for about a month, BUT it’s wildly expensive and isn’t outstanding enough to be worth that investment. I enjoy the smell, texture, and results. You can definitely get just as good a product for a quarter of the cost of this one, though. Don’t be fooled that high cost always equals unmatched. Any decent serum, if used consistently, will help to make you more radiant and youthful. But absolutely, if you catch a sale for this item, grab it. Great product, but not worth the expense
