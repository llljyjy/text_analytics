I was pleasantly surprised by this. I really expected it to be a gel like texture but it isnt- it is more of a light traditional moisturizer. I have very dry skin and I use it as a last step after hydrating serums and it plays well with other products. I also like that you can buy refills for this so you waste less packaging. It does shltsrt with fragrance but after a few weeks it no longer has any scent. I would recommend it. Pricey but a solid moisturizer
