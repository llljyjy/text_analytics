I really love this hydrating cream for my dry skin. A little goes a long way. I wake up in the morning and my skin feels hydrated and plump. This rich formula does break me out. Iâ€™m thankful for the opportunity to try this through influenster because the price would have been something I would have hesitated to buy but now using this, I would consider paying for it myself because of how good it works on my dry skin. Super rich and hydrating
