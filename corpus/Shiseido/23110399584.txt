I received this product in exchange for an honest review from Influenster, it does not effect my review at all. So far I’ve used this day cre for roughly 2 weeks and I don’t hate it. It’s lightweight so it doesn’t make me break out. It has a slight smell but nothing too fragrant that it will irritate the skin. I definitely plan on using this product till it’s empty and burning a new one. NOT BAD MY FRIENDS
