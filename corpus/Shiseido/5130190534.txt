I received this product for free from Shiseido and Influenster in exchange for my opinion.  I’ve really enjoyed using this product. Ive been using it almost every day for about a month and I feel my skin is noticeably more youthful in texture. I like the faint scent and it’s really delightful to apply to the skin. I would definitely recommend this serum as an addition to an anti-aging skincare routine. It is pricey but it is also quality. A skin refresh!
