This cream is amazing! I have dry skin and I live in the Chicago area which has the craziest weather and wind, so my face definitely gets exposed to the elements. This was like a drink for my face! I donâ€™t even have to use primer anymore for my makeup after using this!  I have sensitive skin as well and this did not make me break out or feel itchy. Scent is very light, clea. Packaging is pretty. Definitely would purchase! nan
