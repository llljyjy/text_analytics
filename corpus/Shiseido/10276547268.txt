I think the Shishido essential energy hydrating day cream with SPF 20 is great. I like that it acts as a barrier protect your skin from pollution. When I applied the cream it melted into my skin nicely and initially had the scent of SPF but it wasn’t overpowering at all. My skin feels soft and moisturized after use. I love the elegant packaging but it looks like you should be able to disassemble the top to put the little plastic spatula in. I just shoved the spatula right into the product, I’m not sure if that was what I was supposed to do. I received this product complimentary in exchange for an honest review. nan
