I received this free to review. I really liked this product. It was thick enough that my dry skin felt moisturized but it wasnâ€™t so heavy that my skin felt oily. It also made my skin look and feel healthy and energized. My one complaint is that it really smells like sunscreen. I think a different fragrance would be more pleasing. Energizing
