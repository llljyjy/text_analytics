The Shiseido Urban Environment Fresh-Moisture Sunscreen also has SPF 42. I absolutely loved how this applied. Yes, it is white coming out, but it absorbs clear. It also left my skin feeling oh so soft. It looked hydrated and healthy. I was also able to wear this under makeup with no issues whatsoever!! Everything went on smooth. It did not look cakey. It was not sticky, or tacky. Plus, there was no pilling. It is also super easy to use, and the container is small enough to carry in a purse, diaper bag, crossbody bag, beach bag, etc.HOW TO USE Apply daily, as the last step in your morning skincare routine—before makeup application.Smooth evenly and generously over face and neck, at least 15 minutes before sun exposure.Wear alone or under makeup.KEY INGREDIENTS •HYALURONIC ACID•PEARL LIGHT POWDER•Lightweight SPF 42 cream•Protects against UVA/UVB rays •Deeply moisturizes•Dewy, radiant finish•12 hours of lasting hydration•Water-resistant 40 for minutes•Free of oxybenzone & octinoxate •Ocean-friendly •Hawaii-compliant •Paraben-free•Non-comodegenic•Dermatologist-tested •Ophthalmologist-tested Works well Under Makeup
