I love Shiseido! Love them! And I had exceedingly high hopes for their Urban Environment Mineral Sunscreen… but I was unfortunately left a bit underwhelmed after using this product. Let’s talk pros for a minute. Love that the spf is a 42, most of my facial sunscreens top out at 30spf. Love the addition of hyaluronic acid to help with moisture retention. I don’t mind that it is liquid (remember to shake well before applying). The cons? Ok… it has a definite white cast which I think is exacerbated by the addition of a pinkish, pearlescent/opalescent and luminous finish. Being more warm/olive complected myself, this product completely changed the tone of my skin. Perhaps if they had a version with more golden than pink luminous undertones this could work for anyone who isn’t alabaster skinned. I also don’t love that it is oil-free but that’s only because I have dry aging skin and live in a very dry climate. I can see the oil-free component being helpful for many people, just not me personally. I will say it’s nice to know that all of Shiseido’s sunscreens are certified ocean safe and that’s a positive worth noting. Would I buy this again? Not without a reformulation. I really wanted to love this product but it was far from my holy grail sunscreen. Good but not the best
