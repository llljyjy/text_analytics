I was super excited to try this shiseido product but it ended up being just all right to me. The initial application had a strong white cast that took a while to rub in. The liquid is tan and smells not great. The feel is greasier than I prefer. 3 stars because I used it and didnâ€™t get burnt. But the greasy factor and white cast that was hard to absorb on my skin was a negative for me. Just ok
