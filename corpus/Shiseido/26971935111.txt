Today I’m reviewing the Shiseido sun dual care . So it’s everything we could hope for a sunscreen and even more  I love it ,it’s absolutely non sticky and non greasy and it smells like heaven ( floral … jasmine maybe ) it also will leave your skin hydrated and bonus it contains hyaluronic acid which helps with skin aging . Shiseido never disappoints #shiseidosuncare #complimentary @shiseido @Influenster nan
