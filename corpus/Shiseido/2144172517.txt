I bought this during a sale because so many raved about it.  I liked that it has anti wrinkle benefits and spf all in one.  It’s not a bad cream at all, my only issue with it is that it leaves my face super shiny and the shine doesn’t go away.  So for the price, I’d say pass and I’ll stick with a decent moisturizer along with Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen which I think is the absolute best ever. Pass overall
