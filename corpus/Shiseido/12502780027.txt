I have super sensitive skin, so I was skeptical. But this has not bothered my skin at all. I’m not sure if I’ve noticed a huge difference but I feel like my redness from my rosacea isn’t as red/bright in my face! It does have a fairly strong fragrance, which I don’t love for my sensitive skin but it doesn’t seem to irritate me nan
