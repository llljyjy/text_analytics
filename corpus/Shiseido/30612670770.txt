I love the idea of an oil-free liquid mineral sunscreen. My combo skin gets too oily/shiny with traditional, thick, creamy sunscreens so this liquid format seems perfect. The tint is super fair, and although I’m fair skin and freckled I wish this came in more colors. This made me look a little too pale. I do love the semi-matte finish, especially in more normally slightly oily t-zone. It also pills if you rub this in. I had a far better experience tapping this into my skin like a serum instead of rubbing it in like a lotion. Not really sure if I saw any benefit from the hyaluronic acid. Not a deal breaker, though. Only significant downside for me is the low spf. I use 70 spf minimum on my face because I’m so prone to burning. I would love to see Shiseido come out with a higher spf in this formula. Will definitely purchase that. #shiseidosuncare #voxbox Wish it came in more tints
