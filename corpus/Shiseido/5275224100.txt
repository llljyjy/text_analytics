I’m always on the hunt for a good facial sunscreen. I was so excited to see this had a high SPF, hyaluronic acid, and is designed to protect against the pollution in my urban environment. I’m a city girl on the go and I need something to provide a barrier between UV rays and the hinky biz in the air. This formula is thin, easy to apply, and dries matte. This can be kind of a bummer if you have dry/combo skin but works well for people who lean oily. The formula didn’t aggravate my sensitive skin and left it feeling hydrated at the end of the day. I would absolutely repurchase this! For the city goirlz
