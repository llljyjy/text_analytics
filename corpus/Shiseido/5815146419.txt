This product is phenomenal. I’ve been putting it on in the morning and at night, after cleansing but before my moisturizer. Sometimes I’ll use my face roller with it. Or even mix it in with my foundation. It feels lightweight but it has made such a different in the softness of my skin! It is on the pricier side but it is so important to invest in your skin!My skin feels rejuvenated, supple and hydrated. it’s only been a couple if weeks but I am really enjoying it. Shiseido is a fabulous brand, especially when it comes to their skincare. I’ve never not liked one of their products. Luxurious product that really works!
