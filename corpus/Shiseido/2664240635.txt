I’m a firm believer that you have to give skincare 2 months to give it a real review. It’s not a bad moisturizer, it isn’t heavy, the scent isn’t overwhelming and it protects with SPF. However, I didn’t notice any changes. My skin felt dry in this Midwest winter when I used this cream. I had to use a second moisturizer to feel hydrated. I don’t see any changes in my fine lines, but it’s to soon to tell. Will I purchase this …? No. Not Bad
