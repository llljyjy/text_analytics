Pros: - sunscreen plus hyaluronic acid - ocean friendly - thin formula spreads and applies great- little to no fragrance- works well layered under makeupCons:- have to blend for a while to not have a white cast- is it worth the price tag?? ($35)- after dried it has more of a matte finish which makes my skin feel more dry - clings to dry patches Overall, I think this is a good product but I think if I were going make a sunscreen purchase I would go with the Shiseido Clear Sunscreen Stick. It applies clear, itâ€™s more inclusive for all skin types, and more user friendly application. Good not perfect
