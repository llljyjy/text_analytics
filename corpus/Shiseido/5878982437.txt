The Shiseido Urban Environment Fresh-Moisture sunscreen was nice and not sticky unlike others I’ve tried. In addition to my face, I actually used it on the tops of my shoulders when I was wearing an off-shoulder top on a particularly sunny day, and my shoulders didn’t burn at all - not even a hint of red! That’s usually a spot that really burns quickly for me. Also, it has a nice subtle scent, not overwhelmingly sunscreen scented, which I appreciated as it didn’t take away from the perfume I used that day. Definitely recommend this, whether you use it on your face or on other areas of your body that will be exposed to sunlight. Versatile, and Nice Scent!
