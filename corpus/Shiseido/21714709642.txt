I have heard a lot of noise about the sunscreen stick online, so I wanted to try out their liquid sunscreens as I expected an extremely well known expensive Japanese brand to have gold standard formulas.As soon as this dripped out of the packet I could smell a strong unusual smell that does not seem to resemble either a nice clean cosmetic smell or a typical sunscreen smell. It is a goopy beige slightly oily feeling liquid before applying so I was expecting this to be ultra dewy or shiny and hydrating.But this sunscreen is completely unsuitable cosmetically for anyone with a hint of color in their skin, and then the formula itself feels terrible. Not only did this feel thick spreading around the face, neck and arms, even a tiny dot left an ugly greyish white cast, and actually pilled a bit on my face as I tried spreading out the thick white paste (no skin or makeup products I normally use pill). This also ended up feeling drying on my skin after I gave up trying to see if the white cast reduced after a minute of mixing and spreading.Honestly this is horrific to look at on the skin as the white grey color never went away after the whole day, even my partner said it smelt bad when I stood next to him an hour later after applying. When I used my most effective cleanser I usually leave for days I wear makeup, the drops of water ran white off of my skin onto my counter and left white droplets I had to clean off as well.This is genuinely the worst sunscreen formula I have used - including cheap pharmacy kid’s sunscreen I picked up to blow through when I was on skin steroids and antibiotics that had a heavy white cast but it did fade and feel nicer than this overpriced crime to the skin.I tried the other Ultimate sunscreen by this brand in case I my skin just was not designed for a sunscreen without oil or just incompatible with my skin type. But that came with a whole different set of issues that made it almost equally as bad as this. Won’t touch this brand again! Worst sunscreen I have ever tried
