I wanted to like this SOOO much. But it left a white cast on my skin. It felt a bit greasy. It didn’t play well under my makeup even after letting it soak in for 10 minutes. I mean it isn’t horrible: I like it has skincare benefits and it’s from Shiseido. It just won’t be the sunscreen I reach for everyday. I do like it’s reef-safe and it didn’t sting my eyes! It’s not bad, but it’s not fantastic either. I wanted to like it more than I did.
