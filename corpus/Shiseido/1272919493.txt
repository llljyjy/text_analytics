I want to just start by saying that this is not great for oily skin. It definitely caused me to look more greasy than I do with my usual products. I love the original urban defense sunscreen, as well as the new sunscreen plus HA & I would suggest either of those if you’re oily. This is probably great for fry or normal skin. One nice thing is it left no white cast at all! But aside from that, it didn’t work great under my makeup- my foundation slid all over. Again, this is probably due to me being oily. Sun protection aspect is great. I will use this on days when I’ll be in the sun & am not wearing makeup. You don’t need a separate moisturizer with this so that’s convenient. I did receive this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion. Not good for oily skin.
