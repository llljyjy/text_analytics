Sent over FREE from Influenster for review purposes, I put the Shisheido Urban Environment Oil-Free Sunscreen SPF 42 to the ultimate test. I rolled with the convertible top down in this Southern sun & humidity! The sunscreen gave me the confidence of knowing my skin was protected. Even with my deep melanin, I protect my skin from the sun’s harmful rays! No breakouts. My skin felt matte. The fact that it contains hyaluronic acid and spirulina energy essence that benefits our skin, I am impressed.The one drawback is the price! A $35 price tag for 1 oz. But to compare it to face primers, I suppose the price can be justified as it’s pulling double duty. Overall, the product is a winner. It did not leave a white cast on my skin.
