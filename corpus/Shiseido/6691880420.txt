I picked up the smallest size of this stuff to sample it because I’ve heard and read good things about it. Overall, I really like it. It’s a good day moisturizer. It settles into the skin quickly and doesn’t feel heavy or greasy. It would probably work well as a pre-makeup moisturizer (though I haven’t vetted that yet). My only gripe is that it’s highly fragranced. I actually quite love the smell of it, it’s just SO strong. I wish they made a reduced fragrance or no fragrance version of this, then it would be 5/5. nice moisturizer
