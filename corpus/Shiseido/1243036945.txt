This sunscreen really surprised me in a good way. I have had horrible luck with sunscreens breaking me out or leaving a white cast. This one is light and goes on wonderfully. Not oily and didn’t break me out! I am also a fan of elta md and this one is similar. Much better than others i’ve tried! I wear sunscreen daily and will switch to this when my elta runs out. nan
