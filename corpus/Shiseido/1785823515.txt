This is an excellent moisturizer for normal skin. My normal parts of my skin deal with this well! But it’s not enough for dry skin honestly. It doesn’t moisturize enough. One huge benefit is that it doesn’t smell strongly of SPF but does have a little protection in it! Solid all around moisturizer for normal skin
