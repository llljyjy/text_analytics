I’m horrible at writing reviews but felt the need to with these. In both pictures it literally says nothing about being a makeup remover, so it’s confusing to read some of these reviews lol The short description of this product specifically states they’re “refreshing cleansing sheets.” And that’s exactly what I use them for and love them! I use one every morning when I wake up to freshen up my face before applying anything else. Every other wipe out there are pretty much for makeup removing and I don’t need something that strong in the morning. These are perfect for what they are described to be: “refreshing cleansing sheets.” nan
