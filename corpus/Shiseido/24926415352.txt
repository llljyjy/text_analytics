this is absolutely my new favorite sunscreen. it is somehow an improvement to already wonderful sunscreens like Missha & Roche-Posayâ€™s fluid sunscreens. It has the same fluid consistency and perfect satin finish as these brands but is even more light making it the perfect primer. It spreads so easily, leaves my skin super smooth and soft without feeling weighed down. Love its ingredients and that it is water resistant and reef safe My perfect sunscreen
