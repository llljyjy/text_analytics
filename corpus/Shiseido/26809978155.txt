I absolutely love the formula of this moisturizer! It’s light, my skin is mixed, and my cheeks tend to get very dry, using this in a daily basis has been a game changer, and I love that has spf which is the bonus layer added to my routine. Best thing: doesn’t make you feel and be oily Perfect formula with spf
