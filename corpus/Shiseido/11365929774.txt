This sunscreen is amazing. I like it because there is no white cast, it doesnâ€™t break me out, and leaves my skin feeling really moisturized and dewy. This is a more fluid sunscreen, and if you are worried about it being oily... I personally do not find it to be greasy at all. I love the way it sits under makeup too. Overall 10/10. POC friendly, glowy finish, love it!!
