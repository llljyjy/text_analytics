I have been wearing this sunblock for the past two weeks & I personally love it. It was gifted to me in exchange for my honest review. While I personally adore this sunscreen, there are a few things to keep in mind while shopping; a.) I have oily/combo skin & loved the natural matte finish. On me, it was pore blurring & made my skin look truly lovely, however, I don’t know if someone with dry skin would love this finish or feel it was too drying. B.) I am light skinned & while this mineral sunscreen has a tint, it’s best suited for those with fair to light/medium skin. My medium/tan partner (middle eastern) was unable to wear it, as it left a noticeable white cast. With those two things in mind, I say go for it! It’s a wonderful sunscreen that’s cosmetically elegant, long wearing & works well under makeup. Shiseido Does it Again!
