I found it to be a nice texture but it was a little greasy once on the face. I did like the packaging with the little spatula and I did feel that it was moisturizing, but if it was at all humid or warm, it made my face very greasy, which I felt outweighed any benefits. It did leave my skin soft and moisturized but other than that I did not see any particular benefits. nan
