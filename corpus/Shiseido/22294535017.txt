I was so excited to have been selected to try this sunscreen, but unfortunately did not love it.I am the type of person to wear sunscreen any time I go outside, so I really like having a reliable sunscreen that is lightweight and doesn’t break me out.I found this particular sunscreen to be very lightweight and it did melt into my skin very easily and it absolutely did feel moisturizing. It did not leave a white cast after applying.Unfortunately, that was the only thing I really liked about this product. I found the scent to be really off-putting. At first I thought it smelled really floral; almost like a perfume. It wasn’t a smell that dissipated throughout the day and I felt that it was stronger than I would have liked, especially for it being on my face.I always apply sunscreen after moisturizer and under makeup, and I found that with this sunscreen my face was really shiny and almost oily-looking all day, which I wasn’t a huge fan of.The thing that I disliked the most about this, was how much it broke me out (which was a lot). I don’t think that I have particularly sensitive skin, so I was really surprised how much this broke me out.Overall, I have to say that I would not recommend this product nan
