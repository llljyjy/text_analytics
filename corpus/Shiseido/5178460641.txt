I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest opinion. The consistency of the product itself was like a thinner gel. Slightly runny and not very thick. It was an opaque white/clear color. And it smelled slightly floral and a bit perfumey, so there was definitely a fragrance to it. It had a nice slip to the skin and moved around the face nice. I used about 2-3 pumps of serum for my entire face daily. day and night in my routine. It did feel nice and very moisturizing on my skin, but it was a little tacky compared to my other serum. I felt that it took a bit longer to set into my skin than other serums I have used. It wasnâ€™t necessarily overly greasy or oily but it just took a while to sink into my skin, in my opinion. I also had to play around with my a moisturizer to pair with this. I would definitely recommend trying a sample size before you commit to see if this works well with your skin type!
