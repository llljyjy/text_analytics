I bought this before going to Hawaii in October. Everything about this product is gold. First off, I have very sensitive eyes, and this sunscreen did not burn them at all. The texture is silky smooth and feels more like a skin treatment than sunscreen. Most important of all, yes, it did protect my face for 11 days in Hawaii. Now I use it daily living at an elevation in the mountains. From Sea to Mountains this is your protection!
