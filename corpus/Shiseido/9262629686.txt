Lightweight moisturizer with hyaluronic acid. Pretty basic, as you would have guessed from its name: ’essential’. Didn’t irritate my sensitive skin so that’s always a plus. No crazy scent to it, I appreciate the little things. Comes with a VERY cheap looking/feeling spatula in case you don’t wanna dip your fingers into jar, possibly conteminating cream. It’s really overpriced for how basic it is though nan
