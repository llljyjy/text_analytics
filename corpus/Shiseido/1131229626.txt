I really really like this sunscreen! Let me start by saying I don’t have the greatest luck when it comes to sunscreen or products with any sort of SPF in them, I usually wind up breaking out like a teenager. That being said, I was a bit hesitant when I recieved this. To my surprise it didn’t cause me to break out! The formula is excellent, it is very hydrating/moisturizing, it isn’t greasy or heavy feeling on the skin, it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling nice and smooth plus it has the added benefits of hyaluronic acid. It works great on its own or under makeup, it left my skin with a radiant natural glow especially when I wore it alone. When I did choose to use complexion products they applied smoothly and evenly and I still had a nice natural glow peeking through. The only reason I took a star off was because though it says fragrance free/unscented it isn’t,  it still has that weird sunscreen smell to it though it isn’t so strong that it would be unusable, the smell dissipates after about 10 minutes or so. Formula wise, it’s definitely a 5 star product. Price wise it may seem a bit steep for “just a sunscreen“ however it is more than just your basic run of the mill sunscreen this is an actual skincare product with the great benefits of Shiseido skincare that also happens to be an excellent SPF. I would definitely recommend it especially if you are someone who wants all the benefits of a good skincare regimen but want something a bit lighter/more simple it’s also great if you’re just looking to maybe cut down on a few steps in the morning because you have your spf and moisturizer as well as primer if you’re using complexion products in one! Dual purpose!
