I hope Shiseido doesn’t discontinue this, like they did with their old Benefiance night cream. I love this eye cream. I’m 35 and while I don’t expect this to reverse the little signs of ageing slowly showing up on my face, this eye cream certainly does diminish their appearance! I don’t wear it in the mornings because it is thick and doesn’t absorb really quickly, but that doesn’t bother me. Top marks! nan
