Iâ€™m all for sunscreen that does make me look like a ghost. This sunscreen is easy to apply, lightweight, and absorbed quickly into the skin. The bottle is small enough to carry in your pocketbook so you can reapply throughout the day. It has a mild smell that is pleasant. I would definitely recommended and purchase this product. Great for dark skin!
