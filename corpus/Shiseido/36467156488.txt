Absolutely adore this sunscreen! At first I thought I wouldn’t like it because it has a moderate fragrance to it, but I found that it fades after about 30 minutes and is pretty undetectable after that. I love the way this glides on like a dream, and feels more like a lotion than a sunscreen. If you like dewy sunscreens, you will love this. Probably best for people with dry or combo skin since it is so moisturizing. But really, you have to try it. It sinks in like a moisturizer, makes you glows and no eye burn!! I’m medium skin-toned and it has given me zero white cast. I’m super happy with this sunscreen!! LOVE IT!
