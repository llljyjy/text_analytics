Has a pleasant scent, though I wish it were unscented.  Very thick!! Feels smooth and incredibly moisturizing.  Applying this feels so luxurious.  I liked how my skin felt after applying, however I got a pretty bad breakout after I started using it.  I guess it could have been purging from the hyaluronic acid, I’m not sure.  I took a break from using it so my skin could heal and I’m slowly reintroducing it again so hopefully it goes well.  I really want to love this cream because it feels so nice! nan
