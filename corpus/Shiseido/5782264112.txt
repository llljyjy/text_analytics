Love it! I’ve been using Clinique or Farmacy cleansing balm for a few years as my first step in cleansing but was wanting to check the cleansing oils and I’m sold.  Like others have said, there is none of the eye cloudiness I’ve experienced with the others.  And I love the scent! Very soft but nice. So happy I gave it a try. nan
