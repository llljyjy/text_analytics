I received this product free from Influenster and Shishedo for my honest review. This sunscreen isn’t too shabby at all. The scent wasn’t overpowering and the texture was pleasant, not overly thick. It applied easily and didn’t give my skin that burning sensation that sunscreens sometimes do. The product absorbed into my skin quickly and I didn’t notice any visible signs of streaking or patchiness. Packaging is simple and clean. It does its intended purpose. Summer time
