Overall, I like this sunscreen. One of the best parts is that it is oil free, that is one of the top things I look for before trying a new sunscreen since I have combination skin. This was moisturizing without leaving me feeling very greasy. It is a little watery, but absorbed. I live in the hot south so sunscreen is super important and I feel this held up to the heat. nan
