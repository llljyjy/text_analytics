Iâ€™ve enjoyed the trend of skincare in make up so was excited to try this primer and spf.  In my everyday routine it was fine.  My make up was no different than usual. However.  The day I spent outside in the heat my make up melted, literally melted, off my face.  All of my other products have held up to the heat before.   I also noticed a greasy feel after multiple days of use. Okay under the right conditions.
