I received Shiseido Urban Environment Oil-Free Mineral Sunscreen for free in exchange for my honest review. I really like the way this mineral sunscreen absorbs into the skin. I experienced no greasy residue and it performed well under makeup. I’m very happy with this sunscreen and will continue using it in the future. Thank you, Influenster and Shiseido! Best mineral sunscreen I’ve tried!
