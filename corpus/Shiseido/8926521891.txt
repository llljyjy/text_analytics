Not sure if you can get catfished by a moisturizer but that’s the only way to describe this. The packaging is beautiful. When I opened the jar, it looked super thick and creamy. I live in Arizona so the need for a super hydrating moisturizer is a must. I was so excited for my skin to drink up this luxurious, hydrating nectar…NOPE. My skin seemed to suck it up so fast that there was no sense of relief. It almost had a powdery finish. At first it has a soft feel that disappeared instantly. Very disappointed so I gave it to my husband who is always asking me for moisturizer. Maybe he’ll have better luck. Hard Pass
