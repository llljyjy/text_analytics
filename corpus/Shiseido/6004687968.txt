This was the first Shiseido product I have ever tried, my first impression was that it looked like an Olay jar but the moisturizer is phenomenal. It is thick and creamy and spreads easily. I love that I cannot feel the product on my face, it is like it is completely absorbed and I am left with hydrated skin. this has been a game changer for this dry winter! I will definitely buy this product in the future and highly recommend it. nan
