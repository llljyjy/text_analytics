This does leave a decent white cast, however, if you apply makeup over it then it’s fine. It makes my skin look airbrushed! It’s a wonderful makeup primer and sunscreen. I am decently fair skinned so if you have darker skin this might not be the best sunscreen for you, but it definitely can be covered up with makeup. It dries down well, too! wow!
