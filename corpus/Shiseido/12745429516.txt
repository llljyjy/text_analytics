I prefer products with no scent at all, this onesmells slightly like alcohol. It bothers me a bit. This is my first shiseido product and I’m not too fond of it. The serum doesn’t do much to keep my skin feeling hydrated. I have very dry skin though so maybe it will work better for others. I wanted to use the product for a few weeks before leaving a review and I’ve honestly noticed no difference. It’s not a serum I would purchase again unfortunately. I’d also like to disclose that I received this product complimentary in exchange for my review. Scent is a bit off putting
