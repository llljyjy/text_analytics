The most important skincare product is SPF.It should be applied year round, but we are now approaching Summer when it’s especially important! I received the @shiseido Urban Environment Oil-Free Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 42 free to try and honestly, I LOVE this product! It’s lightweight, moisturizing and melts beautifully into the skin.It leaves my skin looking subtly dewy, but not oily.I love that it’s oil free AND that it contains hyaluronic acid, leaving my skin moisturized (which is something I NEED as I have dry skin).And it’s great for anti-aging! Which is something I’m aiming for in my skincare routine.It also works beautifully as a primer under makeup! GREAT SPF!!
