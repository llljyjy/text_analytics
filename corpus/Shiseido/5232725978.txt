This sunscreen is packed with sun protection and may also be used as a face primer. It’s lightweight, and while I wouldn’t use this under my makeup, it’s a great sunscreen for the pool, beach, or any day you don’t feel like putting on makeup. It absorbed quickly but did leave a bit of white cast. Great sunscreen if you’re not wearing makeup
