I’ve been using this regularly for a few weeks now and loving it! I apply a thin layer in the morning after my cleanser, and it sinks in extremely quickly. It’s so lightweight that I can barely feel it on my skin within minutes, and it leaves me looking glowy without being shiny. Big fan of this! nan
