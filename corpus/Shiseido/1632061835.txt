This feels really nice on my skin. It’s lightweight, not greasy or heavy at all, has a light lotion smell, and really hydrates my skin. My skin was noticeably softer after a single use. It also does not irritate my face at all, which is notable because I have extremely sensitive skin that reacts to random ingredients in totally unremarkable skincare products. I like that there’s this version without SPF so I can wear it before bed, or if I plan on putting on a strong sunscreen later. I like this!
