Let’s talk about Shiseido Ultimune Power Infusing Concentrate. The packaging is so beautiful and sleek that I just knew it was something special. This concentrate is just what I needed for skincare routine to help with anti-aging and also brighten dull looking skin. I really love the iris root extracts because it’s so unique and flagrant. My skin is so much more hydrated and thus younger looking already. Super Smooth!
