First of all, I love how much product you get. The product itself definitely hydrates and sinks into your skin. It does not leave any white cast. I wish it had more than 20 spf, a 30 spf would be nice. Additionally it has a very strong spf fragrance. I wish there was less of a smell. Overall itâ€™s a beautiful product and is great under makeup. Lovely light product, heavy spf fragrance
