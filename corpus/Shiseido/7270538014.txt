*Incentivized/I was sent this by Influenster & Shiseido in exchange for my honest review. All my thoughts are my own. •slightly scented; not a fan, lingers after application•very watery consistency •absorbs pretty quickly•as someone with combo skin (very oily tzone), i appreciate the oil free aspect; it adds a matteness without compromising glow•product is tinted, but does not apply a tint•think it broke me out in these small, under skin bumps but it was hard to tell because applying during the lead up to my period.•thought it would make a great primer, especially around my nose and cheeks where I have larger pores, but makeup came off totally (broke up) Pretty good SPF for combo/oily skin
