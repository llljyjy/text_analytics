Lets me honest here. I NEVER wear sunscreen on my face unless im on vacation to the beach. I received this product to try and just Iâ€™m time for my vacation to Dominican Republic. I used this Dailey after all my showers which was 2 or 3 a day. It did help with my dry skin but that was about it. Not sure what benefits it would give other than that. The product did absorb quickly in my skin and left it feeling a tad but oily. For $38.00 is alittle on the high side but it is worth a try! Worth a try
