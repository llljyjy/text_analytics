I have dry acne prone skin and this did no favors on either account. I broke out and my skin has been dry since adding this to my daily use. The consistency is very watery and thin which I did not expect. It does leave some white cast, it’s best used under makeup for that reason. it is nice under makeup which is it’s one plus for me. Unfortunately not for my skin type
