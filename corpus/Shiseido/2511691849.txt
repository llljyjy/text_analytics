I’ve been loving this moisturizer. It’s so hydrating and I love that it have spf included. I tend to forget to put spf on a daily basis so products that I use daily with included are my jam. Only thing I’ve noticed is a lil white cast on pictures but it could be the combination of the moisturizer and foundation. Overall great product. nan
