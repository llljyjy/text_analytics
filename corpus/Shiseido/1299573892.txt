Absolutely love and I just ordered my second bottle. I should preface my review that I rarely wear makeup so my review is based on clean skin with only skincare products. I donâ€™t mind a little shine either. I guess my skin is combination but not excessively oily. I have tried a few sunscreens and they all made my skin feel dry. This is the first one I tried that felt absorbed and my skin felt nice afterwards. Highly recommend if that is something you are looking for. best for me
