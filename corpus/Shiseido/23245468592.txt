1st off the packaging and the bottle itself are absolutely beautiful. the bright red color and the sleekness are very attractive. 2nd I loved the subtle scent. It has a floral, feminine scent that was not overpowering. lastly, I enjoyed how smooth the product went on.  I received the product complimentary and enjoy it but the price tag is a bit too high for me to just go out and buy it. Like the product not the price tag
