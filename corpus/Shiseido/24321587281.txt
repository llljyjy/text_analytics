I was disappointed when I did not receive this product in the mail, but it somehow got lost during the holidays and I just received it three weeks ago. I wanted to really try it out before writing a review. I must say this is probably the very best test serum I have ever used and I’ve been using it along with the face cream morning and night. I probably wouldn’t have purchased this because of the cost, but after using it the past three weeks I can tell you the quality and results are definitely worth the price . I am 43 years old so I don’t have too many wrinkles however the fine lines and crows feet have already started to diminish just in three weeks. I absolutely love the texture, the fact that it’s not very fragrant and it’s great for sensitive skin. It seems to last a while because I still have plenty left. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to prevent wrinkles or to help diminish them . It also keeps my skin highly moisturized day and night as well. Well worth the price!
