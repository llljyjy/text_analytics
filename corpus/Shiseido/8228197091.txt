This sunblock does it’s job. While it doesn’t leave my face burnt it is a bit watery and leaves a white residue on skin. The residue isn’t noticeable to my skin, although I am very fair it might if more tan it rubs off on clothes which I didn’t like. But I still use it and it works well enough even with its faults. Good sunblock
