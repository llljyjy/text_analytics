I was gifted this moisturizer but I would say it’s pretty good! For me, it’s not as hydrating as I prefer but my skin has been extra dry and dehydrated lately so that might be a reason why, but if I layer my toners, serums, etc with this moisturizer I like it. I definitely still put on SPF even if this has some as SPF 20 just isn’t enough for me! Pretty Good!
