This serum kept my skin hydrated and radiant. It is easy to use and works well with other products. It also helped with reducing signs of aging. It worked well with my combo skin and caused no redness or breakouts. It is slightly expensive but it is worth it. So happy I was able to sample this amazing serum. The serum comes in a beautiful glass bottle and pump distributes enough product. Soooo hydrating
