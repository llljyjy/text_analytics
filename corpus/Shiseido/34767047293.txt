I received this product complimentary from shiseido and influenster in exchange for my honest review. It has good spf and hydrates the skin when in use. I like the combination in single product. I wish it was tinted like the oil-free version.It is white in color and has lotion like texture. Small amount is enough to cover whole face. I avoid rubbing sunscreens on my skin as they leave white cast, so I just tap them to absord into skin. It has little bit generic sunscreen smell that fades away. Overall good product but I liked oil free version better. Good Sunacreen
