I received these products for free from Influenster and brand(s) in exchange for my honest review.   I really liked this product. At first I was skeptical when I read it because I thought it would feel like sun tan lotion but it’s light and doesn’t leave any residue. A little bit goes a LONG way, I learned that the hard way. The only thing I didn’t like was it makes my skin lighter than my tan color in the summer so I couldn’t use it without foundation but I’m very tan. Otherwise it’s amazing! Pleasantly surprised!
