I like the packaging of the product - glass bottle with an easy pump top. The serum is light and has a nice floral scent to it that I enjoy AND it doesn’t break out my sensitive combination skin! That’s always my concern with starting a new skincare product and that didn’t happen with this. The serum is light and feels really good on my skin, absorbs easy too. I feel my skin texture has improved since using it. I will say I still have some flaky spots in my T-zone once the product fully absorbs but I chalk that up to my skin type and winter. All and all I recommend this product. Price is a little high but if you’re already looking to spend that amount on a serum I say go for it! Nice Product and Bottle
