My skin suffers pretty bad once winter hits. I’m the summer I’m lucky to maybe have combo skin, but once the dry winter air hits, my skin becomes crepe paper: dry, cracking, and peeling at even the slightest inconvenience. I have honestly really enjoyed this cream. It’s interesting because the consistency is thick, but it absorbs really well, almost like a gel product would. Some creams when I use them feel a little like they’re just sitting on my skin instead of absorbing in, which then just leads me to feeling like I have a residue layer happening. With this cream though, I don’t have that issue. It absorbs well, and I can feel a difference in my skin’s hydration. I also enjoy that this product has SPF. i e been trying to include it more in my routine (I’m late to the game on spf sadly), but some days I simply forget or am running late, etc. it’s nice knowing that even if it’s not my full preferred SPF amount, I still have some protection happening. Overall, a product I’m happy to have gotten the opportunity to try. This isn’t a brand I normally seek out or reach for, but I’m happy to have been able to give them a try and am absolutely interested in seeing what more I’d like to try from them. Great for my dry winter skin!
