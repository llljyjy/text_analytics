I love this day cream!! I’ve been trying to be better about wearing sunscreen daily but I’ve had trouble finding one that has a texture I like and doesn’t smell too strong. This day cream is light and absorbs quickly while still feeling moisturizing. It doesn’t have too strong of a scent which is also a plus. I do wish the SPF was a little stronger but this is already so much better because I actually want to put it on every day. nan
