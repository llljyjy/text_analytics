For a sunscreen these aren’t bad, but they weren’t stand out to me. They both left a long lasting tacky residue and when I applied my makeup on top of them, it did become a bit crumbly. However, for a day at the beach, or a day without makeup, these would be great. No noticeable smells, no white residue. My daughter’s love them! I really love Shiseido products, these just weren’t in my top picks for them. #shiseidosuncare #complimentary @shiseido @Influenster nan
