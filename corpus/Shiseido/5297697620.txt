I absolutely loved this day cream by Shiseido! It instantly hydrates your skin leaving it silky and soft. This is perfect for my dry skin in the summer. I love that it is SPF 20 for added protection to my face as I’m outside much more this time of year. This cream is light and so moisturizing but doesn’t leave your skin feeling greasy at all. Because it is so hydrating a little goes a long way so this jar actually lasted me quite a while! This was my first time trying this brand and I loved it! Love this product ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
