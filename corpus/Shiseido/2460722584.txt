Love when any product comes in glass rather than plastic. As far as the product itself it has a thinner viscosity to it, which is nice especially when layering skincare. It does smell perfume-y which I don’t mind but is worth mentioning. I don’t know if I would buy this as a standalone skincare product, but as far as an addition it’s pleasant enough. Smells nice, good packaging
