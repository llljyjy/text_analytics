I received this product complementary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I am a big skin care junkie so Iâ€™m very picky about products that I incorporate into my routine. I have really enjoyed using this serum. It is non-greasy and absorbs quickly. It has a light please t fragrance that does not irritate my skin. Ever since having my baby 10 months ago my skin has been incredibly dry and dull, this products helped to combat that within the first use. After about 5 days I noticed my skin appeared plumper and the fine lines on my forehead decreased. I appreciate that this is breastfeeding friendly. I will continue to use this product and hope I continue to notice the anti-aging benefits! Just what my dull postpartum skin needed!
