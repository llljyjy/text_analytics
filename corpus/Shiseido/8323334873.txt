I’ve always been a huge fan of Shisheido. Their packaging is pretty, but even more, their products work wonderfully. I love that this cream  has SPF added; I’m very fair skinned so I’ve been told by my dermatologist it’s time to be wearing SPF on my face and chest every day to avoid any aging spots. The only con is sometimes if I’ve used it after I’ve exfoliated, it stings just a little. I’ve just quit using it on days I have exfoliated instead. It is SO hydrating - I have extremely dry skin and it’s not often I consider adding new products to my skin care regime, but this one I will. Is it pricey? Yes. Is it worth it? Also yes. Great product and great results!
