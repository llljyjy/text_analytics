I received the Shiseido essential energy hydrating cream to test complementary from Influenster. As the second of two different formulas I received I thought this one would be at least a little bit different however both essential energy moisturizers seem to work almost identically. The packaging is still absolutely stunning in my opinion and easy to use. And I like the fact that when I use this moisturizer I actually feel like my skin not only gets hydrated but stays hydrated, especially as someone who is severely dry at all times. I also enjoy the natural glow it gives off. I do have extremely sensitive skin, and despite this saying that it’s sensitive skin friendly I do feel that if I overuse this it can cause me to get a little bit irritated or break out, although I’m not positive it’s this particular product that’s causing that. If you’re a fan of hyaluronic acid you should also like this because it’s in the moisturizer. hydrated, glowing skin
