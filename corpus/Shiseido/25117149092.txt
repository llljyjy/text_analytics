first of,love the bottle it’s heavy and doesn’t look cheap at all. it’s also in big for a normal skincare serum size so it’s worth every penny. the serum itself doesn’t feel tacky when applied but also is moisturizing and smells so good. loved it overall can’t wait to update after 4 weeks of use Love the packaging!
