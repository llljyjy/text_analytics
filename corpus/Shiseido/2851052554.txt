I’m not sure about the product, it makes my skin feel nice but the spf burns my eyes no matter how much I try to keep it away from my eyes. This is usually an issue with creams with spf for me, so it is not the fault of the product. It would be a nice primer without the spf. I do like this one over the oil free bc the oil free is very runny.“I received these products for free from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review.“ It's good but the spf burns my eyes
