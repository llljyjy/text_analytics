As a fair skin/hair woman just edging into my 40s, I fully embrace all forms of sun protection! I was fortunate to be selected to try this amazing product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review  ! Easy application, went on smoothly under makeup and acted as a wonderful primer, leaving a subtle glow - love the added hyaluronic acid for an additional skincare layer. I will note that I did see some white cast as was mentioned in other reviews- it seemed to dissipate quickly for me however, again I am very fair. Will definitely continue to use in the future! Pleasantly surprised!
