I really don’t have any complaints. The packaging was gorgeous, and I really appreciated the opportunity to receive 2 of the product since it was running late. The cream itself is not bad. It’s very moisturizing, smells fresh and a bit like sunscreen (which is to be expected), and it definitely caused a brightening effect on my skin. But, it wasn’t meant for my skin type. It left me with too much shine and grease, and my face felt like it needed to be washed. I would definitely recommend this brand to someone with severe dryness on their face or T zone, or anyone looking for a natural glow as opposed to applying highlighter. Helped me significantly with sun exposure, as well. Which in Florida means a lot! Not bad, just not for me!
