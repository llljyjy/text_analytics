Let me start by saying this product makes my skin glow and look dewy for hours. And I mean hours! It smells great and gives the absolute best hydration. My only issue is that I broke out when I used it, so Iâ€™m not sure my skin loved it as much as I wanted it to. I do have very sensitive skin though, but I would definitely still recommend this product to anyone! Love it but may not be for my skin
