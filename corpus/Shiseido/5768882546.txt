I’ve been using this product consistently since it arrived earlier in January. The texture is a light, milky texture that goes onto the skin smoothly and smells almost like nothing. It takes about 4 pumps to get enough for my face and neck to get coverage of the product.The reason for the lower rating is mostly due to the fact that this product is so expensive per oz. On my skin, it was hard to tell how much product was being absorbed vs evaporated, and it left my skin feeling a little dry if I wasn’t really fast about applying the next layer. I’ve only been testing for a few weeks so I am unsure of how effective it is, as I cannot control for other variables.Maybe if I tried it for longer, maybe if it was cheaper I would purchase myself. However, with other products seeming just as effective and much cheaper, I don’t see this product having a permanent spot in my routine. I did receive this free to try via Influenster. Fine- Overpriced
