Very light scent which I enjoyed as I’m sensitive to scents. Light weight moisturizer that doesn’t leave your skin sticky. I loved that it already has spf in it as well so I don’t have to use a separate products. Set well on the face and under my makeup I didn’t notice any settling throughout the day. Skin remained moisturized even though I normally get patchy dry spots mid day I didn’t when wearing this! Packaging is very well done! Great lightly scented, spf day cream, perfect
