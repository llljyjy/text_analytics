I used this today for the first time on my face and it didn’t sit nicely on my face. Maybe because my face was dry or dirty, but it felt a bit gritty. I’ve used the oil free version and I didn’t have this issue. The bottle size is great and it has a nice scent. No real complaints other than the weird texture. nan
