I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I love that this product serves a dual purpose! Sunscreen, anti-aging and primer! It helps with my dry face and last all day. It doesnâ€™t feel super heavy after applying it and it smells good. I do feel like this brand is expensive but it might be worth it for me. nan
