I want to wear sunscreen everyday, but I am so much more likely to do it with it in my moisturizer. I also want to avoid bad ingredients.  This moisturizer meets both of those needs. This did a great job moisturizing and I appreciate that it is SPF 42, which is higher than many other moisturizers.  The smell is nice and it did not cause a white cast. It left a healthy glow, but not a greasy glow, and layered well under my makeup. All around great!
