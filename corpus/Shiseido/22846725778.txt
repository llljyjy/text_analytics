I’ve recently really gotten into sunscreen which I know is a ll but late for me but better late than never and I’m on the hunt for trying new ones out to see which suits me best! The fresh moisture one I love! It doesn’t leave white cast, feels so good on skin and my makeup applies really good too! The oil free one however I found broke out my skin! I’m glad that I found the fresh moisture one because it is one of my favs now! nan
