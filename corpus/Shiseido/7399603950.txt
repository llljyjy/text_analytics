I’ve been testing this moisturizer for a new weeks and I have quite a few thoughts. My favorite part about all of it is the lux packaging! The moisturizer is nice, not super hydrating, but I do think this would be better for someone who is oily or combo, not someone with dry skin like me. It has a lovely, soft fragrance and doesn’t leave a white cast from the spf. I’ve also used it before makeup and it does seem to smooth my skin a bit! I have moisturizers from the drugstore for $20 that performs just as good as this one for $50. But if you’re up for a splurge product, I say go for it! nan
