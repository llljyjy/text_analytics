I have been using this sunscreen for 2 weeks now and I love it. The formula is very nice and light weight. It doesn’t feel like you’re wearing a sunscreen and it doesn’t have that gross sunscreen smell like many others do. When I wear it out my skin feels super protected and I don’t feel like my skin was out in the sun all day when I get home Silky smooth sunscreen
