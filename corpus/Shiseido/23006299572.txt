I was so excited when I found out that I was going to get to try this product out in exchange for my thoughts and opinions. When I got it I tested it out the next day. I was a little confused because it dried down a little fast and it left a bit of a white cast on my forehead but it wasn’t anything crazy. The second time I used it, I applied it in sections instead of putting the entire amount I was using in my hand all at once. I still noticed a faint white cast but it was less than the first time I used it. The third time I used it, I had just shaved my face & my products melted into my skin so well including this sunscreen. The white cast was barely there but was gone by the time I left my house. I did like this but it won’t be replacing my go-to summer moisturizer from Murad. I would use this as a backup or if it was all I had & recommended it to others. nan
