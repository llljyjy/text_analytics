I liked this sunscreen but it isn’t one I’d give up my other sunscreen for. It’s very light and doesn’t leave a white tint behind. Has hyaluronic acid in it which is a plus. It’s just not one that mixed well with my skin. I’m not ready for consistent breakouts to see if this would end up working out for me when I have one that already works well. I also received this complimentary from influencer for my honest review. Good product
