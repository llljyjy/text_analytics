This moisturizer is a medium consistency that melts into the skin quickly and easily. I don’t feel sticky or greasy after application, but I do feel hydrated. I wish this had more of a scent to it since it smells a little like spf, but it isn’t overwhelming. Overall I really like how my skin feels after using this. I received this product complimentary for review but all opinions are my own. great moisturizer for dry skin
