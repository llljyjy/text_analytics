Great day moisturizer that includes SPF! Perfect for me as I tend to forget sunscreen a lot. I was hesitant about the texture at first because the description says cream, but it’s actually really soft & fast absorbing. I don’t like using heavy moisturizer in the day because I tend to get oily in the T-zone. The only thing I do have to point out is the slight smell of sunscreen. It doesn’t bother me too much though. nan
