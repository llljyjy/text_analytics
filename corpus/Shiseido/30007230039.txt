Living in Florida, you kind of become a connoisseur of sunscreens. This is definitely at the top of my list. I love how light this goes on. It doesn’t leave any white spots or marks, like mineral sunscreen. The scent is pleasant and basically non-existent. I’ve felt very good about spending a lot of time in the sun while using this sunscreen. This is definitely my new everyday protection. It also serves as a great base for my everyday makeup. A great sheer sunscreen
