I actually wanted to try this and happened to receive it in exchange for reviewing so I was super excited! I thought the sunscreen was ok. It’s texture is very watery, kind of difficult to put on. I used my hands to apply, but it left streaky marks because it didn’t absorb well enough. I would have really liked this and kept it in my skincare routine if it was a different consistency and had a tint to it that would even out my skin. Maybe if you have normal (not super dry like me anyway) skin it would work wonderfully! Ok mineral sunscreen
