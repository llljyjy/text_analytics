I have combo skin and I normally hate sunscreen because it ends up being super greasy and sticky on my skin. When I first applied it, it seemed like it was a bit less than others but still a bit greasy. However, after a few seconds, it went into my skin without that greasy shine. I was even able to layer a light gel moisturizer on top of it without feeling overly moisturized!  Impressed. And I like that it was spf 42, more than the usual 30. Surprised!
