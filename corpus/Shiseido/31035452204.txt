#shiseidosuncare #complimentary @shiseido @Influenster I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Shiseido in return for an honest review…If you have dry skin, this sunscreen might be for you! This sunscreen left my face feeling rather oily/greasy and I looked like my face was dewy/damp for a while after application. I could actually feel the weight of this on my face. After one use my face broke out. I typically have a couple pimples here and there especially around my menses, but it was almost like I was in middle school again. It does do its job as a sunscreen, I wasn’t sunburned after being outside for a few hours. I just can’t get around and my skin does not agree with the “moisture” part of this. Oily
