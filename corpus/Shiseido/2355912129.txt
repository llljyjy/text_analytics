I love this cream. My skin is mostly on the dry side so I look for really good moisturizers. This cream is very hydrating. I added it to my morning routine. My skin feels so soft after applying it. I like that it has spf 20 and it doesn’t irritate my skin. I wasn’t to fond of the scent but it’s not overpowering. I can see myself using this cream again. Super hydrating!
