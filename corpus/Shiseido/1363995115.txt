I love the packaging of this product. It also smelled expensive & left my skin with a beautiful glow. I almost preferred to go without makeup when I applied this product because it looked so nice! Unfortunately, it broke me out like crazy after two uses. I can use the Shiseido spf50 but not this one surprisingly. I will pass it onto my daughter to see if she can use it. Beautiful packaging!
