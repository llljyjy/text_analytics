I love the texture of this cream. It went on well andfelt nice and light. I like that is has spf, but I wish itwas higher than 20. I think this would be a greatmoisturizer for summer. Itâ€™s a little light for winterunless I layer it with another moisturizer. It did notbreak me out.I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for an honest review nice and light
