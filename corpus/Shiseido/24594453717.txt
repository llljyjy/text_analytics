I received this from infuenster for free but my opinion and review are my own This is a great everyday sunscreen. It goes on easy doesn’t just sit on the skin it soaks in fast and doesn’t leave no chalky residue and it lays under makeup beautifully.. I really love Shiseido sunscreen products because I always know I’m going to get a high SPF and a nice  lotion that instantly soaks into my skin and leaves no film, residue, or chalky color, i l I’m use it as s primer!!
