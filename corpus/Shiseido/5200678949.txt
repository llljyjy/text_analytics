I have been using it and absolutely love it. It does not leave a white residue, if blended properly. Love love the dewy shine it gives to my face as of the sun is hitting from a perfect angle (while keeping my face safe from sun). The slim design looks great too. I think it has to re-applied if you stay in sun longer. It is runny in consistency that makes it more blend-able than other sunscreens. Its a 10/10 from me . Amazing
