So far, I like this. It’s a transparent liquid so no chance of leaving a white cast. Formula is satisfying. The bottle is convenient to put in your purse if you’re on the go. I mainly use it for my face and neck. I have combination skin and do get more oily during the summer months, so, if you’re oily, I would be a little careful since it does get “decently” oily on your skin if you apply even just a tad more. Thus, one less star. Good Product Overall!
