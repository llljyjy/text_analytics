You can never go wrong with an SPF into your morning routine. I apply it after my moisturizer. Dab on the cheeks, forehead, chin, and neck. Goes in smooth. I find the slight scent really pleasant. Doesnâ€™t leave a white cast. Lightweight and application is easy. FYI: give it a good shake and then apply. Everyday Wear
