Man oh man, I love this stuff. I use retinol and vit c so I’m a sucker for a good spf product. Because this doubles as a moisturizer, I use this in the am. The glow that this gives is so nice, it leaves my skin looking radiant and keeps it moisturized all day. The smell is super light, it’s not sticky, and there’s no white cast. Dewy glow heaven
