I received this product through Influenster for my honest review. Shiseido oil free sunscreen is a 2 in 1, it can be used under makeup as a primer and it’s also a sunscreen! It has a matte finish and didn’t leave a white cast on my face like most sunscreens. Can’t wait to try it out this summer! shiseido urban environment oil-free sunscreen broa
