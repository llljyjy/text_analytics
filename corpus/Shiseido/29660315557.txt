I relieved this as a member of influenster. This moisturizer/ sunscreen works so well with moisturizing my skin and compared to others I’ve tried with spf, this one doesn’t have a strong scent to it that screams sun screen. A little goes a long way also! This jar will last me for a few months. It also absorbed into my skin well and didn’t leave it feeling Greasy and left a soft focus glow to my face after applying. Would definitely recommend this to someone looking for a light weight moisturizer with spf. Worth the price !
