This sunscreen feels like it will be kind of thick on your skin at first, but it’s really more like a thin moisturizer,  so it absorbs quickly without becoming tacky.  I did not notice any kind of fragrance at all, nor any white cast. I honestly think I need to really put this to the test when the hotter, more humid weather comes, but all in all, this is worth it - way better than any cheaper sunscreens I’ve tried. nan
