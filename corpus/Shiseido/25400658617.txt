I really love this sunscreen! The fact that this can be worn under my make up is a huge win in my books. It is very easy to blend into my skin, and it doesn’t leave it feeling heavy or oily. This has a nice and high SPF so I can relax when I’m outside knowing that my skin is well protected. Relax while your skin is protected
