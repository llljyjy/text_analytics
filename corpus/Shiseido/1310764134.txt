Look no further is you want a lightweight hydrating day cream. This one does not have an SPF so be sure to add your own preferred amount. Or they do offer a version of this product with 30 SPF. However, if you are fair-skinned like me I need a 50 SPF for my face so there is no point in paying twice for SPF. It’s lightweight formula really makes your skin sing with hydration without the heavy feeling. I really like it! Shisheido - there’s a cream for that!
