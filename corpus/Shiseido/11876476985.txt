This face serum is seriously great! As soon as I got the package out of my mailbox I washed my face and tried it. Let me just say all the hype is accurate—this serum soaked into my skin immediately and left my face feeling super soft, hydrated, and glowing. I love that I can continue using other serums as well and that this is an addition (not replacement) in my skin care routine. I can’t wait to see the long term results! I love it!
