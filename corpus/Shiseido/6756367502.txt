I received this product for free from Influenster and brand in exchange for my honest review. I am always timid when trying new sunscreens, especially on my face. I have used a lot that have caused irritation but this one, did NOT!! I am so amazed by this product, it is light weight, not greasy & does not leave a white cast. It does have some pigment to it and was actually light enough for me, which is difficult for me to find. I honestly forgot I was wearing it when I did have it on. Itâ€™s light weight, non-greasy and does not have a strong fragrance. I definitely intend on purchasing this again when I run out! nan
