I have sensitive combination skin and am 4 months postpartum. My skin went through some drastic changes with my last pregnancy, hyperpigmentation, oily acne, dry patches and scarring. No matter what I did nothing helped, definitely hormonal. I’m always looking for something that will help with my scars, hyperpigmentation, oil/dry and have SPF without having to use 6 products. So far, so good, I didn’t break out the SPF doesn’t have a string scent and it feels light on my skin. If you have any of my skin issues give it a try. Try It!
