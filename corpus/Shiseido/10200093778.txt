Thank you for sending this to me for free from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review! It has a nice finish and goes in well, but it does leave some white cast. I think other comments have mentioned that this happened when they changed the formula. Overall for me, it does feel nice to put on, but as someone who is not using it as a makeup primer as well, the price just doesnâ€™t hold up for me. I have found less expensive products that work just as well. I am glad that it is reef friendly. nan
