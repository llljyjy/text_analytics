I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. I really enjoy using this sunscreen. So far this is the best one I have used. It goes on very smooth like a lotion and primes your face very nicely getting it ready for your makeup. It absorbs quickly and leaves your face hydrated and literally feeling like silk. It does not leave your face greasy or oily and it doesn’t leave a white cast. This sunscreen is lightweight and has a mild fragrance that I actually enjoy. It keeps me protected and is gentle on the skin. I haven’t experienced any breakouts while using this sunscreen. I definitely recommend this product. Like Silk
