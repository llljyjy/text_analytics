Makeup remover is not mentioned in the description.. idk why ppl keep complaining about it.. just read the description. I love these wipes! I use them after the gym and when my face feels gross. It’s not an intense wipe where my face feels like it’s slightly burning. Hence the title refreshing cleaning sheets. Also I think it smells really nice, it’s not overpowering. Love it!
