I really liked this sunscreen a lot. It wasnâ€™t asthick feeling as most sunscreens and went onmore like moisturizer which was nice. It didmake my face feel kind of sticky though (likemost sunscreens do), so I did feel the need towash my face after coming back in from thesun. But overall, it is a really good sunscreen Great sunscreen
