So I’ve actually been using this serum for 4 months now. I had bought the smaller size to test it out and then surprise Influenster gave me the bigger version. Yay! Great for summer and winter.My skin is oily but in the winter it gets dry.It’s hydrating and my skin absorbs it quickly. I hate serums that sit on top of your skin. This one does not. The smell is nice, not strong at all.Yay for plump, radiant, and beautiful skin ❤️ love ❤️
