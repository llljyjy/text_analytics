I’m very happy with this sunscreen. It’s opaque out of the bottle but quickly disappears on the skin (allowing you to see where you’ve applied it, which is nice), and doesn’t feel sticky or greasy. And-- most importantly to me, as a runner-- it’s sweatproof and doesn’t run into my eyes and sting, even during a long run. It is pricey for sure, and the smell is a bit strong, but overall I like it and will buy it again. Sweatproof!
