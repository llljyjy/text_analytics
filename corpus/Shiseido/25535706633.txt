I received this product complimentary through Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have been using this now every night for the past 2 weeks. It has a slight alcohol scent at first but quickly diminishes as u apply it. It does absorb quickly into your skin without leaving an oily residue. It only takes one pump to cover your entire face so will last a bit. I have also noticed visibility of fine lines and wrinkles have also disappeared which plays a very important role when choosing serums and creams as a woman approaching 40! Overall Iâ€™m very pleased with this and will continue using! Diminishes fine lines and wrinkles
