You canâ€™t tell me all sunscreens apply this nicely without leaving that white residue streak. First thing I did was smell it to see if it actually smells like sunscreen which it does but in a really nice gentle smelling way. It makes my face shine and I took it on my recent vacation. My husband still got a little burnt but granted we were out in the sun for hours. Felt nice having something expensive on our face in the scorching sun. Great
