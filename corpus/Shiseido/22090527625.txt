i love this sunscreen, i’ve been using it for about two years and i think it just looks so nice on the skin. being someone who has a dark skin complexion it’s hard to find sunscreens that don’t leave a white cast but this sunscreen blends into the skin perfectly! I also love that it doesn’t pill on top of other skincare products and doesn’t clog my pores or make me breakout. nan
