I really like the Shiseido brand but was tasked with trying this chemical sunscreen in addition to my SPF heavy skin care regimen that already involves over 7 products before makeup application.  The formula was a bit thick and showed some white cast on my already light complexion. I’d recommend working it in to skin or adding a tinted moisturizer with it if using without makeup. Otherwise, there is a fragrance that many people describe as “beachy“ or “suntan lotion“ but I don’t mind it. I would also use this for days at the beach or pool but for the price and my budget, it will be used sparingly. I should add I’ve had my first ’pimple’ in over a year after using both versions of their new sunscreens for about a week. Not the best reaction for my skin type
