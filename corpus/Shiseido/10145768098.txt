I don’t like chemical sunscreens because they dry out my skin and smell like sunscreen. I always check off that I prefer mineral sunscreens on my surveys, but was sent this anyway. The moisturizer is just fine. I have to use a serum underneath so it doesn’t dry out my skin and wash my hands so it doesn’t dry out my hands. I guess it protects when I’m outdoors but I definitely prefer mineral sunscreens. This moisturizer is just fine
