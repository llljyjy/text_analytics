The sunscreen applies silky smooth. It does not bead up or get runny. It sits well on my combination skin. My skin feels hydrated and well protected. My makeup sits well over the sunscreen. It does well as a stand-alone sunscreen as well. The hyaluronic acid helps renew my skin and gives me a nicer skin texture. Shiseido Urban Enviroment Excellent Coverage
