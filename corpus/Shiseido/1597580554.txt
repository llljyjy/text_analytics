I received a this product for free from influenster in exchange for an honest♥️ I wanted to give myself a few days before leaving a review so I could really see if I noticed any change in the texture and feel of my skin. I’m on day 17 of continuous use and I absolutely love this product! My skin glows after each use and I’ve noticed a huge difference in the way my makeup looks after application. I really think this product has helped my skin retain moisture. I follow my normal skin routine (wash my face every night and morning) then follow up with Shiseido Ultimune power infusing concentrate and end with a nice moisturizer. The bottle is a great weight, and the smell of this concentrate is heavenly.I’m excited to see what the next few weeks of usage will bring! A must have!
