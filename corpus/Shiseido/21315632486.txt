I have very sensitive skin and haven’t found a whole lot of products that haven’t caused breakouts. This feels so nice on my skin and hasn’t caused any breakouts. I love that it has SPF in it and still doesn’t feel sticky or leave my skin feeling gross. My skin is so soft and glowing. I will definitely be making this a staple Best Moisturizer with SPF for my Sensitive Skin
