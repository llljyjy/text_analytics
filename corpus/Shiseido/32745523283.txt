The packaging of this Shiseido Urban Environment Sun dual care sunscreen is amazing i love the packagingsmall but cute. It is oil free Sunscreenso no stickness and second it has Hyaluronic acid in it which is really good and its lightweight beige color running liquid lotion is tinted. Its easy to apply and it doesnâ€™t feel sticky at all, my skin felt so moisturizing. It works as a make-up primer too. It is super hydrating because of hyaluronic acid in it. Love this sunscreen
