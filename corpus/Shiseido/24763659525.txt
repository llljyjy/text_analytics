So, the product is not sticky, it gives nice sun protection with no shining effect. Also it is pretty liquid so it’s easy to wear, especially if you used your daily moisturizer. As a nice bonus — it is water resistant and not greasy :)But it also gives paleness a little bit..I would say it’s perfect for summertime! Not greasy, gives paleness effect
