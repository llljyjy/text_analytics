I am not good at remembering to d a facial cream. So I waited to use this for nearly a full month. I have been pleasantly surprised. The day cream is light and gentle. Didn’t leave a weird residue and absorbed in without clogging pores. I love the results, it’s made my facial skin more vibrant and obviously less dry. Would highly recommend and plan on continuing use. Pleasant surprise
