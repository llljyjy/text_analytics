I received this serum to test and in return for an honest review and I was definitely intrigued. The bottle is very attractive looking. The smell of the serum was okay, not bad but not my favorite. The product applied nicely. I used it daily, sometimes twice daily. (I’m the worst at having an awesome night time routine) Although, I think it caused me to break out in acne, but I’m not sure if I can pin this on it because I did have to mask up at my job and I was under a great deal of stress. Overall, I would consider maybe purchasing this product in the future! I didn’t notice a huge difference, but I feel like most products have to be used continuously for months to see major results.
