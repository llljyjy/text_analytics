I received this for free in a voxbox. I am more of a matte finish girl in the summer so I havenâ€™t used this finish as much as the matte but I can say that I will repeatedly reach for this in the fall and winter. It has the right amount of hydration so that I can use it in place of my moisturizer. I am excited to use this when the weather cools down. I had been looking to start adding spf to my routine and this product does the trick. nan
