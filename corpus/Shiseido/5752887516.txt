I love the fact that this product has little to no fragrance to it a little bit goes a very long way with it. It definitely leaves my skin feeling very soft and gives me a really nice glow also when you apply make up on top of it it does look very good for the most part but as you wear it throughout the day it gave me a very heavy feeling on my skin that could also be due to the humid weather in Florida. I only use this product for about a week because I tend to always go back to my favorite moisturizer which is the Tatcha Dewey cream Fragrance Free Glow
