(I received a sample of this product in exchange for my honest review) Not sure if it’s just my skin but this gave me a dewy finish. it came in a cute bottle that was easy to squeeze. The standard quarter size application was enough to fully coat my entire face. it didn’t leave any white residue on my skin and didn’t have a weird smell. overall pretty good. nan
