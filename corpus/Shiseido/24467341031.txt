This moisturizer is one of the best ones Iâ€™ve tried so far. I have very dry skin during the winter and this helps keep my face very hydrated. The only thing is that this cream is thick and feels a lot like lotion at first, but it absorbs pretty quickly and leaves your skin super soft overnight. It also has a light floral scent which smells good. absorbs well
