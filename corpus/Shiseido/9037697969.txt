I’m a little split on the product. I loved how it made my skin plump, the product was so lightweight and mixed well with my moisturizer. However, it says it helps with dry spots but since I’ve started to use the product, I’ve devolved a dry patch between my brows and I can’t get rid of it now. I did learn after I had been using it that it works well with serums and I stopped using serums to prevent acne not knowing it boosts serums so that could’ve been the  issue that caused the dry spots. Overall the pros outweigh the cons for me. nan
