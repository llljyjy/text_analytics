No white cast but for me, it’s too heavy to use under makeup. It could be my routine but it just takes to long to dry down so my foundation gets cakey. I love it for my neck and chest. Personally, I love the scent and it seems to have a bit of glow so I really like it on neck and chest after moisturizer. I’d purchase again nan
