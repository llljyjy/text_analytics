I have very dry skin and this moisturizer has worked so well for me! I use it morning and night or after I get out of the shower. It’s great to have under make up as it prevents your skin from getting flaky and it’s SPF 20 which is also a huge plus. The moisturizer is gentle, has a light pleasant scent and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and healthy! I recommend giving it a try! Great product
