Rich yet light morning moisturizer. Absorbs well and I love the smell (it does have a light sunscreen smell though) and if Iâ€™m in a rush, I will skip primer. I have sensitive, acne prone skin and this is the second Shiseido cream that has been a winner for me. Rich yet light and absorbing (fresh smell)
