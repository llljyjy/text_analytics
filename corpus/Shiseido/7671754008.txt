Overall I think this is a good products.It absorbs well into the skin and doesn’t feel greay at all. I did notice my skin got brighter after a using it for a couple weeks. It’s harder to tell after only a month of use what else will improve on skin. Unfortunately, I did notice it has alcohol denat in the ingredients and that isn’t great for long term skin use so I will be using the rest off and on. If you’re not into using non tox products them I definitely recommend this one. Skin brightening
