I really enjoyed using this face sunscreen. It feels nice on the skin, is tinted, and makes your face look glowy and dewy. It might be too much for some people though. However, it is so small for the price! I think there are better alternatives, but if you have the money and want to splurge, go for it! good sunscreen
