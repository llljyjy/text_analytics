Great lightweight sunscreen for everyday use. It doesn’t leave your skin feeling oily, greasy or heavy feeling. Doesn’t clog your pores or make your skin break out. It does what it says it’s going to do. I highly recommend. I did receive mine as a gift for my honest opinion. This is my honest opinion. If I had an issue with it I would tell you. Great everyday sunscreen
