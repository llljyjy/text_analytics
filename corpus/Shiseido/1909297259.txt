I absolutely love this moisturizer. It has this combo of hydration and SPF, but without feeling greasy or heavy. There’s no white cast. It works well under makeup and gives that “glow from within” look. I use a hydrating silicone based foundation. I haven’t tried it with matte foundation so I can’t comment on that. It has a subtle scent. Definitely recommend this. nan
