I really liked this sunscreen. It didn’t leave a white cast and blended in well. It wasn’t greasy feeling and absorb into my skin. It worked great by itself or under makeup, mist importantly it didn’t make my eyes sting which typically happens with most facial sunscreens. It didn’t have an overpowering fragrance either. This will definitely become a staple in my morning skin routine. No white cast
