I’m in LOVE!! With my combination skin leaning more on the oily side, I’ve never tried a sunscreen that I actually liked and it didn’t make my face look like an oil slick. This actually was a nice moisturizer to use prior to using my primer then foundation. It’s great for use prior to makeup. It doesn’t affect makeup application at all, it actually helps due to the hyaluronic acid . My skin looks bright and less dull! I highly recommend this!! A must try!! Love this sunscreen!!
