Let me start by saying, I really wish this would have worked for me because now I have so much of it. First the fragrance is a little off putting to me, but I could have got past that. The texture is nice and creamy but when applied I felt like I had a layer of silicone on my face and I could literally scratch my face and would have a residue under my nails. I will not be using this and unfortunately would not recommend it. Not For Me
