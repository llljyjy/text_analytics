Before receiving this product my skin was dry due to the cold air and high heater in my house. Once I started using this I have seen a big change in my skin being more moisturizing and not getting dry as fast or much as before. The scent had a bit of alcohol but not too much where itâ€™s over bearing. As we also know, a little goes a long way! Glow like the sun but protected from the sun
