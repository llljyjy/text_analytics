*Received via Influenster complementary for reviewing purposes * I give this 2 stars because I don’t find it to be anything special. The scent is a little much for me, so after a while I couldn’t stand to use it any longer. That being said though, for a product that claims to make a difference so quickly, I just didn’t see it. I can’t say it’s a bad product, but I do feel there are much better options for a much lesser price. Influenster review
