I wanted to give this product an honest chance for a couple weeks of regular use before I would review it. To be honest I am not THAT amazed. It feels very luxurious to apply and has a nice scent that doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin but I must admit I do not see much of a difference in my skin. I’ve been applying it twice daily under my moisturizer morning and night and I don’t believe it is that moisturizing but it could also be that I have very dry skin especially in the Winter time.  I will continue to use it but I can’t speak for any anti-aging benefits as I think you do need stronger retinols/retinoids in order to see noticeable difference and that too over months at a time. Its a good serum to incorporate and I think there are those with certain skin types who would enjoy this, but maybe just not me. Overall not a bad product, just didn’t do much for me! I will continue to use it though and see if it can change my mind. Holy grail or interesting addition?
