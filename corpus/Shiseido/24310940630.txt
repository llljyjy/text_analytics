The thicker cream formula (swatch on right side) is great for people who need more moisturizing power especially for aging and mature skin! I can even double this up as a moisturizer on a busy day and the hyalulronic acid keeps my skin soft for most of the day. LOVE how my skin doesnâ€™t feel greasy nor leave a white cast afterwards and the sunscreen scent is very light. The new formulas for the sunscreen is AMAZING and I am excited to see future products from Shiseido. Thank you influenster and Shiseido for the opportunity to review! So moisturizing! PERFECT for dry skin folks
