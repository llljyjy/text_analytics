I am loving this SPF formula. The hyaluronic acid makes it very hydrating without feeling heavy or greasy. It dries down nicely without leaving a white cast and layers nicely under makeup. It does have a strong sunscreen smell when you first apply but I was really pleased that it fades once it dries. The packaging is really nice. It’s heavy, looks aesthetically pleasing, and feels expensive. I also really like that it comes with a little spatula so you don’t have to dip your fingers into the jar and it measures out the perfect amount to cover your face. The formula stands up to sweat without getting into your eyes or feeling like it’s melting off. This is perfect for an everyday SPF. I would definitely recommend this to my family and friends who are looking for a high quality SPF moisturizer. My new fave!
