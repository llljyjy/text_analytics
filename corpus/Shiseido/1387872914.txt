This serum adds a very nice boost of moisture to my skin without being heavy.  It absorbs really nicely and the smell is lovely.  I can’t give it 5 stars because other than moisturizing and smelling nice, I didn’t see any sort of amazing results.  Moisture always plumps fine lines but it is a temporary reaction.  I haven’t noticed any true diminishing in fine lines.  It does give a nice glow though.  For the price, I wish it did a little more.  That said, it is a very nice serum. Nice moisture and smells lovely
