I found it to be very lightweight and comfortable — not oily or thick like many other sunscreens. I really loved this as it is meant to wear under makeup. It felt great and didn’t leave a white cast! Not my favorite overall, but I really did like the lightness of it and the travel-friendly packaging! Great under makeup!
