I received Shiseido Urban Environment Fresh Moisture Sunscreen complimentary from Shiseido and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I use this now daily on my face before leaving the house. It’s very light and goes on easy, like you’d expect of a quality moisturizer.  I don’t layer anything above it, just wear it with mascara and love it.  My husband also likes it and my children have worn without and irritations.  Quality product!! Great moisturizer with sun protection!!
