It’s extremely watery and does leave a slight white cast at first which settles down but i think that depends on how much product you use. Overall it’s a great product, it doesn’t feel greasy on the skin and absorbs pretty rapidly, it has a serum like feeling to it. It leaves a dewy shine on the skin which is nice, and it’s a great base to put makeup on. Would give it a 5/5 if it weren’t for the slight white cast in the beginning of application. nan
