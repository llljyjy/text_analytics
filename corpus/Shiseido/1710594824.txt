BROKE MY UNPROBLEMATIC SKIN OUT! I never get pimples, I don’t get hormonal breakouts, I don’t ever have skin issues, other than an oily t-zone. I purchased this sunblock off a positive review from my baby sister. I used this sunblock & the next morning I had pimples forming under the skin. Along my jawline & above my top lip. I wasn’t completely positive that the sunblock caused this to happen so after the pimples healed, I tried the sunblock again a few weeks later & had the same reaction! I was horrified & I’ll never use it on my face again. nan
