I received this from Influenster & Shiseido in exchange for my honest review. It goes on beautifully and leaves a nice healthy glow. It’s thinner then most sunscreens, making it easy to apply. I did notice a slight white cast to it. It’s not as bad as others I tried though, and if wearing under makeup it won’t be noticable. It also did not breakout my sensitive skin. I love this and highly recommend. nan
