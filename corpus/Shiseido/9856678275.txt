very lightweight and pleasant scent (not strong). used it at night before moisturizer & my skin feels very supple the next morning after using this! I received this product complimentary for review purposes. Not confident I would buy it on my own due to how expensive it is, but if you’ve got the funds then I think it’s worth it! nan
