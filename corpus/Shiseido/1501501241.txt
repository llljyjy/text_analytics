Lightweight serum, good for layering other skincare or makeup products. Does have a light fragrant smell but not offensive to the nose. When compared to other serums Iâ€™ve used in the past I was not able to notice a significant improvement in skin/texture. Given the price point and lack of noticeable difference I would not personally purchase. Average
