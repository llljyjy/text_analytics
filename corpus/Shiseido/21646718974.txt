What I liked: this a thick, luxurious feeling productive where a little goes a long way.What I didn’t like: it smelled strongly of sunscreen but only has spf of 20. It also went on oily and then dried kinda chalky like a sunscreen.I think I would buy this product again if it had a higher spf but it wasn’t enough to put up with the sunscreen smell and feel. Smelled & felt like sunscreen with not enough spf
