I like the texture of this moisturizer a lot, super light but also creamy and feels good on my skin. There is a scent, but it’s not as strong as the SPF version. If I were to choose I’d go with this one and just add spf separately. My skin is going through some stuff bc of hormones, and it didn’t react poorly! Kind of tingles after anything right now, so maybe if you have realllly sensitive skin you might not like it.4.5/5 for scent and may cause irritation for sensitive skin! nan
