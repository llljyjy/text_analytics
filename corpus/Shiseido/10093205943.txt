personally really like shiseido products. I thinkbecause they use anti-acne + hydration forreducing signs of aging. I’ve been using newUltimune serum for 15 days so I’m quite new forthe product. (For your reference I’m 32 yearsold and always use shiseido sunscreen for myface). It smells amazing and truly boostsradiance on my skin since started using. I’lldefinitely continue using the product. (No filterused on the photos) Ultimune for Ultimate SkinCare
