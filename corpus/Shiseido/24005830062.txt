I have to wear sunscreen because I take a few medications that require I stay out of the sun. When Shiseido and Influenster asked if I’d take a look at a few of Shiseido’s Sunscreens I was very excited because this particular sunscreen not only has 45spf, it also has Hyaluronic Acid. Gone are the days when you have to decide or layer, Shiseido has taken care of it all. This formula is creamy and nice feeling when you put it on. I did the finger method where you put a stripe down each finger and apply it to different areas of your face and I felt like it was overkill, but I did not even feel the sun on me the day I tested this sunscreen and it was a sunny day at the Seashore. I recommend this sunscreen not because it is Shiseido, or because I received this from Influenster and the company. I believe you should get it because I’m switching to this brand of Sunscreen because my skin looks better AFTER I take it off and my Mother is having some very painful sun damage removed. I really believe that taking care of your skin now helps you when you are older and I love that I now have good sunscreen that won’t destroy my moisture barrier and will have me looking great. For better after sunscreen skin this is the best. Works amazing and so good for skin
