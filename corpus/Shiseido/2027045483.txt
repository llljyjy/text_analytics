This is a thicker cream consistency and really hydrating. I don’t think anyone oily or combo would love this one, but if you have dry skin it might be great for you! I didn’t notice a strong fragrance, and it didn’t irritate my skin. I did notice a very faint white cast but after the product absorbed for 3 minutes or so I didn’t notice it at all. Great—if you have dry skin!
