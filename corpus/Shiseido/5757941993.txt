I wear sunscreen as part of my daily regimen and was able to give full, honest feedback on this product although this review was incentivized. This sunscreen is very lightweight, which is probably my favorite thing about it. It also leaves your skin in a more hydrated and moisturized condition, making it comfortable for all day use. My cheeks tend to sunburn easily, so the efficacy of this product really proved itself during the times where I was outside for longer than usual and didn’t experience irritation to my face. I like that this product contains hyaluronic acid because there’s always room for skincare! I’d 100% recommend. nan
