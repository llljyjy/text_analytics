I received this product incentivized from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review. The product is thinner than I expected, kinda of watery. I have worn it alone and with make up. Leaves a distinct light white cast but can be warmed up some with bronzer. My skin was left looking dewy and feeling slightly tacky but its comfortable. The protection does seem to last all day with minimal exposure. I love when a good product is ocean/environment friendly. I will continue to use and share with friends my experience. @Shiseido #Shiseidosuncare HA sunscreen
