Compared to the oil-free version, I really did not like this sunscreen as much. It works fine as a sunscreen, but did leave my skin feeling greasy throughout the day. I already struggle with combination skin so I try hard to keep my face moistures but not with products that leave a greasy feel. I do appreciate the hyaluronic acid in this product, but I definitely don’t reach for it like I do the other, oil-free sunscreen. It also smelled more like a regular sunscreen than the oil-free kind. It’s okay, but I don’t think I would waste my money buying again. nan
