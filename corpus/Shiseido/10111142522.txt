I enjoyed wearing this product. It was unscented which I really liked. It left my face with a nice glow and I think it did a good job of protecting me from the sun. I did not wear any additional makeup over the product. What I didnâ€™t like about it was how runny and thin the product was out of the bottle. I prefer something a bit more creamy. nan
