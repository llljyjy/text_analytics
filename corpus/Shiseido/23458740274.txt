I received these products for free from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review. I have been using it for a few days and I already love it. My skin feels nice and refreshed after using it. I have sensitive skin and I was overjoyed that this product didn’t irritate my skin or cause any acne. My skin felt soft and healthy. I definitely feel like it’s already made a difference in my skin care routine. Love it!
