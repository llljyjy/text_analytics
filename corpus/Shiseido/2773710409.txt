I really like the texture of this product and love how easily it absorbs into your skin. I’ve used it for 3 weeks now and noticed it has helped even out my skin and some tightening. I have a lot of discoloration from previous acne issues and this has helped. However, while at first it feels super moisturizing on my face if I don’t put a heavy moisturizer after it can cause my skin to feel a little dry. I have very acne prone sensitive dry skin so if your skin is normal you might not feel any dryness. It hasn’t caused me to break out at all so that’s nice. I also didn’t love the smell I prefer unscented. I think the best perk of this is the evening out of my skin and fine lines. nan
