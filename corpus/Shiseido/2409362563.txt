This suncreen is white color, so I do need to spread it and massage it on my face a bit in order to not leaving a whitecast. It is still lightweight, and I like that it is pretty hydrating. The floral scent is pleasant, and it gives my skin a dewy finish. Compare to the Oil-Free version, I prefer the Oil-Free version more given I have oily, combination skin. I think for people with dry skin, this Fresh Moisture would be good. nan
