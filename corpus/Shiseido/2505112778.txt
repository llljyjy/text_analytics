I’ve always used Shiseido sunscreens, but this was my first time with this particular product. Wish it wasn’t so small, but otherwise, does its job, doesn’t make me break out, and feels nice when I smooth it on my skin. It’s liquid like and isn’t creamy which is great. Does not leave a white cast on my skin. GREAT PRODUCT
