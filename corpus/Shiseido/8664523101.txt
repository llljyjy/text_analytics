I personally absolutely love this product. It smells fantastic, and it leaves my skin feeling silky smooth before applying the other products in my skin care routine. I have noticed over time that this product is really helping to hydrate my skin. However, I understand that the price point might make it difficult for everyone to purchase this product. If you have the means to, I definitely think that it is worth it. I will say that the scent is quite strong, so if you are sensitive to fragrances this might not be the product for you. nan
