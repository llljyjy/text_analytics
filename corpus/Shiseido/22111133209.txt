Moist. Hate using that word SO MUCH but that’s all I hear in my head when I use this at night. It does have a powerful fragrance which I was terrified at first because I’ve always broken out worse with smelly schtuff but this has made my skin SO SOFT. I use my curology formula, this, and then a cream moisturizer to lock it in at night and my face is glowing when I wake up. Definitely recommend and want to thank influester for sending this my way to try. Will absolutely buy this myself I’m ~glowing~
