Sunscreen is very important to me. I usually ensure my SPF is in my lotion and foundation. Most facial SPF causes me to breakout or look greasy and rarely works well under foundation. This checked all the boxes! Foundation looked flawless, without sheen and did not clog my pores. A new must have for me! nan
