Love this spf I use it every morning before I leave the house. Its the perfect consistency not to thin or too thick. Leaves my face with a nice glow. At first my face broke out from using it but after a few days it stopped i have really Sensitive skin so i usually have to give it a week before I can judge if its gonna work for me or if my skin doesnt like it and is going to keep breaking out and with this i just had to let my skin adjust. Packaging is also reallh cute. Use daily
