I wanted to love this so bad. I bought it primarily for reapplication throughout the day. It moved makeup - didn’t matter if I blotted before or used setting powder + spray. It was also greasy even if used on bare face, and didn’t rub in well. It broke me out and never fully absorbed. I did wipe the stick clean with a wipe and all that every time I used it, but this product just wasn’t meant to be for me. it’s a no from me
