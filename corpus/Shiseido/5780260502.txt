Love love this moisturizer it’s so hydrating and not greasy. This cream has 20 spf which is great for day time use and it glides on like butter. I have combination skin but tends to get dry during the cold season this cream has helped me stay well hydrated. This product is a must try for the price and how cute it looks that’s a steal!! Must try!
