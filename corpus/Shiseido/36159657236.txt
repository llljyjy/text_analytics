Hands down by far the best everyday sunscreen on the market! It was light and creamy and blended in effortlessly without leaving me looking pasty and white. It has a subtle clean smell. Is safe for a day by the pool. It also is great for everyday wear as I wear it in my everyday skincare arsenal. Best sunscreen hands down!
