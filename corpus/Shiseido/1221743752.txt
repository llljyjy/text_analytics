I received this complimentary product from Influenster to try and give my opinion. I have been loving it! I have been looking for  moisturizer with sunscreen to add to my everyday routine.  This product is giving me what I was looking for.  I love that its lightweight, lightly scented and doesn’t leave my skin looking greasy. I apply it before my makeup and it doesn’t affect my makeup. This product doesn’t feel heavy or clog my pores. It does not leave a white cast so if I decide not to wear makeup its not noticeable.  Definitely will be purchasing this. Moisturizer with sunscreen
