First I would say it does its job. Protect my skin well in this hot and sunny weather. I like that it has no smell. The textture is like milk. It well absorbes in skin and leaves no residue, oils, or shine. Because it has Hyaluronic acic, so it help my skin to stay hydrated and feel soft. Definitely worth the money. New best suncreen
