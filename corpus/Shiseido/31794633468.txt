I love this primer! It does leave a bit of a white cast at first, but I put makeup on over it so it is not noticeable. I havenâ€™t worn a daily spf before this, because they always clogged my pores, but now I do because this is light! It keeps my skin smooth and my makeup on all day. New daily routine
