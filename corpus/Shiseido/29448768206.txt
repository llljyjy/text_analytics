This sunscreen is amazing.  I received for free from Influenster and is the best thing.  I wear sunscreen daily as I live in a warm weather all year long and this product worked great for me.  Using a sunscreen that provides skin care benefits for me is a great feature.  I take pride on caring for my skin.  Oil free is one of my favorite feature as I dont like my skin to feel sticky or oily.  Also hyaluronic acid ingredient is a huge hit.  My skin also felt moisturized.  It has no parabens that is also a great plus for me.  I do recommend trying this product.  I wish I would knew about it long ago. Great sunscreen
