I received this product from @influenster and @shiseido for free in exchange for my honest review. If you’re looking for a high moisture but low residue left behind sunscreen, you’ve found it! The Urban Environment Fresh Moisture sunscreen from Shiseido will leave your skin feeling hydrated while also offering you mega sun protection without the heavy goopy feeling finish. A little bit goes a long way and after about 3 hours in the sun, I am home with a perfectly unburned face. While on the more expensive side, I will certainly be purchasing this again because I just love how it left my face feeling. It’s light. It’s refreshing. It’s fabulousness in a sunblock! Heavy moisture, light finish!
