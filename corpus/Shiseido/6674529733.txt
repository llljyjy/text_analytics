I’ve been wanting to try more product from sheiseido. I have tried some of their products and I feel like they are more superior. in term of quality,  ingredients, packaging and result. The packaging is luxurious, it looks like elegant on the vanity. But what most important is what this serum can do to my skin. I am in my 30s and I take anti aging regimen seriously. This anti aging serum packs some powerful ingredients to reduce wrinkle, I don’t have a lot of wrinkle in my face just around the corner of my eyes (which is natural for my age). But I am looking for full hydration, I believe when you hydrate your skin well, it will significantly reduce the lines. For hydration, it is a good serum, it is easy to apply, and absorb well on the skin with no downtime. It does not have weird smell, just subtle very unnoticeable. I have combination, acne prone skin and this serum does not trigger any break out, which is great so I can continue to use it to achieve the promised result. I will definitely update for the result, which can take 3-4 weeks (the fastest) Good serum, safe for acne prone skin
