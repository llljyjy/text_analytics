I received a sample for review purposes. That being said, it’s so good I bought some for my mom. As usual, this brand delivers. My skin is left smooth and soft. I get worried when SPF is involved but there’s no pilling, white residue, or powdery feeling. It also isn’t sticky at all. If you wear this in the morning it will layer under makeup just fine!
