I feel like i already love this product because it keeps my skin moisturized while keeping me protected from the sun. The consistency melts into my skin effortlessly and works great under makeup. No caking or build up - I would recommend this protract to active people who find themselves outside for extended periods of time… it’s a necessity! I took one star because unfortunately i did notice minor agitation / breakouts :( but i guess that’s better than permanent skin damage - no!? Must!
