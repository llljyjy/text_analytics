I received this product for free from Influenster and Shiseido in return for my honest review.I really wanted to like this product, however I did not. I wouldn’t recommend this product to anyone with brown skin.Pros: Long-lasting. Seems to do the job advertised.Cons:— has the consistency of foundation- doesn’t easily absorb into the skin—doesn’t pair well with brown skin. Give your the look that have you a few shades too light makeup on. Shiseido
