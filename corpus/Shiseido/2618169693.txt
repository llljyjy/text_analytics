I have found one of my new favorite sunscreens to add daily to my skin care routine. It is a lightweight, oil-free, sunscreen that protects the skin against UV rays. It hydrates the skin and is also a face primer. I apply this sunscreen as the last step in my skincare routine and before I apply my makeup. It only takes little product to cover my entire face and neck. Most sunscreens have a slippery feel to it and it takes awhile before it absorbs into the skin but not with Shiseido. The smell isn’t overpowering either and it quickly absorbs into the skin and feels smooth. I’ve noticed since I’ve added this to my skin care routine and paring it with my porefessional primer my skin feels silky smooth and my makeup lasts all day without getting oily because with this Texas heat and humidity you always have to have a good sunscreen. A big plus for me is an spf with a 40+. I will definitely be buying more! Go to this summer
