This day cream is very interesting. It has a very pretty packaging, but at the same time a little misleading(?). It’s like a giant tub, but when you actually open it, it’s a smaller pink container inside, and it’s removable. You could look at it in a couple ways: 1, it’s easier to get out all of the product, 2, it would be a plus *IF* you can buy just a new smaller pink tub at a lower price (but if you can’t, it’s just kinda like huh), or 3, feels scheme-y cuz you think you’re getting more for your buck but really you’re not. At the end of the day, it’s up to you.As for the day cream itself, I think the SPF scent is too strong. I normally like my creams scented but the SPF scent is really not it for me. Having SPF in my cream is great, but I would rather use one that doesn’t have it if the SPF scent is too strong. When applying, the texture of the cream feels really light and airy, but once on my face, it feels a little tacky, like sunscreen…also not a feeling I like. I normally don’t wear make up, so I can’t really speak to layering of other products on top of this cream. Ultimately, I received this for free from Influenster for my honest review, and I still might just opt to give away the second one. I don’t think I can suck up the SPF scent unfortunately. And going back to the packaging, I think if I paid for the product, I would be a little upset, even though the size is clearly on the box. Smells and feels too much like SPF/sunscreen
