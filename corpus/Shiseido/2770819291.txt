This is the second Shiseido skincare product I’ve tried. I love using their facial cotton pads and I always wanted to try out their skincare line. The packaging of the Ultimune Power Infusing Concentrate is high end. A nicely weighted glass bottle and a pump top that can be kept and used in refill bottles. I really like the texture of this product. It’s lightweight and moisturizing and sinks right into the skin. It was very easy to incorporate this product into my skincare routine and I love the fact that it enhances the efficacy of other skincare products you use with it. Overall I’ve really enjoyed this concentrate and will definitely continue using it. Great product
