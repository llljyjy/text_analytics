Purchased for my mom. She loves it, says it feels great, very hydrating, and a little goes a long way. She’s been using this with the foaming cleanser and anti wrinkle eye cream by the same brand and finds this a good skin routine that’s giving her the results she wants, and not irritating her sensitive skin. good for sensitive skin
