I really saw results of this serum after a couple weeks of use. I was doubtful initially but continuous application I notice a huge difference in the overall look and feel of my skin. I am oily and acne prone so I love serums. The consistency is lightweight and doesn’t leave a residue. It’s great for layer under makeup, moisturizer and primer. A must try!
