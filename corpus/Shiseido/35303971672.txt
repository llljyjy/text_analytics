I received the Shiseido Ultimune Power Infusing Concentrate for free from @shiseido and @influenster in exchange for my honest review. This serum was pleasantly thin and smooth going on the skin. I love that it wasn’t sticky or tacky going on or after drying. It seemed pretty hydrating within itself but says you can apply before moisturizing so that’s also a plus. Since this is my first time using this product I can have only review the feel and application. I am anxious to see what the results of this product are after a couple of weeks though!#shiseidoskincare #ultimune #complimentary @influenster @shiseido nan
