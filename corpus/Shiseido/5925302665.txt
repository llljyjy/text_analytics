Was not expecting alot from this product however was pleasantly surprised that it did not break me out or cause my skin to burn or sting. I have sensitive skin and am always looking for products that will keep my skin protected, hydrated, and have no sticky residue. Only downside is that if you have perfume sensitivities this product may not be right for you. Good overall product. Disclaimer product was sent by #influenster but I truly would purchase myself when I run out! Overall good mild serum
