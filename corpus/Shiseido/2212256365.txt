At first I figured this was going to be just another facial sunscreen but after trying it out I found it felt more like a half-versionnof my moisturizer with the added benefit of terrific sunscreen. now I add it on after moisturizing my face and before applying makeup. because it’s oil free, I don’t breakout like regular sunscreen and it allows makeup to hold on without sliding around. nan
