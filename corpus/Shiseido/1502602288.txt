Everything about this formula was pleasing-  texture, no scent, and thankfully did not burn my eyes. Considering how much sunscreen I use I only wish there was more product in the bottle. However I can appreciate the quality. As a side note, it also wore very nicely under makeup. Bigger bottle please!
