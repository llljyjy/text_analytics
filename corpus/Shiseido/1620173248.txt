I was able to try this product for free with influenster through the essential energy voxbox! I’m loving this hydrating cream with moisturizer! It moisturizes but doesn’t leave your skin feeling too greasy it is very light weight and doesn’t burn my eyes or sting at all! I also have layered it under makeup and it doesn’t get clumpy. I would definitely recommend! Great moisturizer with spf
