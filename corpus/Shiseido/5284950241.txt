The product looks thick in the jar, but when I apply it on my face it feels soft and creamy. The product sinks into my skin nicely with no greasiness or residue. It has a slight sunscreen scent, but I don’t mind it and the smell doesn’t linger. I don’t think spf 20 is enough protection from the sun and I prefer to use a separate spf product. While this is a nice moisturizer, I think the product is too pricey and there are many more affordable cream options. nan
