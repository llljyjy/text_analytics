I hoped I would love this oil free spf because I’m always looking for something that’s easy on sensitive skin. This was okay but it left my skin with white cast. It was nicely moisturizing considering my skin can be rather dry but it did irritate my rosacea just a bit. I’m middle of the road on this. Middle of the Road SPF
