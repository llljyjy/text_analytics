It’s been a long winter, and the dry skin in my face has been a dead giveaway of that. I was so excited when I received my two full sized samples of this day cream through Influenster! First of all, the packaging is luxurious and I was impressed already. When I applied a small dab of lotion to my one cheek I immediately fell in love - it was smooth and creamy and left my face feeling like whipped butter met velvet. My dry skin was immediately cured! The lotion does have a heavy sunscreen scent to it, but I personally didn’t mind as it reminded me of the protection it was providing and the scent faded quickly - I only buy face cream with sun protection in it so I appreciated the SPF 20 this provides. I have been using this lotion for 7 days now and my skin has never been so radiant, hydrated, and happy! Happy skin!
