I’ve tried quite a few sunscreen sticks from supergoop to kbeauty and I enjoy this one most. The sunscreen itself is not sticky or greasy and rubs in easily to the skin. The sunscreen smell is very light, the stick is easy to clean after each use, goes on clear and no white cast, and the packaging is great (cap never comes off while being jostled in the bag and it feels luxe/has a nice weight to it lol). Also, this is one of the few sunscreen sticks that don’t completely MELT in the heat; I brought it to the beach with me all summer and it held up through the glaring heat. Best sunscreen stick
