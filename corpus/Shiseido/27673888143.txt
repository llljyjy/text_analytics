I recieved this product free from influencer in exchange for my honest review. Let me start by saying I have combination skin and my skin tends to be oily most of the time. Although this product still worked really well for me. I love the smell of it. It isnâ€™t scented like normal sunscreen it has a flower smell. There is no white cast at all from this product yet it is a thick consistency. It is a great uv protection and it also moisturizes your skin. It is a all around great sunscreen and I will continue to us it nan
