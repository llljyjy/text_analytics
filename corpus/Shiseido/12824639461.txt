I recieved this complimentary for reviewing purposes. I am loving this spf. it doesnt leave a white cast. It doesnâ€™t get in your eyes when swimming or sweating. I never really worn spf because no one ever told me the importance of it. I wear this every day. I apply it in the morning and afternoon. Over all its a great spf and I will be purchasing it when I run out. Love it
