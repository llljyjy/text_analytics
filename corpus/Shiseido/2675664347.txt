I love this eye cream! I used to use the benefiance wrinkle resist 24 eye cream until I was 32 and then it stopped getting rid of my wrinkles.. I tried 20 other eye creams and this is the best. It smoothes just under my eyes where I was getting wrinkles but I can only apply once a day. My eyes look really young! I donâ€™t apply on my lids like one of the other reviews said.. I hope this never gets discontinued! love this eye cream!
