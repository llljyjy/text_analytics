This moisturizer is game changer I am a real sub when it comes to SPS because they leave white streaky residue on your skin. Tend to not moisturize and donâ€™t always have the best smell this one is a game changer. I hope they continue to keep this on the market because it wears so well under my makeup or if I am just doing a natural look. I highly recommend this for someone with combination of oily skin and left my skin looking fresh flawless and rejuvenated Yes yes yessss
