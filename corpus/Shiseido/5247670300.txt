I can’t say enough good things about this cleanser. I’ve been using it for a few years now and I’m just as thrilled with it now as I was when I started. First, you use a pearl-sized amount which lathers up rich and REALLY cleans and refreshes your skin. Once it’s well rinsed and I’ve dried my skin, my skin looks bright and radiant. It’s improved my complexion in both the even tone and radiance of my skin and has eliminated my occasional pimples. My skin has improved so much that at 41 I wear sheerer foundation less frequently than I did at 35 and my skin looks just as nice. One aspect I LOVE about this product is that it removes everything really gently. I can have a full face of makeup, (including eye makeup), and at the end of the day, simply wash my face and it gets my makeup and the day’s oil and crud off of my face. It leaves it perfect. I am so surprised by the reviews that say it strips their skin and is over-drying. I have normal skin, somewhat sensitive and all I can say is that the scent is subtle, the formula is non-irritating even to remove eye makeup, (though be gentle), and following i up with a moisturizer is all I need. This is coming from someone who had skin problems all of her life. And it’s not that I’ve grown out of it as i learned when I forgot to pack this cleanser in vacation. I bought some other cleanser to tide me over for 4 days and my face was not thrilled with me by the time I returned home as was evident by the blemishes that had cropped up. It is a little pricey but you use so little I literally only have to buy 3 tubes or so per year so it works out. My previous cleansers were AMOREPACIFIC and Dermologica. I think this Shiseido cleanser is much better than both of those and have no intention of changing to anything else in the near future because it doesn’t just meet my expectations, it exceeds them. My skin continues to get better. At 41 years old, that’s rare. Exceeds Expectations and Delivers Beautiful Skin
