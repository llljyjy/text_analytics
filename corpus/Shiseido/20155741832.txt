I was in LOVE with the Essential Energy that they discontinued. This one makes my face feel dry but greasy and doesn’t do a thing for my complexion. And unlike the other moisturizer that smelled amazing, this one smells like dish soap. I used the whole bottle to give it a fair chance, but I won’t be buying it again. It’s like moisturizing with dish soap.
