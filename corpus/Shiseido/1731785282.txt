I will never stop raving about this product!! It is insanely hydrating, smells relaxing yet pretty at the same time, and does an awesome job at making your skin look better overall(I assume it’s due to the hyaluronic acid which everyone loves these days). This not so lil cream is actually my newest go-to nighttime staple and I’m never switching again. Holy grail! Girl, you NEED this!
