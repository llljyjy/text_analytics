I received this for free via influencer. I’ve been using it a few weeks and haven’t noticed a significant difference in my skin. Although I usually like to give skincare products at least a month before I form my final thoughts on it. I don’t like the added fragrance and I think this product may be breaking out my skin. Overall, I think you can put your money towards a better skincare item for $75. Not a necessary product
