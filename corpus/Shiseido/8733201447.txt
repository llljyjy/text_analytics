When I received this product, I wasn’t sure if it would hold up to what it promised. My skin is super hydrated, smoother, & firmer than when I started using it weeks ago. It wasn’t an instant change, but I definitely see results after about a week. Super lightweight on my skin and works well in conjunction with my other products in my routine. Super worth the hype. I would definitely buy this product for the price point. A new staple in my skin care routine! Love it! Interesting Product!
