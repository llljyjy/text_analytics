DISCLOSURE: I received this product FREE from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own. This sunscreen has a very light consistency, did not leave the skin feeling greasy, is lightly tinted so white cast faded quickly (on my fair/light skin), and layered well under makeup. Really felt weightless!However it made my skin very tight and dry after about 8 hours of wear. There were visible dry patches that were not there earlier in the day. It might be better suited for someone with oily skin, but it just didnâ€™t work out for my normal/dry skin. I appreciate Shiseido and Influenster for the opportunity to try it out and review! nan
