I love using this sunblock, I use it on my face first thing in the morning after skincare and before makeup. It’s dewy but not greasy on normal to dry skin. I love that it doesn’t leave a white cast or thick film on my skin. It’s light and barely fragranced. A joy to use. A little expensive but a little goes a long way I’ve seen. 9/10 I did receive this free for review from influenster. Great option for brown skin
