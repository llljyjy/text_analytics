My new fav sunscreen!!! It has HA so it can hydrate my screen but doesn’t leave a sticky or oil feeling. It’s liquid base so it absorbs very quickly and leave your skin smooth and nice. It’s light cream color that can use as light makeup if you work in office and doesn’t like to use foundation everyday. Make my pore looks smaller and I feel like I have a glass skin. nan
