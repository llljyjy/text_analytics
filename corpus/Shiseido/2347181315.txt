I received this product to review and it did not disappoint. I love that it is lightweight, has little to no scent and contains spf. Ive used it for the past week and it definitely moistures my skin. I also lovw that it comes with a small tool to aid in scooping out the recommended amount for daily use. Last but definitely not least, a small amount goes a long way. The size of the product is very generous. Definitely a great product
