I love how this product it’s oil-free and has hyaluronic acid in it, and it’s amazing!! It protects my skin with SPF 42 . I love the smell, makea you feel like you’re on the beach, it absorbs in my skin leaving it smooth, soft and my skin doesn’t produce any extra oils with it. Definitely one of the best sunscreens in the market.I received this products for free from @Influenster and @shiseido in exchange for my honest review. Amazing for my combination skin!
