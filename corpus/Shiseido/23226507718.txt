I could tell this was a good product, but not for all skin tones. If you’re fair-skinned or light/med with olive undertones, this may work well. I am light/med skinned with neutral skintones & this left a grey cast which enhanced fine lines & baby hairs on my face. A fair skinned friend tried it & it worked beautifully. Spreads easily, protects well, settles nicely on the skin, & works great under makeup. Only gave 3 stars because it won’t work for all skin tones. Not Made for All
