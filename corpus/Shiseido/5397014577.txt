I love shiseido products and their sunblocks. This oneis nice and like their others. I don’t love hyaluronic acid - however this does make your skin very hydrated throughout the day, more than the other sunblocks in this same line. The consistency is really nice and spreads evenly. The fragrance is light but pleasant. Overall I really like this sunblock but wouldn’t repurchase because of the hyaluronic acid. I would use one of their other similar ones. Really good sunblock
