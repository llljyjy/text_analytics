I love the look of the packaging this cream comes in but I hate using my fingers to get product out. I use a little spatula but if Iâ€™m in a rush and cant find it I skip the cream all together. Other than that complain I love this cream. my skin feels so soft. I use it in the morning only because when I wear makeup it looks flawless over it. nan
