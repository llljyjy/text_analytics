This sunscreen goes very well with makeup, as it is like a primer. Leaves skin smooth and even, absorbs quickly, no residue and has a very light consistency. Personally, I prefer the brandâ€™s Moisture Sunscreen since I love that it moisturizes while protecting the skin, but I definitely recommend this if you are a person who wears makeup daily nan
