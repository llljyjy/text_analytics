I was sent this product in exchange for my honest review and opinion and have not been paid for my review.I have been using this product daily after reviewing the other oil free version. While it is an amazing product something in this version causes my skin to have breakouts. Iâ€™m thinking based on how nice my normally dry patches feel this would be best for those with more dry skin. My daughter has been using this too since she has drier skin than me and her skin looks gorgeous. Great product just not my perfect option
