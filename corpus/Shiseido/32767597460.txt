I received this product for free from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review. I used this moisturizing spf on my face to work outside in my yard. I wanted to put it to the test. I was pleasantly surprised at how well it stayed on through sweat. It didn’t budge or run. It feels so nice and light on the skin, and I really like the fact that it has spf 42, and Hyaluronic Acid. It doesn’t have any scent which I also really liked. I felt like my face was protected from the sun, and the Hyaluronic Acid plumped the skin. I would recommend this product to those looking for a lightweight spf that will last a long time, and enjoy that it is waterproof. I will definitely buy it once my free tube is gone.
