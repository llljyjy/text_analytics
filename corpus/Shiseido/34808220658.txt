I love this sunscreen now! First time I used it was today, I wore it for 6+ hours (it was 88°F with 57% humidity) and it was soft on my skin, didn’t pill off my face as time went on, and you couldn’t see any white like with other sunscreens! I’m also pretty fair skinned tho, so take that as you will. I was skeptical about it bc I’ve tried another Sheshido sunscreen and it left white streaks all over my face no matter how much I rubbed it in or let it sit. I’m very satisfied with this product and I’ll definetly be buying more after this bottle! (I did not reapply through out the day as I left the bottle at home. I have dry to normal skin also) will be buying again!
