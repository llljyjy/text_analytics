I have been using this daily since I got my hands on it, along with the regular sunscreen version. I actually look forward to the sunscreen step of my skincare/makeup routine now, lol. Knowing this has a moisturizing element with hyaluronic acid, as well as a priming effect, its a truly unique and amazing addition to my routine. I always liked what Shiseido sunscreens offered in terms of skincare benefits, but always found the application portion a bit problematic(sometimes slightly drying which reveals texture, or slightly greasy and having my makeup slide around). This new version does neither. I think they got it right this time, and I really appreciate them being innovative and adding a primer effect in there as well. Ill definitely be back to repurchase :) LOVE it.
