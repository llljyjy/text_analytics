I have dry, sensitive skin, and it just drank this cream up! I loved the way it made my skin feel soft and also moisturized. I had no irritation, and it felt very soothing. I would absolutely purchase this day cream! This actually was the first item I have ever tried from Shiseido, and it did not disappoint! I highly recommend if you have normal to dry skin. Wonderful!
