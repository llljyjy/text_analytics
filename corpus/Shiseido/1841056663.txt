I couldn’t wait to try this Ultimune Power Infusing Serum from Shisheido.  First off, let’s talk about the packaging: the serum comes in a beautiful luxurious glass bottle. The nice thing is that this is refillable, you just hang onto the pump and cap, although the refills are still expensive, but it still cuts down on environmental waste.  The serum itself has a slightly milky, runny gel texture to it, but it blends easily into my skin and absorbs quickly.  It also has a nice perfume (citrus? floral?) scent, that’s not overpowering and doesn’t really linger.  The one thing I do want to point out is that, as alcohol is unfortunately one of the main ingredients, I could smell it as I was applying - just a faint smell.  Therefore I was not surprised that it seemed to be a little drying and tightened my skin.  Again, this is a serum, not a moisturizer, so I wouldn’t expect that this would be super hydrating,and it is a very lightweight serum that plays well with my moisturizer.  I haven’t noticed a profound difference as far as diminished wrinkles, but my complexion is more radiant and firm.  I’m on the fence with this serum, only because for it being high end there shouldn’t be alcohol in it. Nice But For The Alcohol
