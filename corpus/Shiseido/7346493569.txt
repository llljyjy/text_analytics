This moisturizer hydrates the skin without being greasy. I have normal skin with an oily T-zone and it does not feel super heavy. I love that it also has SPF in it. Of course I wear SPF on top but I like it when my morning moisturizer also has SPF in it. The texture is creamy and it sinks into the skin right away. It sits great under makeup and doesn’t pill. There is a slight scent but I don’t mind it, it dissipates after it sinks in. Overall a simple and great morning moisturizer. nan
