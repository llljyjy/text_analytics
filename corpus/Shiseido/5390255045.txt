Really awesome sunscreen. I recieved this free from influenster & used it immediately from the time I’ve received it since I live in the texas sun. I used this over the weekend at a splash pad with my kids and we didn’t get that dry skin feel after playing in water & the hot sun. All of us were left fresh & moisturized with ZERO sunburn, plus it didn’t leave a white cast like all the others do. Really nice. Highly recommend! Great sunscreen moisturizer
