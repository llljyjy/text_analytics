I like this one better than the one with spf. Very moisturizing and lasts a long time. I would like it if the packing for the hydrating day cream with spf 20 and this one (Hydrating cream) were different. The two are  identical packaging but the color of the cream and smell are a tad different. REALLY GOOD
