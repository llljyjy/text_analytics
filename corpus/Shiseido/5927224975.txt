I’ve been looking for a new sunscreen for summer that will moisturize my dry skin and not leave a white cast. So I was excited to receive the Shiseido urban environment oil-free with hyaluronic acid broad spectrum spf 42 for free from influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest opinion. First off, I was a little wary about using this because it’s a chemical sunscreen and I only use physical sunscreen’s so it won’t irritate my sensitive skin. I loved how product is small, making it perfect for putting in your purse. However, that’s about all I liked about it. It’s tinted, but somehow was too light for my neutral olive skin tone and left white cast on my face. It’s pretty watery as well and I found it difficult to blend into my skin. It was too matte for my liking, I like something more dewey. It also felt very drying on my already dry skin. I would not recommend this for anybody with dry, sensitive skin and a darker complexion. left a white cast
