This sunscreen is lightweight and absorbs fully into my skin. My skin feels nice and moisturized when I use this product, which is important to me as I get older and want to keep that youthful flow in my face. I love to use it under my makeup, but it’s also good for lazy days at home. I feel good about how I’m treating my skin! nan
