Shiseido’s Urban Environment Mineral Sunscreen and Primer needs improvement. The formula claims to be oil-free; however, the hyaluronic acid ingredient left my skin looking and feeling greasy. This may be suitable for those with dry skin, but I would recommend anyone with normal to oily skin to pass on Shisedo’s mineral sunscreen . nan
