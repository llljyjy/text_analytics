This is an all-in-one sunscreen, moisturizer, and hyaluronic so for me, I was able to use JUST this as a primer before my makeup. At night, I can use my other moisturizers. I plan on using this year-round because it is so light but keeps my skin protected from the sun all the same as the zinc. I have pretty sensitive skin and this didnâ€™t cause any sort of itchiness or breakouts - it was very gentle. And I love the pop of hot orange on the bottle. Sucker for subtle packaging details.
