The coverage on this is amazing but more of a summer dewy look. My face is sensitive due to my dermatomyositis which makes my skin/face red and reactive to the sun. I tested both with makeup as a primer and under a primer with makeup. And both looked good but the non oil version lays better under makeup. I have made this a staple and will continue to use. Product for opinion. Awesome coverage
