When I was growing up my mom couldn’t stress enough to moisturize your face everyday to help from getting wrinkles this is my first time to use this product it was nicely packaged I don’t think there’s one thing I dislike about it if I didn’t have face moisturizer I would use hand and body lotion. Probably not good for your face the hand and body lotion because after it went on it would dry and your face would feel dry this makes your face feel quenched that’s the only word I can think definitely would buy it again five stars Quenched
