A must-have! I have sensitive dry skin and this cream does wonders. Does not irritate skin. Absorbs well. Can be used under makeup (let dry first). Using it for many years along with shisheido cleanser, and just added “toner“ to the routine. Skin looks and feels great!! Worth the splurge. Daily Routine
