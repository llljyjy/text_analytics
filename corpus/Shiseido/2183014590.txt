I really loved how soft this made my skin feel. It also had a very light, but pleasant scent. I do have combination/oily skin though so this product was a bit heavy for me (especially during the summer months) . It did make my skin feel moisturized however I still prefer the lighter gel or water based hydrators since they are not as heavy. I would recommend this product for someone with a bit more dry skin. Great moisturizer!
