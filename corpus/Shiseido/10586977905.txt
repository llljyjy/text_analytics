I received this for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using this for about two weeks now and I love it. I am usually very pink (especially my cheeks and forehead) and this has definitely evened out my skin tone. I’ve noticed my skin is smoother and firmer. I haven’t had as many issues with undereye puffiness as I usually do. I love the feel and the scent of this serum too! nan
