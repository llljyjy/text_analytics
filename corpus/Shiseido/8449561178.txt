It smells really good . It left my skin feels very soft and it just looked smooth overall . I think this would be a better product if alcohol wasn’t one of the main ingredients. I don’t have sensitive skin but I do think that was part of why my skin felt more dry than usual . I try to stay away from products containing alcohol for my my skin . I got to try this thru Influenster and I’m glad I did not sure if I would purchase in the future . If you have more of oily skin this might work well for you . nan
