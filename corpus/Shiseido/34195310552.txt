(I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion) This is a decent mineral sunscreen. It doubles as a makeup primer so it’s good for us that wear makeup daily. It doesn’t do a bad job of protecting my skin.. However, this sunscreen is quite expensive even for a small amount. Sunscreen should be worn daily if you’re going out and this will get used up fairly quickly. I can get a sunscreen for half the price that is just as good. If you have the money for it, this would be a decent choice but I don’t see much of a difference between this and my usual SPF moisturizer. It's ok
