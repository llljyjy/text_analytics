I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Shiseido for testing purposes, and I can honestly say that it’s the best facial sunscreen I’ve ever used! I was in direct sunlight for over two hours today, and while using this sunscreen my face didn’t burn at all. Not one bit of redness. And though this product is considered “dewy”, it didn’t leave my face feeling greasy. Highly recommend! the best facial sunscreen!
