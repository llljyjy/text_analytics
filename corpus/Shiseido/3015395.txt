I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I loved this serum so much!  I have dry, acne prone skin, and expected this to break me out. instead,  I felt like this serum did a great job on adding that first step of hydration that my face really needed. it has a soft, spa like smell, that is typical of Shiseido products, but dissipates quickly.  the consistency is good for a serum, watery and smooth, and my skin drinks it up immensely.  afterwards , my face looked more supple and felt soft.  I liked that it didn’t cause my skin to breakout and my makeup didn’t pill. I would definitely consider buying this serum in the future, although the cost is quite steeper than I would prefer. I did think it was worth it since less is more and i didn’t feel like I needed a ton to smooth on like other serums I have used. Smooth and hydrating
