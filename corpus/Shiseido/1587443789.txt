I don’t often use sunscreen products unless I am indirectly in the sun. I brought this along with my most recent trip and it definitely was a highlight because I didn’t have to worry too much about some damage. But the formulation of consistency is definitely lighter than the previous ones that I have tried. It also does not leave a very milky white OutKast especially when taking photos. I would say give this formulation a try if you were trying to find your staple sunscreen. Smooth Finish & no cloudy whitecast
