this cream has become my go to if I’m stepping outside. my skin is on the sensitive side and all though this has a slight sunscreen smell to it it hasn’t shown any signs of causing me to breakout ( thus far i have been using this cream for three months.) use this sparingly a little goes a long way it can feel a bit heavy when first applying, it’ll take a while to soak into your skin. I apply this after letting   the oils i use sink in then go in with this as my last step. worthy enough to come review it
