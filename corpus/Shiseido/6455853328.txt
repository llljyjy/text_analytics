I wanted to wait until I had really had a chance to get in the groove of using this serum before reviewing this product. I have been pretty dedicated to applying my serum morning and night. I do it right after a fresh face wash and follow it up with either a toner spray or a moisturizer. I love how it feels and the light, floral scent. More importantly, I can confidently say that I absolutely see a brighter, smoother look to my skin. This product makes my skin feel so much softer and more youthful. Highly recommend this product yâ€™all. Bright and youthful
