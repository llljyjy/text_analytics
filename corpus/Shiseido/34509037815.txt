I was thrilled to get the opportunity to try (free for testing purposes) this day cream with hyaluronic acid as I’ve never used it. So far, I’m loving this cream, it’s moisturizing and I can already see any lines that I had starting to disappear. The smell is light and not something that smells so strongly that you smell it all day. I love that it feels light on my skin but has SPF so I’m protected! I’m very pleased with the value and my results so far! I will be continuing to use it! Great Cream!
