I love Shiseido Urban Environment Fresh-Moisture Broad spectrum spf 42 sunscreen. As I applied it I noticed it was very smooth and creamy. My skin felt very soft after applying it. I didn’t have any leftover residue although my skin did look a little shiny , but as it absorbed that went away. I did notice the smell is similar to other sunscreens I have used but this one is just a hint of scent and not overpowering. I usually use spf50 but Shiseido spf42 did just as good. I live in south west Florida so sunscreen is a must have and Shiseido Urban Environment is my new favorite sunscreen! Shiseido upped the sunscreen “Game”
