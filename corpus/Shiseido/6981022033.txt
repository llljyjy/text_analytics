I received this complementary from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. I truly like this product however I do have a complaint… my only complaint is that there is zero information on the bottle about what this product is supposed to do for you… does it help with wrinkles or fine lines? Is it just for moisture? Either way. I have used this product every night for about two weeks now and have noticed that my face is much more soft! I love the fast absorption and light scent. It feels nice on the skin and I do love how smooth my skin feels the next morning. The packaging is also beautiful. Overall, I do recommend this product! They just need to add some information about what this product does to the bottle! nan
