It is extremely light and non-greasy. I like that it has a sun protection factor of 42 and is water resistant. It’s oil-free but still moisturizing. It swiftly seeps into the skin. It appears coloured at first glance, but it is not and does not stain skin. It doesn’t have a particularly strong odor. It contains hyaluronic acid, which is beneficial. I adore the fact that it is environmentally friendly. Love it
