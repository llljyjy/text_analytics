I received this complimentary from Influenster. I like the packaging, but wish there was a spot to store the spatula. The product smells good and is a silky, hydrating formula. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated, but not greasy. I like this cream better than the day cream with SPF. It caused my makeup to pill, but this one is great for night. nan
