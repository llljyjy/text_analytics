I give this product 5 stars! I highly recommend this product and will be making a purchase. Pros: Lightweight almost weightless feel. No skin irritations and or breakouts. Dries Matte and not greasy at all.Cons: Being melaninated the white cast it leaves is irritating bit thankfully it doesnâ€™t last long. nan
