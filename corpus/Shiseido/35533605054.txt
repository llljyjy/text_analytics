An ideal finish for makeup preparation. Light matte with a bit of a CC function for a fair complexion. I was aware this is not a sweat proof or water proof formula but I was shocked to see the suggested reapplication timeframe was 40 minutes. I’m afraid it isn’t well suited to my needs but I remain a fan of the brand. A little disappointing
