I like the consistency of the product, and the way it made my skin feel after applying it. Unfortunately, I did have a white cast on my face after application. The cast cleared once I applied additional moisturizer on top. Throughout the day my skin had a subtle glow. I like the fact that it is formulated without ingredients that clog pores; however I did have a breakout after a couple of days of use. Not the best formula for acne-prone skin.
