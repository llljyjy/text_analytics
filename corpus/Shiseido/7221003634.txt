I received this sunscreen as part of the complimentary Shiseido Sunscreen VoxBox in exchange for an honest review, and man, I could not be happier with it. It’s not greasy, it’s not heavy, and it totally follows through on its promise - my skin feels so moisturized after using it! It’s like a bonus layer of moisture with the added bonus of sun protection. Love this sunscreen!
