This sunscreen seems to be a great option for those with normal to dry skin.  I only used it on my face, and would not spend the money to use on my whole body, as it is kind of pricey. It is light and creamy, and feels very moisturizerizing. Personally, it was too much moisture for my oily (sometimes combination) skin.  It absorbed well, and felt nice at first, but then my face would get extral oily.  It did protect my skin from the sun, and I did not get any sunburns the several times I wore it to baseball games. Good moisturizerizing option
