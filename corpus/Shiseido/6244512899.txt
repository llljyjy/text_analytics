This sunscreen could be a 5 star if only they came out with a tinted formula, even if it was a pink or peach tint. The texture though, is so amazing. I have never seen a mineral sunscreen glide so well without getting blotchy and it is not oily or greasy! I tone it down my putting some foundation on with a cushion sponge. Oh and unlike others, I love the scent of shiseido, I wish it was available in a perfume. nan
