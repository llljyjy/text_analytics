I’ve used this product for a couple of weeks now, it’s truly a wonderful product. My skin is very soft and looks better than ever. During this season I usually get dry patches on my face, since using the serum I haven’t had that issue, I apply it in the morning and before bed. It’s great for sensitive skin, little to none as far as scent goes. I definitely recommend to add into your skincare routine. Fountain of youth
