Really enjoyed this sunscreen. It was lightweight, not sticky  and did not have a strong fragrance. It has a slight glowy tint but nothing that is noticeable besides a nice glow fresh look to the skin. Perfect by itself or under sunscreen. I would not say this is waterproof though so I wouldnâ€™t recommend it for a beach or lake day. great everyday sunscreen
