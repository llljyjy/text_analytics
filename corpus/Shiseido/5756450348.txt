I received this product from Influenster for review. For the most part I like this cream. I use it at night after I cleanse and tone my face.  It doesn’t feel oily or too thick. It absorbs quickly and leaves my face feeling hydrated and soft throughout the day. My only issue with it is that the SPF smell is very strong. It doesn’t linger but I do not love the scent. Nice moisturizer, strong SPF scent
