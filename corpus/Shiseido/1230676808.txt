This cream does what it claims. I saw a difference after two weeks of use 6-7 times a week related to moisture replenishment, suppleness, smoothing and lessening of fine lines, and an overall glow and improvement in texture. Because it is a heavy duty moisturizer, I use this at night only - it does have a mild floral scent but it doesn’t bother me. It does come with a small spatula for application - and a little goes a VERY long way. While it is not cheap by any means, it’s very clear it will last me for some time, which makes repurchase an easy decision, especially since it works. My skin is sensitive and trying different products is always a calculated risk but this caused me no problems at all - Highly recommended. Excellent! Does what it claims!
