Shiseido lightweight sunscreen. Oil free sunscreen lotion that I’ve been using more than 15 years and I will never change this brand because it makes my skin feels like my second skin it hydrates and doesn’t make it greasy or heavy. Good for oily skin! Incentivized! I got it from Influenster to get my honest review! Perfect for oily skin!
