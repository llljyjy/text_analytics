I received this serum for free from Influnenster & Sephora in exchange for my review. It was just okay for me. It did give my skin a nice glow. It feels nice on application and a little goes a very long way. However once “absorbed“ for me if left a “tacky“ feeling on my face which I am not a fan of. Definitely wouldn’t use again. Didn’t work well for me. It's just okay
