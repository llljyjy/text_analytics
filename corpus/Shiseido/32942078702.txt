I was looking forward to trying this sunscreen because I am trying to take better care of my skin and have heard great things about Shiseido products. I started using this about a month ago. I was surprised at the watery nature of this sunscreen. After applying it my face felt greasy. I ended up wiping it off. I thought maybe it was an off day. Next time I used I made sure to shake it up really good but again the water consistency is-not my favorite. And I didn’t like how it felt on my face but I left it on and have used it pretty often to get a better review.  I definitely didn’t get a sunburn on my face but the wateriness and greasy feeling has left me unimpressed with this sunscreen. It also doesn’t smell bad or good. I wouldn’t purchase this. nan
