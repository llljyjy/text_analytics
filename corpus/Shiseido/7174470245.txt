My favorite cotton pads for a couple years now, can rub my whole face without the cotton pilling or bits coming apart. Only eh is you have to be somewhat careful separating them or you could easily break into the individual sheets (ive always caught it before one is ruined and have been able to separate it in the correct spot). Really like how soft these are. (Can be found cheaper at a TJMax!!!!) soft & no pilling
