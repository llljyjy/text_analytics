This product was gifted to me in exchange for my honest review. I am new to this brand, Shiseido. I do like this formula. It feels light on my skin and my skin is starting to have a more radiant tone. I do have sensitive skin but this product hasn’t bothered my skin since I’ve been using it. The packaging is very pretty too! I will continue to use this product on my journey to reduce fine lines on my forehead. Beautiful Product!
