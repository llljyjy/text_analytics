At first, I was a bit concerned when I saw the product coming out of the bottle very thick. But once I started spreading it onto my skin, the sunscreen was very light! It felt moisturizing on my skin & it did not feel tight. Wearing this sunscreen throughout the day, I did not get oily nor did it feel heavy on my skin after a while. I would definitely be purchasing this again when the time comes! nan
