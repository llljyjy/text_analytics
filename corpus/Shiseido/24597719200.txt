I’ve been using this for a few weeks now after receiving it in my Influenster box and I really love it. It has that classic Shiseido scent (a bit floral but not over powering) and it moisturizes nicely without being greasy. It’s been my go to day cream since it arrived. Such a consistent brand with great products so I’m not surprised I love it! love this day cream!
