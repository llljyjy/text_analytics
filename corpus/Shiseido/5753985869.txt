I am loving this sunscreen. I typically have to be careful about what sunscreen products I use because I have sensitive dry skin. Typically sunscreens, even on top of all of my usual skin care, irritate my skin or cause breakouts. This sunscreen is light, hydrating and sits beautifully on the skin, rather than pilling as some other facial sunscreens have done.  There is a slight scent but it is very light, and fades quickly so it does not irritate my allergies. I definitely recommend this, especially for fair girls like me. Great for sensitive dry skin
