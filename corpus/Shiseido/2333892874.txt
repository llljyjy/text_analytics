Phenomenal product! The packaging and actual product just ooze luxury. The serum is lightweight and has a nice faint grape smell, absorbs well and is not greasy. I have been using this for a few weeks and have definitely noticed an improvement in my skin texture and forehead lines. It is a high price point but in my eyes, your skin is worth it. nan
