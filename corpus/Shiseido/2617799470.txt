I’ve been a longtime shiseido fan and have previously used their sunscreen so I was very excited to get the opportunity to review this new sunscreen as well. I took it overseas with me to a very hot dry climate and it performed beautifully. No white cast, didn’t burn my eyes and didn’t clog my pores as some other popular sunscreens tend to do. The subtle tint gave my skin a soft glow without the greasiness. It’s a win! I enjoyed it
