At first, I really didn’t like it. It left a lasting white cast and it just didn’t do well layers, with skincare or makeup. I gave it a few more chances and now I like it a bit more. I wouldn’t purchase it but I will use the rest of it. The product is extremely liquidity which I kind of like but it does leave a white cast. You have to have a lot of time in between layering for it to work well. It also enhances all my dry spots. I would only use it for a no makeup day nan
