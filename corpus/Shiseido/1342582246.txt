I was given this product to test for my honest review and let me say I loved this product. It  is amazing, it was absolutely moisturizing on my skin. I have dry combination skin and live in a desert and this will be a holy grail. There a generous amount in the jar and it even comes with a small applicator so that you donâ€™t have to dip fingers in it. I highly recommend trying it and it comes with SPF! Amazing!
