I received this sunscreen free from influenster and shiseido in exchange for my honest review!I love this product! I have combination skin and It looks great under makeup or just on your skin. It doesn’t leave a white cast on my face and felt really nice on the skin! it doesn’t feel oily or break my face out, I wore it under my makeup in 90 degree weather and my makeup looked so good all day and I didn’t burn at all, and when I wore it without makeup it gives a beautiful glow, I really enjoy using it, I will be purchasing when I run out! nan
