I was sent this product from influenster in a mini size version. this is the best mineral sunscreen i’ve ever used. there’s absolutely no smell, and isn’t greasy at all. i wouldn’t know it was even on my skin. if you can afford the price i would definitely purchase. i haven’t tested however how it lays over makeup.
