I have dry skin and this Shiseido Fresh Moisture Sunscreen was perfect for me. It has a faint pleasant scent . The formula looks and feels like a gentle moisturizer. It spreads easily without making my skin greasy nor does it leave a white cast .it works well even when I skip my moisturizer. It doesnâ€™t cling to my dry patches and spreads evenly . Definitely a good product. Hydrating
