I was lucky enough to test this product out, and I was so excited to see what this product was all about. First, the packaging is so nice. I love it. It feels luxurious. I love that it’s a pump, all you need is two pumps for your whole entire face. A little bit goes a long way. The serum is hydrating and isn’t sticky or greasy feeling (which can be the case with some serums). Im so glad I was able to test this out. I am going to continue to use this to see if it’ll make my skin brighter. Lovely!
