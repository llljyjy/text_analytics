This is my new favorite sunscreen. It is an ultra hydrating 2-in-1 moisturizer and SPF. I love how this feels, and that it doesnâ€™t smell like sunscreen! There is little to no white cast. It honestly blends into the skin very quickly and nicely. I have combination skin and it does not feel oily to me at all. I used this for a little over a week and noticed hydrated skin, no sunburns and no break outs.Overall I would recommend. All Day Protection and Shine!
