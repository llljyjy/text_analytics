Been using this cream since I received from my Voxbox #influentser Not gonna lie, this is replacing my Tatcha dewy skin moisturizer! I find my skin absorb the product nicely, it’s rich but doesn’t leave a slippery residue, been wearing good with my base makeup!! I can see myself wearing this cream even until the sticky NYC summer!! Very impressed!! CREAM FOR ALL SEASONS!
