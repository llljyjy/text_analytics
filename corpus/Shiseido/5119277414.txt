My favorite new addition to my skin care routine. Most thicker moisturizers break me out but this one’s doesn’t do that. My skin feels like so soft. The spf is for sure a plus. The one thing I don’t like is that it smells like sunscreen but the smells starts to dissipate when you start rubbing it in. I got this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. nan
