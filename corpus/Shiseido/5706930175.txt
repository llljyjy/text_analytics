I’ve been using this moisturizer for a couple of weeks now and I absolutely love it! I was worried because I have sensitive, acne prone skin, but this has been great! It feels heavy enough that it moisturizes my skin throughout the winter months and I’m excited to see how it holds up in the summer when I typically use a gel based moisturizer. The spf is an added bonus for this one! It only has a very slight sunscreen smell to it but nothing unbearable. It layers well under makeup which is a must for me! I definitely would repurchase and absolutely recommend this product! amazing moisturizer
