So I have been using this for about two weeks and I definitely could say this is a potent serum that works! I am 36 years old and have been using serums since I turned 30 and have tried different ones from cheap to luxury serums. The past two weeks Ive been using it, I had noticed that I never had a dry skin day which I would always have especially during the winter. It made my skin feeling plump, healthy, and my pores were diminished. Note that I used this with a retinol serum to balance the dryness retinol could give your skin, this balanced everything out for me and kept dryness and irritation at bay. Like my skin wasn’t turning red or dry and I know it’s because of this serum that I had just added to my routine. Texture is also very nice and easy to spread (not too thin or thick). tha packaging feels luxurious and pump dispenses the right amount of product. Plump and Healthy skin!
