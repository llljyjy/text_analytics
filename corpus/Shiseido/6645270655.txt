I absolutely love the texture of this moisturizer. It’s whipped and light. There is a light sunscreen smell to it, but it’s not over powering. It does a good job of moisturizing but will leave you dewy which gets oily throughout the day. Would recommend for drier skin types and not so much for oily/combo skin. nan
