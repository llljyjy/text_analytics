I received this free from Shiseido. I used it for about 3 weeks & I didnâ€™t notice any reduction with fine lines or wrinkles.This is a heavy moisturizer so a little goes a long way. It absorbs into the skin fast & leaves skin silky smooth & moisturized.It works great as a face primer before foundation since it has Dimethicone in it which reduces the appearance of pores and leaves the skin smooth for a nice base. The fragrance is a subtle earthy smell. The hyaluronic Acid ingredients are at the bottom of the ingredient list which means there is not a lot of it in the formula. Great for Makeup prep!
