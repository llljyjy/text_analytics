As with their oil-free sunscreens, this one is awesome.It absorbs quickly, is very lightweight, not overly scented and honestly, considering this isn’t oil-free it really doesn’t feel greasy at all to me. It fully absorbed just like a moisturizer. It’s been great under my makeup and has helped out with the little dry patches I get in certain areas.Again, this may be a little pricey for some people but a little goes a long way. If you have issues with other sunscreens being to heavy or greasy on your face and neck, I’d definitely suggest this one or their oil-free version. I also love that they’re ocean safe! This one’s coming on vacation with me! Such a great sunscreen!
