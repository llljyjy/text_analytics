I love that it’s a moisturizer and sunscreen all in one. So no need for two products. It has a nice smell to it. It smells nice not off-putting. It’s hydrating and best part it leaves that very light dewy finish. This was provided to me for free by Shiseido and Influenster but my opinions are my own.Honestly, I highly recommend you try this! Especially if you love Moisturizers and then also love Sunscreen. It’s even great just as a moisturizer! I will definitely be purchasing this in the future. #shiseidosuncare #complimentary @shiseido @Influenster Great moisturizer plus it has sunscreen!
