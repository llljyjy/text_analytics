I really like this sun screen. I love that it has hyaluronic acid as one of the ingredients as this is a very moisturizing ingredient. I also like how it leaves a nice non greasy finish on my skin, it’s nice and lightweight. It didn’t burn my skin or make my eyes sting either, which is great. I do wish it was more that 40 minutes of water resistants because that is not very long, as more sunscreens are 80 minutes of water resistants. Good moisturizing sunscreen
