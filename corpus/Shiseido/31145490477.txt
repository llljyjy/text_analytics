I’ve been looking for a convenient SPF to reapply during the day when I’m out on the river. This is my new go-to! So convenient whether I’m out fishing or even just around the house. Even my husband (who is picky about SPFs and tends not to wear any because they can feel greasy) double checks that we’ve packed it before we head out for the day. I find it does have a strong smell, but it’s pleasant in my opinion. New Go-To SPF
