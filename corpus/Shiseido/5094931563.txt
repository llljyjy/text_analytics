I received this as a complimentary gift from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I use this Fresh-Moisture on days that aren’t too humid to keep the moisture locked in. I wear this after my serums and under my makeup. It has a slightly thicker consistency of a lotion, it smells like a sunscreen with the initial application but goes away within seconds. Doesn’t leave a white cast. It can also be used under makeup as a primer. I love that it has an SPF 42 since I’m fair and burn easily. Very good product. Definitely a future purchase! Does what it says!
