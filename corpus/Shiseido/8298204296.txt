Thank you Influenster for the complimentary products to review for my honest opinion, I would say this sunscreen is a good sunscreen but not the very best , it works well with makeup and other skincare but be aware that it may burn your eyes if anything comes into contact with! I’ve tried many sunscreens before as they are an essential part of my skincare system and protection against the suns harmful rays. I do recommend this for the arms hands and body but not very good for near the eye area! So maybe forehead and cheeks. The scent of this is light so it’s not bothersome and works well with sensitive skin. I’ve tried other sunscreens that I prefer over this particular one. 6/10
