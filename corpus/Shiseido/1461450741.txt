Really enjoy this serum. There’s a light herbal smell which is enjoyable, not overpowering. I enjoy the packaging as it is very heavy and the pump works to provide the proper amount easily. The chrome parts do get a little dirty from fingerprints. The serum itself has certainly helped to add moisture to my dry skin,hydrated skin does appear more plump and radiant. Overall I’m very happy with this product. The only caveat is the price, however the ingredients add to the higher price. Lovely texture
