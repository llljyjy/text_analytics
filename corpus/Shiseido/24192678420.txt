I received this product complementary from influenster for testing purposes and have to say that I like it. If you have dry skin you will love this. Doesn’t leave white marks and doesn’t pill. It’s a great moisturizing formula. I detect so e fragrance hence star off because I prefer my skincare fragrance free but if you don’t mind it this one is great. Very good and moisturizing formula
