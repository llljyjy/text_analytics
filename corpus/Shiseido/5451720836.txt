I used to have combo skin but lately with it being winter my skin has been so dry it’s been peeling. So I started searching for new products to try to help fix it esp since it’s not cute when you’re wearing makeup and you think you look good but then pass a mirror is in shock how horrible you look with part of your face peeling writhing makeup on which makes it even more noticeable. My review may not be as accurate since I am trying other products with this at the same time. I’ve used this product for about 2/3 days now and like it so far. It has a slight sunscreen smell but in a good way. It’s a very light weight cream and absorbs very quickly. Does not feel heavy on the face at all. Since it’s only spf20 I do use another sunscreen on top to be safe (water based sunscreen). And it works well together. It’s helped with my peeling and my face looks “softer”. I’m going to use this a little longer and see how it works and by then I should be able to give a better review. Good news is also that I haven’t broke out with this even tho I have sensitive skin. nan
