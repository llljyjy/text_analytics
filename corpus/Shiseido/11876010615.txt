This is my first time trying a Shiseido product. First off, the packaging looks high end. It comes in a beautiful glass bottle. The directions suggest applying 2 pumps of serum after cleansing face in the morning and evening. I have naturally oily skin so I started out with one pump in the mornings and 2 at night as I was worried I’d look too dewy. The serum itself does have a light floral fragrance to it. I’ve been using this product for a few weeks now and I honestly can tell a difference in my skin. My skin doesn’t necessarily feel “stonger“ as suggested from product description but it does look more hydrated and feels more fresh and young. I’ve tried different serums but none have had the same effect as this. The 50 mLbottle itself will probably last about 1.5-2 months. I would recommend this serum. Now it is a bit pricey but I would highly consider buying this myself especially if a sale is going on. Great serum
