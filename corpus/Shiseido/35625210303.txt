I wasn’t  bothered by an overwhelming scent as some users noted, but I did feel this specific product was pretty oily, so I didn’t use it on my face.  I live in Arizona, and after wearing this in the sun for about 30 minutes, there was some residual oil pilling after getting warm.  Even though I like the smoothness of this one, I’d probably enjoy the oil-free version more.  With the small size of 1.8 oz and corresponding price point, I wouldn’t purchase this product with all things considered. Pleasant, but passing.
