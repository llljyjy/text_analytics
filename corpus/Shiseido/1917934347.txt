I really love the soft smell this product has, it feels very moisturizing but also pretty thick. 4 out of five because you definitely will need to wash your hands after use because it leaves like that weird gritty feel on your hands otherwise, I’m excited to see how my skin does with it. Will it be a staple in my skincare routine? I’m not sure if I’ll switch it out for my tried and true. Other than that the packaging is cute. First impression review
