*I would like to start out by saying that this is a chemical sunscreen containing avobenzone, so please do your research when it comes to products containing this ingredient. Avobenzone on its own breaks down under UV light in 30 minutes, so additional stabilizers are needed to make it last longer and these can cause acne or other skin sensitivities. I personally do not use chemical sunscreens as my skin is very sensitive and they always irritate me. I only use physical sunscreens. I gave this product to my 58 year old aunt to try and this is her review.*I liked the jar this day cream came in.  It’s red, easy to open and there is actually a tab that you can lift in order to remove the container that holds the cream, right out of the jar.  Not 100% sure what the purpose of doing that would be but I’ve not noticed that feature on other jars from competitors, so thought it was worth mentioning.The first thing I noticed upon opening the jar was the light and pleasant fragrance.   Not too strong or “perfumie” but enough to notice it and enjoy it. It doesn’t last during the day so if someone is sensitive to the smell, I don’t think this would be a problem. The cream is lightweight and absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy feeling. Having oily skin (in the T-zone) I don’t enjoy using serums, oils or greasy feeling products. This product had none of that.I’ve been using the product daily for about 10 days – on my face and neck. Happy to see it contains SPF 20 Sunscreen! My skin definitely feels smoother after applying. In terms of the Hyaluronic Acid and that working to “plump up” the lines (mainly on my neck), I wasn’t blown away by the results. Didn’t notice much of a difference. This product is a good moisturizer so if that is the main goal (perhaps during the winter months when skin is often drier) then this would be a good product to use. I would purchase this product but again, only as a moisturizer, not to diminish lines around my eyes or neck. Double Review
