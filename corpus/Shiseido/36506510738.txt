Disclaimer: incentivized. I waited until I’ve used it multiple times to write a review. I love this product so much! I’ve never used Shiseido products before, so it was really fun to experiment with this. Pros: spreads easily. It’s very liquidy so a drop goes along way. The hyaluoronic acid makes my skin feel soft and glowy. It doesn’t give off a big white tint like other sunscreens, but it does have a *tiny* bit- which I don’t mind since I’m not getting photographed daily. Big pro is that I have not broken out with using this! Cons: can’t think of anything! Love this product, highly recommend. Awesome sunscreen!
