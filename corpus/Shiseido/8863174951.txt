I think this will be a great sunscreen choice for dry skin, and in particular those looking to avoid a white cast.Shiseido formulated this with chemical filters, which is inherently a GOOD thing for deeper skin tones. However, if you are sensitive to certain chemical filters (as I am), make sure to check the filters used. They are very clearly printed on the box as required within the US: Avobenzone 2.3%, Homosalate 10%, Octisalate 5%, Octocrylene 5%In addition, this product contains fragrance, making it a formula that is enjoyable to use. However, again, may not be a perfect fit for those with sensitive skin.As is always the case, the best sunscreen is the one you will use, so if this works for you, it is indeed nice to see a well-formulated and enjoyable sunscreen! No white cast, but check for allergens
