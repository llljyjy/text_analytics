Applied smoothly and is great for everyday wear! I love the packaging and how it comes with a tiny spoon to get the product out. However, if I wanted to change anything, I would add a pump dispenser for cleanliness. Very light smell with a tiny bit of fragrance. Overall, I would recommend this product and purchase again! My mom also enjoys it and will be buying her a jar! nan
