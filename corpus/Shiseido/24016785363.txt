Shiseido went above & beyond with this serum. I have tried a few different serums this past year trying to find a good one to add to my facial routine & this one by far takes the cake. Packaging is super cute & says it will boost radiance in just 3 daysâ€¦ it does!! Definitely leaves my skin feeling super hydrated, soft and glowing. I use it both morning & night. 2 little pumps is all you need so it will last a while and is definitely worth the price. I got my glow back!!
