This sunscreen is a little heavier than I prefer for my face normally. It’s a little heavy and has a definite sunscreen scent. It does absorb quickly and performs beautifully under makeup. There’s no white cast which is a huge bonus.  I’ll continue to wear it and would likely purchase again. Good sunscreen
