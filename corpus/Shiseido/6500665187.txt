I’ve been using this for a couple days now and I’ve noticed some interesting elements. I do LOVE the texture of the cream. It is really easy to put on and not thick or sticky. I just really don’t like that it’s a moisturizer and the second ingredient after water is alcohol. Alcohol is known to dry out the skin even more so I can only imagine what this would be like after a long period of time. It also has an alcohol scent that is not fun to smell while putting it on your face. Ehhh questionable
