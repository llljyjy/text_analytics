I, like many people with dark skin, have had a fair share of experiences with horrible white cast and grey skin from sunscreen. This is probably my new favorite sunscreen. I have sensitive, acne prone skin and have not had any breakouts or irritation from this sunscreen. I liked the supergoop unseen sunscreen as well, but i found it to be too heavy on the skin and made my makeup slippery. This one is very similar but much more lightweight. It’s slightly dewy and wears well under makeup. I do like the convenience of the stick, but it does transfer makeup when you put it on over top, which i honestly expected. While the price point is rather high compared to drugstore sunscreens, I think it’s worth it bc it’s still relatively cheap compared to other sunscreens found at sephora, and im sure this will last for a long time. Great SPF 50 coverage and super convenient. Sunscreen for people who hate sunscreen
