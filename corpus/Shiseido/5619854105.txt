I really enjoyed incorporating this product into my skin care routine. This serum is of a thicker consistency than other serums I’ve tried. I have combination skin so this product has worked well on me. It gives you a perfect base to add moisture into the skin. 9/10. The only thing I am not a fan of is the bottle. I do like that it has a pump. If you’re looking for something good and expen$ive, this is it. nan
