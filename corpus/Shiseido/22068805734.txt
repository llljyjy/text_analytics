Shiseido cosmetics has never disappointed me. And Shiseido Urban Environment Oil-Free Mineral Sunscreen Broad-Spectrum SPF 42 is too. When applying the cream on my face, i feel silky. The texture is creamy and super light. It doesn’t make my face looks oily or greasy, and not burn my eyes as some sunscreens I used before. I’m so pleased with this product. Definitely will buy this product again. Great sunscreen
