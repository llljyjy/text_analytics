I actually really enjoy this product. First let’s talk packaging. It’s amazing. It’s so nice and it has a great pump.  Even the box was good. Now product - amazing. It doesn’t have a terrible scent and it applies great. It leaves my skin feeling awesome. It’s a staple in my routine. I gave it 4 stars because I have not seen a difference yet and it can be drying if too much applied.  Otherwise great product. I received this free and complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. nan
