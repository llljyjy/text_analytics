I am very picky about my sunscreens and typically I stick with my tried and true. However this sunscreen has changed my mind and quickly replaced my other favorites. It can be messy to apply because it is fairly runny but I love the finish and I don’t find it hard to apply makeup over the product. I haven’t used my other sunscreen in weeks because this has become my favorite sunscreen especially on no makeup days because it helps keep my skin from looking too oily or sweaty. I highly recommend this sunscreen!
