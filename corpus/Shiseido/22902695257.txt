I was super excited about receiving a bottle of Sun Dual Care Tech Sunscreen from @influenster and @shiseido in exchange for my honest opinion! I’m a big fan of their original Urban Environment collection, so this sounded perfect to meINGREDIENTS-spirulina energy essence-hyaluronic acid-4.9% titanium dioxide -13.6% zinc oxide-does contain fragrance and alcoholNOTES-this is a completely mineral sunscreen! -the alcohol/fragrance are quite low on the ingredients list, so it didn’t actually bother my skin-has a white cast (which is expected from mineral sunscreens), but it was okay on my paler skin -it’s very lightweight and watery-it’s quite matte, which isn’t my preferred finish but for some people I know isOverall, this is a great sunscreen! It’s a bit pricy, I know, but sunscreen is something that I’m willing to splurge on. Shiseido sunscreens have always been my favorite! nan
