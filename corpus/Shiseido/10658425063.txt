I have been using it for a little over a week now. It only takes one pump to cover my face and neck, I mistakenly used three pumps the first time and quickly realized a little goes a long way. It’s slightly sticky on my hands, but absorbs quickly. I don’t know if it’s because of the short time, but I didn’t notice any results. I will continue using it. I’m not sure
