Shiseido always hits the mark on their products, specifically their sun care products. I’ve been using their sunscreens for a while now but this was my first time in trying the urban environment mineral sunscreen. It looks tinted when it first comes out of the bottle but as you rub it on, it cleanly illuminated my face and felt like it disappeared. It didn’t leave my face feeling oily, nor did it feel heavy on my skin. I would wear this sunscreen daily. What more can you ask!
