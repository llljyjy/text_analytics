The product is lightweight and not oily which is great because I sweat a lot. It absorbed pretty quickly and held good coverage while I was sunbathing. I also tested it on my arms. It was definitely effective since only the one spot on my arm that I missed got sunburnt. The scent was not the obvious sunscreen scent, but there is a mild scent to it. nan
