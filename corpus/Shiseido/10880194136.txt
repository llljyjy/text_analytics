I loved their hydrating cream with SPF, and this is pretty similar to that one. It just doesn’t have SPF in it. The packaging is environmentally friendly, and you can buy refill pods and save on plastic waste. This moisturizer melts like butter into the skin leaving skin supple and hydrated. It feels light and does not cause greasiness at all. Plus, it’s great for my sensitive skin. nan
