I received these products free from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review.  The first two things I noticed was the SPF 42 and that it contains Hyaluronic Acid.  It absorbs into the skin quickly, but does leave a slight white cast so it may not be good for those with darker skin tones.  My real issue with this product is the ingredients. This product would not be good for someone with acne prone or sensitive skin due to the ingredients. Octisalate is a well known skin irritant and it’s listed as an active ingredient. Therefore this will not be going on my face for those reasons, plus it has a pretty strong sunscreen scent from the chemical ingredients. I feel like the Hyaluronic Acid is not necessary and makes it appear a bit gimicky. It’s in so many skincare ingredients that I don’t see a real need for it in sunscreen. It needs better ingredients.
