This sunscreen was shockingly very liquid. I tried to get a photo of how it comes out on my hand as an idea. First let me say what I liked: definitely didn’t get a sunburn the days I wore this. It made my skin feel very soft. It didn’t smell bad. Now what I don’t love: it leaves a white cast on my skin. Now I’m very fair skinned so I can only imagine it being more noticeable the darker your skin. The white cast also emphasized how dry my skin is. I got this for free in exchange for an honest review. Liquid but soft?
