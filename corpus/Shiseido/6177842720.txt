I liked this sunscreen a lot for my face and will continue to use it. It is moisturizing without the oily or tacky texture. Also, it does have the typical sunscreen scent but is not as strong. I also like how it gives my skin a healthy glow. Honestly, I do not know if I would repurchase this, but so far both my face and I are liking it. nan
