So I received the Day Cream 20SPF version of this and fell in love. This hydrating cream though is like the icing on the cake after a long day when I top it on some retinol.  It smells nice and subtle and goes on so smooth. Itâ€™s a really nice consistency - not too thick but thick enough to feel moisturized. I wake up the next morning super hydrated - 10/10 ok LOVE
