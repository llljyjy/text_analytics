I usually hate wearing sunscreen. i have tried pretty much every brand out there. but they are all really thick or greasy feeling and the smell is always very unpleasant. but this sunscreen while it does go on a little thick it soon melts into the skin and you forget you are even wearing it, not to mention there is no unpleasant smell, no white cast and the best part is that it doesnâ€™t drip down and get into my eyes like every other chemical sunscreen. now that I have discovered this wonderful sunscreen i will be able to finally protect my skin for the sun I am very happy and I definitely recommend everyone tries it and I will forever repurchase! #shiseidosuncare @shiseido.usa Best sunscreen I have ever used
