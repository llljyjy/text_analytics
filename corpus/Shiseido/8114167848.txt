I received this product in exchange for an honest review. I am in my mid 30s with fair, rosacea prone skin. I find that I have to bear with sunscreen breaking me out through the summer months especially.This formula is great: as soon as I  received it, I put it on my face, neck, and decolletage and went on a 5 mile run.I returned without any burn! Definitely 5 stars! Great sunscreen!
