Shiseido Urban Environment Oil-Free Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 42It’s Oil-free and lightweight formula applies on the skin like a dream.  I absolutely love that it’s a water resistant sunscreen with hyaluronic acid to aid in hydration with a matte finish. Applies like a dream, leaves your skin so smooth, matte, and protected from the sun and pollution. It also does well under the make up and doesn’t make your skin look caked on with product. I would suggest Reapplying after 40 minutes, especially if in water or sweating.  Also, I’d like to touch in the sizing, I feel it’s the perfect size bottle and very convenient verses the big bulky sunscreens.  10/10 I would definitely recommend. Sunscreen Goddess
