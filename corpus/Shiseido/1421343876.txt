This is one of the best serums I’ve ever used. I’ve always been a fan of Shiseido and this serum is no exception. The smell is really light and when it sits on on skin it doesn’t feel heavy and feels really hydrating. I’ve been using this for a few weeks now and I’ve noticed my skin definitely looks more supple and nice. I’ll be making this a staple in my skincare routine for sure. Amazing serum
