okay I LOVE shiseido and this product was just as good as I thought it would be. my skin is combination but gets very dry in my t-zone over winter.. I struggle to find moisturizers and creams that do enough to soften my skin, but don’t make my face greasy. this stuff is incredible and makes my skin look good, even on the days I don’t wear makeup! a must try, along with their foundation. 10/10! obsessed
