The sunscreen is not for the face.  It will sting, especially if you go in the water.  For the body, ok, but too expensive, and I have found better for less.  It will leave a film, which is fine if you are going into the water,  not so much otherwise. I really donâ€™t like is how thin and drippy it is coming out.  Plus the top will flip open, not a secure closure.  Smaller size better twist close. nan
