I received this from influenster in exchange for my honest review. I really liked this sunscreen! The SPF is 42, it has hyaluronic acid in it, feels a little greasy at first, but once fully absorbed my skin feels great which is a bonus. There are a couple of things that I didn’t like. I’m not crazy about the smell and I really hate that it’s not sweat proof. When I’m wearing this and I start to sweat, my skin gets slimy. This does not leave a white cast on my skin either which is great! If this were sweat proof, I’d definitely buy it. Very moisturizing
