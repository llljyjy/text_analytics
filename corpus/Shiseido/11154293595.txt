I received a sample of this serum free from Influenster to test. Its packaging is fantastic - the container feels heavy and expensive. The product inside, however, was just like any standard serum. While I enjoy that it isn’t heavily fragranced & it feels light on the skin, it just isn’t remarkable. Its definitely a morning, noon, and night type of serum because of how light it feels. I wasn’t blown away - I wouldn’t change up my skincare routine to include it, especially not with how pricy it is! Nothing Special
