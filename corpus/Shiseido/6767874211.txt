First of all, I have the oiliest of skin. So my biggest fear when I use sunscreen is that my face is going to be oily and slick. Not so with this. The most important thing is that you have to let it dry on your face before putting anything else on top of it. Some people said that it causes pilling. That happens if you donâ€™t let it dry first. I put it on top of a clean face. Wait two minutes. Then put on any other kind of primer if you choose. Then I put on powder or foundation. And then bronzer or blush. There you go. It lasts all day and makes your skin look nice. Most important of all, it is protective. Must have!
