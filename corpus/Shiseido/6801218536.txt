Thank you Influenster for sending me this free product in exchange for my honest review. Wow! I LOVE this stuff! I normally never wore sunscreen on my face unless I went to the beach or out by the pool but ever since I received this from Influenster, I’ve been wearing it everyday! I was scared it was going to be sticky on my face but it’s NOT! It doesn’t feel sticky, if anything it feels smooth and dries down normal on your face. I love how it’s tinted to cover some of my redness. It also doesn’t leave that sunscreen smell on your face either! I’m so glad I received this, I know sunscreen is important to wear especially during spring and summer time, since I received it from influenster, I’d thought I’d give sunscreen another chance. This is the best, I’ll continue to wear with and/or without my makeup. Shiseido Urban Environment Oil-Free SPF 42
