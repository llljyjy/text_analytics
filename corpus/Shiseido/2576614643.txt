This is a really great hydrating serum, you can really notice a difference in your skin and the bottle is gorgeous. All of the ingredients are great, but I would reccomend they come out with a fragrance free version. As over time fragrance can be very irritating to your skin. All in all highly reccomend. Beautiful, elegant serum
