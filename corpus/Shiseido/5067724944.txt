I received this product for free from @influenster and @shiseido in exchange for my honest review.  Urban Environment Fresh-Moisture Sunscreen SPF 42:  This sunscreen is good for dry, combo, and normal skin. I wouldn’t recommend for oily skin. This product has hyaluronic acid, is fast absorbing, protect against UVA/UVB rays and is free of oxybenzone & oxtinoxate. This formula is lightweight and very moisturizing. It leaves the skin looking very radiant and dewy. Only a little is needed and spreads nicely without leaving a white cast. The fragrance is light and not over powering. I love that this sunscreen has added skincare benefits.  This is my first time trying this brand and I am impressed. The sunscreen is comfortable and non-irritating. I like how a little goes a long way and the scent isn’t overpowering. My favorite thing is the added skincare benefits not just protection from the sun. I adore the orange and pink summer colors on the packaging.I would recommend! Lightweight and Dewy
