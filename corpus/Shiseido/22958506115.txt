*I received this product from Influenster and shisedo for free for my honest review*This was my first time trying a Shiseido product and I was happily surprised! I liked the fact that this sunscreen didn’t leave a sticky feeling and quickly absorbed into the skin. I find most sunscreens you can feel after applying and I can’t stand that feeling on my skin. No white cast, pleasant scent and very easy to apply. Highly recommend this sunscreen! nan
