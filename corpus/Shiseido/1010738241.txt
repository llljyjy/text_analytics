I was provided with a sample to try from #influencer. I love that there is no fragrance to this sunscreen. It mixes nicely with the shaker all, and applies easily with my fingertips. I did feel this was too greasy for my liking and left a white cast. I will likely give to my fianc√© to use as I prefer my ilia serum with sunscreen. It does seem very gentle so I will try on my son who has very sensitive skin. nan
