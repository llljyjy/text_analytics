I recieved this product for free from Influenster and Shiseido for my honest review.I think we are all used to cream or lotion-based SPF, but this is neither of those! This is very much like a liquid-powder formula. When I say liquid, I mean very watery, which can take a little more concentration for placement, but once you get it all rubbed in it feels very soft on your skin. It doesn’t feel greasy, but it also isn’t drying (though matte). At first, it looks like it has a white-cast, but that disappears after a minute. With a broad spectrum SPF of 42, this is a must for your face. Different!
