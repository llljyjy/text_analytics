Overall this is a great moisturizer! Iâ€™m just getting into skin care and this moisturizer has really made a difference with how my skin feels, especially right now with all the crazy weather winter can bring. My only complaint is it makes my t-zone feel oily after use, which is an area I already struggle with when it comes to oil. Super moisturizing!
