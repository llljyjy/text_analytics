I received this product free to test from influenster. I was excited to try this product, as I was in the market for a new serum. I have a lot of acne scarring as well as hyperpigmentation that I was hoping to improve, but this product has not helped. It claims to make skin more radiant in 3 days, but it’s been about 3 weeks of daily use and I don’t see a difference in my skin at all. I will keep using it and update the review if necessary, but I do not think this is worth the extremely expensive price tag. The bottle is gorgeous and looks beautiful but absolutely not worth it. Too pricey
