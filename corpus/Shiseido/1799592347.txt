Overall, I really like Shiseido’s Hydrating Cream. Just like their day cream version with SPF, it’s an ultra rich and thick consistency that doesn’t clog pores - you can literally flip the container upside down and none will drop out! The packaging is a tad bulky but beautiful, and I’ve just learned that the basin is removable so that you can purchase discounted refill cream packs as a means to cut down on plastic waste! Reusable packaging is a feature that I wish more products would adopt - very cool and they should absolutely highlight this more on the packaging!! Unfortunately, though, Sephora does not appear to offer the refill packs but hopefully they will soon as they are available elsewhere.The hyaluronic acid is especially hydrating overnight and has kept my skin soothed! As far as negative review goes: while I appreciate that Shiseido has made 2 versions of this Hydrating Cream (with and without SPF), I really wish they would’ve differentiated more between these packagings. They’re the exact same color/shape/size with just the tiny font marking the difference —it’s especially hard to figure out which to grab for those of us who rely on glasses but obviously take them off for skincare lol. Nonetheless after using for a couple of weeks I would recommend this product. Love It But Could Use Some Packaging Tweaks
