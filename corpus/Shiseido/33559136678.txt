I love Shiseido products, but this one especially. Not only is it a great sunscreen, it’s an excellent moisturize too! I try to wear sunscreen often. This one Works great! Excellent consistency that isn’t greasy at all. It applies easily & Absorbs really well. I like to use this as my moisturizer before applying foundation for the day! It wears well & doesn’t cause creasing or separation when wearing with makeup. It works just as good with nothing else, wearing as just a sunscreen/moisturizer. It leaves my skin feeling silky smooth & this product does as promises & works really well. The hyaluronic acid helps keep my skin plump & firm! Super cute & appealing packaging, easy to use & very important, great consistency (not greasy) & very it has a pleasant scent that isn’t overpowering! I absolutely highly recommend that everyone try this brand/product & especially for the sunscreen protection this Summer! Your skin will thank you! Great Brand & Another Hit/Great Product!
