Trying out this product I received through Influenster for around a week and feel like it has improved mainly the tone and possibly the texture of my skin. The consistency of the product feels luxurious to apply and doesnâ€™t seem to irritate my sensitive skin. I was worried there would be a strong smell as is often associated with high end skincare but found that was not the case at all. The only con if anything is it might be a bit drying & I need to be double moisturizing during use in these particularly cold dry winter months. The bottle itself is extremely high end and luxe looking & feeling and the amount of product needed means this serum will last you a long time. Overall not sure how drastic of an improvement this will make but it will certainly provide you with a nice glow. Glow Getter
