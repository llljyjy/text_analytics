The product melted into my skin beautifully to create a dewy and hydrated appearance after each use. I used it both as a day and night cream and before applying foundation as a primer. As someone with dry skin, its difficult to find facial creams that really hydrate my skin., but this one worked beautifully. I have been using the product for about 3 weeks and have noticed my skin is more radiant and moisturized. nan
