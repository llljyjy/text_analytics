The first thing I noticed about this facial cream is the SPF! I don’t see that often and need to get better about applying it so I love that it already has it! Convenient and time-saving. The scent is very light and so is the cream. It absorbs quickly and feels light. Makeup over it isn’t an issue. The hyaluronic acid helps to retain moisture. My face doesn’t feel dry by the end of the day and isn’t too oily! SPF!
