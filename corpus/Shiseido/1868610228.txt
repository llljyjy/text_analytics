I really enjoy this moisturizer. It’s a great option for daily use by itself or under makeup. This will be my go to all summer! There’s no heaviness and it’s not greasy like some SPF. It’s lightly scented but the scent doesn’t linger. Feels moisturizing but light on my skin. Received complementary from influenster. Great summer option for daily SPF
