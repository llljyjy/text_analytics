I have used the Shiseido Urban Environment moisturizing sunscreen for many years. It was just recently discontinued and this is the replacement. I am relieved to say I like it. As someone with dry, sensitive skin, it’s very hard to find a separate SPF that doesn’t irritate my skin, or make it feel like the moisture is being depleted from it. Gone is the white-cast from its former formula. I think there is more moisture in this formula and I will caution anyone with oily or combo skin that the finish is very shiny. Now, with that said, there are many alternatives for oily and combo skin when it comes to SPF, but not so much for those of us with dry skin, so it’s a relief to see Shiseido has made the choice to continue to create for us. I started using this when it already heated up outside and I am finding that I can get away with just a serum underneath and no additional moisturizer is needed. In the winter this may change. So at this price point I am very pleased to see a product actually pulling a double as a true moisturizer and working SPF. I use around my eyes and on eyelids without issue but have rubbed my eyes and it has caused light stinging hours after application. But this was from my own doing and I’ve been more cognizant about dragging the product into my eyes. Overall, I am pleased and have purchased a second tube. I left off one star because I only wish it had an spf of 50. It wears comfortably and once dried down I don’t feel it on my skin. Very comfortable and no weird fragrance lingering afterward.
