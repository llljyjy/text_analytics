I wish I knew about this serum sooner! It’s so hydrating, smooth, and cooling when you massage it into your face. A little goes along way it’s not like those serums that dry down fast and you have to keep applying. I think that’s what I love most about this serum! Is the fact that it doesn’t dry down and make your face feel stiff it wakes me up it feels so refreshing I’m Obsessed. nan
