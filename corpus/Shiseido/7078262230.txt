I received this from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This stuff is awesome! A little goes a long way with this product. It’s a little thinner than other sunscreen I’ve used, but I think that’s why I like it. It went on a little white like normal sunscreen, but went away quickly once it was rubbed it. It made my skin feel soft without making it feel greasy. As far as primer it worked VERY well and didn’t make my make up cake up. Great for use alone or as a primer
