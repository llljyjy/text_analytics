It’s okay, it has a gel cream consistency which I love, the spf one has a thick cream consistency that was harder for skin to absorb. This one melts in and leaves the skin soft smooth and shines. It does have a little bit of an oil shine after. Its lightly floral fragrances but it hasn’t made my skin break out or get a red rash yet. I like it. It's pretty good
