I feel oily when I apply it initially but later it helps me keep my skin hydrated for whole day . I just apply shiseido moisture sunscreen and some finishing powder for my daily routine. I love it coz it acts as moisturizer, sun screen and primer . My skin feels so good at end of the day .In addition it had hydraulic acid. Highly I recommend for summer Good one
