I love this sunscreen. I usually have an issue with sunscreen getting into my eyes after several hours. This sunscreen stays in place on the skin. I also feel that since using it my dark marks are starting to fade. I think that is a result of some other products I am using however, I do think this sunscreen  prevents my hyperpigmentation and dark marks from darkening and promotes a more even skin tone overall.   Application is easy, and the formula adds a light reflecting shine that I love because it makes the skin look alive and healthy. If you like a matte finish this sunscreen is not for you. My go-to sunscreen!
