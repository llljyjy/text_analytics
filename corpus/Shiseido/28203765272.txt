I received this product free from influenster. The consistency of this product completely turns me off. It’s extremely liquidy which makes it a nuisance to apply. It also makes for a huge mess if you don’t get the lid on perfectly and lay the product on its side. I love the ingredients and what the product stands for, but it doesn’t mesh with my skin. It’s very white when applied and once absorbed, it leaves my skin with a purple tint - so it cannot be worn alone. However, under makeup I felt like it made my foundation streaky and it felt like I was wearing a second layer on my skin. nan
