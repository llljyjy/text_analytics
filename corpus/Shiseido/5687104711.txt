This was so soft, I wore it under my makeup which made my makeup look smooth. I didnt notice much of a difference with it protecting my skin from the sun. My skin didnt look oily like most sunscreens do. It has a matte finish and did not leave a white residue. I would recommend this for anyone who regularly uses sunscreen. Great sunscreen
