I really enjoy this moisturizer. It has a really light feel, but it seems to do a great job of adding moisture to my skin without feeling greasy, heavy or sticky. The inclusion of SPF is really important to me, so thatâ€™s a huge plus. I would highly recommend for a daily moisturizer! Light moisturizer with SPF
