Received complimentary from Influenster and Sephora so I was excited to try something other then my Goop. This has a tint to see where you can apply and I had to really pack it on my shoulders for my hike. I did finish pink but didnâ€™t burn. Minimal smell and no skin irritation. Used under makeup made my skin super dry/matte. solid choice
