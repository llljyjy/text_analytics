The Shiseido Urban Environment Fresh Moisture Sunscreen SPF 42 feels very high end! The texture is very perfectly creamy like a lotion but you can definitely tell it’s not a cheap formula just by the texture of it. I like the simple tube packaging that just flips open. I like that it’s more than just SPF 30, even though I’ve heard it doesn’t make much difference after 30. It does leave a bit of a dewy finish and smells lightly of sunscreen but not exactly your typical sunscreen scent. I’m SO glad it doesn’t have a big flowery scent like most Shiseido products have! My skin doesn’t feel dehydrated or anything by the end of the day either so it’s certainly not drying like some SPF can be. It also doesn’t pill under any foundation I’ve tried, which is a huge plus. I’ve been using it daily for over a month and have no complaints. I’m not too concerned about the urban environment advertising for this product though. Overall it’s a very cosmetically elegant formulation. Fantastic texture!
