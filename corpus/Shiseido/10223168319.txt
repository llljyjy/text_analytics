I really wanted to try it religiously before giving my review and let me tell you guys I am inloveee with it! First of all the packaging is beyond beautiful! I love how thick and creamy the formula is but yet so light weight on the skin. I can say I’ve noticed a difference in my pores for sure as they have minimized. I have fairly sensitive skin and this product isn’t harsh it didn’t leave any redness. It’s the perfect day cream because it has SPF 20. It also has  purified and micronized hyaluronic acid some of the benefits of HA include anti-aging; anti-wrinkle and moisturizing it also has ginseng root extract which has been proven to reducing fine lines and wrinkles it banishing dullness also reducing redness. I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for an honest review Go to day cream
