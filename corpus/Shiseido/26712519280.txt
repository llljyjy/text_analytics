Summer is right around the corner ladies! Lucky for me i have the NEW Essential Energy Hydrating Cream from shiseido. This luxurious moisturizing formula prepares me to protect my skin from the sunny spring days with SPF 20 featuring Ginseng Root Extract and Hyaluronic Acid to lock in intense hydration so my skin is protected, soothed and ready for makeup. I have oily skin and even though this is a heavier moisturizer it doesn’t make my skin greasy. It melts into my skin and leaves it moisturized without feeling sticky. It’s perfect for lazy summer days by the pool or as your new everyday SPF. Love it!
