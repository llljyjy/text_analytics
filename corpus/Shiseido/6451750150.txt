(Received free Sample from Influenster) I am as pale as one can be(a ginger) and this is the first sunscreen that has ever left a white cast on me. It doesn’t matter how little I use it still makes me ghostly pale. I also wouldn’t say this is very hydrating- I feel like if anything it made my skin drier. Definitely don’t recommend especially if you are darker skinned. White cast for days
