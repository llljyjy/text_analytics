Love this cream!! My skins feels super hydrated . Not to mention it has SPF so I have ditched my old one and I’m sticking to this instead! The smell isn’t so overpowering either which I think is what I dislike from usual sunscreen. 10/10 would recommend since it’s for all skin types too. For reference I have normal to oily skin Favorite day cream thus far
