I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. The bottle is beautiful, and the product itself has a luxe, velvety feel. I love the smell of the serum, although some may find their skin sensitive to it. The serum absorbs beautifully, and left my skin immediately soft and hydrated feeling - almost like a satin veil. The reason why Iâ€™m knocking off one star is that I did not feel that there was a huge difference in the time noted that a difference should be seen. I also had a few scattered bumps, although I will not contribute those directly to this product. I will continue to use as indicated and update my review if there is any change! All in all, yes I would keep using this and recommend to others - just be patient! Velvety-smooth skin
