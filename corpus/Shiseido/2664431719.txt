This is a nice serum but not the absolute best. I have very dry skin so I had high hopes after reading the claims that this was supposed to give a boost of hydration and adds radiance but I didn’t notice any of that. My skin feels smoother when I use this but I don’t have added radiance or more hydration. This would probably be a great serum for combo, oily, & normal skin types. nan
