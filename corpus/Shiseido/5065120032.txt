I received this product for free for my honest review in exchange from influenster. This sunscreen is perfect for dry skin and a natural glow! I love shiseido and when I saw they came out with this product I immediately purchase the water resistant one and I was glad influenster sent me this one as well because I like to stay safe when is about consistency. I purchase many sunscreens and I know what I like and what I don’t and this is something I am definitely will be purchasing when I ran out which is soon. Sunscreens are a staple for me. And I always try to get new ones but I know I can use this one under foundation without separating and leaving white residue which is one of the biggest problems I find in sunscreens. I don’t mind paying the price I know shiseido tends to be a little bit expensive but they had worked for me both when I had oily prone cystic acne and now that my skin has mature and is more on the dry side. It is easy to apply and re apply. It does not have a strong smell and doesn’t irritate my skin either. Beautiful sunscreen for daily application
