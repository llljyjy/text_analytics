I received this product as a part of a promotion with Influenster. I’ve been using this serum for approx. 2 weeks and I am loving the results I’m seeing! I’ve been using this serum morning and night, before my moisturizer. This serum has a nice floral scent. My skin really absorbs the product well and pretty quickly. My skin feels much more radiant. This will definitely be a product that I’m excited to have in my daily skincare routine! Loving the results I’m seeing!
