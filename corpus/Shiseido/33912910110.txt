I am currently loving The Shishido essential energy hydrating cream with hyaluronic acid red.  This moisturizing cream is extremely hydrating on my skin in the fact that you can use it morning and night is a plus. It has a faint smell that is not overpowering. The consistency is thick But not too thick to where it Takes a lot of effort to rub into your skin. And the fact that it has hyaluronic acid in it I am a total fan of any product with hyaluronic acid sense it makes your skin plump. I love it!
