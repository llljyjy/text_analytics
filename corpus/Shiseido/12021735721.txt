I’ve been using this daily for about a month. It feels nice on your face. Has a light gel/serum like consistency. Not greasy at all, and not moisturizing either. After using for a month, I can’t say I’ve noticed any positive effects on my skin. It hasn’t done anything bad either. I will continue to use. Maybe it just needs more time. Okay, but nothing special
