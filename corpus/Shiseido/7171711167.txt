Pros:Love the silky texture of the product,Love that it melts into my skin without leaving a sticky residue!Definitely feel like it adds a nice step o my skincare routineCons:Way too strong of a scent for a skincare productFelt like I was rubbing perfume all over…Ultimately after a week it broke me out.. which I had a feeling it would because it was scented :(If you can’t handle fragrance in your skincare you might just love it!!! Effective but too scented…
