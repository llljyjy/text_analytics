I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I liked this sunscreen, i used it as a primer and it worked great! Blends easily, my skin felt moisturized. It hasn’t been very sunny in the PNW so i can’t vouch for how much protection this product offers but i loved the texture/consistency. The product packaging is pretty but the bottle itself is a bit simple, i expected something wowing and it just wasn’t (which is fine not a dealbreaker). I’d recommend this product if splurging❤️ nan
