Shiseido’s Urban Environment Fresh-Moisture Sunscreen Broad-Spectrum SPF 42 is a daily moisturizing chemical sunscreen that protects skin against harmful UV rays and maintains skin’s moisture for 12 hours. It’s also noncomedogenic and dermatologist-tested. This sunscreen has a lightweight cream consistency that takes a few minutes to fully absorb into your skin, but when it does, it gives you an incredibly glowy finish. The star ingredients in this formula are hyaluronic acid and pearl light powder, which help deliver moisture and reflect red light to make uneven skin tone and dullness less noticeable. I definitely appreciated the intense hydration (I didn’t even need to wear a moisturizer underneath) and the radiant finish this sunscreen gave me, however,… I personally feel that this product was TOO dewy for my combination skin. It made my face look downright oily, to be honest. Not to mention, when applying the correct recommended amount (1/4 teaspoon to your entire face), it would pill awfully after just a couple of hours of wear. It was bad enough to the point where I didn’t dare try wearing makeup over it. But it did protect me from the sun and keep my face super moisturized, so I give 3/5 stars. I received this product courtesy of Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review. Little Too Radiant
