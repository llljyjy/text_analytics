Incorporated these new spfs that i received for free from Influenster and Shiseido as part of my morning routine.  My honest review: i have always loved the Shisheido spf (in the blue bottle) so i was excited to try these too. This version does have some white cast to it so i had to make sure to work it into my skin and let it set first. I also mixed it with some liquid bronzer which helped it blend out better. Overall, i really liked it and would recommend. Not too greasy but my skin stayed hydrated all day (even during the recent cold front in NYC) and i feel like my makeup stayed put better throughout the day when i used this. nan
