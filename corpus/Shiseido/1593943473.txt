I received a deluxe sample of this and immediately ordered the full sized bottle. It has a nice, light consistency to it, doesn’t look greasy, and works well under my makeup. It also evens out my skin tone a bit when wearing it alone. The lotion has a bit of a tint out of the bottle, but it doesn’t seem to act as a tint when applied. My skin is very fair so I can’t speak to whether this would leave a white cast on darker skin. I have combination skin that tends to be on the dry side, and if I haven’t moisturized well prior to applying this I get a bit of a dry patch around my nose but it goes away after a while. Despite this, I absolutely love this sunscreen. Fantastic sunscreen!
