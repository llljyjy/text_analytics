This serum feels great on the skin. It has just the perfect amount of hydration - it leaves my skin smooth and plump, without being greasy. I use it in my evening routine for a few weeks, and my skin feels more hydrated and bouncy. There is a fragrance - not too strong and smells good to me. but be aware if youâ€™re sensitive to it. the packaging is gorgeous! I received this product complimentary for review purposes. nan
