As a south Florida girl, sunscreen is a crucial step in my skincare routine. I loved the lightweight texture of this one and the fact that it absorbed into my skin flawlessly. I didn’t notice any white cast once absorbed, and there was a Dewey finish, not sticky or shiny. It actually worked well as a primer once I applied foundation about 30 minutes following application. I’ve used this daily for a week now and haven’t had any breakouts from it so it’s a keeper for me. Good as a stand-alone sunscreen or as the final skin prep before makeup application. Great for protecting your face!
