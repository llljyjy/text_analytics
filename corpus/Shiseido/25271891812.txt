I had read numerous positive reviews about Shiseido sunscreen both online and the magazines. And now, being able to try it out myself — this sunscreen is wonderful! It leaves my skin feeling hydrated without the normal sunscreen residue. It also completely absorbs without leaving a white appearance. Even when layering this with my moisturizer, makeup etc there isn’t any heavy feeling nor separation of my makeup on top of this sunscreen. It’s really worth the cost. Positive Unexpected Results
