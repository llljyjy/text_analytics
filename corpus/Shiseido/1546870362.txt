This serum is instantly hydrating and it has a comforting viscous texture. You don’t need much and it creates a juicy veil over the skin. It absorbs fairly quickly into the skin and feels very refreshing. After using it for some time, I noticed my skin felt smoother, more plump, and it had a really healthy glow to it! This serum is a great all-around serum that treats my lines and my very dry skin. I tested this during winter when my skin had particularly dry areas and it eliminated them overnight! This is a really impressive formula and one that I find I’m reaching fo often over my other serums. I highly recommend this serum for anyone looking to hydrate and fight signs of aging! Instantly Hydrating and Plumping
