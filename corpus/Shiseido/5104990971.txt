So this sunscreens benefit is hyaluronic acid to retain moisture for 12 hours which in my opinion is the ONLY benefit. It did also absorb easily but I have an oily skin type so when I did try this, I did break out the next day although it does state noncomedogenic. It also states it has no “oxybenzone“ but it has 10% of Homosalate in it still which is very simular to Oxybenzone making it a toxic chemical.. there are statements proving you shouldn’t use this chemical in any sun or skincare. As well as avobenzone these are hormonal disruptors. The ingredients that are also added are BHT + trisodium EDTA which are also carcinogens. So no thank you eeeek. Still Very Toxic Chemical Sunscreen
