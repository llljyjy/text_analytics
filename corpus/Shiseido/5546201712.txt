This product is best for people that are in the dry category or simply looking for something that would help getting a glow and sunscreen in one bottle. My skin has been clean and has a glow after using this product. It has been rewarding feeling my skin hydrated. I have never been happier using this moisturizer, because it help’s in giving my skin the hydration that it needs. Using a cream that has SPF is a bonus to me since I’m usually on a run in the mornings and it cuts down my time since I don’t have to apply many products at once. Best cream for dry skin, whiles getting SPF.
