The first time I used this sunscreen it left a major white cast, which I thought was odd since it is slightly tinted. So the next time I used it I made sure to rub it in better and no white cast. I was glad because I didn’t want to use less because that really defeats the purpose of a sunscreen if you are barely applying it. Once it was rubbed in well enough it really sunk into my skin and didn’t leave a greasy feeling behind and sat under my makeup nicely! I am very pleased! Great Sunscreen with a little learning curve!
