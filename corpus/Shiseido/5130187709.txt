I really wanted to love this product~ the packaging was so beautiful, easy to dispense & seemed to dispense the perfect amount of product which is a great feature as to not waste the product! I’ve come to terms that Shiseido just doesn’t agree with my skin ☹️ It completely dried my skin out so sadly I didn’t get to see any of the fantastic perks it claims to do, I simply didn’t get to use it that much. If you’re a fan of this line I’d suggest giving it a try! I wanted to love….
