If you liked the old urban environment you are going to LOVE the new version. They’ve made some great improvements. 1) they’ve increased the already high zinc % from 9 to 15.5 which means greater UVA (anti-aging protection) 2) it is now in the perfect nude base- it keeps the white cast away while also not leaving color on your clothes. I can wear it without applying makeup over it to correct the white cast. 3) it’s somehow less shiny but at the same time also less drying that the original. Like all Shiseido SPF is offers excellent and reliable sun protection without irritating sensitive skin. It is a beautiful liquid consistency with a shaker ball (shake before applying). It’s also a convenient size to carry with you or travel with. It has the same light fragrance as the original. The Best One Yet!!
