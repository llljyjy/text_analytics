This sunscreen in my current favorite. I have rosacea/very sensitive skin. My dermatologist recommended that I stick to mineral sunscreens over chemical, because mineral sunscreens sit on top of the skin where as chemical sunscreens are absorbed into the skin. Normally to get a satisfactory texture and less white cast I combine two sunscreens Murad city skin mineral sunscreen and Dr. Jart every sun day mineral sunscreen which are both spf50. The Murad sunscreen is tinted which helps with the white cast but very sticky and doesn’t really dry down. The Dr. Jart sunscreen is matte but has a very intense white cast. Combining them makes a nice dewy finish with not to much of a white cast, but I hated always buying two sunscreens that are both sort of pricey. I was really excited to try the Shiseido, because I used to use one of the Shiseido chemical sunscreens which I loved before I was diagnosed with rosacea. This mineral sunscreen dries to my exact skin texture which makes reapplying very easy. No matter how many times a reapply this sunscreen doesn’t feel caked on. The main reason I’m knocking it down one star is because of the white cast. To get the amount of spf that the bottle claims to have you have to wear 2 milligrams per square centimeter which for me(face & neck) thats about 1/4 teaspoon, and this amount gives me a pretty noticeable white cast not to mention reapplication. I am a relatively light East Asian, and I still get a pretty descent white cast. I can’t imagine how much worse the white cast is on skin with more melanin then mine. I don’t wear foundation so maybe for people who do wear foundation the white cast might not be a factor. Overall I really like this sunscreen, but I just wanted to be upfront about the white cast which is common in mineral sunscreens. WHITE CAST
