Light weight and feels incredible on. Does a great job moisturizing but not being to heavy or feast. Great for all skin types. Did not break out my skin which is great, I have sensitive skin. Only down side the smell is not my cup of tea, but it doesn’t last long. It’s not a bad smell just not for me. Great moisturizer
