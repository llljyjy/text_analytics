I received a free sample of this product to try and review. After two bouts of skin cancer (both caught early, thank goodness!) I have tried my fair share of sun protection products, but I hadn’t tried this one before. Definitely recommend - it’s clean and hydrating, not sticky, and doesn’t have a strong scent. I love that it contains hyaluronic acid so it’s doing double duty for my skin! Smooth and hydrating!
