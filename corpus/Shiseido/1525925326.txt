I received these products for free from @influenster and @shiseido in exchange for my honest review.Growing up in Hawaii, sunscreen was always important. Iâ€™m familiar with this brand but never tried their sunscreens so it was exciting to test it out.I received these just in time now that the day are getting warmer. I like to use this sunscreen daily. I love the small convenient packaging. The screen is lightweight and moisturizing. Also, a little goes a long way, which is always a plus in my books. #shiseidosuncare #complimentary nan
