Shiseido gifted me this product to test, honest opinions are my own.Shiseido’s Urban Environment Fresh-Moisture Broad Spectrum SPF42 Sunscreen $38/1.8oz is a super lightweight facial sunscreen. Key ingredients to this Chemical based sunscreen include hyaluronic acid to hydrate and pearl light powder to reflect red light to make uneven skin tone less noticeable.I love how it applies easily like a moisturizer without pilling or leaving a white cast since it is a chemical based sunscreen. My face feels hydrated without feeling like a sticky or oily mess and I get compliments on the radiant glowy finish from the pearl light powder. If you do a patch test on your hands, you will see the pearlescent shimmer. I have no issues with burning, as I reapply SPF through the day.Cons:Sparkly pearlized finish from pearl light powderDoes contain Fragrance, a mild floral scentI would recommend to those that prefer or don’t mind chemical sunscreens and looking for a facial sunscreen that is hydrating and easy to apply.4 Stars because I don’t always want a shimmery glow to my face but otherwise, a great product. Shimmery Chemical Based Facial Sunscreen
