First impression about this product, cute little package, nonscent. It is easy to apply and it is a yummy application, the sunscreen glides all over. It doesn’t leave an oily texture on the skin but it has a shine to it, almost like a highlighter, which doesn’t bother me at all. Another positive point here is the “treatment” purpose, it has hyaluronic acid that contributes to the hydration of the skin. The only thing that makes me wonder if I would use this product by itself is the white cast that it does leave on the skin and you will notice it if you have a medium to dark skin tone, I don’t think it would be perceptive if your skin is more on the light tone side.But this aspect of white cast is common for sunscreen made with mineral ingredients, that is all this one has. All things considered, the white cast that it leaves it’s pretty mild. So far I like it. ✨Not Sure? Give it a try!✨
