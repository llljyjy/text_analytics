I have very dry and acne prone skin, and have used and tried countless of moisturizers that claimed to hydrate the skin. In all my years of searching for the perfect moisturizer, Iâ€™ve never found one. Until this cream! I was stuck using moisturizers with argan oil on top because the moisturizers never fully moisturized my dry skin and my skin would still be left feeling tight and thirsty, and most of the time break out with various moisturizers.This cream from Shiseido is now In my holy grail products list because it is so creamy, rich and exceptionally hydrating, without being greasy or oily. My skin has never felt this hydrated, and the best part is that this cream does not break me out at all like most creams do. After application, my skin is left feeling super soft, hydrated and glowing all day long without having to reapply. Is this product worth the money? In my opinion absolutely, especially of you suffer with dry and acne prone skin. My favorite moisturizer
