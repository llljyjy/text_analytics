I tried both this and the SPF version and weirdly this also smells like SPF! It’s thick and rich, and was great when it was colder because my skin craves moisture. but now it’s getting hotter and more humid, so I find I can only use it at night and it’s pretty greasy after sleeping anyway. probably best for people with dry skin in dry climates or really crave greasy intense moisture. intense moisture!
