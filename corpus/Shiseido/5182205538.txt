I received this complimentary for my honest feedback.  Goes on smooth. Rubs in and absorbs well.  Pleasant smell.  What I didnt like is how greasy and oily it made my face feel for about an hour after applying.  Hoping I dont break out from it.  Willing to give it a chance. I am concerned it will run when I sweat. Its ok, leas greasy, and it would be great
