The Shiseido Urban Environment Sun Dual Care Fresh Moisture Sunscreen has broad spectrum SPF 42 and hyaluronic acid. The smell is not overly strong and it doesnâ€™t smell like traditional sunscreen which is a major plus. It goes on smoothly and soaks in quickly. I love that it hydrated my skin AND protects!I noticed that I did not even get mildly sunburned despite being in the sun for about two hours. If I was going to be in the sun longer, I would definitely reapply. All in all, I am pleased with this product. Fresh and Protective
