I must start out by saying I have extremely dry skin and struggle finding a product that helps me during the winter weather. After trying this product out for a week I did see improvements in my dryness, altho it did not resolve my issues. On a positive note, I will say the texture went on very smooth and the scent was amazing! Loved the container also. The creme was in a removable cup, making this container reusable for any other needs. nan
