This is hands down the best sunscreen stick I have ever used. I prefer chemical sunscreen to mineral, and this one is just about perfect. I goes on easily, smells great, and blends in nicely. I’m not a total greaseball at the end of the day if I use it, even more than one application. It’s been perfect for my whole family on our beach trip. I don’t wear it over makeup, but it seems to be totally fine over my regular skincare. WORTH THE MONEY
