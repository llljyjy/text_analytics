I have only used this product for almost three weeks and will come back to do a full review in four to six weeks.I have started to use the serum in my every day skincare routine. In my three weeks of use, I have noticed my skin looking a tad more radiant.This serum works against every day damage and aging. The serum is light weight sinking into the skin to leave the skin soft and hydrated. It is not sticky or oily. This serum does have a light floral scent to it.The packaging is beautiful (sucker for anything in red) and the pump is sturdy as well. nan
