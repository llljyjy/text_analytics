Received produce complimentary from Influenster. I have been wanting to try shiseido sunscreen for a while and was ecstatic to see why they are the sunscreen queen! To preface, I have combo skin that is oilier in the t-zone area. Typically Iâ€™m on the normal/dry end for spring so this sunscreen was perfect. The sunscreen is moisturizing enough without causing me to be oily all over. Love the squeeze tube to ensure you are able to get every last drop. I would recommend especially to those who are not oily! nan
