The wait is over, I finally received the hydrating cream after only trying the day cream and I’m obsessed! It has a way more pleasant smell than the other one and leaves your skin so damn smooth and hydrating. I just wish it had a different packaging that is less time consuming. Overall, I’m hooked! Better than the regular day cream.
