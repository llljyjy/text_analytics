I wear facial sunscreen anytime I go outside, so this was an interesting item to test. The application of this product is very lightweight and easy to apply, it does not leave a white cast. It does have a slight tint, but I did not really notice any change in color of my skin upon application. I have worn this both by itself and under makeup, and while it wears okay by itself I did feel it was too oily feeling under my makeup. It is oil-free technically, but the feeling was greasier than my standard facial sunscreen. Nice Application, But Feels Oily
