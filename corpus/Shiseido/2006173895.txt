This is a first impression so please take this with a grain of salt. I bought this because I run outta sunscreen so fast. I was a little hesitant because of all of the reviews of it being really oily but I tried it anyways. From my experience you do have to shake it up REALLY well because it is a more watery consistency. It does feel a little oily when you apply but I find that went away within 10-20mins. NO WHITE CAST. It feels more like you have a silicone base primer on your skin. I did get a touch oily through the day, but it’s nothing terribly. Specially with living in the humidity of Hawaii. I haven’t tried it under makeup. But so far so good. Is it too good to be true?
