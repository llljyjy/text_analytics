this serum is seriously awesome! I was so excited when I received the full size product in my voxbox especially because it retails for $75 and after trying it I think it’s so worth it. first off a little goes a long way, its lightweight, smells great and leaves skin feeling fresh. the best part is usually i have issues w my nose area drying out and my skin tends to get flaky even with moisturizer its always made my makeup look cakey there and since i started using this its improved so much plus I’ve noticed my skin feels and looks more radiant I love it! nan
