Really like this cream!  Consistency was great and it blended right into my skin.  I like that it works for both day and nighttime and didn’t cause any issues when I wore makeup on top of it.  It has a nice soft scent which isn’t too overpowering definitely comes through.  My skin felt super quenched and moisturized while using it but not sure it did a whole lot for my wrinkles but I’ll keep using it. nan
