I have a hard time finding a good face sunscreen. I’ve got sensitive skin that is prone to breaking out. I LOVE this sunscreen! It’s the perfect amount of moisturizing and my skin didn’t have any reactions to it. It works really well to protect my face from the sun. It also doesn’t burn my eyes like some other face sunscreen! I would definitely recommend this and purchase it! No flashback or white cast either! This product was gifted to me from Influenster for my honest review. nan
