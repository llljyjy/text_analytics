I really like this face cream! I’d never tried Shiseido before but I’ve been looking for a good moisturizer with SPF. It doesn’t smell super strongly of sunscreen, doesn’t pill under my concealer/foundation, and doesn’t leave a white cast on the face! They also make a non-SPF version which is nice. It’s on the thick side consistency-wise but not the most hydrating thing I’ve ever used. Good for combo to oily skin, honestly I think it even has a very light mattifying effect. Would repurchase! No white cast, sunscreen smell, or pilling!
