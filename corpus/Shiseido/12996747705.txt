I was given this product for free from Indluenster and Shisedo in return for a review. Feels luxurious, smells nice, great packaging. It absorbs quickly and is very hydrating. However, the marketing here needs to be better. I would never buy this because is does not clearly state what this product even does! Says itâ€™s like vitamins etc for your skin, but does it help prevent wrinkles? Does it help with red spots? Good for sensitive skin? I will use this on my neck, chest, and hands What does this do?
