I really like these cotton pads. I use them with the Paula’s choice BHA exfoliant and it feels really nice on my skin. They really are just a fancy cotton pad that’s softer then the usual cotton pads you get a target. There is no special need for these, any cotton pad will do. I just like how soft these guys are. nan
