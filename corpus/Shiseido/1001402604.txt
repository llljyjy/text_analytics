I read all the great reviews and had to order this as I’m obsessive about my sunscreen, but unfortunately it doesn’t live up to the hype for me. It has a scent, but it fades quickly. I did like that it goes over makeup without smearing it  *but* it leaves a tacky finish that doesn’t dry down. It’s a similar finish to when your hair sticks to your lipgloss. When the wind blows your hair plasters to your cheek. I’ll stick to spf powder. Sticky finish
