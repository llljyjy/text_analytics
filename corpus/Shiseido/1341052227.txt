Daily, dewy moisturizing sunscreen protects skin against harmful UV rays and maintains skinâ€™s moisture for 12 hours.This one is more for a dewy finish, it left a beautiful fresh and dewy look to my face! I can truly say this would be ideal for more normal to dry skin types, as I felt in my oily areas (im combination skin) a little too moisturizing making it accentuate my pores. I have to say though that it even though it was really moisturizing it is not greasy, it has a radiant plumping effect. I love the scent too, it is not too overwhelming! plumping & dewy effect!
