I was really excited to test the sunscreen out since I love finding new sunscreen that I like incorporating into my daily skin care routine.however I was quite disappointed by this product since I like most of this companies skin care and make up. For the price I didn’t find the quality nor product given worth the money. I first began applying it as my face using my fingers but I felt a weird film on top of my skin. It’s not something I’m used to in my sunscreen products and not something that I enjoy. It also leaves a slight white cast which I tend to avoid in my sunscreen selection. Since the consistency of this product is milky and very liquidy it requires you to use more product than you would a regular cream sunscreen. after applying I didn’t feel as if my skin was moisturized or well protected. Overall I’d say it’s not worth the price for the quality of the product and I’d choose one of my drugstore options instead. Shiseido Sunscreen
