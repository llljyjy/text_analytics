i was super excited to get the chance to try out the Shiseido Ultimune Power Ultimate Power Infusing Serumand it did not disappoint! The serum smells fresh and light. It glides on the skin and sinks in almost immediately without leaving a slick or tacky finish. After using this product for a few weeks i have noticed my skin feels firmer and more hydrated. My skins tone and texture have improved and it wears really nicely under makeup. I have slightly dry skin with the beginning signs of aging, my skin is getting more dull and losing its “bounce back“ youthful appearance. I feel like this serum has helped to either slow or even slightly reverse the aging process and i am hooked! I will definitely be purchasing more of this stuff when i run out!!! Firmer Brighter Skin
