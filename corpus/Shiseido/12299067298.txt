I’m not the best at remembering to wear sunscreen, I’m usually reminded all day I’m wearing it because of it’s heavy feel, harsh smell and it burns my eyes.Urban Environment Fresh-Moisture Sunscreen Broad-Spectrum SPF 42 is different! It has been a pleasure integrating it into my daily skincare routine. It has a mild but pleasant sunscreen scent that fades fairly quickly. Overall, if you’re looking for an everyday sunscreen that has a nice added bonus of hydrating the skin this is for you! Great Option for Everyday!
