This has been a great addition to my skin care routine. My fine lines have gotten better using this. I have been testing it out for a few months now. It doesn’t have a strong smell and it didn’t irritate my skin. I also didn’t break out when I started using this which was a big plus for me. My skin seems more radiant and people have noticed a difference in my fine lines and skin. I definitely recommend it to anyone on the fence about buying it. You won’t be disappointed. It’s fantastic
