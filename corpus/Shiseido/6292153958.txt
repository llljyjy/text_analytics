I received this product complimentary through Influenster in exchange for my honest review ❤️ I was really excited to receive this product! First thoughts - I’m definitely going to break this glass bottle before it’s over with. I was afraid the serum would feel sticky but it doesn’t at all. It leaves my face feeling so soft.After three days of use - I can definitely tell a difference as far as my face being more moisturized. I’m very dry in my tzone and had a few patches of dry skin when I started using this three days ago. Those patches are almost gone completely. I feel like my skin is brighter, but as far as helping with any lines or wrinkles I think I’ll have to use the product for awhile longer to see those results. But definitely so far so good, especially for three days! I gave it a three day test.
