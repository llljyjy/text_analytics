I received this for free to try out to give my honest opinion.This cream was a great moisturizer for my face and I loved how light it was. This day cream is very fast absorbing and a little greasy. My face had a nice shine and felt smooth with lots of softness. It 100% provided my skin with the hydration it needed. Be very careful not to get it close to your eyes because I made that mistake and it caused me a little eye irritation. I love that it has SPF 20 suncream so my face had protection when outside. It is not really scented but has like a neutral cream scent. I love the packaging and the beautiful color. If you have dry skin this is the cream for you. Skin is Popping
