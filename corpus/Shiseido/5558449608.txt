The essential energy hydrating day cream with SPF20 moisturizer is PERFECT for my combination sensitive skin that’s prone to dehydration. It hydrates and smooths the appearance of pores and fine lines, gives radiance but is still lightweight that I can see myself using it during the summer too without it feeling heavy or “greasy”. The smell isn’t too over powering which is great as sometimes scents will trigger a headache for me. Might be adding this to the holy grail list! nan
