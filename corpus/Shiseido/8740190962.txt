I was pleasantly suprised by this day cream! I usually don’t love SPF in moisturizers because it can irritate my skin or have an odd texture but this one feels so nice on my skin. It is the perfect consistency and since I have been using it my skin hasn’t been dry or flaky. It wears wonderfully under makeup and isn’t greasy. It has become a regular staple in my routine. Perfect day cream!
