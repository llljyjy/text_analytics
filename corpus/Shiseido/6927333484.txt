This is the only sunscreen that doesn’t break me out! I brought this with me during the hottest season of Florida and I’ve never been the burning type but my god was I burning there! I forgotten that I didn’t put on sunscreen that morning and my god did this save me from the heat! My entire family was using this and I still had a lot left after the trip! I prefer this over the pink one since this last me longer! BURN BE GONE!
