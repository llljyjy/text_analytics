I can not stress this enough, you need this in your routine. Firstly let’s talk about the texture. It is watery, but smooth and velvety, absorbs and dries in to the skin in 10 seconds flat, but almost acting as a primier to help all of your other steps work better. I used this both in the morning and at night, 2 pumps, and it still lasted me more than a month. One of my main focuses of my skin care it brightening, due to me having a few dark spots from acne. Within 2 weeks I saw a difference. But not just in teh dark spots. My face felt smoother, more moisturized, plumper. You need this, evern if you don’t use it twice a day I promise you will see a difference worth having it around. Buy this now!!!!!
