So far I am really liking this cream! The packaging is great! It feels nice and light, I’m still trying to figure out if the couple of small pimples I have had are from this cream or from other recent changes that have been made. It also had a light fragrance, which smells natural. That’s a hit or miss with some people. I would definitely recommend others try. Light and creamy
