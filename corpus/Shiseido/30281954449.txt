I can honestly say I am so “hoppy” to receive my first ever Shiseido products!!! Y’all know I love skincare products and “ suncare” is very much apart of skincare. It is ONE of the most IMPORTANT steps in my extensive skincare routine. So for self care Sunday this Easter. I had to share the NEW Urban Environment SPF formulas from Shiseido! These are INCREDIBLE! They are their most ADVANCED suncare technology yet!! The Urban Environment Oil-Free Sunscreen SPF 42 also doubled as a face primer! I wore it today under my makeup for our Easter Egg Hunt and love that it is an Oil-free, mattifying lotion formula that hydrates the skin! It felt so hydrating and lightweight on my skin! The Urban Environment Fresh-Moisture Sunscreen SPF 42 is a dewy, radiant and hydrating formula that maintains skin’s moisture for 12 hours!This also felt so AMAZING on my skin yesterday when we took Ava to meet the Easter Bunny. It was all I wore and my husband said I looked radiant and beautiful! Each formula is infused with hyaluronic acid! Y’all know I LOVE all things hyaluronic acid! Retaining moisture in our skin is very important when aging and protecting us from the drying effects of the sun.I need and love suncare that protects against both UVA/UVB rays and pollution. Also love that these are free of oxybenzone & octinoxate! Making these 2 products my NEW best friends for spring and summer! I’m in LOVE and honored to have Shiseido in my skincare arsenal now! A MUST HAVE in my opinion! Thank you Influenster and Shiseido IM IN LOVE
