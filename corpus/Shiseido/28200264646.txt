I fell in love with this product.  It’s smooth, non oily, great coverage and sunscreen to boot!! I’m fair skinned and this wonderful product has made foundation for me a thing of the past. I put this on a little blush and Mascara and done. I’ve gotten compliments on how great my skin looks. At 53 and a redhead with fair skin sunscreen is so important but this is the best one I’ve had for my face.  Most are very low on protection but this one has worked fantastic out in extreme sun.  Love love love it!! A must try SUNSCREEN for everyone.
