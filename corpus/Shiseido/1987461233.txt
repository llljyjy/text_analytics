I love the packaging for the product because it’s in a glass bottle and it has a pump. I have now incorporated it my daily morning & evening skin routine; after cleansing my face I put 2 pumps of this concentrate serum on my face and follow with sunscreen & moisturizer. It has a nice subtle scent, the serums absorbs quickly and does not feel icky. After applying it on a daily basis for a week I noticed my skin feels smoother, more hydrated and more plump. I really enjoyed the serum and will purchase when I finish this bottle (did not make my sensitive skin breakout) . I recommended it if you’re looking for a lightweight serum (will be bringing some on my next flight to help my combo skin stay hydrated). Awesome Lunar New Year Gift
