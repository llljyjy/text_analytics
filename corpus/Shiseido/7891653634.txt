This serum is awesome for oily skin that gets dry in the winter. A lot of serums break me out, but this is gentle enough to moisturize without making my skin greasy. ItIs super lightweight and feels great on the skin! My skin feels more luminous when I use it. Iâ€™m excited to continue using it during the summer when my skin is less dry. Lightweight moisture
