Pros: Smells delightful, better than most typical sunscreen lotions, high SPF [50+], water resistant, longer lasting UVA/UVB protectionCons: amount of product needed for adequate protection if though it’s a creamy liquid, resistance to glide on [even though I would shake bottle excessively; ex. add a dollop to your upper arm, you’ll need another dollop for your lower arm], price for bottle [$50] vs how much used per application / outingChange that would pique my interest to purchase again? Dispense the product as aerosol rather than a cream to avoid excessive use Needs to be an AEROSOL rather than a CREAM
