This Hydrating Cream has a thick white texture. It provides the perfect amount of moisture for my skin. My skin tends to lean more toward dry versus oily, so this stuff is everything I needed. I love this brand. Shiseido never disappoints! Leaves my skin hydrated and feeling smooth. Perfect Hydration
