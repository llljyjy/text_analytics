This my first time trying a shiseido product. I’ve been looking for a facial spf and this might be the one for me. First of all it’s a broad spectrum 42 spf that works great. I applied after my normal facial routine and it blended so nicely into my skin without any white residue or oily finish. I love that it contains hyaluronic so it’s not dying like others. I would definitely buy this again. GREAT SPF
