My skin is more on the oily side and sensitive. I triedthe moisturizer with SPF and thought it worked well,until I used it daily for a week and started seeinginflamed little pimples that felt itchy all throughoutmy face. I was hopeful to try this moisturizer withoutSPF, but after using it consistently for a few days, Istill ended up with the same reaction. Safe to say Iwould not be able to use this moisturizer brand.However, my mom tried it (her skin is not oily) and shereally likes it. No preference between SPF vs. no SPF.They both work just as good for her. I did enjoy theway the moisturizer felt on my skin when I first tried it.Also the texture was nice and not too thick. Wouldrecommend for people who do not have oily orsensitive skin. not good for my skin
