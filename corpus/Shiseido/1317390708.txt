I received this product for free from Influenster and Shiseido in exhange for my honest review. I really enjoyed this sunscreen. I love that it has hyaluronic acid and that it isn’t greasy feeling. It did not leave a cast on my olive skin tone. It is very scented, but I enjoyed the scent, but if you’re sensitive to scents, this may not be the sunscreen for you. I also like that it’s a smaller sized bottle, so it is easy to tote in my handbag or makeup bag. nan
