This is a nice Serum in my lineup. The lack of scent, nice packaging, quick absorption and glow it gives me are great. I consider it a good multi benefit product that works well for layering, but it’s not a standout for me. I consider myself lucky to have a range of serums that work well for my skin, and this definitely stands up well there. That said, it is very expensive even on sale and that’s my sticking point. There’s too much skincare in the world to overpay! A good low scent option
