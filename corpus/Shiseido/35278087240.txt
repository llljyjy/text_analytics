I loved this Shiseido Urban Environment Sunscreen! When used as a makeup primer it works fabulous. My face didn’t get oily throughout the day, and my makeup stayed put. There was no white cast for me because it absorbed quickly.  I will definitely take this sunscreen to the beach with me, or whenever I’m outdoors. Love it!
