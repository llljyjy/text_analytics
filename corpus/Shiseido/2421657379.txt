I received this item from Influenster for my review-I am very picky when it comes to moisturizers, but this one has been great! It isn’t to greasy abs doesn’t leave me oily. It helps with my dry spots. The smell is good but not overwhelming. The packaging is cute with the little spatula. I would definitely recommend this moisturizer for combination skin. nan
