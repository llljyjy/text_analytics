Shiseido gifted me their Essential Energy Hydrating Cream and I absolutely love it! ⁣I use this cream following my AM skincare and it is so luxe and hydrating! I love that it has SPF too, and it doesn’t irritate my eyes like other spf formulas do! I have sensitive skin that’s prone to breakouts upon trying new products and this has not broken me out once! I highly recommend trying this out! Love it!
