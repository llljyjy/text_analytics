I was so excited to have a Sheido product sent to me for product testing since Iâ€™m a long time fan of their skincare products!  I love that this ultra-lightweight sunscreen also comes with skincare benefits. If I need to run out the door I can moisturize my skin with the hyaluronic acid and stay protected! It has a light scent and it absorbs pretty quickly. I also love using it as a makeup base since it applies like a serum rather than a thick sunscreen. I also recommend the water resistant sunscreen from this line All in one Skincare & sun protection
