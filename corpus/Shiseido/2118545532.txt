I received this product complimentary and immediately noticed the generous amount of product. The product goes on smooth and light. I can smell the sunscreen in the product which is why I took off one star but that fades quickly .. and your face is left with a smooth powdery soft feel. This product works well under daily makeup. I have really dry skin due to my climate where I live. I feel the product is moisturizing for normal to dry skin. Overall I enjoyed this product Every day cream
