i use this cleansing milk as the first step for my double cleanse routine. it leaves my normally dry skin smooth and clean without feeling stripped. it also prepares my skin super well for my second cleanse. a little goes a long way for me as it is able to take of all my makeup easily (although i have yet to try it out with waterproof mascara). the only con i’ve found is that the product stings when it gets in my eyes. so, i make sure not to rub too harshly to ensure none of the product gets in my eyes. otherwise it’s amazing and i would buy again!i feel like the fragrance might throw some people off but i don’t mind the fragrance/scent. wish i could give it a 5 but still a good product
