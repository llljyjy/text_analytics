I wasn’t expecting to like this line but I love the ingredients in it and the fact that it’s one sunblock that doesn’t break out my face nor body!! I have received this complimentary from influencer I have this one and the oil free facial one this one is moisturizing so on my dry days on my face I’ll use this one and still have no problems o love that this is moisturizing and not greasy!!!  Also loved the packaging I think most of all I love the skin care into it like hyrolic acid. All tan not burn and we’re in Texas Spf & skin care in one
