I am a big fan of Shiseido skin care products and this one is no exception. I love the smooth texture of this oil on my skin and the light fragrance. It effectively melts away my makeup and cleanses my skin before I wash my face. I even use it when I donâ€™t have makeup because I enjoy the ritual and scent so much! I will alternate between this and the Dermologica Precleanse because they are both top products for cleaning your skin properly. Silky smooth and smells amazing
