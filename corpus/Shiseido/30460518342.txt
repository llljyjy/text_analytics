I really like this Sunscreen. It’s great for the face because it’s tinted and you can use it under your makeup as a primer. You have to make sure you shake it well each time you use it so that it’s mixed to the right consistency. @Shiseido, @Influenster, #shiseidosuncareI received this product for free in return for my honest opinion. Great primer and sunscreen in one
