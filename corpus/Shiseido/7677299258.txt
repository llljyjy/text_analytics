This product has been great so far! I waited a little bit for my review to see how my skin handled a consistent change. I have sensitive skin and am prone to breakouts with changes in routines. This product did not result in that and has left my dry skin feeling so hydrated! Itâ€™s a bonus that it includes SPF. nan
