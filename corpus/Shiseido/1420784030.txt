I’ve been using this for a few weeks and I think my skin has been liking it and feeling more happy. I’m surprised because alcohol is the second ingredient in this. I will continue to use this and see how it performs over time. This product retails for $110 at this size (1.6oz). It has really nice heavy packaging but for $110 I would expect a huge difference in my skin, which I haven’t seen yet. I will say you only need a tiny amount (1 pump) for your whole face. The product also has some floral fragrance but it’s not super strong. I feel ok about this product having received it to review but I can’t say I would buy it. Too expensive for what it’s worth
