This Shiseido Fresh-Moisture Sunscreen is a good lotion SPF. I found the product to be easy to apply and feel comfortable on the skin. It didn’t feel greasy or sticky at all. It is a white cream color but doesn’t leave a whitecast or any coloration to the skin.  I prefer unscented products but the fragrance in this is light and pleasant enough that I do not mind it at all. It leaves the skin slightly dewy and moisturized but not too much. I like that it is SPF 42 and do not mind that it is a chemical sunscreen. I like that the size of the tube makes it easy to carry around and reapply throughout the day. I do wish that more product was in each tube so I wouldn’t feel so bad about the environmental impact of the packaging and having to replace it so often. Overall, it is a SPF I gladly would use and include in my daily skin routine. nan
