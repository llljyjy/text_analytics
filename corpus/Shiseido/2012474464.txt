I received this product for free from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review. I tried this sunscreen from Shiseido and it’s really a wonderful product.  First I like that it has no smell. No scent whatsoever like other sunscreens. It is like milk and when you rub it in it disappears and leaves no residue, oils, or shine. I also like that my skin feels soft and hydrated with the Hyaluronic acid and I’m still getting decent at protection with the spf 42. This is my new go-to product for my face. Smooth & No Odor
