This is a good sunscreen for days at the beach/pool/outside event, etc. I found that it is a little too thick to wear under makeup and it has a tendency to clog my pores. My skin isn’t super sensitive so I was surprised. But I’ll definitely be using it when I’m out in the sun for a few hours and then washing it off. nan
