I love the way it feels in my skin, is totally liquid so you can blend it easy around the area you want to protect, in my case I love it using it just in my face (including ears) and neck, usually others sunscreen are super heavy and hard to put in your ears, this one is the easiest! And gives a extra bright tone to your face without looking oily...I donâ€™t think I will use foundation again with this sunscreen. Totally recommend it! Best everyday sunscreen ever
