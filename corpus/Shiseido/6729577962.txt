I was nervous to try a retinol product because I know they can be harsh. This serum is gentle and user friendly for the most inexperienced person. It has a light consistency and hardly has a scent to it which is nice for sensitive noses. My skin usually doesn’t take to be products but this one was nice and my skin ate it up. Unlike other retinol products, this didn’t cause irritation or make my skin purge into breakouts. As with any retinol product, please make sure to follow up with sunscreen everyday!Unfortunately, where this product fails is in the packaging which isn’t commensurate to the price point.  For a luxe product, I expect it to feel solid and have a hefty weight to it. This is plastic with a gold coating on it. I prefer pumps because they are hygienic, but the bulky packaging and opaque bottle prevents you from seeing how much product you actually have. It’s a big bottle which is misleading for how many fluid ounces are inside. I felt like I ran out of product so quick because I had no way to gauge how much I had left. This all put me off to buy the product again and I’d rather grab a cheaper alternative. This product was given to me complimentary from influenster for my honest review.
