This sunscreen definitely feels more like a moisturizer. My skin felt hydrated, dewy and gorgeous with this one. Shiseido really out did themselves with these new formulas. A little definitely goes a long. Since my skin tends to be oiler in the summer Iâ€™ll use this one more on my no makeup days! nan
