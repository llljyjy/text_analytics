I received this product for free and the opinions are my own. Likes- this product has no smell when normal SPFs do have a horrible smell. It’s nice that it is a smaller bottle so I can just throw in makeup bag. Dislikes- I don’t like that the product has a tint to it( this is okay if u are using it under a foundation). This product is also very watery nan
