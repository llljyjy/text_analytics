Love this sunscreen - it’s very lightweight and absorbs very quickly, though it does have a slight tint and fragrance and it has a very matte finish. I prefer a dewier look especially for those days when I’m not wearing makeup, but I appreciated the very slight color it gave me so I wasn’t a ghost in sunscreen! great but mattifying
