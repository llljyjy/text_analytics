I’ve been applying this to my face every morning for the last few weeks. I have never owned or tried a skin cream this expensive, so it’s been a treat! I have to say that I love the consistency and application of this cream. It’s super hydrating but it’s not greasy. My skin feels soft and replenished after only a few weeks. I haven’t noticed any breakouts either. Would definitely recommend this to friends battling dry, sensitive skin! nan
