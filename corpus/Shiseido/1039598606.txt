I used this product under my makeup as a sunscreen and it worked as intended. It helped protect my face on the days when I was outside in very sunny conditions. I did not experience any white residue from this product. I found the tint to work well with my skin tone. I love this product is safe for oceans and reefs in the event I wanted to go to the beach. I will definitely add it to my favorites and repurchase. Great SPF
