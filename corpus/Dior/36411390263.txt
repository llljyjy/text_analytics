Super nice and soft on the face. This on/off cleanser didn’t cause me any breakouts and all of the ingredients are super nice (excluding the perfume) but I don’t mind the scent, I think it smells good. Very refreshing and my face felt softer than it has in a while. 10/10 at removing makeup too, literally melted it right off! Silky smooth great clean
