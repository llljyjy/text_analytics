Since I have to wear a mask all day at work I have been on the hunt for a holy grail lip product that would give my lips a little oomph without smearing inside the mask. There is a very slight sheen to this that makes my lips look lush. It isn’t a lip mask, so don’t expect it to transform or heal your lips, but if you’re looking for something better than regular balm. I also love that it’s not greasy or tacky. Beautiful luxe balm
