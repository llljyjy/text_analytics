I received this free to try and review. I have oily skin and though I like the rich, creamy consistency, I donâ€™t as a moisturizer. So, I used it as a mask like it says you can and left it on for ten minutes. The results left my skin really soft and took the dullness away. Has no scent or heavy perfumes. nan
