I received this complimentary cleanser from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This face cleanser has a strong fragrance so I was a little unsure at first. I only had to use a tiny pea sized amount because it has great lathering properties. It has a subtle perfume fragrance. I did notice my face felt clean without any residue after washing. I tend to have dryer/sensitive skin so I did worry a bit about the fragrance. It seems moisturizing and did not leave my skin tight so I feel like it wasn’t too harsh for my sensitive skin. It is a relatively clean ingredient product so this was important. I typically use la roche posey which does not have clean ingredients! My skin looked fresh clean & I didn’t have any reactions to the cleanser so I would highly recommend this and I am very happy with how my face feels and looks! Love it on/off
