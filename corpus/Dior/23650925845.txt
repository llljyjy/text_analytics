I received this product from Influenster for free for my honest review and first off I’ve been using this for a few days now on my face, and really do like this product to retain my skin’s moisture but I was hoping that the balm itself would be more moisturizing. I haven’t noticed a huge difference in the look and feel of my skin. So overall I find it okay, but I expected a bit more. it’s an okay product
