I recently received the Dior Capture Totale Super Potent Eye Serum VoxBox free to review from @Influenster. This eye serum is made from 92% ingredients of natural origin. The serum has a built in applicator, used to massage the product into the under eye skin. I’ve noticed that my under eye concealer goes on easier and lasts longer since I started using this product. I haven’t noticed any difference in my dark under eye circles, but they are hereditary, not from lack of sleep, so it’s unlikely they’ll ever go away. I  like how my under eyes feel after applying this serum, so I will continue to use it.#complimentary, #contest, #influenster Good Eye Serum
