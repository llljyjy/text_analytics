I received this product for free from Influencer for my honest review. I really did like this cream as a hand cream. It has a very slight scent, is thick without being greasy and keeps your hands nice and soft for most of the day. That being said, I would not spend that much money on a hand cream, but I would recommend! Great hand cream
