I received this product to try off of influenster (which is an app you can download, you get to try products for free for your honest review) I absolutely love this honestly! For people who are sensitive to scents, this would be good for you! It still has a good smelling, very soft scent. You don’t need to use a lot because a little goes a long ways. I’ve used this twice now, and I’m impressed! It’s such a good product, and even though a little on the spendy side, I would recommend this product for sure. Good quality!
