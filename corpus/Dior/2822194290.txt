This product was very moisturizing and I liked that it didn’t leave an oily residue on my skin. However, it wasn’t any better than other products of this type that I’ve tried. I wouldn’t say it’s worth the price but I’ll definitely use it up. I received this for free from Influenster to test out but all opinions are my own. Nice but not spectacular
