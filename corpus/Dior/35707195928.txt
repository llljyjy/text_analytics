I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. What a game changer! Winter had done a number on my mature skin. Dry flaky spots contributed to uneven foundation coverage. After using this balm daily, my skin is smooth and absorbent. This thick balm is great for spot treatment for all over body use too. Highly recommended! Miracle in a tube!
