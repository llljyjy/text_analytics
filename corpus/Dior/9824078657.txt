This was sent to me by Influenster to try for free. the bottle itself is an off white cream color, and the feel is definitely more high end than regular drugstore products. Very smooth. The product itself is just as refined. It has a light scent of Water Lilies, that’s not overpowering or harsh. It honestly reminds me of fresh linens. The product is white, smooth, but a little grainy, and is kind of similar to Neutrogena’s Deep Clean Cleanser. only in appearance though. For me. this product was INSANELY more effective on my skin (which is combination and sensitive). I just want to say, I could literally feel this cleanser, in my pores. I only used about a pea sized amount for my whole face (!) and it foamed, not a huge amount, but enough that I could tell it had emulsified into my skin. This face wash is akin to getting a spa treatment, without the cost. My skin feels dewy. clean, and looks bright and refreshed. So Impressed! For such a high end brand, it’s relatively costly effective going between $40-$50 and it is worth every. single. penny. Effective and Soothing
