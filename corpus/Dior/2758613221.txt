This product definitely felt luxe. The mousse texture was really nice, and it had a nice floral scent to it. However, it is definitely one of those cleansers that will give you that squeaky clean feelings after you rinse it off. So if you have dry skin, it can be quite drying. It burned my skin a little bit as well, but not too much. That may just be from the smell. Slightly Drying and Irritating
