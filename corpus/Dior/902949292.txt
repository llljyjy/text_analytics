I decided to try this on only one eye for the first week. I think I noticed a very slight difference but not really sure. The lotion is easy to dispense and apply with the little metal tip. I liked that the tip was cold, that probably helps. There is no scent which is nice and it absorbed pretty quickly. I do think one week is a little hard to fully judge it by but so far it seems pretty good. Pretty good so far
