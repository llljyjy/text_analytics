This product is fairly thick coming out of the tube but applies smoothly onto the skin. I use it on my face, neck, and hands. After using, my skin is much softer and looks smoother. It does not have a scent. I really like it. I just would prefer it to be a little lighter coming out of the tube. I definitely will continue to use and do recommend. Hydrates my skin well
