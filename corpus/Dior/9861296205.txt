This serum has some bold claims. That it firms and plumps your skin by 55% in 4 hours. Those claims are true. Around the 4 hour mark my smile lines are less noticeable. I have sensitive skin and this doesn’t break me out. There is a slight fragrance but it isn’t headache inducing. It dissipates after about 10 minutes on me. It makes my skin feel incredible. I received this product from Influenster for my honest review. Beautiful product
