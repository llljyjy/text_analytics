I’ve always used Dior cosmetics but this is my first time trying something from there skincare line. I’ve received this product from influenster to review. To begin, I love the packaging it feels very luxurious. I have dry and sensitive skin so I did feel the water lily in this product cleanse my skin nicely and not strip the natural oils in my skin. I would recommend this product to anybody looking for a new facial cleanser. Luxurious and Fresh Cleanser
