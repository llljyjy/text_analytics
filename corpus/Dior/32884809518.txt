I used this balm especially on the face and on some specific parts of the body like the elbow, for example, to feel the effectiveness and repair.  I would say that it is better to use it on the body (but the amount in the package is small for this purpose) rather than on the face (if you have an oily face, as it does not have a dry touch).  It is a good product, but there are other cheaper options with the same benefit. Good product
