I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. This Dior serum is amazing. I immediately felt a difference in skin firmness after the first application. I have been using this serum daily for the past few weeks and my skin looks fantastic. My skin is soft and firm. I notice less wrinkles and fine lines. The serum is light and hydrating. It doesnâ€™t leave my skin oily or greasy, which is important to me because I have oily skin. The serum does have a floral fragrance when applied, but It only lasts a moment. I am happy to continue using this serum and see continued results. My New Favorite Serum
