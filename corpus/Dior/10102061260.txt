This is a very nice balm.   It is a little lighter than I would expect from a balm but does a nice job.   It does not irritate my eyes if I get it too close to them. I like that it is not scented.   I’ve used it mostly on my face but it is winter in the Midwest and I have had a scratch between my index and middle fingers since December that just didn’t seem to be getting enough moisture to heal.  So I’ve rubbed in the remaining balm when I’m done applying it to my face and it is finally healing nicely. Regular hand cream was not doing the trick.  All in all. I’m very happy with it for my aging (cough, cough, I’m pushing 50) skin in wintertime. Light and effective
