I received this product for free from Influenster and Dior for my honest review. I think I might be in love since the very first time I used this product my face has been as soft as a baby’s bottom and it’s also been so smooth and has made my skin very hydrated and we’ll let’s not forget about how my face is so glowy I kinda feel like this serum has special powers because I even seen instant results as well the wrinkles on my forehead and in the corner of my mouth are like completely gone. Now instead of having a 10 step routine I’ve been able to drop it down to just cleansing, toning and the Dior serum which is amazing my face stay so hydrated and plump I’m in love thank you so much influenster and Dior for allowing me to try this product out. Im on love
