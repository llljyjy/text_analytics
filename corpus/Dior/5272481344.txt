I started to test this before I got my lash extensions done and then I’d use it sparingly since I wanted to be careful in general but the times I was using it I did enjoy it. It feels really gentle and soft and lathers well too. It has that high end fragrance that most high end makeup has but it doesn’t bother me like those do because this one feels a bit softer of a scent. I actually enjoy the smell since it smells clean and fresh yet feminine. But if you’re someone who is sensitive to smells, you might wanna steer clear of this one. One other thing I also am enjoying is my skin does feel soft after I rinse it off and I’m a sucker for that! As for moisturizing I have combo/oily skin so I haven’t really kept track of how much a difference it makes so i’m not 100% sure on that. You do get a ton of product since it’s a big bottle and you don’t have to use all that much so it will last but it is a bit pricey. You can find ones that work similarly or better for a way better price so it’s totally up to personal preference if you wanna splurge or not. i likey
