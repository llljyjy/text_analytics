The Dior Cica Recover & Repair Multi-use Balm is a good cream for face and body. I received a tube to try from Influenster. I used the cream on my dry arms and as a night cream before going to bed. It hydrated my face and arms and did not leave a greasy residue. The cream has no detectable scent. For the price, I feel this cream is too expensive to use on the body. There are so many other body creams and lotions that can moisturize for less money. That is why I gave it three stars. I will probably use this as my next night cream. Otherwise it is a nice cream. Good Multi-Use Cream
