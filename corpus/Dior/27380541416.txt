I really wanted to love this product. It looks, smells, and feels very luxurious. It just didn’t work for me. I normally wash my face with a salicylic acid cleanser and then apply adapalene/benzoyl peroxide (so my face is pretty used to harsh things). However, when I washed my face with this product, my cheeks started to turn red and very warm. Afterwards, I made the dumb decision of applying my acid and omg. The stinging was real. My cheeks got insanely red, my face was burning up. I tried using it without the acid after and it still leaves my face a bit rosy and very tight. Another issue I have with the product is the packaging. I understand that a screw bottle looks more luxurious than a pump or pop on/off cap. But it’s just so inconvenient to use. You have to be holding the bottle in one hand, squeeze the product onto the other hand, then you have to put the bottle down because one hand already has product (and hope that the cleanser doesn’t ooze out while you wash your face), and then finally screw the cap back on when you wash your hands. Luxurious, but not for me
