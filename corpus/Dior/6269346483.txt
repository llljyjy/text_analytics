I used this product only at night. I have sensitive skin so I cleanse with only water in the morning. I used this after a cleansing balm, and found it not stripping at all. Itâ€™s a very gentle cleanser and has a mild floral fragrance. It starts out creamy but foams up and has a decent lather. Overall I loved the experience- it feels very luxurious. I really enjoyed it! Very luxurious!
