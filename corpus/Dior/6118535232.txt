I am obsessed with this cleanser!! The first thing you’ll notice as you go to use it is the scent. This scent needs to be a perfume. I purposely take my time when using this just to indulge on the smell alone. Next you’ll noticed how well it cleans your face. It completely strips away dirt and excess oil. But I will highly suggest using a moisturizer after use. My nose dried out a little. The last thing that you may love is how well it removes makeup. I tried it out on a medium coverage foundation and it completely removed all traces of makeup without me having to use anything additional before or after. This is now my go to for a cleanser/makeup remover. And I’ll surely save money with this because I only need a dime size amount. nan
