I received this product to test out in exchange for an honest review. I’ve been using this for a little over a week and I love it! My hands/elbows get really dry and there are few products I’ve found to tackle the dryness and this product is great for those areas! I have very sensitive skin and I didn’t have a bad reaction to it at all. I would definitely recommend this product if you’re looking for a non greasy, quick absorbing product for your skin. nan
