I am 46 with fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes. I do not have Botox or fillers in my face. I have been using Diorâ€™s Super Potent Eye Serum for three weeks, twice a day and noticed a slight difference in the reduction of my lines around my eyes. It has brightened my under eye and reduced the puffiness. It works extremely well under makeup with no pilling too. The applicator is brilliant and makes it effortless. It massages the product into my delicate skin. The serum is light and a bit cooling. I look forward to applying it because of the applicator. The bottle is gorgeous and I love to display it on my vanity. Excellent application
