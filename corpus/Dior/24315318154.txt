I was sent this product free from Influenster for testing and review. The product is a balm-moisturizer hybrid. It’s not an occlusive salve. It sinks into the skin very quickly and works very well under makeup with no pilling. It doesn’t clog my pores, and it has a soothing and faint chamomile scent. I have oily and acne-prone skin, and this product worked really well for me. It moisturized well without causing acne or irritation. I wouldn’t use this product on my body since the size is relatively small. Moisturizing and sensitive skin friendly
