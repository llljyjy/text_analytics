This product is amazing!!! I My 55+ year-old hyper-sensitive skin gets red and blotchy with most products. The Cica Recover Balm made my face and neck feel nourished and supple - no greasy or oily feel - and is so gentle I had no skin reaction. Itâ€™s a lightweight cream product that applies easily to face and neck There was also no lingering fragrance and my skin feels hydrated  for hours and healthy. Love it!! Fabulous gentle skincare!!
