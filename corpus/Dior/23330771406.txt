For reference I have combo-oily acne-prone skin. I quite like this cleanser, it is a cream cleanser that builds up to a lather easily. I haven’t tested it with thicker makeup yet, but for what I wear on a day to day basis it takes off my makeup very well. When compared to my other cleansers, I feel as though this one takes it off quicker. I only need a small amount and the bottle itself is a good size. I also like the design of the bottle, it is a minimalistic white design that kind of reminds me of a sunscreen bottle (not in a bad way). I also notice that this cleanser does not dry out my skin and I feel nice and clean after. I have also noticed that my skin looks a bit clearer after using this but am unsure if it is directly related. As for the cons, this cleanser does have fragrance. It is a floral scent that isn’t very strong but it is noticeably there. Those with sensitive skin might want to avoid for this reason. The second thing I disliked was that this cleanser does sting your eyes a bit. Those with sensitive eyes might want to avoid for this reason as well. As for the price point, I don’t factor in price into my ratings, but I personally don’t think it is worth it. There are many other cleansers that work in a similar manner and there isn’t exactly anything that makes it stand out in particular. As I mentioned though I did find it took off my makeup quicker than others and I like it for that reason. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good everyday cleanser from a luxury brand. nan
