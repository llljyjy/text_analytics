I received my Dior Cica Balm and love love love it! It’s lightweight goes on super smooth and absorbs into your skin without fragrance . I use it nightly after cleansing my face. I looked up pricing on it and it ranges from $39 to $80 in price. It’s an amazing product so I would pay the higher price for it. Love it!
