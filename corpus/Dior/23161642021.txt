I was so excited to receive this product! It’s a super hydrating, luxurious balm/lotion that is amazing for dry, winter skin. I use this product morning & night and have found it’s great for wearing on its own and for priming my skin before makeup to get rid of dry patches. It smells exactly like chamomile tea which makes it feel even more luxurious. The texture is pretty thick but it spreads easily, so a little goes a long way. It could also be great as body lotion or for any dry patches on your body. The size of the tube is pretty big so i think it will last me quite a while. Would definitely recommend this product, especially if you have dry skin! So Luxurious!
