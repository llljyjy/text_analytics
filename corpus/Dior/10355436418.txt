I started using this while i was on accutane so that helped but 5 months later i still use it and honestly swear by it. After i stopped accutane I still had redness and hyper pigmentation and it’s reduced dramatically and i confidently say it’s 70% because of this. i’ve noticed nights that i don’t use this my skin looks way more red and dull the next morning compared to nights that i do. I use it mornings and nights and it looks great under makeup and lasts me a while too. 100% worth the price it’s like a miracle in a bottle. acne prone and hyperpigmentation miracle
