This balm is one of the best I have ever used.  Creamy and rich.  Initially, I tried it on face but then discovered using on multiple dry spots on my body.  Almost immediately, I could feel the difference in the moisture on those spots.I highly recommend this!  I received this product as a free sample for my honest review. Creamy and rich!
