Very hydrating balm for winter skin.  I have used this at night over the last few days over my serum and my skin feels smooth and hydrated.  A little goes a long way, I used a pea sized amount, rub it between my fingers and pat into my skin.  I use the remaking amount on the back of my hands.  Love this balm!!I like that it has no fragrance too excellent balm for winter skin
