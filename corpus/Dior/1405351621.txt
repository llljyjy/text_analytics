Not a fan of floral/powder scents, but this cream is surprisingly lightweight and softens skin within a few uses. It absorbs easily and provides results fairly quickly. I’m not sure if I’d suggest this for oily skin or acne prone skin but it would likely suit dry, mature or aging skin very well. nan
