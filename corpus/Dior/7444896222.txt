It is a good eye serum. I have fine lines and dark circle. After using this eye serum for a couple of weeks, I can say that this eye serum is very hydrating which helps to soften fine lines. I also like the texture of the cream which is not too thick. So, it gets absorbed into the skin nicely. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good eye cream/serum.I have not purchased this on my own but I will from now onwards. Good One
