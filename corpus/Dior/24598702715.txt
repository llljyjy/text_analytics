I used this cleanser for two weeks and have mixed feelings. It felt very harsh on my skin and irritated my eyes. I feel like this would could easily irritate sensitive skin. It’s an effective cleanser and lathers nicely. My skin was very clean after using it. But I didn’t feel or see any skincare benefits. This is also a scented product which is something to consider. Meh
