I received this product free for review from Influenster and Dior. The Dior Capture Totale Super Potent Eye Serum might have been good, but it had so little product in it I was only able to use it for 3 days. Thatâ€™s from a full size product. I loved the applicator though it was cooling, and soothing to my eyes. Just another eye product
