This moisturizer is amazing.  It is the perfect balance between oily and dry leaving me with a perfect dewy glow with an intense moisture being added to my skin.  The only critique I would give is the the packaging although minimal feels cheap.  I wish it had a pump top with the same tube rather than the squeeze top to better control the amount of product being dispensed. This was a great product to be gifted by Influenster! nan
