Loving this serum!  I love the metal tip applicator.  It is soothing and cooling, really helps with fine lines and puffiness.  I have been using for a few days.  My eyes are a little brighter, puffiness definitely coming down.  Just be careful when applying not to squeeze the tube because the serum can come flooding out and this isnâ€™t a product you want to waste! Love It
