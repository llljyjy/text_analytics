This definitely feels like an ~expensive~ cleanser. The scent leans towards mature floral when you’re actively using it (which did turn me off a little when I used it for the first time not gonna lie) but your face ends up smelling just lightly fresh after you’re done. I have pretty sensitive skin and adding this cleanser into my routine did NOT make me break out at all, so we love that. Skin feels squeaky clean and hydrated after using. My main reason for reducing one star is that it says you can use it for makeup removal, but it really does not do that very well and especially does not remove any eye makeup and actually reallllyyy stings if it gets in your eyes, which is not ideal if you are trying to get your makeup off with it!! All in all, very nice cleanser just don’t get it in your eyes She is nice!
