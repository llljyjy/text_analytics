After using this serum several nights as part of my nighttime skincare routine, I noticed the skin under my eyes to be more smooth and awake the morning after use. I didn’t notice a huge difference in my fine lines around my eyes, but the brightness and tightness were noticeable. The applicator is nice and cooling—but I tended to just want to apply to the skin directly with my finger. Pricey product but a great eye serum! nan
