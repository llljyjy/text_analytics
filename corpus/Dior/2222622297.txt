I have extremely dry skin and I was using another face wash prior to this one and it was just drying me out to the point where my husband would ask why my skin looked dry and he never notices nothing like that. Anyways I was so excited I was getting this to try out because I have used dior skincare in the past and absolutely loved it. This is a very moisturizing face wash , as soon as I dried my face after using it my skin felt so soft and moisturized ! I will continue to use it and update with my overall opinion but so far I love it ! This product was given to me an exchange of my honest review from Influenster. Great for dry skin
