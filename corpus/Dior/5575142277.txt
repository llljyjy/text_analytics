Even if this cleanser has fragrance in it which i usually try to steer away in my skincare. It’s not too harsh and my sensitive skin doesn’t have a reaction to it. I would suggest though not suing this everyday, especially if you have dry skin. Maybe twice a week would be good. Follow with a moisturizer cause it can feel a little dry after wards Gentle
