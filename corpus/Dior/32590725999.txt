I received this product from influenster in exchange for my honest review. I absolutely love this product! Iâ€™ve been using this face wash a few weeks now and it is definitely a new staple in my skin care routine. Nice, sturdy packaging, good consistency and foams up on your face with just a little product. Leaves your face feeling really clean, no residue and not feeling overly dried out. I will be purchasing in the future! Love,love love!
