The applicator is so nice it felt cooling and it glides so smooth no tugging on that delicate skin, unfortunately the serum is kinda scented and it made my eyes water and sting a little instantly, I gave it to my mom and she loves it, I haven’t seen much change in her burly isn’t only been a week or so. I got it from influenster Meh
