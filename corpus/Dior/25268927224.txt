I was really shocked by the thick texture of this cleanser—definitely felt closer to a nighttime moisturizer! Loved the creaminess and I would consider using this item more, but the fragrance was too stringent around my nose. Will be using irregularly as a result. Smells like Oil of Olay, which doesn’t bother me but I could see bothering other people. Creamy, but too stringent
