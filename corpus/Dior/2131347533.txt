I enjoy this serum. Iâ€™ve tried other items in this line, and they all have one common thing that turns me away slightly though, the scent. I feel like scents like this are common in high end skincare and makeup products. This is why I gave one less star. Other than the scent, I love this product. It makes my skin so smooth and makes it appear fresh and renewed. I cannot wait to see the longer term results. I would consider purchasing when I run out of what I have. A nice addition!
