“J’adore Dior!“ should become their general tag phrase, not just a perfume name!I’m absolutely becoming a fan of all things Dior!This lotion/balm absorbs almost instantly leaving a truly hydrated, greaseless feeling.I typically use about a dime sized amount, so as far as the price goes... I feel like the tube won’t last long and most people won’t justify the high cost.I’m not “most people“ though, so I’ll splurge!  The quality of the product is 5 stars in my book! Worth the Splurge!
