I was pleasantly surprised by this product! So many moisturizers are way too heavy for my face, but this felt light and it absorbed really really well. I love that it is fragrance-free. I used good lotion on half my face and neck for several days, and I could definitely feel the difference in the texture of my skin. The lotion side was very soft and smooth compared to the other side of my face. I recommend this product! I was given a free sample to test and review by influencer and Dior. My opinion is my own Excellent product
