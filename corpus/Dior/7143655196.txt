I was pleasantly surprised at the results from this eye serum. I’ve been using it for 12 days and I love how it has hydrated my eye area, minimized my bags, and brightened my eye area. It’s very lightweight yet keeps my eyes hydrated most of the day. And it’s a dream under makeup. It doesn’t get cakey or flake. I would definitely recommend this product if you are looking for a good eye serum. Pleasantly surprised
