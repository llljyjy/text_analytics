I just have to say I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed using the Dior Cica Recover and Repair Multi Use Balm. I love that it is fragrance free, unlike most Dior products. Itâ€™s very rich but it sinks into the skin quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated with no greasy feeling. I have found it to be calming and soothing to my sensitive skin, particularly on my neck which is easily irritated. I applied it in the morning in place of my regular moisturizer and it worked really well with a full face of makeup. This definitely has a permanent place in my skincare regimen Good stuff
