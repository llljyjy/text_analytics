I tried this balm over the course of a couple weeks, and I really like it! The only drawback is that it doesn’t sit well under makeup like other moisturizers I’ve tried and foundation tends to slip and separate, and maybe that was just user error and I need to try it out again and let it soak into my skin fully before I put foundation over top, but it does really well on its own at keeping my skin hydrated all day. I have dry sensitive skin, and my skin gets really dry during the winter. I also live in a dry state and I work in healthcare so between the dry air, winter, and constant hand sanitizer, this balm has been a relief to my skin. I’ve used it on my hands and my face and it’s really nice. It’s slightly heavier than the water based moisturizers I’ve used but it’s not so heavy that it’s noticeable on the skin. I think it’s really nice and it does last all day. I will say my skin does feel a little oilier than if I were to use a water based moisturizer, but it is really nice especially if you have dry skin, and I like it especially as a hand moisturizer because it’s not as oily or as heavy as other body moisturizers can be.
