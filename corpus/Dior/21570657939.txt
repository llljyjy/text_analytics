This balm impressed me! I used it to moisturize dry patches on my skin (winter had not been kind to my hands) and I saw results immediately! And it’s fragrance free which is a very nice touch. I’m not a huge fan of fragrance in skin care because it typically leaves me with a headache but this is totally scentless. Overall this is a great product but giving 4 stars instead of 5 because of the price. nan
