I seriously love this cleanser so much. I am a person wholikes to do one step cleansing for my makeup removing.Recently all the cleansers I use were having residues of mywaterproof eye liner so I had to use eye makeup removerwith cotton balls. But this one has no residues behind. Alsowhen you rub the cleanser on your face it creates goodamount of foams which feels so good. After cleansing ithas no strong feeling on your skin. Skin still feelsmoisturized after cleansing with this cleanser. My favorite cleanser from now on
