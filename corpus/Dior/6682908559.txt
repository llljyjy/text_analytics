I’ve been using this on my dry and cracked hands for 3 days and they’ve been transformed. They are no longer cracking or rough. My hands have turned soft and don’t look or feel dry anymore. I’ve used it on my feet as well and they’re super soft. I would love it even more if it were more affordable. It’s an excellent product that many people won’t be able to enjoy because of the price point. I’m torn on whether or not to purchase after this is finished because it’s hard to justify the cost Healed cracked and dry hands
