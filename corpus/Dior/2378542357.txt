My face has been chapped and dry this winter. Many products cause irritation- redness or breakouts for my sensitive combo skin, but this has not at all. It doesnâ€™t leave my face greasy, and I was able to apply makeup over it without an issue. I also add it throughout the day if needed. Not much of a scent, and I find it soothing on my chapped areas Perfect for sensitive skin
