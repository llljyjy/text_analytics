I was so excited to receive Dior’s new cleanser for review and am happy to report that I really enjoyed it. It foams up beautifully with a very concentrated formula. A little goes a long way here, so there’s so need to use much more than a pea size amount. It easily removes all traces of makeup and oil, but does not leave the skin feeling stripped. If I could change one thing about it, I would turn the fragrance down a couple notches. Otherwise, I really enjoy this cleanser and would recommend for any luxury skincare lovers with normal skin type. nan
