I really liked this multi use balm by Dior. I found it to be rich, non-greasy, quick absorbing, immensely hydrating & the benefits are long lasting.I am using it on my neck, décolleté & elbows , although I did try it as a mask & it hydrated quite well.With a combination of camomile hyaluronic acid & Shea butter it’s easy to see how this super rich balm will calm, nourish & hydrate.I was lucky to get this as a promotion, but will definitely continue to purchase in the future.It’s also gentle, made from 91% natural ingredients & suitable for all skin types, even sensitive. Try It…. Your Skin Will Thank You….
