I sampled this moisturizer for free through Influenster. I used it exclusively over a scar on my back from a recent mole removal. I guess for the price of this product I was expecting more of a miracle in the reduction of redness at my scar, so I was a bit disappointed. I will say, if you’re in the market for cream that’s non-greasy and suitable for sensitive skin, this is the one. I just couldn’t personally justify the price to buy for myself. Worth a look for sensitive skin
