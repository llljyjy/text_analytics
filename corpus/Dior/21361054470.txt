This is my first kind of any skincare from Dior and I am pleasantly surprised. I have oily skin and it did a great job of cleaning my skin. It left my skin feeling moisturized and soft unlike some cleansers that strip the skin. My only caution is that it does have a strong smell but since it is not on my skin for that long I donâ€™t mind it too much. nan
