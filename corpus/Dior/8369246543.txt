I really liked this product - it’s really moisturizing without feeling heavy or greasy, and works well in both my AM and PM routines so it’s super easy to add into my rotation! I also like how versatile it is and how it can be used as more of a sleeping mask too. There’s no harsh fragrance which is really nice as well. Definitely staying in my routine! nan
