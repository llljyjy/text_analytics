This little product packs a big punch. I love trying eye serums and although this one is pricey it definitely makes a difference. I have darkish circles under my eyes and in almost two weeks they look so much lighter. I love the whole application process and itâ€™s super relaxing to apply and rub in with the applicator. My under eye area is moisturized because of this serum and that feeling lasts all day long. However, it still absorbs really well and does not look greasy. I also notice that the little lines by my eyes are less noticeable. I look forward to using this even longer and seeing even more incredible results. Dark circles gone
