I received this product in my Influenster voxbox in exchange for my honest review. I an excited to say that this balm leaves my skin hydrated and more supple. It is a light cream with ni fragrance or stickiness. And I had no sensitivity issues or breakout on my dry sensitive skin. It left it feeling soft and looking more vibrant.  Dior is known for quality skin care and this is a lovely addition to their line if products. I love this Cica bakm!
