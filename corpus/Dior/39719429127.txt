Well I am a mom of toddler twins who has little time for skin routines or to care for herself I’m always tired and from health issues I either have puffy eyes dark circles or both this eye serum was amazing from the convenient dispenser to how calming the cream felt I am always a skeptic and this actually exceeded my expectations I definitely have noticed a difference in my drains and puffiness has drastically reduced and looks so much better also it was easy to apply makeup and the like after the eye serum! I will be buying this for sure I received it for free for a honest review and to be honest I can’t wait to see how I look after I finish the tube! Tired twin mom
