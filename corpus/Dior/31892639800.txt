I am one of those people who always have multiple hand creams/lotions in rotation. My skin is sensitive and dry and my face is acne-prone and sensitive. I tried this on my face and it was too thick and caused some breakout. I used this for a couple weeks as a hand cream though and it performs great. It kept my hands, arms and elbows moisturized throughout the day. I have used similar products that were equal or better in quality at a lower price point. nan
