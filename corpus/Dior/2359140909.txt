I wanted to like this balm, but it didn’t really hydrate my lips and wore off very quickly. I found myself reapplying every 10 min. The colour was gorgeous, so I gave it three stars. The scent is floral and kinda strong, and if you get it in your mouth, it’s weird. The balm is also very thin when on the lips and doesn’t coat lips well. I love Dior lip glow balm, and I will continue to stick to that balm from Dior. nan
