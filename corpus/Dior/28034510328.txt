The OFF/ON foaming cleanser was pleasant to use and surprisingly effective! I rubbed a small amount onto my face, then dampened my hands and lathered the cleanser until it was foaming. That initial portion was enough to clean the makeup from my entire face! I used cotton rounds to remove the makeup, especially around my eyes, where lathering caused irritation because of my eyeliner. I then continued with the rest of my skincare routine. My skin felt clean and refreshed! A Little Goes A Long Way
