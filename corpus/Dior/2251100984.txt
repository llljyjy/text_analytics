I received this eye serum in a VoxBox in exchange for an honest review. Overall Iâ€™m impressed with this product. It has a luxurious, thicker feel with an amazing applicator. The metal applicator  provides a cooling effect around your eyes during application, which feel wonderful especially when getting ready in the morning.  I have noticed some difference in my fine lines and puffiness around my eyes and am eager to see that progress with continued use. The smell was perfume like. Definitely worth trying! Definitely worth trying!
