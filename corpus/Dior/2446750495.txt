I received this product free to try. The biggest positive for me is the applicator. It’s cooling and I do like how it goes on. It’s dries nice and my makeup wears over it great. It does have a fragrance but I like it. I have used it quite a bit but don’t notice a ton of change in my under eyes. Also I feel like the price point his pretty high. Just okay
