I’ve used this creme for 4 years now. One jar will last you a long time as you don’t need much. I have used it as a day and night creme. Even with combination skin, it does not make me oily throughout the day or make me break out. I’m in my 30s and feel like it is a great product for someone getting serious about skincare. It moisturizes without feeling heavy and leaves your skin feeling nice and supple. I do feel like for this price point you can get a moisturizer with more skincare benefits. This is a great basic moisturizer if you are willing to splurge! Great moisturizer for combo skin.
