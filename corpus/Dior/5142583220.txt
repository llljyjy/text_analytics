I was actually impressed with how It instantly reduced puffiness. This product has a unique metal applicator tip that smoothly applies the product with a cooling effect similar to one of those jade rollers. It has a very light clean scent and after 14 days of use it does appear to be helping with very fine lines and is visibly brighter around my eye area.  Is does have a tendency though to sit on top of the skin and feel a little sticky. I always feel like I have to pat it in after using the applicator. There was also no directions on the product and the QR code didn’t work for me. I ended up having to go to the website to see the recommendation for use. Not that big of a deal but it was annoying. Overall a good but expensive product. Bye Bye puffiness…
