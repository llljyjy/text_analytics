FINALLY a product that I can use on my very sensitive skin.  I quickly added this product to my night routine of cleansing and moisturizing.  Then I use it in the morning underneath my makeup.  This product leaves my skin feeling so soft.  I would have given it 5 stars but it is a little more expensive than I would normally pay for a moisturizer. nan
