I received this product for free to review from Influenster. These are my honest opinions: For the most part, I enjoy this cleanser. It reminds me of some of the more silky K-beauty cleansers. You don’t need a lot, and when you clean your face, you feel like it is getting clean. With these cleansers, when you get that super clean feeling, it can sometimes leave your skin feeling stripped of oils. The Dior Cleanser does not leave my face feeling stripped, tight or dry.   The cleanser also effectively removes makeup. Very easily removes eyeliner and mascara, and really anything without leaving any residue. I have used this cleanser for a month, and I have had no issues with breakouts or any irritation. It even kept my skin relatively clear from hormonal acne at the time of the month. My biggest issue with this cleanser is the scent. I am not fond of Dior’s powdery florals, and I certainly don’t care for the scent used in this cleanser, Considering it is used right next to your nose, the smell is incredibly overpowering. I normally do not mind fragrance, but this one is too strong for me personally. Otherwise, it’s a wonderful cleanser. Due to its scent, I wouldn’t purchase it again, but I would consider buying it if they made the scent barely there or eliminate it entirely. nan
