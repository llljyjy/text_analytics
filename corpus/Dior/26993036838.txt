I received this from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This face cleanser is fantastic. I used a pea sized amount and it lathered up enough for my whole face. It smells amazing - like a luxury perfume. The smell isn’t too strong, it’s subtle. My face felt fresh and no residue was left on my face after washing. I have sensitive combination skin that is oily and can be dry. This took off the oil while also moisturizing the dry spots. It wasn’t too harsh for my sensitive skin. I love that it has clean ingredients. I typically use Cerave Salicylic Acid Cleanser, but this is my new favorite! My skin looked fresh and clean after and it healed pimples I already had on my face. No new pimples showed up.  I would highly recommend this and I am very happy with how my skin looks! Dior, Dior Face Wash
