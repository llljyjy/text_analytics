After using this product for almost a month, I am very impressed. As a mom of a toddler, I don’t get much sleep and I noticed after two weeks that my dark eyes disappeared and my under eye area looks much brighter. My eyes don’t look as puffy and I liked that I could combine this serum with my current eye cream. Although it’s an extra step to my skincare routine is very much worth it. I would highly recommend this product and will purchase it in the future. My only complain is the packaging, not the easiest when it comes to getting the right amount of product out. My new favorite eye serum!
