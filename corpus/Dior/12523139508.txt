I tried going into testing this product with a very impartial point of view, trying not to get too excited over the fact that it is Dior (but, I mean, DIOR. Come on). Luckily, my hype was not misplaced. The first thing I noticed was the wonderful texture and weight of the product. I’ve got SUPER dry skin and it has been UNHAPPY lately. The thick cream consistency was so good on my skin. I worried it would be a bit drying, since my face did feel very clean afterwards, but it left a nice amount of moisture behind. There is a slight powdery smell to it that I didn’t love, but it goes away very quickly upon rinsing. I followed up the cleanser with my usual evening routine and my skin feels SO nice this morning. ALSO, I was expecting this to be much more expensive that it actually is. Don’t get me wrong, it’s pricey, but it also does feel very luxury so the price feels consistent. Dry Skin Approved
