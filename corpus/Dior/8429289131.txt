I love this face wash mousse! It is so light and leaves my skin feeling so smooth. The consistency is really fluffy and a little goes a long way. Also removes makeup surprising well! I will say that if you have sensitive eyes make sure to avoid them because it did sting mine a little - nothing unbearable though. Love it!
