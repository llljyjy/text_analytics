I’ve been trying to find a replacement for Amore Pacifics face cleanser. This product has great reviews so I decided to try it out even though it’s more expensive than Amore Pacific. I bought it at the store and must have had a bad bottle. Oil came out a lot at first and the cleanser came out a bit chunky. This cleanser is heavily perfumed, did not remove eye or face make up well, and my face felt like it still had a layer on it. I tried it for a week and just couldn’t anymore. Returned. For $62 before taxes this should be amazing. Bad tube?
