My Skin is absolutely loving Dior Cica Repair and Recovery Balm! I have very dry hands from frequent daily washing and have tried tons of different brands to no avail. This has literally healed my chapped hands! I also have itchy, uncomfortable skin from a thyroid condition and this is a game changer. The chamomile and centella asiatica in this balm must be the cream of the crop because it worked immediately to calm,soothe and hydrate my skin everywhere I’ve been using it! It’s almost like a medecine but in a soft,easily absorbed,silky skincare form! It doesn’t feel heavy or greasy either like so many others I have tried! Dior Cica R&R Balm has pride of place on my skincare shelf now and I plan to keep it that way! A literal skin savior!
