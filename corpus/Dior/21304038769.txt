This balm is so moisturizing and perfect for my sensitive skin! It’s unbelievably amazing and I wouldn’t ask for a better multi use balm, with all of the soothing effects as well it calmed some of the redness from a breakout, it smoothed and evenly moisturized my skin so well and worked perfect with my skin. The unscented balm was helpful as well because my skin is so sensitive but this product my skin absolutely loves and I probably will never change from this product! What a game changer! Excellent for sensitive skin
