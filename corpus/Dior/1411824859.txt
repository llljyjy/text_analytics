A few weeks ago I received the @diorbeauty Super Potent Eye Serum from Influenster (for free, in exchange for three website reviews but not obligated to post on instagram).I wanted to post about it here because I think it’s important for people to understand that luxury fashion brands have historically been known to churn out very basic formulated skincare products and put an insane price tag on them. They rely on people recognizing their name and hope that their reputation in fashion carries over to their skincare, causing people to lust after and buy their products. I used to have a minor internal rage when clients would tell me they only use Chanel skincare and want to know why their skin is in bad shape.I’d say within the past five to seven years most major luxury brands have stepped up their formulas and really started to adjust to the growing demand for effective products. I used to like Chanel makeup and I feel like makeup has been a different story. Some of the major fashion houses have put effort into making better skincare products. It’s great (although they’re still overpriced).But why do so many of them continue to include super offensive, irritating and overpowering fragrance in their skincare? Especially an EYE cream/ treatment, which in my educated opinion should never have fragrance.This eye treatment doesn’t irritate my eyes, which shocked me as the fragrance is incredibly strong.  So strong that I’m pretty nervous to regularly use it.It’s a thin and serum-like formula with a jasmine heavy scent. It feels hydrating and pleasant on the skin. No sticky or tacky feeling. It contains niacinamide, adenosine and ascorbyl glucoside (vitamin c). It has potential but I’ll never be able to tell because I don’t want to use it around my eyes.The applicator is so nice and cooling too, great for a bit of lymph drainage massage.But i’ll be using it up on my feet. Heavily fragranced
