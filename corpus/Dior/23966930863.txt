I received this product for free from Influenster and Sephora in exchange for my honest review. I keep it in the shower and use it morning and night. A little bit goes a long way, and it lathers nicely. It has a nice smell that is not overpowering. My skin feels clean and soft after using it.  I would purchase this product when this tube runs out. nan
