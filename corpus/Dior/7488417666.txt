I received these products for free from Influenster and Dior in exchange for my honest review.  I’ve been using this product for 2 weeks and I can see the difference in my skin already.  My skin is alot brighter and plumper than before.  I noticed the smoothness after just the first day. The serum is creamy and has a very light texture.  This is also moisturizing enough for me and didn’t need to apply any separately.   It does have a nice floral smell that may be too strong for some.   I will keep this in rotation in my skin care routine. Bright and Smooth
