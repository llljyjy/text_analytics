This is an eye serum that helps diminish puffiness, fine lines, and dark circles. It’s very lightweight and has a light scent, but I do wish it was a cream instead so it can be more moisturizing. It applies and dries pretty easily as well. It also has an applicator tip that you can use to help massage your eye area, but I personally like using my fingers. I’ve been using this both in my morning and night routine for a couple of weeks and I have noticed very slight differences. My main concerns are fine lines and dark circles and I have noticed the area is a tiny bit more taut and just a bit brighter. I think I have to use it more to see more results, but so far I’m happy with it. nan
