Dior kindly gifted me the off/on foaming cleanser to try out and review. This foaming cleanser has a thick consistency and foams up quite a bit. A little product has been plenty for my second cleanse after an oil cleanser. It feels really nice during and after application and doesn’t dry my face out. I also like the clean scent it has. Won’t dry your skin
