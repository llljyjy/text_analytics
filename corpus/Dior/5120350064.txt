I received Dior Capture Totale Le Sérum Anti-Aging Serum (1oz) fromInfluenster and Dior for my honest review. Followed the directions aswritten for the past seven days, and I have seen a dramatic change in thefine lines, firmness and texture of my skin. With winter, my skin dries outpretty fast after cleansing. But, since using this product for the past weekmy skin feels hydrated, firm and smooth. Also used this product (1 pump) onmy neck in the morning, and I noticed a beautiful change there as well. Ithas a nice scent that my hubby just loves. It is non-sticky and has notcaused me to breakout, which comes easily to me. This product is veryluxurious and I highly recommend this product. Thank you Dior andInfluenster for allowing me to review this beautiful product. Dior Capture Totale Le Sérum Anti-Aging Serum 1oz
