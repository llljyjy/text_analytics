I was given the chance to try this Cica Recovery Balm for face and body from #Influenster and #Dior in exchange for my honest opinion. This is my true experience with the product, yours may vary. I have combination skin. The typical oily T-zone and dry cheeks. I have struggled to find a product that helps both. Usually it helps one concern and makes the other worse. This balm is so good it took care of the dry patches on my cheeks and did not make the oily parts worse. I’ve been using this Recovery balm for well over a month now and have only used maybe 1/4th of the tube. I only need about the size of a pea of the balm to spread over my face and neck. It goes on so smooth and is instantly absorbed into my skin leaving it feeling hydrated and smooth not greasy or sticky. The dry patches on my cheeks are completely gone and the rest of my face does not get any oilier than before so for me that makes this totally worth it. I have never been the one to buy high-end or pricier products but in this case I believe this balm is worth every penny. From now on I won’t waste money on cheaper moisturizers that do not work, I will be buying this Dior balm. We are worth it. We deserve to have good skin, and this balm is the answer for me.
