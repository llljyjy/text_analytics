First off, the smell. It is heavenly! Rich and luxurious. It has a powdery floral hint that reminds me of my grandmother (and this is a most positive highlight of the product for me!). Next, it is so foaming and makes a great bubbly lather. A little tiny bit goes a long way! Perfect, because I never want to run out! Lastly, it really cleanses your skin. I feel fresh faced and actually relaxed after using this! I love it!! THE BEST THERE IS
