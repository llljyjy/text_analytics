I really enjoyed using the Cica Recover & Repair balm. I got it at a time my hands and my face needed help and I was willing to do anything to repair the dryness and damage. This helped alot. Itâ€™s a very dense lotion that soaks in beautifully. It smelled slightly like oatmeal to me, but I think it was meant to be odorless. It took very few uses with small amounts to help my face. And my hands look great. I have also used it on my legs, because why not after it worked so well. Love it
