I have always struggled with acne and skin issues, so I was pretty excited when I received a free sample of this product from Influenster and Dior. It smells heavenly, it’s so clean! And I only need to use a small amount for each wash (less than dime sized, twice a day) and my skin has improved drastically. My skin feels smoother and softer, and I have not had a single break out in the last month (I cannot stress enough how big of a deal this is for me!!) I started using this product about 5 weeks ago, so I know it must be because of this wonderful product. The price for the big tube of this really made me think I would not be purchasing this in the future, but I was so wrong. With the small amount needed for each use and the results I’ve been seeing, it’s absolutely worth every penny. I’m completely in love with this cleanser!! nan
