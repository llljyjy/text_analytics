This is a good cleanser that effectively removes makeup and dirt to cleanse the skin. I take very little if the cleanser in went hands and work it into my face. My only complaint is the smell- I wish it was either unscented or had a more pleasant smell. Also I didnâ€™t find it y too be hydrating as it does leave my skin feeling drier than with other cleansers nan
