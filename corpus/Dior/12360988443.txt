First of all, I got a sample of this primer with the purchase of another product. I have oily skin, and this primer did NOT mattify my face as other reviewers claim. Although this is not for people with oily or combination skin since it makes your face shiny, I do recommend it for dry skin. I am not sure why someone mentioned it dried their skin because I do find it moisturizing. I wish Dior would make this same primer but for oily skin because I did like its moisturizing effect. I know most people love the shine, but I donâ€™t like to roam around looking as if I applied cooking oil on my face. Not for oily skin
