I wanted to love this cleanser but I just don’t think it’s for me. It is heavily perfumed and I just prefer a lighter scent for my face products. The texture is really nice and it feels good on my skin at least. Because of the heavy scent, however, this stuff stings my eyes unlike other cleansers I’ve used. Overall I think this Dior cleanser would be nice for someone who really likes the smell of perfume. Perfume
