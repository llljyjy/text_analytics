Really sinks into the skin! I have super dry and sensitive skin. I feel like it actually absorbs instead of drying on top of my skin. Everything burns my skin but this doesn’t! I used it in my face and it really really worked for me. 5 stars and I’m a tough crowd to please with moisturizers. Sensitive skin’s best friend
