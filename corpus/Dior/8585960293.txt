When it comes to skin care I’m a big fan of Dior. The applicator makes applying the cream on the eye a more gentle process; however, it takes a bit of effort to squeeze out the product before you could even lay apply it. That being said this cream is super amazing on the eye. Well I haven’t noticed any significant change to my skin, after using the product for a couple of weeks what I can say is that the product feels amazing on the eye. It’s almost like having an eye massage and moisturizer and one product. Well it’s a bit on the pricey her side when it comes to eye products I think it’s worth the spend. Smooth Eyes
