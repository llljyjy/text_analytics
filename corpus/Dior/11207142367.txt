I got this as a complimentary in exchange for an honest review. First of all: a full sized bottle?! Thank you!!Now here is the honest review from my dry and sensitive skin: let me start off by saying that the texture is perfect for cleansing the face very well. Next, the smell - I saw many reviews that complain about the smell, but truly there’s a floral scent that is very subtle and not overpowering that indicates that the ingredients are great. After use: no irritation which is a big one, and skin feels very soft. Obviously everyone’s skin is different, but I recommend trying it! Great product honestly
