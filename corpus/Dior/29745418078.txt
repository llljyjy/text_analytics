I absolutely love @lancomeofficial mousse face wash and didnâ€™t think I would love anything else, until @dior came through with their mousse face wash. I love the creamy feel, the smell, and how it made my face look. I feel like it got all the oil, food residue, spit + slobber my two toddlers usually leave on my face and it just felt so refreshed and soft. A great plus on the size as well! nan
