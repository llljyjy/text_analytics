This item was sent to me complimentary from Influenster/Dior. While pricy and luxurious, I wanted to be sure to give it a full and honest review. Iâ€™ve been using this serum consistently for a month, and I truly love it. It feels so luxurious and high-quality, and actually does plump up my undereye area. The applicator is ergonomic to the undereye area and made of metal so I love keeping this in my skincare fridge to get a - makes my eyes look so alive and refreshed! Plumping, cooling, luxurious!
