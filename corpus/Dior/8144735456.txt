I like the lather the face wash gives I feel like a little goes a long way! the scent is actually very nice, I’m super sensitive to scents and this one didn’t bother me at all. If you are worried about the scent it will go away after a while. I tried out the face wash for about a week and I love the way my skin looks and feels. I can’t wait until a month from now to see what it looks like. This is definitely worth the money! Love!
