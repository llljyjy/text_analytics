Received product from Influenster for purpose of reviewing. I knew right away the two areas to test. Face and elbows. For my face this balm left a soft canvas for my makeup to be applied. Smooth not greasy so long as you donâ€™t use too much. Only a small amount is needed. As for my elbow, it has been like sandpaper since having bursitis. I used the Dior every day and night for a week and wow soft like it used to be. I was amazed. Even a week after not using still soft. Worth every penny. Does as promised. Unscented. Lasts a long time. Wow I was amazed
