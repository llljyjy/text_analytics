If you have dry skin (specially during cold weather), this balm will solve the problem. It’s very thick cream, but it absorbs fast. Slightly scented of chamomile, almost imperceptible. If you already have oily skin, I wouldn’t recommend using on your face, only for the body. I like the package as well, u don’t have to touch what your not going to use. Good product, delivers what it promises. Very powerful moisturizer
