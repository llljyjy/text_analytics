Received this free from Influenster and Dior in exchange for an honest review. I’ve been using it for 3 weeks as my night moisturizer on my face and a couple of time on my legs due to the dry Minnesota February weather.It’s lightweight and moisturizes well without feeling greasy. No notable scent.Other than that, nothing to rave about, and I’m certain you could get the same thing for much less. Nice and moisturizing
