Though higher than your average facial cleanser this is definitely NOT your average cleanser! II love it! You only need a small amount to cover your whole face. My face felt so fresh, clean and not dry. The fragrance is light but so nice and not overwhelming. Permanent addition to my skincare routine...I highly recommend this, it is worth every dime! Definitely worth the price!
