After using this serum for about a week both in the morning and nights skincare, I noticed the skin under my eyes to be more awake with less dark circles when I woke. I didnâ€™t notice any difference in my fine lines around my eyes, but the brightness was noticeable enough that my husband mentioned it. The applicator is really fun, and makes the serum easily glide on your skin and feels nice and cool. I also use the bit of excess on my frown lines between my eye brows and I have noticed that those seem a bit less deep! I definitely enjoy using this serum. Cooling Application
