This cleanser has a lightweight and airy feel when squeezed out of the tube. Once you apply to skin it feels creamy and luxurious. It is gentle on my skin and removes makeup with little effort. Leaves my skin feeling hydrated and smooth. This has a light scent but not overpowering. I wish it wasnâ€™t so expensive but definitely worth it. New favorite cleanser
