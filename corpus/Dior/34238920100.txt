I received it from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This balm spreads easily and absorbs easily, not greasy at all but moisturizing well. The scent is natural as it is fragrance-free. It comforts my dry and sensitive winter skin quite well. After using it, you will have a healthy glow on your face. Iâ€™m really happy to keep using it. great one for dry skin
