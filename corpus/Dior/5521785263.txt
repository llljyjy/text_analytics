Iâ€™ve been using the Dior Cica Balm for a couple of weeks. It is not artificially fragranced, but it does have a mild clay smell. There was not a noticeable change to the appearance of my facial skin, but I used it on my hands and feet and there was remarkable improvement.   My feet were so scaly, that pulling off my socks sounded like ripping a Velcro strip. I shower, slather the Balm on my feet and put on socks. The next morning, my soles look and feel like i quickly ran a pumice stone over them. My hands, also, appeared youthful, until a few hand washings. I really loved how thick the Balm is. I look forward to using this product in the future and will encourage my friends to try it, as well! Repair Me
