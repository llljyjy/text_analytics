Amazing. I wasn’t expecting much because this product has a vague description. I wasn’t sure when I’d use it exactly but decided to try it as an evening moisturizer. I’m so glad I did. When I woke up in the morning my skin was plumper and smoother and not dry at all! I also used it around my eye wrinkles and it helped tons! Definitely recommend.  I was able to try this courtesy of Influenster. Thank you! Say Goodbye to Dryness!
