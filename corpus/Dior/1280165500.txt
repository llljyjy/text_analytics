Amazing formula. I noticed my under eye area appeared tighter and smoother after using it every night within 3 weeks. I enjoy how lightweight it is. It is hydrating and leaves my under eyes feeling smooth after it dries. The only complaint I have is that I do not care for the applicator. I had to squeeze it quite a bit to get some product out and even when I did it would get sucked back up through the home. I also didnâ€™t care for the ridges on the tip of the applicator. I would have preferred a smooth tip. I would definitely recommend it to others, but do not think I would buy it again just because of the applicator. I did receive this complimentary product for free from Influenster and Dior in exchange for my honest review. Smooth under eye
