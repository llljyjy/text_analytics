I was very skeptical at first because I’ve tried so many products for my combination skin and they were always oily. This product is amazing! It goes on very smooth and creamy, it’s not oily and leaves my face and arms soft and moisturized without perfume smells or harsh chemicals. I will definitely be purchasing this product in the future. The perfect moisturizer
