I really like this. it really moisturizers my super dry skin. I feel it helps repair my dry patches.  there is no fragrance which is a big plus for me after it goes on smoothly.  recommend this to those that want to moisturize but donâ€™t want a heavily scented product that give you other sensitivity issues. Moisturizes without the fragrance
