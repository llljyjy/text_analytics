I took my time to test this product so I could really see the benefits. It’s a gem! My first inclination was to try it it for the neck and decolette because that’s where I tend to want extra TLC since the skin is more fragile. Spot on. Within one week it minimized skin crepiness and lines looked diffused. When I tried it on my face as a mask, it provided serious hydration and plumping. I also don’t breakout which is plus since I have sensitive skin. Speaking of breakouts, I get chin cysts that time of month, I dabbed this on the pimple and it really helped to insulate the area and reduce redness. So happy to make this part of my regular skincare product rotation. Cushion Your Skin
