I received this product for free from Influenster and Dior in exchange for my honest review.Why brands still continue to add inorganic fragrance to skincare products that are going on your FACE, in this day and age- I have no clue, but this is the reason Dior’s new Capture Totale Serum gets an L from me. I prefer my skin not to burn from the attempts at trying to make it smell like baby-soft perfume from 1993, please. But- I’d say if you’re NOT extremely or even slightly sensitive skinned, I could see where it’s claims of evening skin texture, and boosting radiance may be legitimately accurate. However, I can’t speak from personal experience about the claims of “firming“, as I did not use this for more than 2 days of use, due to the ’formula’ being too potent for my skin type. Did not see any magical improvement in my skin in that time, but also, didn’t see any terrible side effects either.It’s a toss up for me. Sorry guys! Highly fragranced
