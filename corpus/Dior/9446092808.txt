I received this product from Influencer for my review. I have to say I really liked this cream. I have very sensitive skin and I liked that this cream was scent free and it really made my skin very soft and hydrated. It soaked in quickly and did not leave my skin feeling tacky. I would definitely recommend this cream. Good for sensitive skin
