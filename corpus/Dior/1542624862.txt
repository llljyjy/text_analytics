Been using the eye serum for a few weeks now and really enjoying the results. I notice smoother firmer skin and the metal applicator helps to depuff under eye bags. Itâ€™s a fun way to relax, apply, and massage the serum around the eye area. The serum itself has a mild fragrance. I enjoyed the experience and results and recommend this! Loving it!!
