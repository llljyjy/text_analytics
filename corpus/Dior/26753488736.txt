Thank you Influenster, Dior, and Sephora for the Incentivized VoxBox of Dior Cica Recover & Repair Multi-Use Balm complimentary for test and review purposes.I love how creamy this balm is. It easily absorbed into my skin and leaves it feeling hydrated. I have been using Dior Cica Recover & Repair Multi-Use Balm twice a day on sensitive skin, but I could use it more often, I like it that much. There is no fragrance, which I appreciate. I really like the combination of Centella Asiatica, chamomile, and hyaluronic acid. I wish it came in a bigger size to use on my whole body. Great Balm for sensitive skin!
