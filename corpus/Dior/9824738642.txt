I have thoroughly enjoyed using this cleanser, and so has my sensitive skin. This cleanser is gentle enough on my drier skin but still washes off all my makeup in one go. Itâ€™s creamy, foamy, and has a pleasant aroma to it. The container is aesthetic and is easy enough to squeeze out the cleanser. I would definitely recommend this if it is in your price range nan
