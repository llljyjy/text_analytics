I normally use Tula facial cleanser every day, and this one definitely gives it a run for its money!! I received this cleanser as a free sample. I love that it makes my skin feel very soft and smooth after use, and it does a great job of making my skin feel totally clean after washing. I use the product with an electric facial brush for extra effect. Iâ€™ve only been using for about a week, but I can see a difference in the clarity and smoothness of my skin! Refreshing and effective cleanser!
