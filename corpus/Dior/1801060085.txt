Best moisturizer for dry skin. I have been struggling to find a good lotion for my dry skin, especially in the winter. Once I found La Mer lotion I finally found a lotion that worked. Except the $90 price tag for the mini size was not budget friendly. I am so glad that I found this Dior face lotion through Influenster. This balm works wonders! Leaves my skin feeling hydrated all day, $60 for the size of the lotion is a steal. Will be purchasing again! Perfect for dry skin
