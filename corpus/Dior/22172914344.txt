I was excited to receive this lotion to try as I  have very dry skin in the winter and I always need to keep a bottle of lotion in my purse. The lotion itself is very thick and hydrating but it’s a little difficult to even squeeze it out of the tube. The scent is my least favorite part about it.  I was expecting it to be unscented or but it actually is pretty odd and has a weird earthy scent that I don’t enjoy. Thankfully it fades pretty quickly! nan
