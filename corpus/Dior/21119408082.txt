I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I love how it feels on my skin. It’s the perfect thickness for the cold weather. It doesn’t have a fragrance and it doesn’t leave my skin sticky or feeling greasy. My skin felt more moisturize and supple but it didn’t feel heavy and weighed down. It left me with glowy radiant skin. After a week of using my skin didn’t break out from it.@dior @Influenster #complimentary. Love this product
