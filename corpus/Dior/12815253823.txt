I really liked the feel of this serum under my eyes. It felt very luxurious and hydrating. The packaging wasn’t the best because I felt like the product sometimes cling to the metal tip, but that’s not the worst thing ever. I feel like I may have noticed a slight decrease in the purpleness of my under eyes, but I feel like this sort of product needs to be tried longer than a two weeks to get a good idea of if it’s actually working/having an effect. I received this for free to try out courtesy of Influenster. Pretty good!
