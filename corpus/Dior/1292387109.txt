I received a tube of this eye serum courtesy of Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion on the product.  Honestly, I am pretty impressed with this eye serum so far.  I realy like the metal applicator tip and flexible stem.  It doesn’t drag on the thin skin of my under eye area.  It’s cooling and light, and the serum absorbs quickly.  I’m going to keep this tube in the fridge for a quick coollng shot in the mornings to wake up my eyes! Dior skincare products are pricey, but this particular serum is effective and keeps my (aged) undereye area well hydrated. nan
