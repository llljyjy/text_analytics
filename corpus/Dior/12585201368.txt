I have extremely oily, sensitive skin. This product is amazing. It didn’t case my sensitive skin to break out and it didn’t make my skin feel oily after applying. It made my skin feel so fresh, clean and moisturized in a healthy way. A lot of products that I use on my face make my oily face look more oily and this product did not do that! It has a light scent to it but nothing too strong. I totally recommend this product to everyone! I like how it can be used for any dry or sensitive skin, but that it doesn’t counter act with oils. Don’t walk... run to get this! LOVE
