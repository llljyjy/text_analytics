This is a wonderful moisturizer. For areas you like a thick cream. For me it would be my elbows, knees and feet. I tried it on my face and though it’s not cakey it’s so heavy that it feels it should be. It helps with dry skin big time as I mentioned it’s great on my feet, elbows and knees where I don’t mind a ticket cream. There’s not much of an odor. For sure reason I expected possibly a light floral sent. All in all it does what it is meant to do. And that’s moisturize. Thick cream
