I thoroughly enjoyed this product overall! The packaging is perfect and delivers a beautiful thick cream that’s perfect for night time use. After using I noticed a visible glow in the morning and that my makeup applied much smoother. The product does not have a noticeable scent which is great for people with sensitive or acne prone skin. I wouldn’t recommend this product for anyone with oily skin but with those for dry to normal skin types this product is a LIFE SAVER during the colder months and makes your skin look amazing!! GREAT product
