The beautiful herbal scent thatâ€™s light. The ingredients are easy to read and clear. A creamy texture nonsticky at all I love that this is multiple uses so I can use it on most dry areas. Today I tried it on my hands and they felt very soft!!  I went about my day and almost forgot I had it on my hands. My hands still feel soft and I believe it is because of the shea butter, almond oil, and jojoba oil. soft and creamy not sticky
