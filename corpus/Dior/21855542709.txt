I enjoyed the experience with this cleanser. I would say that it is best for people with a normal skin type since it felt slightly drying on my dry skin. It is also VERY FRAGRANCED. The smell remained on my skin for the rest of the night even after washing it off. The scent is pleasant, perfume-y, and clean smelling, but it is very strong. I would not recommend for people with sensitive skin. Very fragranced
