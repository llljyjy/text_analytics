The formulation itself is great. It is scented however it was not too strong and it didn’t irritate my eyes. The eye cream is light and goes on smooth. My under eyes feel nice and hydrated after each use. I did not notice much improvement with puffiness but the hydration did make my fine lines appear more diminished. I used this every night for about a month. The applicator requires too much pressure to get product out. Though I love the concept, I prefer to have a simple tube to squirt product out as needed on my fingers. I honestly don’t plan on purchasing this. There are plenty of other eye creams that will achieve the same effect for less. Meh, pretty average
