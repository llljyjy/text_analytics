This product was provided to me for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. The title says it all - this is a perfectly fine foaming cleanser. It is quite perfumed so that is important to note. I’ve also found it to be somewhat stripping when I use it - other cleansers don’t leave my face feeling “squeaky clean” which to me is an uncomfortable/stripping feeling. It does feel quite gentle otherwise though. For me it’s fine, and I’ll finish the bottle, but I would not pay full price for this to repurchase. nan
