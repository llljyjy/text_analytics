I absolutely loved the Dior Cica Recover & Repair Multi-Use Balm! My facial skin & hands were so dehydrated & dry before I used the Dior Cica Balm. After just a few days using this product as a cream on my face & hands they are so hydrated, soft & smooth. You only need a small amount & it has a very creamy texture. The balm is great for scent sensitive individuals because it has a very faint scent and didn’t trigger my migraines. I’m glad I tried this product & will be purchasing more. I definitely recommend trying this product to everyone. I liked the simplicity of the packaging but would like more user information on the outside box. Very Moisturizing
