I am 54ish years old & purchased this product I have only been using this for a few days but I already notice that my skin appears brighter, feels softer, and the redness is fading away!  I love this lotion!!!  I suspect this will become a game changer for some!  Now, at first I thought it might be watery but it is a clear lotion. Very soothing & moisturing!  It takes one penny size drop for my entire face & neck and I use it after washing. My system:  Dreamskin face wash, Dior 1-minute mask once a week, then the Capture Totale Essence Lotion, Tatcha the Dewy Serum (new addition), Dior Hydra Life Eyecream, Capture Totale Dreamskin Care & Perfect skin perfection- I also use the Backstage skin perfector as a base when traveling as it’s easier to pack. I use the Dreamskin foundation for the days I need a more finished look. I did replace the Dior serum with the new Tatcha serum just to try it out but I will be switching back. In this photo I have used my Dior line but did not put in any foundation or face powder. I am wearing the new Refy brow in Dark, Dior backstage eye shadow, Dior backstage contour, Lancôme mascara, Dior lip addict, and Maracuja juicy lip plump. Honest Review - Over 50 & just started using this.
