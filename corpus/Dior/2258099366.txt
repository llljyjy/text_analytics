I am a HUGE fan of Dior’s beauty products and was thrilled to receive the OFF/ON Foaming Cleanser to test from Influenster. Like the other Dior skincare products I’ve tried, this product does what it claims to do! It washes the day away, leaving my face fresh, clean, and hydrated. The cleanser is rich in texture but delicate enough for sensitive skin, effortlessly removing makeup, harsh impurities, excess oil/sebum, and the environmental stressors that clog pores and leave my skin looking dull, dry, and tired. Once again, I am blown away by Dior’s ability to deliver a super lux product that delivers on its promise with innovative ingredients and chic packaging. While it is pricey, a little goes a long way, and I believe the results are worth the investment. Highly Recommend! Worth the Investment
