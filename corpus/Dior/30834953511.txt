I like this cleanser, but if you don’t like fragranced skincare products, this is definitely not for you. It’s my first time using one like this, with its texture and smell, and although I don’t dislike it at all (because I’ll keep using it) I wouldn’t buy it again since I prefer odorless products. It has a good texture and is quite yielding, super foaming. nan
