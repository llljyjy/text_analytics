My skin looks very shiny, shiny as in like a healthy glow. Been using it for two months now, it lasts a long time. Doesn’t remove stubborn mascara or makeup very well, but is good as a double cleanser. I use this after I remove my makeup with ponds cold cream. It does have a scent, but it is because it’s made with a French milled soap kind of cleansing agent. Didn’t cause breakouts, did make my skin feel tight, but that went away with use. Overall, good double cleanser but nothing special, did like the glow it gave me though! And it lasts a very long time, very big bottle. Hope this helps! Honest review
