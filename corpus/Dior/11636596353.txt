I received this product for free from Influenster and Dior in exchange for my honest review. This definitely feels like an ~expensive~ cleanser. I have pretty sensitive skin and adding this cleanser into my routine did NOT make me break out at all, so I really love that!! I really enjoy the floral scent of this cleanser and how well it lathers during use. However, if you do not like fragrance in your products or if you are sensitive to fragrance then this may not be for you. My face also felt really clean after using this cleanser without feeling that it was stripping away my skinâ€™s natural oils. I would definitely recommend this cleanser! Clean fresh scent!!
