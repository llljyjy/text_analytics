Have been using this eye serum for couple weeks I already love the instant cooling and refreshing of massaging the metallic applicator around my eyes, squeezing the proper amount can be tricky but i got use to it with time. The serum is light weighted and absorbed quickly non sticky, I didn’t use it alongside the eye cream so am not sure of it is anti-aging benefits. It is hydrating but I haven’t noticed any changes regarding the fine lines. In love with the cooling applicator
