I have been using this as the last step in my routine for the past week and...wow. i was not expecting the color to blend with my skin. Honestly I thought this was foundation when it came out of the tube. However!! I rubbed this in on my face and it literally blurred my face, mattified my skin(even the one day I put on too much serum!!! this literally sucked it up) My skin is looking and feeling way more supple and this is only day 6!!! The other day after I put it on I just touched my cheek because my skin hasnâ€™t been so soft and glowy in such a long time. I am not as shiny throughout the day whereas I would usually have to blot...a lot lol. My skin is definitely smoother and more radiant after using this. It literally makes your skin look dreamlike.
