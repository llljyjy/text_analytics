First of, this is my first time ever trying eye cream. I was very excited to try this to see results for my under eyes. First impression, it smells nice but not overpowering. However, it’s a bit sticky. After reading the instructions I was a bit confused on how to use the product. I ended up just massaging my eyelids and under eyes with the applicator for a few seconds with the serum. I kept noticing that when I would wake up the next morning my eyes looked puffy. Kept trying it day and night for a couple of weeks and still received the same results, puffy eyes. I’m not sure if that’s normal or I’m having some type of reaction. Eye serum newbie
