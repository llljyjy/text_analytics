I used the old formula of this moisturizer and loved it, so I bought the new formula when I ran out. The consistency of the new formula  is a little thicker and less opaque than the old one, and seems to last longer as a protective layer on the surface of my skin (I feel like I notice it when I wash my face at the end of the day - which is prob a good thing!), but this change hasn’t caused any breakouts, increased oiliness or other skin issues for me. Despite hyaluronic acid now being a call-out ingredient of the new formula, I haven’t increased skin benefits in comparison to the old formula. Overall, I’m glad the new formula continues to fit in my skincare routine, but minus one star for the random price increase. The new formula still works for me!
