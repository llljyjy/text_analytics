The product I received was a good size, 150 ml or 5 oz.A little goes a very long way.The color of that product was white with a whipped lotion feel that foamed nicely when wet.It had a nice clean scent reminiscent of Ponds or Oil of Olay.Face felt clean and hydrated afterwards.Very effective in removing makeup when used in conjunction with a cleaning tool. No need for a double cleanse.I would definitely recommend this. Nice & Clean
