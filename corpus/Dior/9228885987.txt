This is a nice, thick but not too heavy cream for sensitive skin. I am enjoying it, you can use it anywhere and it will be effective and not irritate. There is no scent to it which is nice. My only complaint would be the purchase price. I don’t think it’s that special to be charged that much. Nice, thick but not too heavy cream
