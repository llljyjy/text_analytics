I received this product complimentary from Influenster. Complete transparency I was a little skeptical about using the product but I was actually pleasantly surprised. This little eye cream/serum was wonderful. The applicator tip is nice and cooling which felt really good after a long day and once I had taken off my make up. I did notice that after about a week to week and a half I had less fine lines and I feel like my eyes were slightly less puffy. I can see this product lasting me a while because truly only need a small small amount of the cream/serum. Big fan of product not a big fan of the price. Perfect except the price
