I received this product complementary from influencer and I am a little iffy about it. I used it on my face for a couple of weeks to see how it would do as a moisturizer and it goes on more like a lotion and then melts into the skin. I have very sensitive and I’m more on the dry skin side and this worked for a little while but didn’t really do my face justice. Not to mention it made me break out in a couple of spot. I will probably be using this product more for an eye cream or a body lotion. Dior Recover & Repair Muti-Use Balm
