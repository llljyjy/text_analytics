I was sent this cleanser from Influenster for review.  I have used Thai for over a week.  I tried this without moisturizer afterward and with a. I have mature dehydrated skin.  This took off all my makeup without striping my skin.  Only a small pea sized amount was needed to cleanse my face. As with all Dior skincare it has fragrance.  I enjoy this cleanser.  If you like Dior skincare I think you will enjoy this cleanser. Nice cleanser
