The only thing that truly stuck out to me was the classic Dior fragrance which is abundant. It has a cream based texture that turns into a foam which I like. However, the cleanser didn’t feel anymore effective than my normal routine. Love how much product you get and it does take off some make up. if you are already a Dior-girl then you’ll love this. For me though it was just okay. eh but okay
