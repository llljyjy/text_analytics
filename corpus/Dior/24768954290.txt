I received this product complimentary through Influenster for my honest review. I have been using this product for about 2 and a half weeks now. It has a light scent that isnâ€™t very noticeable. I love the applicator, it provides a nice cooling massage. I was also surprised to find that a little bit goes a long way! My skin feels super hydrated and less puffy after I apply. However, dark circles have always been a problem for me because I have very fair thin skin under my eyes. I have not noticed a difference in the darkness under my eyes. Overall I do really like this product and how it makes my skin feel! nan
