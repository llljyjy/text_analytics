I received this I’m exchange for my honest review, and honestly, I’m pretty happy. I always look at the price and see if I think it’s worth the cost. In this case, I think it is. The smell was heavenly in my opinion and my face felt so clean and moisturized. I could see this replacing my usual daily fash wash. A little really goes a long way too. nan
