This is super greasy going on. It spreads fairly easily but I would never put this on my face. I did use it on my body after showering however and I can say that it doesn’t have much of a scent. It took some time to fully absorb, like 20 minutes or so before it stopped feeling like I’d spread butter all over my skin. I had particularly dry and irritated areas when I tried this and it did calm them down and keep them moisturized for some time. Overall, I think it does what it claims to do, I just don’t like the initial greasy feeling when it goes on. Greasy
