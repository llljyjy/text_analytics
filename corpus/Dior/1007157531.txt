This is a really nice basic moisturizer. I still have problems with product related breakouts but didn’t with this, and it also layers nicely under liquid foundation with no primer necessary.I don’t think this would be moisturizing enough in the dead of winter without using a hydrating serum underneath, but when my skin is closer to normal than dry, it is lovely.
