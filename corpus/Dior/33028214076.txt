I absolutely love this cream. I tend to have pretty dry skin in the colder months and my skin is also sensitive so it is sometimes extremely hard to find a lotion/cream that I can use on both my hands and face if needed, this one did the job better than I could’ve ever imagined. The size is perfect for my purse as I’m in the go quite often. I also love the mild scent it has as it’s not ever whelming but it still smells really good ! nan
