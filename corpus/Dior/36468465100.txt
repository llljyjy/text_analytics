This is a nice foaming cleanser that is easy to l ather with a little water. It is infused with great ingredients like water lily and cornflower floral water. It feels amazing on my skin. it is smooth and creamy. It is very deliecate to my sensitive skin. I like how it foams up to get rid of impurities, bacteria and make up. It left my skin clean and refreshed. I also like the very light floral fragrance. I have finally found a good cleanser that leaves my skin glowing that doesnâ€™t irritate my skin. Love this Cleaner
