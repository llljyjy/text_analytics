I received this product for free from Influenster & Dior in exchange for my honest opinion. This eye serum was okay. Nothing spectacular or particularly different from others Iâ€™ve tried. I used this product daily for almost a solid month & had no notable changes to the darkness or fine lines. It is a nice formula, it goes on smoothly, absorbs well, & dries to a smooth finish. The application is really nice with the metal tip that does help reduce puffiness. nan
