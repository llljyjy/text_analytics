I love the Dior Foaming Cleanser! I needed a light cleanser to cleanse my skin in the morning. It has a sweet fragrance and feels great on my skin! A little goes a long way. I put two pumps to cover my whole face and it lathered beautifully, leaving an appealing foam texture to absorb into your skin. It also removes all traces of makeup easily. This is for sure becoming a staple in my morning routine as it is gentle and lightweight. My skin afterward does not feel dry at all and that can ensure going to work feeling hydrated and fresh. Definitely recommend and I love this stuff seriously so much! nan
