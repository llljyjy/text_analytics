I was excited to receive the Dior Cica Recover and Repair Balm because I suffer from redness and dry skin on my face, neck and chest. Once again I have fallen in love with another Dior product! This Recover and Repair Balm is so nice!  It feels wonderful on the skin and I have noticed a big difference in the condition of my skin. The redness has lightened and my skin feels soft and moisturized without a greasy feel.  It worked wonders on the backs of my hands as well! If you are considering purchasing this, but are on the fence, GO FOR IT!!! You won’t regret it! It does exactly what it promises! I received this product free for my honest review.  My opinion was in no way influenced from receiving the product free. This is my honest thoughts and feelings on this product. Another Dior Product You’ll Fall In Love With!!!
