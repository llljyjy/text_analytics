I wanted to love this recovery balm but candidly I was let down. The texture and (lack of) fragrance are both fantastic but that’s where the love story ends for me. Going on I almost felt like I was dragging it on my skin and then it just got gluey and thick. Invariably I’d have to use something else within hours or my skin actually looked flaky and dry. Totally counter productive. At the price point and with the lack of results, I couldn’t justify purchasing this or recommending it. great in concept, execution not for me
