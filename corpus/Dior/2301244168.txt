I started out trying this face wash to find a cheaper alternative to the La Mer Cleansing Foam and ended up loving it even more than I thought I would. It’s nearly identical except it smells better and I don’t get ANY breakouts at all. Best face wash I’ve tried. One star off for the packaging, it doesn’t feel sanitary to rest the bottle on a wet surface in the shower when that’s where the product comes out of. The idea of bacteria collecting on the opening just feels counterintuitive. Great product, horrible packaging. La Mer Cleansing Foam Substitute
