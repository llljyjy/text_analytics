I bought this product looking for a high-end lip balm. I wanted no color so went for the 001 Dior Natural. I understand the balm is natural, but it came out really grainy and had a coconut smell I didn’t care for. I’m not giving it 1 star since it did moisturize my lips, but for Dior I expected more. Indifferent
