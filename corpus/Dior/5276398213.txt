I received this product for my honest review. I honestly loved it. The serum felt good on my skin and immediately seemed to hydrate as well as soften and smooth. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the price point of it for the size makes it something I would not consistently purchase. Very nice serum
