I was excited to try this foaming face wash from Dior.  Dior OFF/ON Foaming Cleanser is infused with purifying water Lily and soothing cornflower water. I could definitely smell the floral scent as I was washing my face. The product did foam nicely with added water. This Dior face cleanser is called OFF/ON for a reason. The OFF represents the negative that you will take off of your face when you cleanse with this product and the ON is the positive things that you will add to your face. Love it
