A little goes a long way with this cleanser. I use it the mornings so I feel fresh because of the pleasant fragrance it contains. If you are sensitive to scents, this isn’t for you. I can barely use any new cleansers on my sensitive skin but this one didn’t give me a a hard time. I have a combination skin with mostly dry parts in winter & it doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry. Luxurious cleanser with pleasant fragrance!
