Wow! I was pleasantly surprised about this product! The balm sinks into the skin super well and leaves my skin feeling soft. Not only can I use this on my face at night when I need extra moisture from the cold but I can also use it as hand lotion! Considering I have oily/combination skin, I’m surprised it doesn’t feel greasy on the skin. The only thing that I should call out is that there is a minor fragrance that lingers for a couple minutes after application but it went away after a little bit. nan
