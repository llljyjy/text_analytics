My skin has been so dry this winter, but this balm brought back the hydration my skin needed. I apply it at night as the final step in my skin care routine. When I  wake up, my face and neck is so hydrated, supple and soft, with no dry patches. The best part is that this balm is not heavy, sticky and greasy unlike other moisturizers Iâ€™ve tried. Highly recommend! Soft, Supple Skin!
