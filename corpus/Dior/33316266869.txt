I received a sample of this product to test, and I have to admit - I was impressed!  Typically, I’m very choosy on face care. In the past, I’ve had lots of issues due to skin sensitivities - I wouldn’t say I have highly sensitive skin, but I tend to get issues with break outs when I use lower quality products. I used this cleanser daily for over a week, and I’m in love!  Skin feels clean and soft, with no acne issues. The only thing I could see as a potential negative is the scent, which is somewhat strong when you first use it. After a few days, I adjusted to the smell, and it didn’t bother me after that. Overall, I recommend this product! Clean and moisturized!
