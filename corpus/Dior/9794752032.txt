I love it!!! I did NOT want to fork over the cash for this serum but it is worth it. My skin reacts to everything. A little of this covers up or blurs tiny red spots and pores. It also improves my skin. It feels luxurious, and I somehow look like Iâ€™m wearing a little bit of makeup with just this. nan
