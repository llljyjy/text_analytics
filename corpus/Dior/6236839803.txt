I like this eye serum - the formula is super luxe and is nice to apply. What I didn’t like was the packaging. It’s kind of that hard plastic that’s hard to squeeze - while nice, I just never prefer the harder plastic (personal preference). The metal applicator is awesome - always a plus. Pretty good!
