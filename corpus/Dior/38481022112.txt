I got this as a gift! Which was right up my alley as I’ve been a long time lover of most all things Dior.   2 wks ago my review would have been the following- It did nothing. I noticed maybe slight lightening of my dark circles, and some softening. But I wouldn’t recommend in the long run for anti aging. Then a few days after stopping this product the weirdest thing happened as I was observing my face in the mirror- I thought my eyes looked unusually bad.. WORSE off than before. But with more close up investigation I realized.. holy crap. My eyes were just a lot more changed than I realized while using the Dior Totale, that hadn’t noticed how much this actually did for my under eyes, In 16ish days of use.I noticed my eyes weren’t looking as bouncy and taunt. + my dark ring around my eyes (mainly pronounced in the inner eye area) was more deep in color with discontinued use. I wasn’t sure about the fine lines at the time. But with this realization I did what any female would do- I started using it again, immediately. Not until after I picked up using it again- did I see 5 DAYS later my fine lines start to dissipate. Almost as if someone took a photoshop brightening and blurring tool to my face. & after about a week after continuing use- did my dark eye pigment lighten again ALONG with the firmer filled in look come back! It is SO wild that my under eyes started to restore themselves back to improvement so quickly after I picked it back up and then still continued to improve from there!  I truly believe that if someone doesn’t like this product and give it 10/10- they didn’t use it faithfully, and/or long enough! I am so so impressed that this is something you can purchase on a shelf and as this is obviously now a serious HolyGrail product for myself- I hope Dior never stops making this. Don’t CHANGE A THING IN THIS, PLEASE! LOVE, A more than SATISFIED consumer *Photo is 32 days apart/ both 0 makeup. the 2nd pic, I have dyed henna eyebrows* 30 day REVIEW
