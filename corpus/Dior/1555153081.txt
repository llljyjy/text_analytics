Although this is a beautiful cleanser for my normal/combo skin, and leaves my skin cleansed but still moisturized, Iâ€™m unable to use it because the floral scent is SO strong. I love and prefer scented skincare products, but this lingered on my skin even after putting all of my skincare on. If you can tolerate the scent, though, this is a beautiful cleanser! STRONG Scent!
