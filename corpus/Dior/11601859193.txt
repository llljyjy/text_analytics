I’ve tried a lot of cleansers but this one is the best! With this one, my skin doesn’t even ask for a moisturizer; even though my skin is on a dry side. After using it I just can’t stop touching my face because it feels so silky, clean and healthier! And It removes the oil that I get during the day & night. Overall, the product is so smooth and foamy, it takes tiny amount to foam. Personally, the scent is very pleasant and sophisticated, reminds me of some natural & luxurious herbs :) Maybe it’s just me... because I prefer to have scents in my skin care routine. I am very impressed because this is the first cleanser that doesn’t resemble soap-like cleansing effect and in a gentle way gets its job done. WOW! Wonderful Product.
