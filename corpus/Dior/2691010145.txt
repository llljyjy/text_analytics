This cleanser absolutely exceeded my expectations! It cleared all my makeup (including waterproof mascara) and left my skin feeling hydrated and glowing. I have sensitive skin and was concerned but am happy to say this will now be added to my daily routine! Do note, the fragrance is a bit intense but is fresh and clean. nan
