I received this Dior Cica Recover & Repair Multi-Use Balm for free from Influentser and Dior as a complimentary sample in exchange for my honest review (incentivized).  I had recently started using another product on my face and didn’t want to change up the process.  After researching the product and seeing that it was suitable for sensitive skin and had multiple uses, I decided to try it on my elbows and the back of my hands - both of which I have been having issues with lately.  The skin on the back of my hands and elbows have been dry and bumpy lately. I started using this product on them when I received it, and I’m very pleased with the results.  The skin is noticeably softer with no adverse effects.  I love how the balm soothes the skin when I apply it and isn’t greasy like some products are. I plan to continue using it in these areas and will definitely purchase the product so I can use it on other areas (including my face and neck). I have been very pleased with this product.
