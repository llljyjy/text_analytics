I was sent this #complementary product for me to test in exchange for an honest review.  This is absolutely without a doubt the best cleanser that I’ve ever tried, ever!!.  I’m so impressed with the beautiful way in which a little absolutely goes a long way, also the scent is definitely entoxicating and envigorating.  The price point is the only thing that’s not friendly at all, but for me if a product is effective in delivering results then I don’t care if I have to spend a lot of money.  I recommend this wash because it doesn’t strip my skin and it my face feels supple and moisturized.  I love it!.  Thanks to @influenster and #Dior!! So luxe...
