I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Iâ€™ve used this cream as my morning and night face moisturizer for about 10 days now and I really enjoy it. It is thick and easily absorbed by my skin. I like that the ingredients are clean and simple. I believe this product helped heal some of my active breakouts as well. I am giving 5 stars because I believe the quality and amount of product is worth the price. Simple and Effective
