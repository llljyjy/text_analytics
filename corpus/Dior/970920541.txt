As a forty-six year-old woman, I look for a cleanser that will remove my makeup without stripping my skin. Dior’s La Mousse does just that! I was amazed (and slightly disgusted) by the amount of makeup and pollution in the foam that came off my face. Since I generally use cleansers that require a second cleanse (Philosophy’s Purity is my go-to), I used my normal toner and was pleasantly surprised to find nothing on my cotton round...the Dior La Mousse had thoroughly cleansed my skin...without stripping it! My face felt moisturized and silky smooth after rinsing the foam cleanser off. I’m really happy I received this product from Dior. Cleanses thoroughly without stripping
