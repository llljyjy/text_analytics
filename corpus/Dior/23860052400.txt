I hadnâ€™t tried this facial cleanser before, but I really liked it.  It is very clean, without alcohol, parabens and sulfates.  It is a cream with which I can clean my face of makeup and impurities without any problems.  This cleanser leaves my skin clean, beautiful and hydrated.  I like it very much. Super clean
