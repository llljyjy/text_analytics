Of course, I loved the luxurious packaging and fancy applicator which massaged my under eye area with a cooling touch. But the actual cream it’s self is excellent. It’s rich and moisturizing and I had no problem using it morning and evening as suggested. After about five days, my under eye area was noticeably brighter and smoother! I am very pleased with this eye serum and I would certainly purchase in the future. Highly recommended. 5/5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ It actually works!
