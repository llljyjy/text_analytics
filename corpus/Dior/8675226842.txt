I have been loving this Balm. I have been using for over a month now. I really like how this is truly a multi tasking product. My skin has been really dry with the colder weather and this has helped so much. It absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy feel. Very hydrating and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. I would highly recommend. Great Balm
