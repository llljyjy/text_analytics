I wanted to love this but I’m so disappointed in our it may my skin LOOK. As a brown skin woman, this product left the same “Ashy” and “dull” cast that some creme based sun blocks leave. Unfortunately I definitely would not try this again. If they reformulated this product to be for more varying shades, I would give it another try but for right now, I will pass on this skin perfector. nan
