So I thought, omg this is not even 1 oz. But let me tell you a little goes a long way. The massager applicator is out of this world. It has fragrance, but it is very subtle. I recommend it. I would buy it again. My eyes get perked up instantly when I apply it, and every time it gets better. Do yourself a favor and make this investment. Oh my luxxxx
