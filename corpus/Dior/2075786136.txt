I was gifted this product through Influenster. I had high hopes for this but I didnâ€™t feel it performed as it should. Once I read that this was supposed to be used in conjunction with the eye cream, I did lower my expectations. Smooth application, however the metal applicator was completely unnecessary and not useful at all. I did notice a slight reduction in my dark circles and my puffiness but not enough that I would buy the product outright. nan
