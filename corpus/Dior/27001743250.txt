I have been using this product for a month now. My holy grail routine includes the Estée Lauder serum and eye cream and I just replaced the eye cream with this for the experiment. I do love the packaging and the scent. I do prefer a bit more moisture which I didn’t feel like this gives. I’m 32 with very little wrinkles (yet) but I don’t feel like this did anything to improve them like my other product did. It’s a nice product but I don’t know that I’d purchase again for the price. Nice product but not my fave
