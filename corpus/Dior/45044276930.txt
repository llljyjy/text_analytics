Iâ€™ve been using this product for about two weeks and can already see a difference in the size of my  pores and have noticed a slight difference in my pigmented areas. I have extremely sensitive skin and have not had any allergic or bad reaction to this serum. I struggle daily with rosacea and this has not caused it to flare up either. I also love the way my makeup looks when I apply it over , it leaves a smooth and clean look. And it even helps minimize the small wrinkles around my eyes! An absolute must for everyone !
