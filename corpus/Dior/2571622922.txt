I’ve been using this for the past wk & 1/2 day & night. I see a slight improvement in my skin texture. It’s more hydrated with less fine lines. Just like other Dior products, it’s fragranced. However it’s light and pleasant IMO. The product has light serum like texture, not greasy or thick. I’m not a big fan of the packaging. The cooling effect is great but I don’t like the grooves and it’s hard to dispense the product. Bottom like if you buy this for the quality of the product, then this is for you. Less wrinkles
