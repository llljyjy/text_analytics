This is by no means a cheap product, but it comes in a pretty decent size considering you only need a pea-sized amount each time. I can appreciate the thought that went behind this product, with mostly natural ingredients and attempt to make this a true skincare product. I really wanted to love it, but it felt the slightest bit drying, relative to the more moisturizing drug store cleansers I’ve tried. Overall, it does foam up beautifully and has a really nice floral scent. But for those with very dry skin, I wouldn’t recommend it beautiful lather but not for dry skin
