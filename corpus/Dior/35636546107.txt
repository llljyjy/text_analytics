This product leaves my skin feeling soft and gives it a dewy, almost plumper look. My skin looks healthier and fresh after one wash. I also like the lily scent. I am not a huge fan of floral fragrances but this one wasn’t overpowering at all. Having sensitive skin I tend to avoid fragrances but this didn’t irritate my skin Love
