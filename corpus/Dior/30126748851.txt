When I found out I was getting this wonderful luxurious Dior Baume Cica-Reparateur, Cica recover Balm.  I was very happy to finally  try something from the Dior brand, I been using this in my night routine on my face and neck as a moisturizer, my skin is a combination, this balm hydrates very well, does not leave a shiny face, in the morning my skin is smooth and  soft, it has a nice light, clean scent, very mild fragrance, it does wonders would probably buy it in the future,  would recommend .
