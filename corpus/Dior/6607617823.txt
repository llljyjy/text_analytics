I’ve been using this fairly regularly and haven’t seen a big difference. However I am somewhat young (36) and don’t have too many fine lines yet around my eyes. I don’t see any negatives so I’m happy to keep using it as I get older, but for me, I didn’t see any dramatic differences. I do like how the cream feels on my skin. nan
