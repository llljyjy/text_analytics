I apply this serum at night after washing my face. Itâ€™s easy to use with its dedicated applicator. I do wish the circumference of the applicator was smaller as I find myself using my finger in smaller areas. The packaging is great and easy to travel with. My eyes feel refreshed in the mornings and I also like to apply it right before I put on my concealer. Fantastic serum for my night time regimen
