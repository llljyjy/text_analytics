When I typically think of balm I think of thick, heavy, smelly and gloppy. This is not that!  This balm is a little bit thicker than my normal facial moisturizer. it goes on smoothly, has no smell, leaves my skin moisturizer, soothed and can be used on any part of my skin. It was especially great for my winter moisture deprived hands and elbows.Another big bonus is it leaves my face glowing and made my makeup look great. Great balm!
