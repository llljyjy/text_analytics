I’ve been using this product for a couple weeks now, in the morning as an extra moisturizing boost (I use a medical-grade product at night).  Overall I’ve been pleased with it. The serum absorbs well into the skin and the metal applicator feels nice. It does well under makeup.  There’s no scent that I’ve noticed. nan
