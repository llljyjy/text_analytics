I received this complimentary sample from Influenster in exchange for my review…I used it on my hands and arms first and the hydrating feeling hits immediately. I was a bit hesitant to try on my face but I said what the heck and did it. It’s been 2 nights now and it makes your skin feel extremely luxurious. My skin is very dry and constantly peeling from my nose and it hasn’t peeled at all. It layers well with other skincare serums and does not pill up. I even use it in the morning and it doesn’t move around my makeup or make it oily at all. It also has no scent at all which is perfect for sensitive skin. I would buy this again for my face for sure. Amazing!
