so, I got this about a week ago. I’ve been using it in the morning every day. It has a very light, barely there scent.  This balm goes on very smoothly and soaks into your skin without leaving a greasy feeling. Be aware that a little goes a long way. I have noticed a difference in my skin- softer, moisturized and better overall. I’m really pleased with Dior Cica Balm. WORTH it
