First, the packaging being absolutely terrible (hard to squeeze unless you shake product down/cap doesn’t make sense) but the product more than makes up for the issues. It goes on smooth and really has helped my under-eye area. Its a bit out of my price range but a little goes a long way so I don’t think I will need to repurchase for a while. Luxurious
