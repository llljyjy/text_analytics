Winter + constant use of hand sanitizer had been extremely drying on my hands. I needed a moisturizer that would last through almost hourly hand washing as well (I work in a public office). I used the Dior Cica balm, and after just 1 day of wear, I saw a marked improvement   on my dry, cracked knuckles and cuticles. The hyaluronic acid  really helped add hydration without any greasy feeling.  My hands simply felt softer and not as painfully dry.Since I have oily skin, I have not needed to try this balm on my face (so I can not speak to its results as a face moisturizer). I would love to see how this heals chapped skin around my nose after too many tissues in allergy season (it is just starting).  Overall, I enjoyed testing this product and would recommend it to seeking deep, yet non-greasy hydration. Even at its more luxury price point, I feel the 2.5 oz/75 ml size is actually quite economical, as you need very small amounts of product on your dry skin. I will be repurchasing this balm for my own skincare arsenal. Wonderful moisturizer for anywhere
