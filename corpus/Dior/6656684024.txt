I received a sample of Capture Totale Super Potent Eye Serum from Influenster and Dior to try, complimentary and I love it! It feels really nice, under my eyes! I wasnt expecting to like it, as much as I do. I’ve tried so many, under eye products and this one, pleasantly surprised me! I really like the packaging and the applicator. When I apply it, it feels cool and soothing. I have been using it for a few weeks now and I can see a difference in the skin, under my eyes. My fine lines have diminished, some and it’s also helped with my dark circles. My skin looks, more refreshed and not puffy. It also goes well under my makeup. I can’t wait to see the results, in a few months! Feels Nice, Under My Eyes!
