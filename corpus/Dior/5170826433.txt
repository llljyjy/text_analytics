This is a good face cleanser. It’s lightweight and a little goes a long way. It’s nice to add something new to my collection and I’m happy that it doesn’t irritate the skin. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to experiment more with their skincare routine and who is looking to try a new skin cleanser. Dior Cleanser
