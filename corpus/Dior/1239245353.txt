I love Dior in general and wanted to love this product but the beautiful color didn’t last at all. I reapplied quite frequently to no avail. At the end of the day, my lips weren’t that moisturized. I’m not a fan of the scent either. If you don’t like strongly scented lip products, proceed with caution. Ummm Just Okay…
