I was very excited to try this cleanser. I have never tried skincare from this brand. This is my first time using this cleanser & it met my expectations. The bottle is a good size & you don’t need to use a lot of product. It gets the job done with minimum product. The scent is nice and light, nothing overpowering or overwhelming. It feels nice on my skin. My skin didn’t have a bad reaction which is a plus. My skin feels so soft and clean after using it. I love that. I love that my skin still feels nice and hydrated after using it. It does a good job of taking off my makeup especially mascara that’s always a big issue for me. It gets any dirt or oil off at the end of the day and feels good to use to refresh my face in the morning. I would buy this cleanser given the chance. nan
