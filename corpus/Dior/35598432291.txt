I love how well this works on extra dry skin. Living in a cold state definitely need relief for my skin. I did try this on my face unfortunately it left my skin feeling dry but looking red and kind of oily. That being said I tried it on my neck line and hands love it there. My hands are so soft they donâ€™t look rough and ashy. I think its well worth the relief this time of year. Thank you #influencer and #SEPHORA  for the free sample I will definitely be purchasing this lotion again Smoothness when most needed
