My new must have for my dry winter skin!  My facial skin gets so dry in the wintertime and I also get dry patches on my arms and chest.  I have been so impressed of how quickly the Dior Cica Recovery  & Repair Multi-Use Balm has healed and hydrated my skin.  I started using this balm on my face twice a day for the first few days and now I only apply nightly.  After using this for a few weeks, my skin is no longer dry and flaky and my complexion is so radiant.  I’m still using this balm on the dry patches of my arms and chest and they are finally looking much better.  This balm just melts into your skin and it doesn’t leave a sticky residue.  If you suffer from dry flaky skin then this is a must have.  I love it!! Bye Bye Winter Dry Skin!
