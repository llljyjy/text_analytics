It had a nice thick consistency without being too heavy. Nonscented so good for people who may be sensitive to fragrance. Did pretty well on hydration, but it didn’t do anything to wow me enough to justify the price tag.  No problems with it but I’ve used similar moisturizers that cost less. If you have the money to spend then go for it. Good but pricey
