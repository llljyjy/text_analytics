My face has really appreciated this rich, luxurious serum. Influenster sent me this product gratis, for my review. It is a thicker serum and would be a good moisturizer on its own in the summer. In colder weather,  it complements a heavier moisturizer. If your skin is dry this is your drink. It has a glowing sheen. If your skin is oily, this is not for you. A Glowing Serum
