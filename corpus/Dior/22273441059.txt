i got this complimentary for my honest review. I wasn’t sure what to expect in the beginning since I’ve never tried a skincare product from Dior. I loved how it lathered and you really don’t need a lot to clean you face, which means this is cleanser is going to last long. It is really nice when using and my skin feels clean after using it but a thing that I’m unsure of is the fragrance in it. It smells really nice and I like it since it didn’t affect how it worked on me. However, it might be something to keep in mind since fragrance could cause irritation for some people. I personally love it and I think the price is fine for the amount of product you are getting! Yes.
