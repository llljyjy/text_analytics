The applicator for this product is amazing and I love how cool it feels on my under eyes. I love the formulation and how it feels on the skin and leaves my undereye feeling plump and firm. I really love everything about love eye product but…there’s a large but coming. The scent gives me  headaches. It is very over powering for me and leaves me wishing I had a scent free formula. Good but could be great!
