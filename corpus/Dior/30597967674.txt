I received this from Influenster for my review. I do not like this balm. The smell is a little strange to me and it has not helped my dry skin. I have other lotions that help my skin and they do not cost as much as this. Cost is not an issue when it comes to good products but if I can spend $15 on a product that works better than a $60 who wouldnâ€™t. This balm also caused me to break out. As soon as I noticed it I stopped using it and my skin cleared up. Not a favorite
