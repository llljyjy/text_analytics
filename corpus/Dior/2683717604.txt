I’m always open to trying different cleansers so I was looking forward to trying this from Dior!The good: the formula is very thick and rich! a little really does go a long way. It’s got great foaming action, and I loved how well it removed my makeup.The not so good: I’m in my kid 50’s and my skin is on the dry side. I feel as if this cleanser strips my skin of its natural oils a bit. I’m going to hang on to it and try it during the summer months as it may be a better fit that time of year. Not ideal for dry skin
