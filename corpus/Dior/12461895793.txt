I have pretty sensitive skin and this did not cause any breakouts or negative reactions from my skin. It left my face feeling refreshed and smooth without feeling dried out. I will mention it does have a pretty strong scent to it so for that reason I wouldnâ€™t recommend for removing eye makeup because it does burn when it gets into your eyes. Overall a great product and a little bit goes a long way so it is also a good value. Left my skin feeling refreshed!
