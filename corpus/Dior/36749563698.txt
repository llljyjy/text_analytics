I was thrilled to get this to test out for my honest review. I’ve never had a Door skincare product and had high hopes & did it deliver! This Mousse only takes the smallest pea-sized amount to completely cleanse your face of all makeup, oil, dirt, etc. with one go! Your face will be squeaky clean yet not stripped. I’ve never seen anything even remotely like this! My only complaint would be the strong scent...it smells like Ivory bar soap. I was turned off by this immediately but got used to it because this product is so great! Amazing!
