Firstly, although it’s called a balm, it is not greasy or occlusive.  It is a cream with some thickness, but it is not heavy.   Also, a little goes a very long way.  I have combination skin and my cheeks get so dry, particularly during the winter months.  It made my skin feel very soft and did not cause any blemishes.  So soft, that I decided to try it on my rough “winter” hands.  Wow!  It helped heal all the dried areas and left no residue on my hands.  The Dior Cica Recover and Repair Balm has become my new deserted island must have.  It will always be in my skin care regimen.  I received this from Influenster, but will definitely be buying it in the future.  The far off future, because remember, a little goes a long way! Excellent Product For Dry Skin - Anywhere
