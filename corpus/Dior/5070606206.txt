I was so excited about receiving this product so the first night I tried it! It has a light fragrance to it, and when I started to clean my face it seemed like a very thick hydrating product but after rinsing it off my face my skin just felt dry. I do not have dry skin I have combination skin, and I have to admit the only thing else that Iâ€™ve used before in my younger days that made me feel my skin feel this way was soap. I just cannot continue to use it with it making my skin feel so dry and if you wash around your eyes and get it in your eyes it stings like soap. I also want to say that I did receive it free from influencer. nan
