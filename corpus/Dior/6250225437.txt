I want to preface by sharing that I received this product as a gift from Influenster - thank you!!I suffer from dry skin during the cold winters and having something thicker than a lotion is always a godsend.  While Dior has marketed this as a multi-use balm for both your face and body, I have preferred to use this on my poor hands which get rough and dry, especially with all the hand washing that I do. It does its job and I would put it close to the top with Vaseline- the only “edge” that it has over Vaseline is that it hydrates, while Vaseline just “locks in” moisture, and using one after the other is a great way to maximize the balm’s efficacy, or at least in my experience. I was not a huge fan of using this on my skin, but that is more so a me issue than the product issue as my migraines did not mesh well with the fragrance, albeit light one, of the balm. Overall, I would say that this is a very solid product to use, though the price point can be a bit of a deterrent. A solid [but pricey] winter balm
