The Cica Recover Balm is amazing. I live in the desert southwest and the dry air does a number on my skin. I applied the balm and it felt so good. The balm is a nice cream that isn’t too thick, it absorbed quickly and didn’t leave a greasy feel. My skin felt so soft, moisturized and it looked healthier after one use. I also applied the balm to my hands. They are always so dry they itch. My hands looked so much better and the itch diminished right away. I think the Cica Recover Balm is a fantastic product and I recommend it. Wonderful Balm!
