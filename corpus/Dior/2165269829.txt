First off. It feels great under the eyes. When I use the the silver applicator to apply the eye serum under my eyes, it provides a cooling effect. However I don’t like how the product sits on my face after using that applicator so I have to use my finger to rub it into my skin. It has a slight fragrance to it. Did I see any results, well I notice a small difference in my under eye lines so that’s about it. I’ll just pass on this product. High end eye serum not worth your money
