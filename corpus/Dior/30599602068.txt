I received this complimentary product from Influenster for my honest opinion. I thought thisTotale Super Potent Eye Serum from Dior was a fantastic product. I liked the applicator and that it had a nice scent. The product wasn’t too greasey or sticky after applying. I honestly didn’t see a huge improvement while using it but I could see a small difference after using it for a week. I would recommend. Nice!
