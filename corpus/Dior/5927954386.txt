I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Dior in return for my honest review. I’m a 43 year old with very few fine lines underneath my eyes. However the few I had developed were a little annoying. There are some mornings when my eyes are puffy so I was very interested to see if the claims about this product were true. I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks now but not every single day and night. The product is very hydrating and I can most definitely see a difference in my under eye area. The only thing that I don’t really like about this product is the applicator tip. Although it’s cooling, it’s too big. If it were smaller, I’d give 5 stars easily. Would I repurchase this product with my own coins? Maybe. I want to use it a little longer to see my results. If it continues to diminish my under eye fine lines, most definitely. Thanks Dior and Influenster for the opportunity to review this product and I look forward to working with you again in the future. I was pleasantly surprised
