Iâ€™ve only been using the Dior Capture Totale Super Potent Serum for 10 days and can already see that some of the fine lines are less visible. I really like the textured applicator and that the ridged surface is cold which seems to help with any eye puffiness too. This product has revitalized my skin. 10/10 recommend. I look 20 years old again!
