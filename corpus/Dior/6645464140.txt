I have dry, sensitive skin. This product is fragrance free and didnâ€™t irritate my skin. It is rich and deeply nourishing but also lightweight. It left my skin soft and hydrated without feeling tacky or heavy. I love that it sinks in quickly and wears well over makeup. I use it daily as my winter moisturizer and on dry skin on my body. Great for dry skin!
