Does this come in a MEGA size? No, really. This is so extravagant that I need it in a larger size so I can put it on head to toe everyday. I love that it is fragrance free. While that isn’t a dea breaker for me when things are fragranced, I love that this is not. I live in a very dry climate and we have hard water so my skin has been very dry lately. This couldn’t of come at a better time. I have enjoyed it on my face, but I recently tried it on a really dry yucky spot on the back of my hand from too much hand washing lately and viola! My skin was soft, supple and back to normal the next day! I can’t recommend this enough. 10/10! I received this product from Influenster for free in exchange for my honest opinion. I am in Love!
