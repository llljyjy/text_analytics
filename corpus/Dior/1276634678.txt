I used Dior’s Cica Recover and Repair Multiuse Balm for 2 weeks while stopping all other skincare to fairly assess its strengths. My first impression of the minimalist packaging and tube was that it might be a no nonsense, highly effective product. It has a very mild gentle fragrance which may come specifically from its ingredients and not added perfumes and dyes. I have some sensitivity and hyperpigmentation issues from reactions occasionally, so this was much appreciated. The cream itself is balmy in texture, but spreads easily and doesn’t leave a greasy feel behind. A little doesn’t go a long way, and I needed about 2 large pea size dollops to cover my whole face and neck. It spread easily and sank in without leaving a greasy film, but I didn’t feel that it moisturized extraordinarily well. It was good nevertheless, and my skin felt adequately soft while I wore it. It also seemed to calm some rashes and irritation i developed from a new cleanser last week. With the Dior name, the minimalist packaging and quality ingredients I expected this cream to blow me out of the water. Perhaps my expectations were a little high. With those managed, I would say this is a good if not great moisturizer. Decent moisturizer
