I have been using Dior Capture Totale Super Potent Eye Serum now for about a week and I am loving the results. My skin looks brighter and feels more firm after applying each morning and evening. I donâ€™t struggle with puffiness in the mornings, but do occasionally have darker areas under my eyes and this serum helps minimize and brighten underneath my eyes. Some of my smaller fine lines have even disappeared as the serum plumps and hydrates those areas. I have enjoyed using Dior Capture Totale Super Potent Eye Serum because the applicator feels nice and cooling on the skin. Also unlike other products, I noticed a change in my skin after using the serum only 3 or 4 times. Although pricey, this is definitely an eye serum I will likely purchase in the future. Excellent Eye Serum with Cooling Applicator
