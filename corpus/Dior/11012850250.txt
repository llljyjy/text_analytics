I loved this product! While it claims that it can be used in the face and body, I only used it on my face. If itâ€™s for my body I usually just buy any fragrance free tub of lotion.  But the product in itself worked wonders on my skin! It is lightweight while moisturizing and made my makeup look incredible when I applied this under. I LOVE that it is fragrance free and great for sensitive skin. I would definitely make this a staple in my routine. Great for Face
