Love the smell of this stuff it’s so fresh received this in exchange for my review but it’s deff worth a try if you like clean skin care. It cleans your skin without stripping it. Really cleans the pores out and it foams up nicely. I would recommend for all skin types as it’s soft enough to accommodate all. Packaging is a minimalist vibe. Clean skincare clean ingredients
