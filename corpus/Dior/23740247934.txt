I really liked this product and noticed a difference on my crows feet and dark circles. The metal applicator was cooling and would instantly depuff my eye. Unfortunately if I was in a hurry, it wouldnâ€™t be as cool on the 2nd eye. Rating 4 stars because it was difficult to apply the right amount of product. It felt like either too much or too little product. Soothing & cooling
