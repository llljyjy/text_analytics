As my title says, I’m a new mom to a three month old and this has been a lifesaver. I can tell my under eyes are smooth and hydrated, I don’t mind going without concealer. The applicator feels amazing and definitely helps with the puffiness I have from lack of sleep. I’ve had people tell me I look great on days I’ve had three hours of sleep so there’s definitely something to this eye cream lol! I’ll be purchasing again since it works so well and Dior is a brand I trust. I received this complimentary in turn for my review but all opinions are my own. A lifesaver for a new mom!
