I think this is a nice eye serum. My only two negatives as of now is i do not like the grooves in the applicator. In order for it to slide vs drag, i feel like you need to push out more product than needed. The scent is pretty strong as well but thatâ€™s typical in Dior products. It is nice and hydrating and the applicator would be very nice without the grooves, feels cooling. I would have to use the product much longer to comment on whether or not it helps with fine lines and wrinkles but i do like the product overall! nan
