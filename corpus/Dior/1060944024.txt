The Dior Capture Totale Super Potent Eye Serum was great. It had a cooling sensation and I loved the applicator. It gives out just enough product without giving you too much. I usually wake up with puffy eyes and it reduces the puff as well as lessened the dark circles. I left off one star for the scent as I typically donâ€™t care to have scent in my eye products Great!
