My skin was so dry before using this balm and afterwards it felt moisturized and protected from the dry winter air.  I don’t generally have sensitive skin so I don’t seek out products without synthetic fragrances, but I don’t like heavily perfumed skin care on my face so this is really nice.  I used this as a cream mostly, but occasionally as a spot treatment on the areas that were the most dry, both were very effective.  I am planning to buy this as my regular winter time routine.  I highly recommend it for anyone with dry skin. Great for dry winter skin!
