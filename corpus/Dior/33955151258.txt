#DiorrecoverybalmFace and body recovery balm w chamomile. I’ve been using this. I have to say the more you use it the better it is. My hands are so dry. They are constantly being washed. So they tend to dry out quicker Plus you have winter on top of it. The more that I’ve used this balm. I really like it. It’s fragrance free and soaks into your skin relatively quickly. I really love that it’s fragrance free. Sometimes a fragrance can irritate my dry skin even more. Another great thing about this #Dior recovery balm is that you notice a difference right away. My hands are nice and soft in between uses. Doesn’t leave your face feeling greasy or sticky. A very welcomed addition to my face cream. It doesn’t break my face out either. Which is a plus. Thank you #Dior another wonderful product. #Influenster A must for hands and perfect for your face
