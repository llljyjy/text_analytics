I really like this face cleaner. I have to say, that this is the only product that I’ve used where my face actually feels clean after using it. The cleanser is probably one of the best that I’ve ever used. You can feel how clean your face is after washing it. I did a little research on the ingredients. The only two I found that were questionable  but very low risk were, PEG-100 STEARATE and POLYQUATERNIUM-22 which might cause a little irritation on sensitive skin. Overall, the product ratesEXCELLENT everywhere I’ve searched. I love it and Ihighly recommend. Recommend
