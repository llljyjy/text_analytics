I very much enjoyed trying this product.  The serum helped alot with the puffy bags and overall look of my eye area . I dont personally have very much darkness under my eyes so I canâ€™t say to how well it might work on that.  This serum also lasted all day under my make-up  although it is a bit sticky FYI so I just made sure to use with a primer that was more silky than tacky. I will definitely be adding this to my daily routine. Definitely long lasting
