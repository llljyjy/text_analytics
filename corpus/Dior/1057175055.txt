I got this product free in a Vox Box and couldn’t wait to try it. It smells the way all Dior skin care. It says it foams but it doesn’t foam all that much. Generally I like my cleansers to foam more, however I love the way my skin looks after I have completely rinsed this off. It looks so radiant almost a glow to my face. I do spend more time rinsing this off as it has more or a creamy consistency which isn’t my favorite but like I said the radiance of my skin outweighs any negative that I have for this. Clean and radiant
