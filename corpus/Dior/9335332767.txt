So far I really love this product! It’s states you see full results in 30 days so I’m not there yet BUT in the week I have used it I will say my skin is less dry and the texture of my skin is not as rough to the touch either! The fragrance is subtle and pleasant. It doesn’t make my skin shine or make it oily. I love it! Wish I would’ve tried sooner!
