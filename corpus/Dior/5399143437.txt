The Capture Totale Super Potent Eye Serum by Dior is so good. I apply morning and night per directions. I apply with  wry light pressure around my eye and on the upper eye lid. I come around and apply to brow bone. I do this application on each side. I have noticed from day one my fine lines and wrinkles have started to improve. It makes my eye area feel refreshed. The puffiness has also went down around my eye area. It keeps my eye area nice and hydrated also. Definitely seeing plumper and brighter skin already. I would highly recommend! I did receive this product complimentary from Influenster to review. So good
