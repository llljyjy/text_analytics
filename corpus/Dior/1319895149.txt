I received this as a complimentary product through Influenster. I have to say, I am blown away with it! I live in the very dry state of Colorado, and have developed dry skin that is still prone to breakouts as I have gotten older. This is a thick product, so I didn’t hold out much hope that I wouldn’t breakout. But I haven’t had one breakout! I actually look forward to putting this on my skin- it makes it feel so good! I will say- once you put it on you have to give it a minute to “sink in.” But after it does, your skin remains hydrated ALL DAY. No coming home to see flaky spots! I’m not so sure that I would have bought this without trying it. But I absolutely will budget for it now! Because a moisturizer like this is extremely hard to find! Lasts all day long
