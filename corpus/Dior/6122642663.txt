Overall it’s a pretty solid cleaner. I usually use a face wash with salicylic acid,so I would not replace it with this one. I really like to use this when I have makeup on,because it does actually take the makeup off pretty well. I also use it to wash makeup off my hands after swatching and stuff. Mascara is a little harder to get off with this,but even then it gets off 80%. The scent is strong,but it’s what know you signed up for when you bought it. It doesn’t linger for long after you’ve washed your face. My skin feel pretty clean after I’ve used this Very Nice
