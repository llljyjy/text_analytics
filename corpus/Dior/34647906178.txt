Yes, this is my new go- to.  For years I’ve used an Estée Lauder product that’s similar- but after receiving and using this product morning and night, I’ve found it to be incredibly effective in cleansing my makeup up.  It leaves me feeling refreshed, clean, and frankly, luxurious.  The soft scent complements the refreshing feeling.  I definitely believe it is worth the splurge and certainly recommend it. My new go-to!
