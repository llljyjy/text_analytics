I waited a while to review so I could use it for a few weeks and get a good feel on it. This face wash has really upped the game on what I put on my face. Literally first wash, I felt how TIGHT my face felt after I washed it. My face felt so clean! I’ve used another brand of face wash for years and after using this I don’t think I’ll ever go back. Clean and tight!!
