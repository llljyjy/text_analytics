I have only been using this Dior eye serum for a little over two weeks now and I can honestly say it has reduced some of the lighter lines around my eyes, not much difference in the deeper lines yet. The puffiness under my eyes is still there.The applicator is easy to use, my only issue is the tube dispensing a little too much product. It’s kinda hard to get the correct amount out squeezing the tube. As for fragrance it’s actually not bad at all. I’ll continue to use this on my fine lines around my eyes. Definitely something I’d purchase. Really good serum
