I received this serum from Influenster and Dior for free In exchange for my honest opinion. First off, I really love the packaging and applicator. The cap comes off easily and with just a slight squeeze you get the product flowing. You only need a tiny bit of the product and it goes a long way. The applicator gently glides the product on and above your eyelids . The applicator has a nice cooling effect because it’s cold. It’s relaxing to glide the serum around your eyes. I have dark circles and puffiness and after just one use I noticed a difference. The dark circles look lighter, and the puffiness decreased in about 10-15 mins. It also left a nice glowing and “slimmer” more youthful look to my eye skin. I have been using it everyday and it’s fabulous. It feels luxurious and does not leave behind any stickiness. Another thing I loved is how I am not itchy or allergic to it. I have very sensitive skin and psoriasis around my eyes and it did not irritate  me at all. I will be buying the whole product line next! Lux and works after one use
