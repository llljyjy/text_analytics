I received this full sized balm in exchange for my honest review. It is amazing for hydration! I use it on my face, neck and hands and I can tell a huge difference in how moisturized they feel! A little goes a long way and it lasts a long time! There is no greasy feeling or smell. I love that it is multi use! It is excellent for dryness and I would recommend to anyone with skin!! Thank you Influenster for sending this to me! It is a must have product indeed!! nan
