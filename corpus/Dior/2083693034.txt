Soothing, hydrating, non-sticky and smells good but too strong. I’ve been using it for a week so far and my skin has no bad reaction to it so that’s a good thing. The bottle is gorgeous but in terms of skincare you can probably find better anti-aging serums out there and for a better price as well. Dock 1 star because the scent is way too strong.
