Shocked at how soft this leaves my skin after use! I used it on my face, neck and chest. I liked it best on my chest, but using a little less product than I usually would on my face made me like it more. It is very thick and luxurious, and no noticeable scent at all. I have medium sensitive skin and that was a bonus for me. If i used too much on my face I tended to get a little oily, but overall a wonderful product that worked well at keeping the dry skin at bay! I received this product from Influenster in return for my honest review. Nice thick cream that works well with no scent!
