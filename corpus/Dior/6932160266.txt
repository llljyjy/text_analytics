I’ve been using this product for a little over a month with my sister. I have oily acne-prone skin while my sister’s skin is overly sensitive. I was worried about her skin breaking out and turning red like it usually does when we use a new product, but she hasn’t had that reaction. It has been working well for us as a night moisturizer. I tend to use a light application all over and then spot treat on my active blemishes. There is a very slight fragrance to the product, but once it’s on, you don’t even smell it. The texture is almost like a overnight mask where it is definitely on the thicker side. This would be a good moisturizer for the colder season, but it’s getting warm where I live so I’ll have to see how it works at night. I might have to just do spot treatment with the balm. I wish the price point was a little lower so I wouldn’t feel as guilty repurchasing. With that said, I can’t see myself repurchasing, but it would be a nice gift to get other people. Good product if you're willing to pay the price...
