I was a little hesitant to try this product at first.  However, when first trying, it is very smooth and had a nice light floral set that was not overwhelming. After first washing my face it felt clean and very fresh but not too dry and it worked well with my sensitive skin. The consistency of the cleanser was very light and fluffy and not a lot with needed to clean my face. Overall I would definitely include this in my skin care routine and continue purchasing this product!! Better Than Expected!!
