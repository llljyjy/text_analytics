I have been using the Dior 1967 lotion for the past two weeks. I am in love. It’s a very soft smooth silky lotion. It’s not Ronnie it’s more on the thick side brake glides on and really leaves your skin feeling moisturized but not sticky. I have been using it on all of my body parts especially the dry areas such as hands elbows and knees. He is working great. He has a very mild smell which is good with me! I would recommend this product. I also got this as part of being an Influenster their reviewer in exchange for my opinion. nan
