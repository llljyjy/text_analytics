I absolutely love this cleanser! It comes out of the bottle in a creamy luxurious consistency. I just need a tiny amount and it works into a nice lather on my skin. It cleans but doesn’t strip my skin, leaving it moisturized after I’ve finished using it. I have noticed a difference in the luminosity of my face in just a few days of using this product. I was amazed that I could see some results this quickly after beginning use. I can’t imagine the results I will see in the coming weeks. Dior is a quality name and this is a quality product! I’m extremely happy I tried this! It will definitely become a part of my skin routine! Pillow Soft Skin!
