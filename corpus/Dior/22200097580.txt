This Dior cleanser was better than I expected! I had tried some other Dior skincare items and wasn’t too impressed, so I didn’t have high hopes for this, but it ended up being pretty good. The bottle is a good size and it comes with a good amount of product. I found it quite hydrating and it has a creamy/frothy consistency. It didn’t feel stripping and was gentle but not so gentle that it didn’t leave my skin feeling clean. One thing to note is that it has a perfume-like scent which I know some people would rather not have in a skincare product. I personally don’t mind it, but it’s just something to take into consideration. nan
