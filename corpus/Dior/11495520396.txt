I got this face wash from influenster for free in exchange of my honest review.I used this for 2 weeks before posting the review so as to have a better view of how this cleanser performed. Starting with the packaging, it looks elegant and feels luxurious. A pea size amount is enough to give a rich, smooth lather so this tube would last long. The fragrance is very subtle and not overpowering. After washing my face I was surprised how squeeky clean my face felt. It worked very well in cleaning the oiliness and makeup residuefrom the face.  I also noticed my nose was smooth and could see visible difference in white heads. This left my face feeling soft and fresh. I loved the overall experience of using this cleanser and this is definitely going to be my to go cleanser!! Works amazing!!
