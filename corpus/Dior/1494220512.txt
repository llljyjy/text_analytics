I am such a big fan of Dior beauty products and was so eager to try this eye serum. I am always nervous when trying eye creams and serums because I have sensitive skin and am prone to milia. As I expected, this eye cream was rich and felt very luxurious under my eyes and it didn’t cause milia! I love the cooling metal applicator. It feels nice and soothing under my eyes. Also, I feel like I waste less product by using the applicator because it means my fingers won’t absorb the product. My only complaint is the tube. I felt it was was difficult at times to squeeze out the product because the plastic is very thick. It isn’t the best applicator for those with arthritis. Overall, I thought the product was great. My under eyes definitely looked more refreshed within the first week of using this product. luxury in a bottle
