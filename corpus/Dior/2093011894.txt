This balm works great on my face and dry areas on my body and hands. The balm is a cream, but not too thick. A little amount goes a long way. It is not greasy and does not feel heavy on my skin. It absorbs well too. I like that it is fragrance free, has hylaronic acid, and is very hydrating. This really helps all the dry areas become softer and smoother. Great overall balm. Great balm for all dry areas
