I received the Dior Cica Recover & Repair-my skin is usually dull and dry.  After first application I noticed that my face felt more hydrated.  Put some on my neck and hands and notice my crepe hands are no more. Only use about a pearl size, this stuff is thick.  Fragrance not bad.  Will definitely recommend this product. nan
