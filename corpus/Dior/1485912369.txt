I was really excited to receive this product.  I haven’t noticed drastic results. However, I’ve noticed that it calmed my under eye area so it was less puffy and the fine lines were softened. The metal tip is so soothing and glides nicely on the skin. The serum is light & a little goes a long way. It absorbs nicely into the skin. I did struggle to get the serum to squeeze out. The tune needs to be a little softer. Soothing
