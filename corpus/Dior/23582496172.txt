Loved this stuff!!! The metal tip is really soothing. It was tricky to use at first because I tried to press the serum out while the tip was on my face and it sucked my face into the hole, but I figured out it works better to squeeze out the serum upside down first and then apply. You only need a teeny tiny bit and the results are visible immediately! Amazing!
