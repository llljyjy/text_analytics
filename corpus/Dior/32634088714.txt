I was sent this product for review but all opinions are my own. I really like this product. A little goes a long way and it makes my skin very soft. It didnâ€™t have much impact on my acne so that was disappointing. If it helped my acne, i would definitely spend $50 for this product. As it stands it  , my skin is super soft and the smell is very fresh and clean. Very soft skin
