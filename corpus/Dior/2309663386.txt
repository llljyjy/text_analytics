The metal cooling tip is great! The serum is lightweight and hydrating. It absorbs pretty fast and leaves your under eyes looking fresh. The tube application isn’t the best, it makes it hard to control how much you squeeze out and the tube is pretty stiff. It also has a strong scent, which I was surprised of, since it’s a heavy perfume like scent. I think skincare should have a light/fresh scent or no scent at all. I’ve been using it for 2 weeks already and I will say that you do get used to the scent but maybe if you have sensitive skin it might not be a go to option. nan
