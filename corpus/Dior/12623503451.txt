Absolutely love this product. It comes at a premium price, but the value is there for the performance and the fact that a very TINY bit goes a long, long way. Not even a full pump is required for the face. Creates a good canvas for makeup application and after several hours makeup still looks like it was just applied. Received a small sample bottle of this and after using every drop I had to order the full size. Very complimentary to my temperamental combination skin. No facial shine or breakouts. Absolutely will continue to purchase. nan
