The texture is so creamy and thin you’ll think you need a lot but you definitely don’t! The price is hefty so knowing that helps a lot. That said, I can’t use this alone to cleanse my face. It burns my eyes so I need an oil cleanser first and then use this on just my face as a second cleanse. I have very oily skin and don’t feel this makes that worse or causes any new breakouts. I received this free from Influenster or I never would have shelled out the money to try it. I think on a sale I’d pick it up again, but full price is just too much. Good Second Cleanse
