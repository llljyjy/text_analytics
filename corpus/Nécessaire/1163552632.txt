I was really curious about trying Necessaire’s Neck Serum as I’ve really enjoyed the texture of their Body Serum.  Necessaire markets The Neck Serum as “a daily multi-peptide treatment for tech neck and aged neck.“The fast-absorbing emulsion is infused with a 9% peptide blend featuring five (5) peptides at clinically-proven concentrations to trigger skin’s own ability to create collagen. It also contains rose water and niacimide. Once again, Necessaire did not disappoint.  The texture of the Neck Serum is light but most importantly, it feels good on the skin and sinks in immediately. So there is no tacky feeling around the neck. This is especially important in the summer where it gets hot and it’s so easy to break into sweat. The other bonus is that The Neck Serum can double as moisturizer which is wonderful for warmer weather! I think my only hesitation is that it’s quite expensive at USD60. Feels as comfortable as your skin!
