This serum really surprised me. I have tried many other neck serums and creams that did nothing. I’m glad I took a before and after so I could see my results. Honestly I feel that in person my neck looks even better than on this photo. The Neck feels firmer and I’m glad my neck lines and and beginning of a turkey neck it’s better. I will be 45 years old next week and my neck it’s one area I really struggle. I will continue using this serum after I’m done w this bottle because I see it’s really working! I love that it also absorb quickly so I don’t feel oily. Ive used almost every night but even though I did miss a few nights I still saw results so I highly recommend! This really works!
