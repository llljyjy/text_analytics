Just started using this product but this is the first sunscreen I haven’t reacted to. I have tried every hypoallergenic sunscreen and I’ve always had allergic reactions. So far nothing no bumps or hives and it didnt make me break out (super acne prone skin). Less is more and pat don’t rub. Not much if any white cast either! ACTUALLY HYPOALLERGENIC SUNSCREEN!
