I really like this mineral sunscreen. I am pregnant and I can only use mineral sunscreens! This one is good. It doesn’t dry the skin out. Very hydrating sunscreen. I love the 30 spf on this. It’s a thick cream so you really have to rub it in. It doesn’t leave a white cast but if you don’t rub it in nicely, it does. Overall, I really like this sunscreen. It does what it is suppose to. Hydrates and protects your skin from sun damage. I prefer mixing this in with my foundation and I have not have any issues with it. It works. It doesn’t effect how foundation applies either. Overal, I really like it. Lovely sunscreen
