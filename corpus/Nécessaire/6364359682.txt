Necessarie has my favorite body wash so I was excited to try this Neck Serum  As a lady in my early 40’s my neck and declete are a concern for me. This serum is rich, non- greasy, and feels amazing on the skin. There is no heavy scent thank goodness. I am really loving this Serum and the results I’ve seen Amazing Serum to help prevent sagging skin.
