So far, so good.  I’ve been using for approximately a week now, and it seems to work pretty well.  The best results will more than likely show down the road.  The good news is, you don’t need much, so the bottle will last quite a long time.  It’s a very light formula, and doesn’t leave the skin sticky or greasy feeling.  It says it’s not scented, however, to me it has a faint smell.  It smells nice though, I actually enjoy it.  After a week of use, my neck looks more hydrated, therefore helping any imperfections I may have.  As far as any tightening, I haven’t experienced that yet, but like this product well enough, I’ll definitely keep using it.  I like that it’s a product specifically for my neck…give it a try, I think you’ll enjoy! Great Product!
