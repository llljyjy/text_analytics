I have been a fan of Necessaire products and was pleased to receive this in exchange for my honest review. This neck serum is pretty nice, although I don’t normally use a separate product for my neck. It has a silky smooth, soft serum texture that’s not too runny, so it’s easy to apply and absorbs well, but not too well. The ingredient list includes niacinamide, and peptides, and as it also includes rose water, it does have a natural, light rose scent that dissipates. I haven’t noticed any major changes, but this does hydrate without being greasy and has some promising benefits. It feels kind of lotion like after applied, almost protective, which is good as it helps with the feel of hydration, which one probably wants for the neck area.  The packaging is excellent (dark bottle w/ a pump!). I would recommend this to anyone interested in a skin care product to specifically target the neck area. Promising neck serum
