I enjoy the feel of this product (moisturizing, not sticky) and I feel secure knowing that when I apply this it is protecting my skin from both the sun and pollution. It has a white cast that disappears after applying a thin layer, but I am nervous that when I got o reapply or if I put a greater amount, the cast wonâ€™t disappear. Love the feel, wish there was no white/purple cast
