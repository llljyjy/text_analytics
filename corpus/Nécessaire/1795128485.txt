I’ve been using this serum for the last few days and so far my neck has been loving this product. My neck tends to be very sensitive to products, but so far I have not experienced any irritation. With the level of ingredients like peptides and humectants, I feel confident that will continue to use, my neck will start to transform, being more plumped and tight. The texture feels amazing, I’m tempted to use this on my face, that’s how wonderful this serum feels. Not greasy or sticky, just sank in and moisturized. This serum will be a great addition to my routine. Non sticky and moisturizing
