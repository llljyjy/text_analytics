This is my first necessaire product and wonâ€™t be my last. I love that you can use this mineral sunscreen on both your body and face. It has hyaluronic acid and niacinamide in the Ingredients to help with hydration which I absolutely need. The scent is very light. The sunscreen absorb quickly and left me feeling hydrated. No white cast. Oh and can we talk about the packaging. I can see why the hype. Must have hydrating spf this summer
