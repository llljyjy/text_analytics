This is a great and super hydrating neck serum. It soaks right in and doesn’t feel heavy. As someone who typically doesn’t include a separate neck product into my routine, it was nice to have something that is dedicated to this area. I found that it leaves my skin moisturized and my neck lines a little less visible. An amazing neck lotion
