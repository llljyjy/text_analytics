For anyone in the market for a new sunscreen, I highly recommend Necessaire Mineral SPF 30! I received this complimentary in exchange for my review.  It’s a mineral sunscreen infused with skincare actives like Hyaluronic Acid which strengthens skin’s protective barrier. It’s such a nice daily sunscreen that goes on smoothly and I love that it not only protects my skin from the sun but it also uses Non-Nano Zunc oxide only. My skin feels hydrated but not greasy. It’s my new go-to!! Best daily sunscreen!
