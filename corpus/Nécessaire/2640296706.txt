I love Necessaire products and their body care is truly amazing, my body just loves it so much. So happy that I am trying out their newest neck serum. The texture itself is perfect. It absorbs quickly without giving me any greasy or tacky feeling. I love the formulation which is designed for the neck that is more dedicated. I personally love this serum that works as a serum plus moisturizer so I donâ€™t have to put an extra layer on my neck. I do recommend this neck serum if you have seen the early stage of aging on the neck. Quick absorb, formulated for neck
