I’m about excited about this sunscreen because it’s the first time I see a sunscreen that has the perfect consistency; it’s not liquidy and not creamy. It feels like a moisturizer and it’s easy to apply and blend into the skin. No smell and I love the packaging. It’s yellow and it comes with a plump which is awesome to take anymore without worrying if the product will get messy in your bag. great packaging and consistency
