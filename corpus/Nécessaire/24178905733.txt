This is a beautiful serum that is super silky and glides on with ease. It’s more of a cream than a serum. I don’t notice a distinct scent when using it and I also love that it’s not too sticky. It does give the skin a lot of moisture which results in a slightly plumper looking neck area. However my deep neck lines don’t appear to be any different after 28 days of consistent use. I can’t help but use it on parts of my face and also my hands as well since a little goes a long way with this formula. It comes in an aesthetic, glass bottle. I love that it’s so clean and full of peptides. I was hoping for more results with neck lines at this point but I do enjoy the product. I like it
