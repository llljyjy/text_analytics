This is a standout mineral sunscreen for me. A lot of them leave a white cast (even on my lighter skin tone), but I didnâ€™t notice it with this one.It also has some great nourishing ingredients added (like Squalane, Shea Butter and Hyaluronic Acid) that make it less drying than other mineral sunscreens and gives it a creamy texture.Overall I prefer to use this on my body but I also applied it to my face a couple of times, and it works well.One thing to note is that the pump provides quite a bit of product. So if you want a smaller amount for your face, try to push it down gently, otherwise you will end up with too much product. I also love that this is fragrance free. great mineral sunscreen
