I’ve been trying to pay more attention to my neck in my skincare routine because I’m now 28 and have thick ‘tech neck’ lines in my skin and see that my 54 year old mother who never used neck cream is starting to have the most wrinkles in that area. This serum from necessaire is really light weight, comfortable, and not sticky. The texture reminds me of a watery lotion. I’ve been putting in on after my showers at night and really liking it so far! nan
