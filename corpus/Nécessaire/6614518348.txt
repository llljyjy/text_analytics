This sunscreen is almost perfect to me. I love the simple packaging. The texture of the sunscreen is perfect. It’s not too heavy and leaves a nice glow on my skin. The scent isn’t heavy at all which I love! The only problem is that you can’t really control the amount of product that comes out. One full pump is way too much product so you have to slowly press on the pump to release less product. It’s not a huge deal breaker to me though and I will definitely repurchase when I run out :) Almost the perfect sunscreen
