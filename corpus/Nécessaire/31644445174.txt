This is a great product and I definitely recommend it for someone who prefers mineral sunscreen or has to use mineral sunscreen over chemical. I find it to be a little on the $$ end of the spectrum for an SPF but it does a good job. I do feel as if you need to apply more product than recommended because 1/2 is the recommended amount for the face...but i personally feel like that’s not enough and most dermatologists say at least 3 finger swatches worth are recommended. It doesn’t leave the face greasy, I like the dewy finish and does have Hyaluronic acid, which definitely is hydrating. Overall, other than a price point being a little high, it’s a good product in my view A product that does the job
