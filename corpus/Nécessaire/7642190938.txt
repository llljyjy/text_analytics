I love NÉCESSAIRE body wash so I was excited to try their mineral sunscreen. This product is for both face and body, and the pump dispenses a generous amount, definitely enough for larger areas (when used for the body). The cream doesn’t feel greasy on the skin, it’s moisturizing and gives no white cast if applied in a thin layer. I really liked that it doesn’t have a scent either.It also has some good ingredientslike hyaluronic acid and niacinamide. Very nice product! Great!
