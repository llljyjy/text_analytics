I’ve been using this for the past few days and here are my initial thoughts. For a mineral sunscreen, it absorbs very well and feels non-greasy. I am medium skin toned so I find that I have to blend quite a bit for the white cast to completely go away. The good thing is that it does go away. It also wears well under makeup. The only thing I don’t like is the strong smell. It kind of smells like glue but I feel like a lot of sunscreens do. Also this is for the face and body so the smell is not a dealbreaker as I can still apply this on my legs, etc. nan
