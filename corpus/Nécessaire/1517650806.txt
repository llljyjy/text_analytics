Can I just say how much I LOVE that this product is fragrance-free?!?!?! The texture is divine and I love that it’s packaged in glass. AND.... the design of the bottle makes it look so good it stays out on my vanity.I’ve been using this nightly for the past two weeks and love how it moisturizes my neck and decollete with just the right amount of hydration.  I see a lot more suppleness but I think I’d need to use the product longer to see more results. LOVE this neck serum
