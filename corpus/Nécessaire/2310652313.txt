First off - love the skin-loving ingredients, including hyaluronic acid, vitamin B5, and vitamin e. This sunscreen is very moisturizing and great for your face and/or body. I’m acne prone and it didn’t cause me to breakout. No scent, which I prefer, and beautiful packaging. Amazing protection and no white cast. A winner! I recommend applying to hands even for driving or flying for extra protection. Very lightweight and non-greasy feel. The Right Stuff
