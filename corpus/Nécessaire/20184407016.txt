I’m usually picky about sunscreen because I hate the feeling on my skin, but I was pleasantly surprised how much I like Nècessaire! Unlike most mineral sunscreens, this one does not leave white residue behind. It applied light and smooth with no greasy hands after. I’ll definitely be using this for beach days! Great mineral sunscreen!
