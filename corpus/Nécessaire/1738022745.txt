So far I’ve been really happy with this neck serum! Given that I’m in my late 30s I’ve seen some loss of firmness in my neck area so I’ve been looking for treatments to regain it. This product is nicely packaged and the texture is silky and sinks in immediately- I didn’t have any residue left on my clothing from use after giving it 5 mins to sink in. My neck seems a bit firmer after using- definitely more hydrated. nan
