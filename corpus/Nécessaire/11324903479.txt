Im currently pregnant so I can only use mineral sunscreens for face and body.  This is a nice, lightweight sunscreen that feels hydrating on my face.  It seems to blend in easily and I dont notice any white cast on my light-medium skin tone.  Im very impressed with the loving skincare ingredients such as niacinamide and hyaluronic acid. I also prefer sunscreens that are unscented! Overall, Iâ€™ve used a lot of products from this brane and I love them all. So happy with this sunscreen!
