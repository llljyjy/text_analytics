Omg!! New Favorite SPF!! I’m always a mineral spf fan, but this formula is next level. Doesn’t feel heavy or greasy at all! Layers well with other skincare products and wears well under makeup, no pilling. The texture is sooo lightweight too! Doesn’t have that strong spf smell. Def would be spendy to use this as a body spf though nan
