This skincare is one of the best and was able to be applied on smoothly, which is something that I truly loved! The ingredients  that stood out to me was 20% Non-Nano Zinc Oxide and Algae Extract, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin B5, Vitamin E so I knew just with these ingredients  that my skin would be able to be hydrated and smoother! The product texture was very smooth and also felt smooth. It was so easy to apply on my skin. Hydration
