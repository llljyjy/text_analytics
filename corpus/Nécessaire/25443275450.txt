I like Mineral sunscreen and this is very easy to use plus hydrating one. It has spf 30 which gives protection from sun rays. It has ingredients like Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin B5, Vitamin E which helps to moisturise and reduce fine lines. Texture is smooth and It gets blend so nicely on my face and doesnâ€™t leave any white cast on face. nan
