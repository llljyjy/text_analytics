I’ve been using this serum (almost) daily for a month, and I’ve really noticed a difference in the bands on my neck. The creases are still there, of course, but they don’t appear as deep. The serum has a light yet rich texture and spreads easily — just one pump is enough for an application. I like to apply it to my neck and massage any extra along my jawline as part of my nightly routine, after cleansing and moisturizing my face. It is fragrance-free but has a light, pleasant scent. Works to reduce tech neck!
