I love the packaging of this sunscreen. Also it’s smaller than I expected , but I actually like it better that way because I can put it in any kind of purse. Has a great little pumpApplicator. Smells like sunscreen, not perfumed in any way which I also like. I like that you can use it on both face and body, but I don’t notice anything very different from other sunscreens. nan
