This physical barrier sunscreen is a home run for me!  It’s super creamy and surprisingly there is no white cast and it absorbs quickly, leaving me with a nice glow. I am so impressed! I use it on my skin in place of a moisturizer and apply to face, neck and décolletage every day.  I love that it has Niacinamide and other moisturizing ingredients working hand in hand with the zinc. If I’m going out and about I apply to my arms as well. The pump makes it easy to control the amount I disperse.  This is a total win for anyone like me that is a daily sunscreen wearer. THE BEST!
