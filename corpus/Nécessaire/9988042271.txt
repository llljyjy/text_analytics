This neck serum works. I use it every night before bed at the end of my skincare routine. I swipe in an upwards motion as the bottle says. I even started using it with a Gua sha for added bonus. My neck has never looked so sleek. The texture is nice, not too thin or thick. Goes on really smoothly. My 28 day before (black top photo) and afters (close up of neck) show it! nan
