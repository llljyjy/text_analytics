This is a very lightweight but solid spf product to have this summer! It’s got a very satin and soft finish without feeling greasy or thick. Absorbs into skin nicely and doesn’t have a tacky smell. Actually made my skin feel very hydrated while out at the pool all day. Perfect for the face and body and definitely a must have product for you daily routine!!! Love it 10/10! MUST-HAVE 10/10 Product
