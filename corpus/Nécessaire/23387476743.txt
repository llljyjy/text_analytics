I am happy with this mineral (Zinc oxide) sunscreen. It is very light weight like a lotion, very easy to blend and very hydrating (thanks to the Hyaluronic acid) on my dry skin. It doesnâ€™t leave a white cast on the skin. The formula is fragrance free which suits my dry sensitive skin. It can be applied under the makeup or the last step of the morning skin care routine. I use a single pump to cover my face and neck. A lightweight hydrating sunscreen
