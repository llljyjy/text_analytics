Beautiful and sustainable packaging. I love Necessaire products. This sunscreen is in a bright yellow bottle. It contains hyaluronic acid so it felt really good on my dry skin. No white cast. I loved how the texture blended into my skin. Mineral sunscreen with SPF 30. Loved it. Easy to carry in my purse. Loved it
