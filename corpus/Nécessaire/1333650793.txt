As I have aged the skin on my neck has developed deep lines and uneven skin tone.  This was very apparent once I started spending a lot of my work day on zoom calls.  This product definitely improved the overall look of my neck and d√©colletage, though subtly.  I think some of the lines have softened and my skin tone is a little more even.  I hope that with continued use I will continue to see improvements.I added a before and after picture.  I tried to keep the lighting and clothing the same to help show any difference in my skin.
