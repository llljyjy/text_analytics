I love how this sunscreen has niacinamide and hyaluronic acid in it. These are actually my two favorite ingredients that are really great for my skin. They work so well on hydrating my skin and not making my skin vreak out or become itchy. I love how this also is reef safe and has no silicones or pegs. This makes the sunscreen absorb better into my skin and I always apply it after light moisturizer so my skin can have that smooth feel. I also really enjoy how the texture is lightweight and goes from a cream to a serum like feel. Beautiful sunscreen
