The consistency of this sunscreen is super smooth + hydrating. I am pretty fair with sensitive combo skin for reference. The downside was that unfortunately it takes a lot of blending to get rid of the white cast and even after it’s blended in, you can still see some residue on the skin. It did not break out my skin, didn’t burn my eyes + left me looking super glowy. I’ll probably continue to use this on my body, but not my face. nan
