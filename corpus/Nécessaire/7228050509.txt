I LOVE this sunscreen. I always look for mineral sunscreens and this one is great. It is spf 30 and I’m able to apply this everyday and it hasn’t dried out my skin, but it actually feels extra hydrated. It is fragrance fee which is super nice and love that it has 20% zinc oxide and no silicones! The pump applicator is also super nice. I love it! Best Sunscreen!
