The texture of this is SO thick. Not that that’s an issue but it takes a long time to rub in. I have to go back and rub it in multiple times or there will be white areas and particles on my face. It’s a lot of work and also not great under makeup. I will use for no makeup days but not my ideal mineral formula unfortunately. Thick and difficult to blend
