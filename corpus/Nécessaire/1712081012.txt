This is a 100% mineral sunscreen with non-nano zinc that acts more than a sunscreen! It has niacinamide which helps support the skin’s protective barrier and hyaluronic acid which keeps the skin hydrated. This protects against both UVA and UVB. It has clean ingredients and does not contain silicones or PEGs.I love the way this feels on my skin! It feels lightweight, as though I’m applying a lotion. It leaves my skin feeling soft without that heavy sunscreen feeling!What I don’t like is that the cream sits on top of my skin and does take time to rub in to avoid a white cast. Also, it is not waterproof. However, I do feel good about using a sunscreen that does not contain silicones or PEGs. Feels nice! Clean ingredients.
