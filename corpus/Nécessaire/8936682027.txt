I absolutely love the Nécessaire sunscreen; you know how you get that smell of chemical sunscreen when you go to the beach? Don’t worry, this doesn’t have that scent, it’s completely fragrance free (at least for my nose it doesn’t smell like the example I stated). This is perfect for that everyday use, you don’t need a lot and little goes a long way with applying - it’s best to wait about 15 minutes before going out in the sun and reapply after 2 hours. I would like to add that everything is recyclable: box, insert, and bottle! Definitely give this a try! nan
