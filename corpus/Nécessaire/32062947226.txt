I was super excited to try the newest launch from Necessaire. I love that this is a 100% mineral sunscreen just because certain chemical SPF’s sometimes make me break out.  I’m happy to report that this blends into my light medium skin tone and leaves no white-cast behind.  This will definitely be a go-to product all year long. My new go-to product!
