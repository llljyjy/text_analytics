I am very into clean anti-aging skincare, but really never thought to try a neck cream before. As a woman in her late 30s, I’m definitely trying to freeze the clock. lol I decided to incorporate this into my beauty routine & I’m glad I did. The texture is very light & it absorbs beautifully! Virtually no scent & the glass packaging is great! I was skeptical, but the skin on my neck has never looked or felt so smooth & firm. I’m a believer! Loving it!
