Great sunscreen! I’m a big fan of the pump vs tube and love that my skin didn’t feel dry after using. It has a much creamier and more moisturizing consistency. I used under make up and it didn’t pill at all. The only thing I didn’t like… because it has no added scent, it ends up having a weird smell to it. Thankfully it doesn’t linger! Works well and easy to apply!
