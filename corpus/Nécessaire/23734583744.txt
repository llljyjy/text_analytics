This is the only mineral sunscreen I like to use regularly for both my face and my body. This sunscreen does not leave a white cast, it’s easily absorbed by my skin with no greasy finish. It’s hydrating enough that sometimes I use it in place of my moisturizer. The only down side is that it’s not water or sweat proof, so just remember to reapply as many times as needed throughout the day. nan
