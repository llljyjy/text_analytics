This spf has a similar feel to most mineral sunscreens. Though it’s a bit lighter which I like because that makes it a lot easier to blend in. It does leave an initial white cast but that goes away after a few minutes. It does not dry not but it’s not greasy feeling either, it feels like a hydrating moisturizer. nan
