I like that this is fragrance free and for both the face and body. It does leave a slight white cast unfortunately if you don’t blend it well or accidentally use too much product. The consistency is isn’t too thick which is good but it’s also slightly sticky. I would rather use this on my body than face just because I feel like this won’t help my oily skin. nan
