I love that this SPF takes a really natural approach to sun protection, as well as the addition of Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin B5, Vitamin E and niacinimide to protect, moisturize, and keep your skin happy throughout the day. Since this sunscreen is very natural, it is not water or sweat proof, so you will need another option for days at the pool. The white cast was minimal for a mineral sunscreen, but I’m not the biggest fan of how it sits on the skin after, feels a little stickier than I’d prefer. The bottle is too small to regularly use as a full body sunscreen, but works great for getting face and neck area.  Overall I really love the intent of this product and the packaging is beautiful.
