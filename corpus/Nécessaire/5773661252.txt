I’m glad Necessaire came out with a sunscreen product, especially for this dreadful summer months. I love that it’s a spray, which makes it easy to apply and super lightweight. It’s also compact enough where you can carry it in your purse. SPF 30 as well, so I feel safe knowing that it will product my face and body. I would particularly use this for face, as the size it small to use solely for body. nan
