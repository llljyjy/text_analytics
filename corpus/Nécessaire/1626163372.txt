Love this new sunscreen! It has Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin B5, Vitamin E, and niacinamide! It is very light and unlike my other sunscreens feels like lotion! It doesn’t have a heavy smell, and it’s easy to apply. I walk my dog outside several times a day and it works very well with reapplication as well. I’ve used this on my face a few times and I have not had a breakout. I’d LOVE. A larger size of this!! nan
