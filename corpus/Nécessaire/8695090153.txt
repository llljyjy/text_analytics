While I love the HA & Niacinamide in the formula, this is a true mineral sunscreen & definitely leaves a white cast. The texture is thick & it does melt down a bit as you apply but the white cast stays even after 15 minutes resting. I use a skin tint on top of this so I’m not too bothered by it, but keep this in mind if you’re tan or deeper skin tone, because you will see the white cast on bare skin. The formula feels hydrating & comforting to my dry skin, leaves a nice glow but not dewy. Beyond the white cast I can’t find a problem with this sunscreen. I’m not mad at the price either! Mineral sunscreens never work for my tan skin so I didn’t expect it to be without issue, but it’s manageable under a tint. Overall, I’m kind of impressed! If you like mineral sunscreens & don’t mind a cast or plan to wear makeup on top - I recommend this for sure. White cast? Yes.
