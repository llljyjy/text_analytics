Im usually conscious about my neck so I do apply my facial serums to my neck pretty much on a daily basis. My issue is that I have a couple of deep lines on my neck those are the ones that are hard to improve without actual intervention from a derm. I have continuously used the serum, it has a nice creamy light weight texture. I find the serum to be a tad sticky if applied on dry skin so best to use on damp skin. When applied on damp skin it works perfectly without any tackiness. My favorite way to use it to right after I come out of the shower, I apply the neck serum first followed by a body serum. I don’t see a significant improvement in firmness and texture maybe because I already take very good care of the neck area. I do find this serum to be quite hydrating. Will be great during the winter when it’s cold outside and if we don’t properly cover the neck area or the central heating is on. Hydrating neck serum
