I like this sunscreen, it is a mineral formulation that absorbs rather quickly and it is nongreasy. I love the fact that it has no harmful chemical ingredients and contains 20% zinc oxide, hyaluronic acid, and niacinamide. Mineral sunscreen activates right away and this can be used alone or under makeup. I love how fast this absorbs into the skin, I was a little skeptical as most sunscreens leave a white cast on me. I do, however, suggest applying the product thoroughly if you have a darker/tan skin tone like me as the formula does come out very white. One pump is often enough to cover the full face and neck, but you can also use this for your body as well. When used on my face, it doesn’t feel ’heavy’ at all which is an added plus as it is something that can be used daily! (*this product was gifted from Nécessaire for my honest and unbiased review) Great daily SPF
