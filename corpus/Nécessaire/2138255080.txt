I generally love this brand but I hate this sunscreen.  It leaves a horrible white cast, even on my very pale skin. I also found that it burns and irritates my eyes, and none of my other favorite mineral sunscreens do this. This was a major let down, especially considering the price. I will be returning it after only a few uses… it’s terrible on my face and too expensive to use as a body sunscreen. white cast even on very pale skin
