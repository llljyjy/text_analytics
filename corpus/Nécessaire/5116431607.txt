Switching to a mineral sunscreen has been difficult since most sunscreens don’t absorb quickly into the skin. Luckily, Necessaire’s mineral sunscreen has been able to blend seamlessly into the skin. With no silicones, I was worried the texture would be thick but the consistency is still thin. It is a nice prep before makeup! Must have mineral sunscreen!
