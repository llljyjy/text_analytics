It is a nice light weight neck serum that glides on easily and absorbs well.  It has no fragrance for those that are sensitive. I like having a product that is specifically formulated for my neck because the skin on my neck is so different than my facial skin. This neck serum is a welcome addition to my morning and night skincare routines. Great addition to my skincare routine
