So I wanted to love this product because I love Necessaires other products but this one was just okay. First, I do appreciate this is 100% mineral and silicone free. I also love there is no scent. But it left that white cast on my face and felt a bit tacky on my skin. So this sunscreen was just okay for me. Just okayâ€¦
