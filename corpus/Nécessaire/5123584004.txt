This neck serum has a thick, but watery based consistency. There is zero oil like texture or residue, and the skin drinks it up. I noticed two weeks in that my lines on my neck started to diminish and it started being a more youthful look. I also apply to my décolleté area and it’s seriously done wonders on those lines as well!! nan
