I have used several of The Necessaire products before, their skin serum being my favorite. I’m 34 and have known for a while I needed to incorporate a good neck cream into my regimen. I really appreciate that the cream has no fragrance as I am quite sensitive to perfumes. While I can’t say this was life changing, I did notice my neck was brighter, firmer, and more supple. Lightweight but adequate. Love It for 30 Somethings!
