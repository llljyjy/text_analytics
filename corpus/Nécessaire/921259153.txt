I am in my late 40s and have to pay extra attention to my neck area. I love that this was fragrance free, and the texture was very light and didnâ€™t feel heavy or greasy on my neck. It felt so silky and was so easy to apply. It has helped nourish and hydrate my neck area. I apply it on right after a shower or whenever I need some TLC throughout the day. I love how my neck feels soft and looks smoother with continued use. Great neck serum!! Great neck serum!!
