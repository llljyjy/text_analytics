I’m already a fan of the brand and having this was a great addition to my collection. I always seem to ignore it forget about my neck so this has been a great reminder of tending to my neck   This serum is lightweight and absorbs into skin easily. It doesn’t have a scent at all.  So far after a few weeks of using , I’ve noticed that my neck looked firmer and tighter. The lines I have on my neck are kinda fading away.  I’m impressed. Impressed
