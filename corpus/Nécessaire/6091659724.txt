This is a great SPF formula . I have combo dry leaning , acne prone skin and the combo of ingredients here are fantastic . I’ve always loved combining Hyaluronic acid and niacinamide so I was super pumped to see these together in an spf because not only do they work beautifully in hydration but also in helping mitigate breakouts which can sometimes occur with use of spf. I find this formula is really friendly on my skin and I apply it every two hours when I’m out and about in the sun . Great formula
