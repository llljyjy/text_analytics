I have used this at least 5 times on my face and once in my body. So far I am in love! It layers really well with makeup on the skin. It is super non-irritating and thin. It is white (I am super pale) so I am not sure how much of a white cast it gives. I will continue to happily use this. New Favorite Face Sunscreen
