I absolutely love NÉCESSAIRE  The Sunscreen - Mineral SPF 30 it’s easy to apply and blends in  nicely to my face and body. I really like how this sunscreen is Non-Nano Zinc Oxide 20% and Algae Extract it helps  protect my skin from UV rays and pollution, it also contains Hyaluronic acid which great for dry dull skin it keeps it so hydrated while also helping to reduce wrinkles and fine lines and also has Niacinamide that supports  the skin’s protective barrier. My new favorite sunscreen
