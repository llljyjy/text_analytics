This sunscreen is the best mineral sunscreen. The texture doesn’t feel thick and feels more like lotion on my skin. It has a slight cast so I prefer to use it on my body rather than my face. It doesn’t feel sticky on absorbs nicely onto my body. I love how it is fragrance free as well. Definitely recommend. nan
