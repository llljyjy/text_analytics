I really enjoyed this mineral sunscreen considering that it has hyaluronic acid along with vitamins for ample hydration and support! I think it’s vital to apply sunscreen daily and love that I can skip a few serums based on the the ingredients that are already infused into this sunscreen! I also do like the texture because it’s easy to apply and spreads well. I have used one other mineral sunscreen that was really thick so I was surprised on the application of this one! Lightweight and hydrating
