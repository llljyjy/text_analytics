Guys, I think I found the one. It didn’t leave my face white, it feels really good like a quality daily moisturizer, it’s non nano zinc and doesn’t contain so many chemicals they usually put in spf these days! Also has hyaluronic acid, vitamin B and vitamin E! I’m in love, definitely my new daily spf I finally found the one !
