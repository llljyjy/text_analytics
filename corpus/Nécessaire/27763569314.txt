Woohoo I am so in love with The Sunscreen - Mineral SPF 30 by Necessaire. The formula is super nice on the skin, it glides smoothly without leaving the white cast. This absolutely perfect to use in my daily routine, just use it 15 minutes before going out and don’t forget to re apply in every 2 hours, and I’m ready to enjoy my summer in the pool. Highly recommended. Great for summer.
