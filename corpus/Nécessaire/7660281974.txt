My skin is very sensitive so I always use mineral sunscreen. This one was the perfect mineral sunscreen. The formula is not too thick, but because itâ€™s a mineral sunscreen I still warm the sunscreen in my hand by rubbing prior to application. This helps application go on flawlessly. It leaves no white cast and looks beautiful on. I looked super radiant. Perfect
