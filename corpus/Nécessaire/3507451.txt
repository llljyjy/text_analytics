With summer and travel back on the table, I am excited about being in the sun and using sunscreen to protect myself.  I love the texture of this sunscreen, its easy to apply, and it easily blends into the skin without too much rubbing.  it’s soft and gentle.  There is no white cast, as it feel more like a moisturizer and its 20% zinc oxide, a physical protection for the skin,  It protects against both UVA and UVB.  It’s an everyday sunscreen of SPF 30.  I love the niacin amide and hyaluronic acid in it for my skin. nan
