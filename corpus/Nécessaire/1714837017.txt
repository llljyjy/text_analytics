I am a Necessaire STAN. I use the body wash and the body serum religiously, and I am also the MOST pale, especially in the winter and have been looking for a new SPF, mostly just to change things up. I had previously been using LRP Touleraine moisturizer with SPF 50, and that works great, but had my eye on this as a next product. I wear sunscreen year round, but in the winter drop down to SPF 30-ish from 50-60 in the spring/summer. This is moisturizing but not slimy or greasy and my face felt great all day! It wears nicely under makeup, but I cant speak to leaving a white cast because.... I am very fair. So far no breakout activity, and my skin is happy. I would repurchase this. This brand does no wrong
