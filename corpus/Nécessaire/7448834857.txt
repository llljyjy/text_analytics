I had really high hopes for this product and I’m kind of on the fence. I have olive skin and this does leave a bit of a white cast no matter how long I rub it in. However, I love the texture and how moisturizing it is. Does stay a bit tacky after application and I didn’t find that it sat super well under makeup but I don’t wear makeup every day so I’ve been using on pool/park/beach days. Love the packaging. Not my fave but I don’t mind using it because the ingredients are good. Moisturizing for a mineral sunscreen!
