After using this for a few weeks I’ve noticed a bit of subtle changes to the skin on my neck. A lot of the more fine lines have all but disappeared, and the one really deep crease has diminished a bit. I think it’ll continue to fade with continued use. All in all I think this is a really nice product that works as intended. I know that these days we want instantaneous results, and while I think this does help pretty quickly to get to finer lines, if you have deeper creases it’ll take a little longer. Definitely recommend! Really helped!
