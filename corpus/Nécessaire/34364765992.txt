Usually I love mineral sunscreens,that too it’s face and body, it has a little thick consistency but gives a no white caste and doesn’t feel oily or greasy on skin. Easy to reapply and goes well with under makeup too. But it’s not waterproof or sweat proof.it has 20%zinc. Good face and body sunscreen
