I didn’t think I needed a neck serum in my routine but I guess I do! Within the last couple of years I’ve noticed that the skin on my neck isn’t as smooth as it use to be and the natural wrinkles that occur there are looking more prominent so I was happy to give this a try and so far I’m happy with the results I’ve seen. The serum is smooth, soaks in quickly, doesn’t leave a sticky feeling on the skin and has a very light pleasant fragrance—which I assume is from the rose water. The most noticeable change is how soft the skin feels on my neck. There is a slight reduction in how deep set my wrinkles look but I would need to use it much longer I assume to fully see the benefits of this serum. I’ve also been taking the excess and putting it on top of my hands and have noticed the same changes there too! I’ll definitely keep using this! Happy with this!
