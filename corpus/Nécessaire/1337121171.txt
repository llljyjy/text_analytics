This is exactly what I needed.  I am in my forties and started to take care of my neck area  more seriously. First I love the slick packaging that the serum comes in. The pump is easy to use and gives me the right amount I with just one pump and one pump is the exactly what I need to cover my neck and decolletage.  The texture is smooth and silky and  applies very easy on the skin and makes it firm and  yet soft immediately, I use it with a small roller massager and already see my double chin smoothing out.  Is perfume free, but there is  beautiful rose scent from the rose water in it and I love it. Exactly what I needed.
