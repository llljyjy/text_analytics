I Just tried this for the first time as Iâ€™ve been increasingly unhappy by the way my neck is aging differently to my face, and the appearance of the dreaded turkey neck.Oh my goodness, I am so happy I did. From the very first application I noticed a massive difference in the appearance of my neck. Two pumps is enough for the whole area to be covered, so hoping this lasts a while. I plan to never run out... I love it! I love it
