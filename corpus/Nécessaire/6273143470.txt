I have been using this serum by Necessaire for about a week. It absorbs nicely into my skin leaving my neck area feeling well-hydrated.  The serum is fragrance free with a texture that is smooth and silky.  The skin around my neck remains firm and moisturized for most of the day. I like that this product contains skin supporting peptides and is made responsibly, sustainable, and eco-friendly. I definitely recommend it. Encouraging Results!
