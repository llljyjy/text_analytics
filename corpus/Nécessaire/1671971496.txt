I have been using this Neck Serum for weeks now and absolutely love it. I have noticed the skin on my neck is firmer and feels much more smooth. The application is a breeze for me after showering and I feel it moisturizes enough on its own that I donâ€™t need to apply a moisturizer after it. The texture is light and very velvety. Would recommend and definitely will be repurchasing it. A Savior For My Neck
