I am liking this neck serum. To be frank I noticed the skin on my neck looking and ageing very differently than my face. So I was in need of a good neck skin care product. This serum is lightweight and absorbs easily into my skin. The neck area immediately feels hydrated. Itâ€™s not sticky at all and layers well with other skincare that I use. My neck area has shown signs of improvement. Another Necessaire product I like. Lovely Neck Serum!
