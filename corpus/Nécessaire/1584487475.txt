I have been using NÉCESSAIRE The Neck Serum for a few weeks now and so far I’ve been loving it! I noticed my neck is pretty dry, which causes my neck to look more aged than it is. Probably because I haven’t paid enough attention to that part of my body! Also, my neck is really sensitive and lots of moisturizers itch. But not this one! The Neck Serum is a lightweight emultion that is easy to apply to my neck and chest and does not irritate my sensitive skin. I definitely see less crepiness, the serum adds a nice amount of hydration. I love that it has peptides and is fragrance free! Definitely worth trying out! Bye crepiness
