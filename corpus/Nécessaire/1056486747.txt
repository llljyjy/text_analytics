We barely see products in the market that focus on neck so I think itâ€™s awesome! The texture is a light lotion so not a typical serum you would expect. It absorbs quickly and no fragrance. It provides hydration with some really good ingredients like peptide which is amazing. Little goes a long way and I will use this every night. For your neck :)
