I love mineral sunscreens and I was so excited to hear that Necessaire was launching one! The yellow packaging is so fun and I love the pump. I found that patting and not rubbing was the best way to apply this sunscreen, and letting my skincare absorb for a bit before application. I love the 20% zinc oxide for protection and Niacinamide is always a favorite for skincare. No whitecast and no fragrance means this one is a winner! The only downside is that it is not sweatproof or waterproof so I probably will use this more in the winter when Iâ€™m not sweating constantly outside as much. nan
