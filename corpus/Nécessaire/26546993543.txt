I have been enjoying this serum a lot. I love how hydrating and refreshing it feels. Applying it is always a very pleasant experience that I look forward to daily. The scent is light and lovely which also makes the application very relaxing and enjoyable, especially when applying it at night during my daily skincare routine, before going to bed. The consistency of this serum is light and the hydrating formula soaks in ultra fast leaving skin feeling and looking rejuvenated and very silky. I cannot believe how much of a difference it has already made and how surprised I am with my skin results! I am seeing quickly improvements in my tech lines and my skin feels replenish and tighter with every use. Canâ€™t wait to see more results in the upcoming weeks! nan
