I have been using the Necessaire Neck serum for more than a month.  I love getting products specifically for my neck.   I definitely have issues between tech neck and aging.   I really do love this serum because it’s soothing and there are no irritating ingredients.   It is a really nice serum/gel lotion consistency, feels hydrating and I am a huge fan of peptides for making a difference in the quality of my skin, so I love that this has 6 different peptides.  Some days I feel like I’m seeing nice improvement in skin quality of my neck and others I do not really notice, (or maybe i’ve been holding my neck weird and my lines are more pronounced again)  but I think this is such a solid product and really nice to treat your neck to a bit of extra attention with its own product and care.   I have tried some other neck treatments that can be irritating so I really appreciate this formula, and think it’s not a complete miracle worker for me in a month but it’s still a win!  Love it and I’ll keep using it for hopefully even better results! Soothing, not irritating, & love the peptides!
