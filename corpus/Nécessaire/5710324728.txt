This is my first neck specific serum. Packaging is fantastic and LOVE that it’s fragrance free.  Texture is a lightweight creamy serum that sinks into the skin nicely. Not greasy at all. I expected to like this serum but not to notice any significant changes. After using nightly for the last month (skipping some nights here and there) I just looked at my before/after pics and I see an absolute reduction in my tech neck lines! I’m a skincare fanatic and I do moisturize my neck regularly. Adding this serum into my nightly routine has been wonderful and after one month it’s exceeded my expectations. If you are someone who’s self conscious about your neck area this is worth checking out nan
