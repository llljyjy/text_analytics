It goes on thick and really coats the skin. I never tried this on my face since I breakout East and it seemed thick. I put it on my arms and you could see where you applied it but it did soak in. There is really no smell to it but it does cost your hands so it is something you will have to wash off your hands once you apply. I gave it four stars cause I didnâ€™t burn. Pretty good sunscreen
