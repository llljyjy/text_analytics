Finally found a mineral sun lotion that both blends easily on my skin and is a good barrier under my makeup. It does not have any scent and is unlike any other mineral suncream I have tried before. Itâ€™s not greasy at all. Mineral sunscreens are better for you and the environment too! Best mineral sun lotion I've found so far
