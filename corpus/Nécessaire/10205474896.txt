I was gifted this NécessaireThe Sunscreen - 100% Mineral, Broad Spectrum SPF 30 with 20% Non-Nano Zinc, Hyaluronic Acid and Niacinamide and I enjoyed using it. The formula is not to thick or liquid-y which I like. I like that it can act as a moisturizer too. Application is okay, I had to work on it a few times without rubbing it as per instructions since it can leave a slightly white cast. For some reason, it felt a little tacky when first applied but it went away after a few minutes. Since it’s not sweat or water-proof, I like using it when going to work and not when I am running an errand outside. A 100% mineral sunscreen worth trying
