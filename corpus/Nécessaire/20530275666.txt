I love this clean product, there’s no fragrance whatsoever, it blends into the skin beautifully, as long as you spend a little time to blend it into the skin, so it doesn’t leave any white marks, it’s great under the make up. I definitely prefer this sunscreen over any chemical based ones. I’d definitely recommend it to everyone, especially if you have a sensitive skin. Very nice
