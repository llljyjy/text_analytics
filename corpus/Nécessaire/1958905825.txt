I had high hopes for this sunscreen but unfortunately I donâ€™t like it very much. I found it extremely difficult and time consuming to rub into the skin, tried the gentle patting method and it took even longer. The texture is very thick and after 10 minutes of letting it absorb there was still a slight cast on my face. It will for sure leave a cast on darker skin tones. I do love the ingredients in it, especially the niacinamide and panthenol. Unfortunately the application process makes it a hassle to use as I like a sunscreen that will quickly absorb without the need for so much elbow grease. Not impressed
