I liked this sunscreen that formulated with niacin-amid and the spf is 100% mineral. When I applied this on my skin it left my skin with white cast but after 10 minutes it went away. My skin looks good soft and brighter after each use. Sunscreen is my favorite and I like this one as I can use this for my face and body. The packaging is very cute. Now I use it everyday. Good sunscreen
