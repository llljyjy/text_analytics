Sunscreen is one of the most essential products needed on a daily basis and I have been trying to be better about being consistent. I am still figuring out if I like chemical or mineral better. I like this new one because it has a pump, it’s not too thick and doesn’t have much of a scent. As with my lost miners sunscreens, it does require a bit of work to eliminate the white caste and work it into the skin. I will say it does leave the slightest bit of white cast BUT it’s not too noticeable. It also performs well under makeup! Overall, I think this is a wonderful option if your looking for a new sunscreen! I also really appreciate that it’s reef safe nan
