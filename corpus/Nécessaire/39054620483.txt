I’m so happy with this product! I have sensitive skin, and a hard time finding sunscreens that protect me and don’t hurt my skin so I was very happily surprised when I tried this! It rubs in well and stays on for a long time - it makes my skin feel moisturized without leaving it oily - and when I went swimming in the pool it didn’t run off into my eyes! nan
