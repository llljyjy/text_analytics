I really enjoy this mineral SPF. It’s lightweight, and absorbs quickly into the skin without feeling sticky. It leaves a nice finish on the skin. I also like that it contains niacinamide and hyaluronic acid. However, it’s not waterproof so you may need to reapply it. Overall, it’s a good product, and I would recommend it. Love it!
