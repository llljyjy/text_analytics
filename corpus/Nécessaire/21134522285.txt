I highly recommend Necessaire Mineral SPF 30! I use it on my face and neck everyday and it’s the perfect protection for me. It glides on your skin well and doesn’t leave a sticky residue. I like that it doesn’t have any scent to it the packaging is very pretty and the pump is convenient and easy to use. Also it’s very hydrating, it gives your skin a beautiful glow Very good sunscreen
