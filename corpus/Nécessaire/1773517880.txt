I have never used a neck serum before, but after staring at my self on zoom for way too long, I was ready for a change. Now in my mid-40s, I definitely needed some tightening and smoothing of the skin. This Neck Serum by NÃ©cessaire is light weight, goes on smooth and absorbs immediately without any sticky residue. I used as a part of my morning skin routine and felt well moisturized from the start and definitely can see improvement in my neck skin texture and firmness with consistent use. Feel tighter and smoother with consistent use!
