I have been so into SPF lately, it is the only product that we truly need for the health of our skin. Nécessaire is one of my favorite new brands so when I saw that they were coming out with a sunscreen for summer I knew I had to try it out! Firstly, I love the product’s packaging and color. It looks so chic displayed in my bathroom, and it matches the whole brand’s aesthetic. The product itself comes out in a pump which makes it hassle free and easy to dispense the perfect amount. When I apply it to my skin the formula feels smooth and absorbs nicely into skin. The hyaluronic acid and niacinamide are very moisturizing on the skin and do not break me out. Typically my acne-prone skin is VERY sensitive to sunscreens, and it can cause me to break out. However, this product did not break me out at all. The sunscreen itself is white, however I don’t notice any white cast on my skin. That being said, I do have light skin so it would be hard to tell if the product left a white cast.
