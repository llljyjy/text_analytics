Honestly I was skeptical of a neck serum to help my deep tech-neck and sun damage lines, but after 2 weeks I feel like I can see a difference already.  It goes on smooth, it feels lightweight and the bottle size seems like it will last for a decent amount of time.  Iâ€™m looking forward to seeing more results over the next few weeks. impressed
