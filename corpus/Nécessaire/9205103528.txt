Iâ€™m overall not super impressed with this. It took a lot of time to rub in/remove white cast, and I have fair skin. It stung my skin and felt heavy on my skin under makeup. I have dry/combo skin and I would recommend this for colder months and not warm weather at all. It felt like a body sunscreen for my face, which is not what I was interested in about this. nan
