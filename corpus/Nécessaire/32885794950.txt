I love a good multipurpose product, sunscreen for your face and body, 2 in 1 instead of me having to leave home with 1 for my face & 1 for my body..already a win for me. I love thoroughly enjoyed using this spf, I especially enjoy that it has Niacinamide to help strengthen my skins protective barrier so I can even use it as a moisturizer in my daily skincare and bodycare routine; love that itâ€™s super lightweight and not sticky or leaving a white cast; it left my skin feeling hydrated and protected. 100% recommend. 100% recommend
