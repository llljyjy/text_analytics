I’m still on the search for my perfect spf.. I wanted to love this but just couldn’t. It’s VERY thick so “patting it in“ to avoid pilling is challenging. I smoothed it out as best as I could and then started patting it in. I didn’t notice pilling until AFTER it completely dried. I’m not sure if it reacted with my serums? but I had to flick away tons of white tiny specks that pilled all over my face. Will be returning Pills like crazy
