This is a mineral SPF 30 sunscreen. I took a risk to try the sunscreen because I had recently found a physical sunscreen that worked perfectly on my dark skin tone. So, I had not given up on mineral sunscreen completely. This sunscreen unfortunately is not for me. First of all, the instructions to apply half a pump for my face is not right because that is not enough sunscreen for protection. But even at half a pump, the sunscreen feels heavy and leaves a noticeable white cast on my skin tone. My skin tone is honey. This is not a comfortable formula to wear; I would have been fine to apply make up over this if I at least Felt comfortable wearing this sunscreen. I am sorry but this is a big pass for me. I would not encourage anyone with a darker skin tone than me to bother trying it. Heavy, not great for darker skin tones
