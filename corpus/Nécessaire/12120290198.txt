I’ve been reaching for this sunblock a few days each week on both my face and arms since purchasing it about a week ago and so far, so good - this is a sunblock I like and would consider repurchasing. This is my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador. It’s a-richer-though-still-easily-spreadable-SPF - the consistency is somewhere between a lotion and a cream.  I do get a very light white cast initially upon application, but I think that’s to be expected from an 100% mineral sunblock like this one - good news is that the white cast isn’t as prominent as most and it fades away pretty quickly and fully as the sunblock is massaged and absorbed into the skin. I don’t pick up any scent to this product, not even a sunblock scent, which is a plus. Also a nice touch is the light glow the product leaves on my skin - not glittery or shimmery, just a lovely, soft sheen. This is one I’d consider using as an everyday SPF for my body. I’d like to see how this performs on my face in the winter months. It was fine when I used it this past week but I think given the consistency of it, it might be something that would work better on my face in the cooler months when it leans more dry to very dry throughout. I’ll plan to give this SPF a try then if I haven’t already used up this bottle on my arms, neck, legs, etc. nan
