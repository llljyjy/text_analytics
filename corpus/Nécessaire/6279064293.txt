I love that this SPF has Niacinamide and hyaluronic acid. Great for brightening and hydration. I love the beautiful satin finish this spf gives when absorbed. A small amount goes a very long wayâ€¦ one pump covered my entire face. It felt slightly sticky until it completely dried down. Left behind no white cast and no pilling. Paired fine with makeup and other skincare. Good! Takes a bit to absorb
