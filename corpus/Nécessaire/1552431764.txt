This is a really lovely neck cream from Necessaire. The texture is very lightweight and easy to rub in. I love that it is fragrance free as well. After the first application I did get a pimple on my neck but that only happened the first time. I have found that my neck does look more hydrated and the necklace lines are maybe slightly less deep. Overall it a really nice product and the price seems fair if I continue to see improvements. Nice serum
