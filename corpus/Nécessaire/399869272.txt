Such a lightweight spf that feels like a lotion moisturizer and zero fragrance. This texture applies smoothly and no tacky feel. I like that it is formulated clean and has Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin E, and Niacinamide. It does have a white cast but it fades away once product has settled into skin. perfect lotion formula & fragrance free
