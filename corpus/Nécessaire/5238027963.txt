Overall enjoying this sunscreen. It has a creamy texture that blends into the skin with minimal effort. It feels hydrating but not oily. There is no noticeable scent and feels comfortable on the face and body. There is a slight initial white cast but fades away and doesnâ€™t make me look gray. Definitely follow the directions for the amount of pumps, 1/2 for face was enough for me. A couple for the upper Since my bottom is covered. Nice sunscreen! Superior than other zinc sunscreen
