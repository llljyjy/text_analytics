I’m writing this review now because I have moved on from this product. Trying to learn what feels good, what works and what’s good for your skin, is tricky. It’s a learning journey but I’ve used this for a couple years now. At first my skin was on the dryer end and this help moisturize it, a lot. It’s thick and really heavy and oily. I don’t like that but after the years it’s transformed my skin to now, not oily, but hydrated, even when I’m not wearing it. Like I said, I can move on now, it’s done it’s job but it’s just too heavy to continue to use now. nan
