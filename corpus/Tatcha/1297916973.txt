This is a great sunscreen that applies easily and blends into the skin beautiful without leaving a white cast or oily residue on the skin.  It looks great on it’s own since it is slightly tinted so it leaves your skin looking more even and healthy after applying.  It also serves as a great makeup primer under foundation.  So far I’ve used it on it’s own and under both liquid and cream foundations. I had no issues with it pilling like some of the other reviews are claiming. My guess is that this conflicts with certain skincare products. Now onto the annoying part of this sunscreen - the packaging. For $60, I expect the packaging to be flawless. Unfortunately, like most Tatcha products, the packaging is just pretty to look at but not the most functional. I thought the bottle was so cute and easy to carry around when I first bought it. But after leaving it out on my bathroom counter, I realized that 1. The depth/width of the bottle is too thin for it to stand up on it’s own and gets easily knocked over or just falls over by itself. 2. The surface starts chipping and the products starts looking old quickly due to the color just chipping off.  I am really expecting Tatcha to look into this and upgrade the packaging ASAP. Great sunscreen, AWFUL packaging
