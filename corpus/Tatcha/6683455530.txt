I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. My goal is to improve my texture and tone. I wanted to see how well this product worked by itself so this was the only thing I changed about my routine, I didn’t use any other tatcha products with it. After just one week I started to see results. My skin was more vibrant and my pores less visible. The product itself is light and doesn’t have a strong smell. I have sensitive skin and it didn’t irritate my face at all. The photos show my skin before I started using it and after 3 weeks. I’m in love and want to try other Tatcha products! Skincare Must Have!
