Had some discoloration and hyperpigmentation on jawline (mainly from years of not wearing sunscreen when I was younger) and this has been the only product Iâ€™ve found which helped to significantly even skin tone and get rid of the discoloration. Have used many exfoliating products and serums but none have helped even skin tone and discoloration as effectively as this serum. Price is steep but it is worth it, in my opinion. Will definitely repurchase. Effective in evening skin tone
