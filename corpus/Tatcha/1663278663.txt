The actual properties of this product are great but I cannot get on board with the application. The nozzle and atomizer on this is terrible, so uneven and wasteful. I have succumbed to spraying this in my palm and applying it like an essence, otherwise itâ€™s far too wasteful.The ingredients and hydrating properties are beautiful but I would never risk applying this on top of makeup because the spray is so terribly uneven I believe it would only mess your face up! Foul nozzle
