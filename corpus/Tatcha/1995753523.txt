I wouldnâ€™t waste your money on this. I LOVE Tatcha but this serves no purpose. It pulls on the skin, and leaves minimal product behind. I 100% recommend the Tatcha eye firming serum, you will not regret getting that, but this product is like a drug store, nothing. Not worth it at all, low quality.
