I really enjoyed using this clay mask! I noticed my pores getting smaller even after the first use. My skin felt sooo much more smooth and I can’t wait to see long term results.The application process was pretty easy, little spoon is included in the package, after applying on the skin you can feel that the mask is warming it up, you only need to leave it on for 3-5 mins and then rinse. Saves time and gives the same effect as leaving some other mask for 20 mins (I don’t usually have that much time and this is really important to me).I must say that this product is pricey, but it works + a little goes a long way, so I might repurchase it after ( I’m sure it will last me moooonths tho!)This product was gifted to me by Tatcha. nan
