I love this exfoliating cleanser. Most exfoliating products you can’t use too much because it will dry or break out your face. This cleanser you can use everyday. Not one time has it irritated my skin. The beads in this cleanser aren’t rough and big. They are finely milled so it goes over your skin smooth. I really like this cleanser and the price isn’t too expensive. I recommend if you are a skincare junkies like myself! Great stuff
