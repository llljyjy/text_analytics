I really wanted to love this product. The sunscreen itself is well formulated and feels great in my skin. There is no “sunscreen” smell and it doesn’t leave a white cast. It also sits well under my primer and makeup. I just can’t deal with the packaging. Like many other reviewers have noted the packaging looks sleek and pretty but it is not functional at all. As soon as you start removing the cap, product spews out everywhere making a mess. Then the coloring of the bottle starts to peel off and mixes into the sunscreen. I was picking small purple flakes from my face all day.If this was in a pump (or any sort of actually usable packaging), I’d put it on auto-replenish. But the packaging is a big miss by Tatcha and not worth the frustration. good product, horrible packaging
