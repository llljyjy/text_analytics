I received a mini size for my birthday from Sephora, so naturally I was so excited to try out Tatcha! The cream itself is a wonderful velvety consistency- BUT it was not all that. I have tried out several different creams as I work in the skincare industry and other than the consistency, I didn’t see all the hype. I HAD to apply this product twice, & I don’t really see how this is for dry skin as it wasn’t all that moisturizing. I have normal skin with combo T Zone & my T zone was drier than usual.. I also have sensitive skin and I had NO problems using this cream. I would give it a try if your on the fence but wouldn’t add to my routine. It's just alright
