I have stress-picked my skin my whole life. Luckily it heals quickly and I don’t have much scarring, but in between my skin tends to get quite dry and painful. When I use this cream consistently my skin heals at least twice as fast and it doesn’t hurt as much. I 100% recommend this product. Worth a try if you haven’t found your holy grail
