This is the second time I have purchased this product because my favourite oil control moisturizer was discontinued from Ole Henriksen. I thought I would give it another try. I am very disappointed because this does nothing for my skin. It makes it very oily and pores are not tightened at all. For this price, I expected more. I also have tried the powder and primer from this brand and they were both not great. With the high reviews and high prices, I was expecting better quality. nan
