Can’t really rate the product since so much of it exploded on my bathroom counter as soon as I opened the top of the bottle.  It’s very expensive so its a inexcusable shame since I’m usually a huge Tatcha fan.  I’ve tried several times to hold the bottle differently or not hold it at all when opening but it’s simply futile.  Poor packing/ design flaw somehow causes air pressure to build and, when you remove the cap, the sunscreen erupts like Vesuvius.  The endless flow off the sides can only be stopped by putting the cap back on.  This actually deters one from using the product having to clean up such messes each time. A Total Design Fail
