this face mask is seriously the best. It has a grainy , cooling texture that warms up when applied to your skin, and also changes colors when you wash it off. There is a fragrance that truly is amazing, it reminded me of the spa,  which made putting on the mask feel luxurious. Tatcha is always 10/10 with their packaging and it does not feel cheap at all. The mask comes with a gold spatula which is super convenient. This one was gifted to me by Tatcha , but I will definitely buy it again once i run out. the BEST clay mask ive ever used
