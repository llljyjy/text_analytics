I’m going to be honest. I wanted to hate this product so I could justify not spending the money on its price tag however I ended up LOVING this cleanser! Wow, first off, it feels amazing on the face and your face feels amazing once you wash it off. To me it smells like a margarita, not strong but just subtle, maybe it’s the salt? Not sure but I’m a big fan! Can’t recommend this enough! nan
