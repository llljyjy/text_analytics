Gave my a swollen, painful stye right near my tear duct. Upon further investigation, this product has a lot of pore-clogging ingredients. If you are prone to styes, steer clear and avoid the pain! Also wasnâ€™t thrilled about the fragrance; why does it need to be scented? Our eyes are the most delicate part of our face and require ingredients in makeup/skincare that work for sensitive areas. nan
