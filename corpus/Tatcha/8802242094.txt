I put this on after washing my face around 11 am and by the time it was 4 pm I have to wipe it off because it turned SO greasy. It does feel like whenever you put it on at first but gets so gross after a few hours. I have combo skin but even my forehead which is super dry was slick with greasy. I was definitely worried it would clog my pores. mmmm, no.
