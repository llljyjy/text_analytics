This is the only serum I’ve ever used during the day that truly makes a difference. I have really sensitive skin but I can use this everyday and i actually see my skin brighter, smoother, less redness and over all improvement. I used the whole bottle before writing a review but honestly 2 weeks in I saw noticeable results. I’m scared to switch to any other vitamin c serum now! Brighter and smoother skin
