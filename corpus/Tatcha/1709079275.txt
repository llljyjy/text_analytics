I am someone with very sensitized skin & I avoid fragrance & alcohol ingredients at all costs & use products with not too many ingredients or powerful chemicals. I needed something to exfoliate my face only every once in a while. I used this one time- it did exactly what I needed & I really enjoyed the experience, but my face was SO stripped immediately after I used it :( Sadly, I had to return. If my face wasnâ€™t so stripped afterwards, this would of been my new go to exfoliator. nan
