I love this sunscreen so much. The packaging is gorgeous. I love the bottle shape. It makes it easy to throw in your bag/travel! The formula on this sunscreen is absolutely amazing. It has a slight tint to it when applied but blends into your skin perfectly. Once dry, my skin feels very silky and soft. I canâ€™t wait to use this during the summer and at the beach. It also works perfectly under makeup as well! 10/10 product! This was gifted by Tatcha. Amazing luxury sunscreen
