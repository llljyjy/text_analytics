I bought the travel size because I wasn’t set on spending $60 for a primer but I will say it’s worth the money and I’ll definitely buy the full-size! It makes my skin so dewy and soothed and blurs my pores beautifully! It’s not oily at all and always makes my makeup look like my own skin! will buy the full-size!
