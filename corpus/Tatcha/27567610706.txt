I recieved this as a sample size in my birthday gift. I was very excited for it as Iâ€™ve used other Tatcha products and they work well but this one really missed the mark. It is very oily, greasy, and thick. I have dry skin, so I thought this product would work well for me, but it never absorbs in to the skin. I wore it for well over 2 hours after I applied it and it still felt oily and wet on my face, my hair was sticking to it, and it was clumping up so everytime I touched my face there would be little clumps of cream coming off. Greasy.
