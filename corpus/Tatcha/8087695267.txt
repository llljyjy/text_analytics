Switched from the Water cream and I’m not looking back. I have very oily acne pitted skin, and the Water cream made my skin texture look rougher. I realized I needed more mousture so switched to this. Been using for a week and no breakouts or whiteheads, and it feels more hydrating than the Water Cream. It’s rich, but doesn’t feel like it’s sitting on uour skin or suffocating your pores. My new staple. nan
