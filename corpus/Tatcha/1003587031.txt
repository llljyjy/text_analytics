I did receive this as my bday sample-just hit the big 4-0!! I’ve always taken care of my skin with Josie’s argan line, and I still will use the stuff because it is affordable and I see great results-but this stuff was mind blowing! After one application, I was in love. The scent is subtle and clean, the feeling is soft and luxurious. A very little goes a long way-it especially helps if your fingers are damp while applying the cream. I can’t say enough good things about this cream. nan
