As a 19 year old male who shaves with a blade multiple times a week my skin can get very irritated if I don’t use the right products. This face wash doubles as a physical exfoliant but also as a great cleansing product. It keeps my pores clean especially when I use it after a warm shower. I would recommended rubbing the product through your fingertips with a small splash of warm water before applying onto the face. This ensures the product is broken up and softened and it feels much smoother on the skin and is much more gentle. I get paranoid about granular ingredients in face washes because I don’t want to strip my skin, this product is high quality and does not strip my skin at all. It is moisturizing and the scent is subtle but quite nice. I use Tatcha almost exclusively in my skincare routine now. I follow this wash with The Essence, Violet C Serum, and Silk Cream moisturizer and my skin looks perfect and feels amazing. Would recommend this to anybody interested in exploring luxury skincare as Tatcha does blow me away with their clean ingredients and brisk results. Male with Combo to Dry Skin
