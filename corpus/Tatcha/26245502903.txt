After using this for a few months, I notice no difference in the moisture or feel of my dry lips. Aquaphor, Vaseline, or Glossier’s Balm Dot Com work way better. Also I don’t know why a mask has to have color! If anything my lips feel MORE dry after use. It’s pretty as lipstick/gloss, but not a mask and not helpful for dry lips. Does Not Work
