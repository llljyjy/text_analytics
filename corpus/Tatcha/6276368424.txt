Best moisturizer. Keeps me hydrated. Works great under makeup, and doesn’t clog pores. For me it works. Again skincare and makeup is different for everyone. I also was trying hard for a long time to not but this since it’s expensive but it’s worth every penny for me. The way my skin glows and feels is worth it for me. What can I say it’s just perfection.
