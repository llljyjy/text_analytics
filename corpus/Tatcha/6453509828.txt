I can see this definitely not working for oily skin…. BUT if you have dry flakey skin, this stuff is magic. It leaves a sheen too which makes your skin look amazing. The only other product that has been able to combat my dry skin (I live in Alberta) is Belif moisturizing bomb. It doesn’t absorb too quickly so your skin stays soft and moisturized for a while but you can definitely put makeup on over top pretty quickly. Amazing for dry skin
