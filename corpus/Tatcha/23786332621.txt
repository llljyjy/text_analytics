Such a great primer and sunscreen duo. It has such an amazing texture and goes on so smooth. It doesn’t leave a cast on my skin, feel too thick or dry out my skin like other mineral sunscreens. I wasn’t a fan of Tatcha’s other sunscreen, but this one is perfect for me. Works super well with all my other products including my makeup too. It doesn’t seem to breakout my skin either. I’m currently 6 months pregnant and during my pregnancy have had a hard time finding products that agree with my skin but this one does. Definitely will be purchasing again! lovely; will be purchasing again!
