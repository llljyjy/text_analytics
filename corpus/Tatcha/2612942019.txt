Great product,  TERRIBLE package! Unless you want pieces of the paint of the bottle on your face or have enough time to peel them off.The product itself is great; lightweight, Great SPF 50 and doesn’t leave a white cast on my face, my skin is naturally tan and finding mineral sunscreens can be hard. I won’t be repurchasing this product until the bottle, package, container changes because it was very frustrating to have pieces of it on my face, especially with that price tag. terrible bottle/container, peels off
