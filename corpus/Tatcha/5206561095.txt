Truly love this face wash. I already purchased several times. It needs very little product for a good face wash, so it lasts for a few months even when using it twice a day. It does not dry the skin, but cleanse face very well. I purchased two last time, one for myself and one for mom. And even though mom wasnâ€™t too keen to try it out, she is in love with it as well. However, have to agree with few other people, packaging could be stronger. The lid breaks off easily. nan
