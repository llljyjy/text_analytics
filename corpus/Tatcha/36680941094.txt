I got this product as a sample and I have now purchased two full size products. It has been a game changer for my skin routine and despite the price, I don’t think I can go back. I really love the texture and it has cleared up my acne. I do recommend trying the mini/sample size first and do a patch test as like most moisturizers, it doesn’t work with every skin type. I will continue purchasing this Tatcha moisturizer as I love it so much! Game changer!
