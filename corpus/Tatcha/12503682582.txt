I bought this 9 months ago and I still have so much left!! You only use the tiniest bit and it works great. I have a slight problem with the physical abrasion of the rice grains just because I don’t think physical exfoliating is as good for your skin as chemical is, but this works great for me personally. Well. Well. Worth your money. Don’t rely on this to remove your makeup though. lasts forever.
