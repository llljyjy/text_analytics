At first I loved this cleanser. it has a somewhat gritty texture so it lightly exfoliates without stripping your skin. But after about a week of using it along with the Tatcha Dewy Skin Hydrating and Plumping Moisturizer, I broke out with terrible acne all over my chin and forehead - I normally have very clear skin and, aside from a random pimple or two every once in a while, I never break out like this. I will never use anything from Tatcha again after the experience I had with this product. Caused Terrible Breakout
