I was very surprised with this product!! I only bought it during the sephora sale, but it is totally worth your money. I have oily skin and it is a bit on the heavy side but it doesnâ€™t stay heavy and greasy. I usually use it at night when I go to bed. I wake up and my skin feels super smooth and hydrated. nan
