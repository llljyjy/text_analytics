I absolutely loooove this moisturizer. I am all about the dewy skin look.  This is a great moisturizer for people over 40.. I’m 50 and I won’t touch another moisturizer.  However,  I just recently started using Chanel’s Sublimage La Lotion Supreme,  then apply  Tatcha’s moisturizer and my skin is plump, bouncy and dewy.  I’m in heaven. tatcha dewy
