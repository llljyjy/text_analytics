What is that strong scent? Green tea, algae, and purple rice apparently. I chose the trial size for my birthday gift because I like that it’s a clean product but I don’t like the smell. Smells medicinal in a bad way. I would rather smell Vicks vapor rub. Does it moisturize? For a few hours and then my perpetually dry forehead since last year (I’m 33) became dry again. This dewy look is also on the verge of looking greasy on me. I wouldn’t buy again either because of the price. Meh
