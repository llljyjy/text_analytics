This is the only Sephora sample I’ve received that has made me certain I would never buy it! It broke my skin out twice. I tried it the first time & it broke me out but I thought or hoped it was a fluke but after the second try I knew it was the Tatcha. It also piles on your face & doesn’t smell the greatest in my  opinion. I threw it away & definitely don’t recommend. Breakouts & Piling
