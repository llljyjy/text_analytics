I have trouble consistently using sunscreen before putting on makeup because it changes the way my foundation sits. This one is unlike anything I’ve ever tried. It’s so silky soft and feels like a primer more than a sunscreen. The only reason I took off a star is because it’s very small for the amount of money it costs. I feel like 40-45$ would be more appropriate. But, I still will be purchasing because it feels so good on my skin and makeup goes on like a dream. Absolutely LOVE
