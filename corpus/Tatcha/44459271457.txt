I really thought this would be a mid priced cream. I also purchased the night cream.  Subdermal bumps at the jawline (obviously a trend among a LOT of reviews here)  plus small blemishes all over my face after a week of use. Again, I have nice skin, no breakouts. Now I am taking it back to find something to clear up my skin. I’m sure it works for some, but don’t make an investment- get a sample and try it out. I started out with the lip mask- that works great, but the creams-- never again. Breakout City
