This is the only product I have ever received a sample of, then went back to get the full size! I cannot say enough great things about this moisturizer/game changer. The way it glides on my skin, the subtlety clean scent, the natural glow and overall even tone it gives me are equally amazing. The number of people who have asked me what makeup I’m wearing is crazy! They are all shocked when I tell them I’m only wearing moisturizer. I’m considering trying the whole line of the facial care system but it’s pretty pricey. I’m curious ,if my skin looks this good with just the moisturizer, what could it be if I incorporate the whole line on my skincare routine?? Look no further!!
