Hands down THE best cleanser I’ve ever used. Was looking for something that would make my skin feel clean and soft without stripping it and making me feel dry—mind you, I also have oily skin. Been using this for a while now and I’ve seen MAJOR differences to my skin texture and appearance. My skin looks more radiant, supple, and gently exfoliated without losing its firmness or moisture. Never going back to any other product, this is my go to. LOVE
