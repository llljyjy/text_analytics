This ended up being a pleasant surprise! I was using very strong cleanser loaded up with “acids and vitamins”. Finally I decided to double cleanse with milder ingredient. Honestly, I only realized how amazing my skin was looking with cleansing oil until I ran out!!! My pores are now out of control and my make up applies terribly!! Definitely repurchasing over and over again! Calmed redness down and helped with cleaning out whiteheads. I pair it up glossier milk cleanser. Great for double cleeansing
