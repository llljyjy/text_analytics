I was using Herbivore Pink Cloud my daily morning serum under my moisturizer and spf.  My husband purchased this with the Tatcha overnight cream which I use nightly and love.  I was not impressed with this serum.  I never saw fine lines when using my previous serum.  I feel a little dehydrated with this and not very plump.  I also don’t like the perfume smell.  I don’t like putting any fragrance on my face even if it dissipates. I give it two stars for sinking in very quickly.  But my skin hasn’t looked this dry and dehydrated in a long time. Not as good as my previous serum
