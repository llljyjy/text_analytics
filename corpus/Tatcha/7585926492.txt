This will forever be a staple for me. I may not use it consistently but I always find myself going back to it, specifically when I need to regulate my routine. In the winter my skin gets painfully dry due to eczema, this is a life saver during those colder months. Non irritating and good for sensitive skin. Leaves skin feeling clean but never stripped. Soft and supple, goowing skin. Forever a staple
