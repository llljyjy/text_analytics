Definitely only need a little bit of product and a lot of water and massaging between hands to lather up into a foam . Doesn’t have a strong scent and doesn’t strip your skin. I would use this first to remove makeup and sunscreen and then another cleanser to wash skin . If you’re looking for a basic gentle everyday cleanser then this is perfect . I don’t know if it’s worth 36$ in my opinion. Maybe 16$ to 20$. I received this as a birthday gift and chose because I love the tatcha purple moisturizer. I guess you only need a little bit because it’s concentrated and you could make it last six months nan
