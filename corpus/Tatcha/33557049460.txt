Admittedly, I didn’t buy Tatcha for a long time because “influencers“ on TikTok who “know skincare“ said not to. I get that it isn’t medical-grade skincare, but WOW, I AM IMPRESSED. I think the packaging is ugly and sometimes purchase based on that (don’t we all, sometimes?) but I’m so glad I took the plunge. I started using this right after spraying Dermalogica’s hyaluronic ceramide mist and oh my GOD my skin looks amazing, my pores are shrinking, and I’m plump all day. I liked this a lot by itself, but paired with the Dermalogica product — shut the front door. My only complaint is the violet coloring. I’d rather skip coloring... but I’ll keep using it because I love it so much. I also like the smell. PROVED WRONG!
