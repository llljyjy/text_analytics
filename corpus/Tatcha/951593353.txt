Love this product! Goes on like silk with zero white cast and feels like nothing. I have to take off a star because the packaging is horrible. It spills out as soon as you take off the cap but worst of all, the coating of the package chips off in my hands so I have to pick it off my face when it mixes with the sunscreen. Hopefully Tatcha changes that by the time I run out of this because I want to repurchase. Amazing formula but awful packaging.
