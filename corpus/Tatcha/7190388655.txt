I absolutely love this product but the label on the bottle flakes off every single and brings the score from a 5 to a 3. I’ve gone through 3-4 bottles because this product is so great but I always end up w tiny purple flakes on my hands and then face. The product itself does not have a sunscreen smell or feel. Works great under makeup and even gives a slight dewy glow if you don’t have make up. It never clogs my pores or irritates my skin. I use this every single day and it really helps. Love but label always flakes off onto your hands
