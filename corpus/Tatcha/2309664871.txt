This is the only moisturizer I’ve tried that hydrates all the layers of my skin. I’ve tried ones like the Neutrogena Hydroboost and the Drunk Elephant polypeptides one and found that skin surface to be soft but my skin still felt tight. This gives the best, long-lasting hydration. Gives my skin a healthy glow that LASTS. Doesn’t break me out either, which is rare. Totally worth the price! GAME CHANGER FOR DRY/SENSITIVE SKIN
