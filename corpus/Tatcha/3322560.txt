I was surprised that this didn’t get a universal 5 stars in the ratings because this is hands down my favorite moisturizer. But when I looked into it, the complaints were from women who had acne issues. This is NOT a good moisturizer for acne prone skin.  However, it is AMAZING FOR DRY SKIN.  I have always been complimented for my beautiful skin, but that’s because I have always taken care of it. For years I used Chanel and LaMer products. At about age 45, I started using Clarins Double Serum (which I *still* swear by).  After trying a sample of Tatcha’s The Dewy Skin Cream, I realized that it worked just as well, but cost a fraction of what Chanel’s Le Lift or La Mer’s Creme de la Mer. I switched and haven’t looked back. I’m nearly 60 and I still have people compliment me on my beautiful skin and who are shocked when they hear my age. I have a simple routine: removing my eye makeup with Lancome’s Bi-facil, rinsing my face with water and a washcloth (and occasionally using micellar water), drying it and adding a small dollop of Clarin’s Double Serum, and in winter, following with this Tatcha moisturizer. My skin is reactive, tending to Rosaceae. I am very pale (Irish descent) and burn easily (followed by freckles). I also tend to have dry skin. Deliciously hydrating
