Love this sunscreen, combine it with Tatcha Liquid Silk Primer & the combo gives me a great finish without foundation (I have fair skin). But unless you need to slip sunscreen into the pocket of skin tight jeans, you won’t see any purpose for this packaging. Seriously Tatcha, what were you thinking? Please re- package, then I’d love to re-purchase!! SUNSCREEN A DREAM- PACKAGING A NIGHTMARE
