I got it in my birthday gift, and oh my god.. my skin has NEVER been so clear, plump and glowy in all my life. I have PCOS and get awful bumps from the hair removal and since using this, I don’t get any irritation anymore! I have extremely sensitive skin and This doesn’t seem to bother me at all. It does have a light lavender scent, but I don’t mind it for the results I get. I ended up purchasing the largest jar. nan
