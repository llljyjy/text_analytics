I know we all have different skin, so reviews should always be taken with a grain of salt. That being said, this is my favorite moisturizer of all time. I can see a noticeable difference in my skin, it makes you look hydrated and brighter (maybe that’s when used with the other skincare products I use!). If it helps, I have pretty “normal” skin (not dry or oily) and use this with a face oil (Sunday Riley) and vitamin C serum (Olehenriksen) daily. I know everyone says not to splurge on moisturizer but I really really love this and make sure I never run out of it. nan
