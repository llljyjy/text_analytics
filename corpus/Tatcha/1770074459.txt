So the formula is really good but the packaging is so weird. It’s like flaking everywhere? The little specks from the bottle get on my face and hard to remove. It’s honestly a huge pain and drawback. This is an expensive product and while the product is good, the price is too high for the packaging to be SO poor. Fix it tatcha. Good, bad packaging
