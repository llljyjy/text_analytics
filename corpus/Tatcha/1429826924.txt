Because I have oily skin and use retinol I was specifically on the search for a high spf 50, with niacinamide, water resistant, and preferably a mineral sunscreen. It was great to find all of requirements in one product. I did not want to like this due to the price but I absolutely cannot deny the Tatcha Silk Sunscreen feels ultra smooth, is skin softening as well as actually smooths my skin in preparation for my foundation. It looks marvelous and I enjoyed it on bare skin as well without getting oily all day. I am medium dark and it blends wonderfully with my complexion. If you do not want to spend $60 dollars on a sunscreen do not tempt yourself with this one because once youâ€™ve tried it, it is so beautiful you will not be willing to go back.
