Ridiculous product despite all the great reviews and youtubers recommending it! I’ve been using all kinds of sunscreen at different price points and this is the first time seeing such a terrible product. I just opened it and it exploded everywhere. Tried to stop the flow but it kept coming out as long as the lid was open. it has been in a room with AC and no one ever touched it. Also, the paint on the side of the bottle peeled and now it’s all over my hands and face. Still cleaning up my sink and my face. DON’T BUY!!! DON'T BUY! the bottle peels and it explodes!
