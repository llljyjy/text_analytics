I’ve got to be missing something. This does next to nothing for me, and certainly isn’t the best exfoliator out there. I agree with others that the packaging is awkward. The hole is too big for a normal amount of powder to come out ... regardless of how careful you are. I’ll use this up but I will not be repurchasing. nan
