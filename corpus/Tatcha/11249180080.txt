I have always been a fan of the Tatcha brand, and this is one of my favourite products. I have fairly sensitive skin, in the sense where it goes very red and splotchy when anything new is introduced. However, this exfoliant is so gentle that I can physically exfoliate my face without stripping it of moisture. It leaves such a nice glow, and you can tell the difference in skin tone & pores. Only reason I would not give a five star is because I feel like the applicator wastes product when trying to apply! GLOW, GLOW, GLOW
