Honestly it gives my skin a nice feel. But I don’t see any dewyness or resurfacing. It’s a decent serum but don’t expect it to show any visible change. Like the slight fragrance of the product. I was using the Estée Lauder serum before this one and that made my skin feel more supple and enriched than this one. Really wanted to love this one. Packaging is good, and only requires 1-2 pumps to cover the whole face. nan
