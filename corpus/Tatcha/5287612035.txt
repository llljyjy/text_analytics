I have used this every AM (sometimes PM too) since June 2020 and cannot justify buying it anymore. It is definitely moisturizing but has done nothing to prevent wrinkles and crowâ€™s feet under and around my eyes. I use many other Tatcha products and love them, but this is a waste of money. Such a shame considering this brand is usually top-notch. Good moisturizer but bad for anti-aging
