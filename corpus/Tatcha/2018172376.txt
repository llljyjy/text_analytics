I purchased this mask a little bit ago, when it was early access, and I am glad I did. It does exactly what it says it does! Immediate results after one use for me. I normally dislike all products that warm on my face, I do not like the sensation at all, but this one doesn’t bother me. The warmth on your face is very faint, thankfully. A little does go a long way, so I personally do not believe it’s overpriced since it works beautifully. You definitely get what you pay for and with this you get quality. For a product that has Japanese Konjac, it works on sensitive skin WAY better than everything else I have tried. On my weekly mask day I put this mask on for 5 minutes, take a shower and wash it off before using the Tatcha calming rice polish, then use the Vitamin C mask when I get out before my serums/creams…my face LOVES IT! I have sensitive fair skin, btw. Another Tatcha must have.
