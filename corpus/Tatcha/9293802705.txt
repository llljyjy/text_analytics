I’m loving this moisturizer. It works beautifully under foundation and performs like a primer. It’s expensive but worth it. You really need so little and I found that if you use too much sometimes it pills under foundation. I can use it around my eyes without any burning. I do find that my fine lines are plumped and it does give a small dewy look, but not shiny at all. I apply it after my serum and then try to wait about 5 minutes before foundation for best results. Love it!
