I really researched this a lot and watched a ton of videos before buying this but I can say this powder is the bomb.com. I use it every other night and this makes my skin feel so good afterwards and so clean, but not clean to the point it’s dry. This enzyme powder cleans out my pores very well too. In fact, I was shocked at how clean and small my pores appeared. It’s amazing :) this is the exfoliant you need.
