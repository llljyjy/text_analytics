This sunscreen is basically my white whale - it’s lightweight but actually works, has a subtle tint that doesn’t make me look orange, and blurs imperfections just enough to wear on its own. For a typical “low makeup” day I pair this with under-eye corrector and a tinted lip balm and that’s it. I haven’t had the same issues with packaging that other reviewers have experienced, and I’m about halfway through the bottle. My only complaint is the price - $60 is pretty wild for a daily sunscreen but this product is so good I’m willing to overlook it as long as my budget allows. nan
