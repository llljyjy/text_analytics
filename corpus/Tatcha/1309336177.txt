A little of this mask goes a long way.  It’s a great exfoliator that leaves my skin feeling refreshed and buttery smooth. It’s very gentle on the skin and has a nice cooling and calming effect.  It controls my oil production which is great since I am prone to acne breakouts.  It did not irritate the love that it is lightly scented and smells great while the mask is on.  Complimentary from Tatcha. Hydrating Mask
