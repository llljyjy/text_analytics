I am absolutely blown away by the formulation and texture of this sunscreen. I went in with low expectations since it as only zinc oxide so I thought it would have terrible white cast. I was so wrong - it has a wonderful milky consistency and blended right into my skin. The finish is velvety, silky, and hydrating! This just might be my new fave sunscreen but I do wish the price were more affordable. nan
