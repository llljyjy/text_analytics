my first thought was such a small amount for the price.  first use, i thought, wow this feels really nice.  second use, it oozed all over the bottle, my hands and the table.  maybe i shook too much?  let’s be careful next time. third use, i held the bottle upside down and ever-so-gently squeezed out to apply to my face.  when i stopped squeezing, it kept dripping out like mad.  the bottle was sitting upright on the table and i was not touching it and it oozed out 3 or 4 applications worth.  what a waste.  then i noticed the sunscreen had made the lilac labeling flake off the bottle and stick to my hands and face.  sigh. so now i’m picking lilac flakes off of my face. save your money and buy something like missha or canmake. nice but messy, wasteful packaging
