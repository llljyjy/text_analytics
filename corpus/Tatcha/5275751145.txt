I first got this mask in mini size but fell in love enough to buy the full size over and over. Despite my skin concern I want to address, this mask is always my go-to.  Besides the gorgeous packaging and wand to apply it, it never dries me out or makes my skin oily. Even if I have acne it doesn’t aggravate my sensitive skin and always leaves me glowing. Best results come from using it at least 1-2x a week and it’s well worth the price even on a budget since it lasts forever and gives amazing results. forever my favourite
