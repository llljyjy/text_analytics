I’ve been using this product for a long time that I actually re-bought it! Due to its oily nature, it is able to pick up any makeup I’m wearing at day or any dirt and give a good canvas for the rest of my skincare. Only downside is how much of it I have to use for my face. I would give it 4.5 stars due to that, but it works so well for my skin that that I wouldn’t want to change. Excellent Oil Cleanser
