I’ve been having breakouts on my cheeks, forehead, & neck for about 2 years now, along with sweat bumps across my forehead & this was the first non-drug store product I splurged on.I had tried lots of other more high end products through samples & family, 2 of which were Tatcha. I loved how they made my skin feel directly after use, but was reluctant to buy any myself because I didn’t know if they would have and long term results & the prices hurt my heart lol. But let me say, this is SO worth it. After using this cleanser for over 4 months now I am IN LOVE.I have semi sensitive skin & it never burns or gives my skin that dry & tight feeling.I’ve seen so much improvement with my acne (especially on my cheeks) & my face feels like baby skin right after use.I shortly went back to a drugstore cleanser to try & avoid spending so much on one product & see if I would notice any big differences & my skin was crying for me to switch back to this.I cant hype this up enough!! Worth every penny.
