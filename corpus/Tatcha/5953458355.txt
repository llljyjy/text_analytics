Tatcha could sell me dust in a bag and I would buy it and apply it to my face! All jokes aside this mask is absolutely wonderful. The list of effective and high quality ingredients is substantial. Personally I barely noticed the warming effect of the mask. Instantly after the first use I noticed major improvement in my skin. My face feels SO smooth, like I just did a peel! My pores appear shrunken and overall my face just appears healthier. You can see in the attached photo that it helped to clean and shrink my pores noticeably. I also appreciate that my skin did not feel tight or dry after use. Effective yet gentle on the skin
