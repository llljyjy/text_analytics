I’ve been on the hunt for a lip mask for SOOO LONG and decided to buy both the Laneige and the Tatcha one. I definitely like the Laneige one more. Despite the lower price, that one just hydrated my lips more. This tatcha one isn’t really great for overnight - just felt like a sticky lip gloss. Now, I just wear this during the day.. I’m honestly not sure if I would repurchase this It's just ok
