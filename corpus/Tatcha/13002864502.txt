beyond its beautiful packaging and affordable price the tatcha rice wash cleanser has to be my favorite gentle cleanser! you don’t need a large amount to cleanse your face - pea-sized is enough when lathered with warm water. the texture is slightly grainy but isn’t physically exfoliating and it smells super refreshing. this product makes me excited to cleanse my face every morning and night! especially when using it as a double cleanser after my gentle makeup remover. the perfect cleanser!
