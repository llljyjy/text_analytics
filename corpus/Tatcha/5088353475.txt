This opinion is a hot take, but I have a really hard time grappling with the texture of this cream. It feels like a makeup primer with its familiar silicone feeling and matte finish, but putting it on my face post oils and serums almost feels wrong! I know it’s extremely popular and has a huge following, but I have definitely used other thick face creams that are more moisturizing and significantly more affordable like Weleda Skin Food.Overall, definitely give it a try if you can afford it, but I would steer away from this item and get something else. These jar-style product packages aren’t sanitary either since you have to dip your fingers into the product to use it... Regardless, I guess I just don’t get the hype with this one. Not Worth the Hype!
