I love the liquid part of it for my very oily skin. But I don’t like the little grains in it. I feel like their too harsh and would actually cause micro abrasions. Wish Tatcha would make this wash without the grains as you don’t need to exfoliate everyday. I prefer the Rice Polish for exfoliation. ehhh not a fan of the grain in it
