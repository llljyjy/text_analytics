I’m another critic of this over-hyped product. I also received this as a birthday gift and it looks nothing like the actual product. I used it twice and I received the worst breakout I had gotten in years. I’m not sure if the product was expired because it was a sample, or if the ingredients did not go well with my skin (my current serums did not contain retinol so not quite sure how it started). Spend your money on another product. BAD Breakout
