This new Tatcha clay face mask is fantastic! It has such a nice texture that doesnâ€™t irritate my skin but rather a absorbs the oil. The results are quite immediate - I leave it on my face for a few minutes and wash it off with warm water. After that I apply face moisturizer. Have been using it for a few weeks and loving it! Gifted by Tatcha. Amazing clay mask!
