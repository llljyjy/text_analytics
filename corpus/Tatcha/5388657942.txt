I am really picky about my nighttime moisturizers, and this one is 10/10 for me. Perfect consistency, little/no fragrance, and everything I want out of an overnight cream. My skin always looks balanced and refreshed in the morning, and when I donâ€™t use this consistently I notice the dullness in my skin. Worth Every Penny
