This primer is an HG product for me. I’m reordering for the third or fourth time. I’m 43 and have normal to oily skin and this primer makes my skin look more matte, but natural. It’s like my skin, but better. It is t drying in the least. It pairs great with my glossier skin tint and cloud paint, or looks great alone. I love this stuff. HG primer for me
