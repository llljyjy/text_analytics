I love this cleanser but they should improve the packaging considering the high price. I have had 3 tubes and all the lids have been broken at the first fall or within a few weeks of use. Which produces the product to come out and if its left in the shower, water would come inside and ruin the product. BAD quality packaging. It brakes at the first fall
