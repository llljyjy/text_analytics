I did not like this product at all. Felt like a scrub instead of a clay mask. The product was gifted to me by Tatcha and I am glad about that. No money wasted. I can only say the brand is great at packaging and presentation but overall this product did nothing for my skin. I really wished it would have dried down after application like most clay masks. This a scrub not a clay mask really
