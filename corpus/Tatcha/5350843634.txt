I agree with others. It’s a great product, but packaging is horrible. I had to put it in a different bottle. As soon as you open it, the product is bubbling out all over the place (just like after being on a plane- some of my toiletries do the same thing). And the product seems to pull the paint off the outside when you are cleaning everything up afterwards.That said, the actual product is really good. But I won’t purchase it again unless they change the packaging. Good Product, Bad Packaging
