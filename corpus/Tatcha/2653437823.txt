I don’t get how that one person writes a review saying that they got this birthday sample, and say “they’ll never purchase again”. You didn’t buy it. So. lol Anyway… as for me, I also got a birthday sample, and I SHOULD’VE kept an eye on the skin concerns, because I know just by touching it, it isn’t for my oily skin. Lol maybe I’ll just use it as a eye cream before bed. Not gonna waste it. 4 stars for me anyway. nan
