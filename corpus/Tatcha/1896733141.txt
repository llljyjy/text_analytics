I love a good primer and received this as a sample. Super excited to use it for my birthday dinner and it made me pill. I have combo skin and used a serum plus moisturizer before this primer. It was so much pilling after I put it on. Very disappointed. My old Mac primer doesnâ€™t even cause pilling .. try the Laura Mercier hydrating one instead not for me; it pills
