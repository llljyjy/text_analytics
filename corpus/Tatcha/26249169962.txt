Another hit from Tatcha. This Clarifying Clay Mask leaves your skin feeling so smooth and soft and even looking brighter - and this coming from someone who doesn’t care for clay masks. Tatcha always seems to have the best forumla in the prettiest packaging! This mask is wonderful and my skin loves it! *Gifted by TatchaTatcha is that brand that never dissapoints I feel. Clay masks are usually my least favourite but I was super excited to receive this Clarifying Clay Mask complimentary from Tatcha for my honest review. Most clay masks dry my skin out but not this one.  After using my skin feels fresh and rejuvinated! It even feels smoother as if I’ve just exfoliated. I have combination skin and so this did a great job at just evening out my skin’s texture.It comes in that beautiful Tatcha packaging we love. I’m so happy I was able to try this out - I love it and definitely recommend! Another fantastic release!
