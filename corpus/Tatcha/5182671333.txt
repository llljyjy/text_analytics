Got this as part of the Sephora birthday gift and I love it so much! It goes on very silky smooth after a moisturizer and stays out with no oil spots after an entire night out. Im not sure why others are mentioning pilling but it probably has to do with their other makeup products not meshing well with this formula for whatever reason. I use Charlotte tilbury foundation and concealer and urban decay powder for reference. This primer is the perfect edition to this routine! A bit disappointed in the price point but I will be buying the large size and using for days when I really need my makeup to last. great product
