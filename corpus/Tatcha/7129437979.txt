I like the cleanser! It has little gentle exfoliating beads. My skin texture has improved a little after a few weeks of use. Not sure that I would repurchase the moisturizer again though. I wish it came in a bigger size in this duo, especially considering that I’m not even 1/5 of the way done with the cleanser and I’ve already run out of moisturizer. Not loving the formula either; it doesn’t soak into my skin like the inkey list’s omega water cream does. TL; DR: Like the exfoliating cleanser but would rather buy the inkey list moisturizer than this tatcha one. Good Cleanser! Skip on the moisturizer
