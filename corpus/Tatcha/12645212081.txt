I love this moisturizer even though its stated its good for dry skin, it works perfectly with my combination skin. I love the texture and consistency of the cream. Its light and it doesnâ€™t make my face greasy. It keeps my skin healthy and well hydrated. It helped my skin survived when I visited Las Vegas in summer! Perfect! perfect moisturizer
