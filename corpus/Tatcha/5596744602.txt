As others mentioned, there’s a serious packaging flaw. This can be overcome by wrapping the base of the bottle in tape before you use it to prevent the flaking.As far as the sunscreen itself...it’s fine. Just okay. I’m not a fan of the finish as it has this glossy slightly bronzed look to it which doesn’t look good on my particular skin shade.The price is insane for the amount of product. If it were 5 years ago it might be worth it for a nice wearable formula, but there’s so many better and more affordable options now. If you are looking for a daily SPF with similar benefits (such as the rice extract and sensitive skin friendly), the Beauty of Joseon Sun Relief is a much better formula at a fraction of the price, and zero white cast or bronze color. Speaking of sensitivity, I felt like my skin seemed to tend towards being a bit more pink when wearing this, but I didn’t have any reaction per se. not bad but just not worth it
