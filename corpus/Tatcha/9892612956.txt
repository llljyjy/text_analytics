I’ve heard about this product so many times but thought it was just another overhyped-overpriced product. I ended up getting a free sample of this once and had to go back to purchase the full size! I have combination skin but I’ve been on a ton of products for my acne that are drying so I use the slightest bit of this stuff to moisturize at the end. It’s worth every single penny! Doesn’t make me break out at all either. worth the price!
