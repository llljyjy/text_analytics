I’ve been using Lancôme advanced Génifique for years now and love it. Not certain at this point if Silk Peony will replace but certainly will rotate both eye creams because love them both. Especially using Tatcha eye cream in am. Silk Peony melts quickly/absorbs into my aging under eyes giving me a dewy hydrating look that I need! I’ve searched for a full coverage hydrating concealer for a long time. I use BB concealer but formula has changed. Less hydrating:(Using Silk Peony with my Full coverage concealer gives me that dewy, hydrating under eye that I absolutely need! Aging dry under eyes, no go. I’m loving this stuff and absolutely recommend for aging skin. It helps in brightening and gives me the hydration I need so much! Darkness under eyes, waiting for results. Thicker formula but all good because it’s so hydrating! And don’t need to apply much to get perfected results. Melts, yes!
