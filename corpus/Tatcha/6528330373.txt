I got a sample size of this product in the Sephora birthday gift. I’m really disappointed.. I have fairly dry skin so I thought this would be great. Unfortunately it made me EXTREMELY oily, like I need to rewash my face and start over oily. Not to mention the consistency is very thick (reminds me of the silk canvas primer consistency) so it wasn’t as easy to spread as I would’ve liked. I definitely won’t be purchasing the full size of this product :( I wanted to love this…
