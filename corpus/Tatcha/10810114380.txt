I have dry skin and I use this multiple times throughout the day coz it works. Finally something that has no complaints from my end. I trust this cream first thing on bare skin. Never had any bumps or rashes or tingly feeling. Although I donâ€™t use the spatula that have provided.I see it as Kind of a choking hazard for small babies. Everything else is great! Does what it says Must have even for dry skin
