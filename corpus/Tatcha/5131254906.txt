I’m not one to spend a ton of money on one product but this is the exception, I’m on my fourth jar and i am never disappointed. The thick texture feels super Lux and i do feel like it makes a noticeable difference in the texture and hydration of my skin. I apply it about 4 nights a week and i can’t find any other products that give me the same results. It’s the tatcha magic i guess lol worth the $$$
