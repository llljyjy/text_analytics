I cannot believe how well done this mineral sunscreen is. Let me start out by saying: if you are able to wear chemical filters, by all means - do that. Mineral filters are a huge pain. But unfortunately, they’re the only option for some of us with sensitive skin (self included). I’ve tried so many mineral sunscreens in my life, and been disappointed by the majority. Sticky, heavy, white cast, and a low SPF.As for THIS product: This was a pricey purchase for me, but I thought that if there was a chance it ended up being nice, it could be worth it. It turns out it’s not just nice. It’s phenomenal! It ticks every single box for me: beautiful application, unscented, non-irritating, no white cast, blurs my skin (what kind of wild bonus is THAT in a sunscreen!?) It’s a mineral sunscreen that - rather than leave my skin looking worse - I look better while wearing it!?A few notes: it’s a thin formula, so you want to be cautious in the application. Due to its price, PLEASE do not attempt to underapply. I’ll add that I like the packaging personally as I’m standing it up at my vanity, but know it doesn’t lend itself to just standing on its own. I can see why not everyone may love the design.Alas, a huge win. Perhaps not for my bank account, but my skin has found it’s true love! take my money, just take it
