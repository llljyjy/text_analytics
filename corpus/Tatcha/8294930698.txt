Completely changed my skin. I use to have little texture near my eyes and around my check area and this completely got rid of it. My skin looks amazing it’s so clear I don’t mind going without make up my pores are smaller, not oily. Yes a little pricey but honesty takes only an almond size to do face could last for months. I was using Cereva and it’s well worth switching that wasn’t doing anything for my shin as this has. I actually got lucky and someone left it behind in my rooms or I would have never tried! Works way better than I'd ever thought
