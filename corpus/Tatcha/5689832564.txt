Great for dry skin. it’s winter time and my skin gets really dry during this time. I was out of my usual moisturizer and I had the mini size of this moisturizer and wow! I’m almost done with it and I will definitely buy more. The first time I used it, I thought was really oily, but that subsided over a couple of minutes it leaves my skin feel hydrated. I love it! my skin feels wonderful! nan
