This moisturizer along with the deep cleanser is saving my skin. I don’t understand the bad reviews about it not being luxurious enough? It literally contains gold lol along with nice, clean ingredients. Yes it’s expensive but it’s shortened my routine tremendously and I don’t have to buy 6 different budget serums now that all add up to the price anyways and don’t work as well as this. My formerly dehydrated, combination, acne prone yet starting to age skin (30s) is now clearing up rapidly looking brighter and less pore filled. I’m a mother who doesn’t like to spend a lot on herself but Tatcha is my new found splurge. So worth it! holy grail
