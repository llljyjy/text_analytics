This is a great eye cream to wear under makeup. I press this into my under eye area just before applying concealer and it definitely helps my concealer blend more effectively. It’s very rich, so don’t use too much or you can experience pilling. Also, I’ve found that pressing it into my skin rather than rubbing it in helps with absorption. There’s a slight scent but nothing too overpowering to bother your eyes. I think it smells like fruity cereal, but I’ve also heard others describe it as a gentle floral scent.My only complaint is the jar packaging. I try to keep the lid open as little as possible and use a metal spatula (it came with a metal makeup mixing tray I bought elsewhere) to scoop out a small amount every morning.Also I find this does better as a daytime eye cream. You could use this at night but I’m using it AM only because at night I’m trying to use up another brand of eye cream that didn’t work so well with makeup. Great cream as base for under eye concealer
