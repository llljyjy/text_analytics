This stuff is magic. It was the first moisturizer I ever bought when I started my skincare about three years ago and have not stopped buying it since. One jar of this can last me about 6 months which is the period after opening time frame so it never expires on me. The scent is lovely. The packaging is innovative. The formula is top tier! The price is backed by good ingredients, research, and technology! nan
