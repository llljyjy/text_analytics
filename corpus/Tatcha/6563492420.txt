Really good sunscreen, not oily, not white cast, goes on really smooth and for a mineral sunscreen this one is great. Finding a good mineral sunscreen can be pretty hard, I have been part of that long search for years, but thank God I am done looking.  This sunscreen doesn’t leave a white cast, when you put it on it leaves like a purple look on your face, but it fades away after a couple of minutes and if you blend it good, you won’t be able to tell you have sunscreen on, it doesn’t stain your clothes like other tinted sunscreen do and it doesn’t cause breakouts and trust me I have very sensitive skin and so far this one hasn’t caused any breakouts. Now I do have to agreed with the rest on the packaging being terrible, but to me the product inside of what really matters and if you are careful enough it won’t wear off that bad and that fast. If you are looking for a none greasy, no white cast, you should give this one a try. Great Sunscreen!
