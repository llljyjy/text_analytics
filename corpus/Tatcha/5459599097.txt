A lot of times, I’ve found splurge items aren’t really with it, but this one is worth the $! I have oily/combo skin and sometimes sensitivity around cheeks will lead to redness. This moisturizer is sooo soothing. It has a nice rich consistency without feeling greasy. It sinks in nicely and leaves skin looking so smooth and plump. My dehydrated skin loves how this moisturizer feels. For me, it’s perfect for the winter, but I think it’d be too heavy for summertime. If I had the $ and wanted to splurge on one item, this would be it. Soothing and moisturizing
