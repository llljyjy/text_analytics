The product itself is great and I would definitely make it a permanent item, but the packaging is TERRIBLE. Hence the 4 stars. The second you open the cap the product starts oozing up from the spout and it wastes so much product. You basically literally can’t touch the container while you’ve got the cap off. This product is too expensive for such bad packaging that wastes so much product and I don’t think I’ll repurchase unless they change it. Product is Great, Packaging Ruins It
