Got sunburn on my face despite having applied this very liberally and only being in part shade/part sunlight for a little over an hour. Also disappointed in the packaging itself. The outside started chipping shortly after buying it, leaving tin looking flakes all over my skin and bathroom. I would think with a brand like tatcha this would have been better quality. The only good thing I can say about it is that it didn’t make me break out and doesn’t make my dry skin worse. No thanks
