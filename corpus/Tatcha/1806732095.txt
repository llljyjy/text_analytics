I got the sample for my birthday and let me tell you I was pleasantly surprised on how nice this cream was. I have sensitive skin and this did not irritate my skin AT ALL. It made it plump, dewy and well hydrated just like the product says. It goes amazing under makeup and as a night cream. It’s goes on beautifully and my skin looks brighter and healthier. It’s an amazing product and worth the hype and mind you I’m a skincare snob so not easily impressed by just anything. Treat yourself if you can! Worth the splurge!
