#SephoraPartner I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review & today i’m talking about the one I selected to test. I chose to review @tatcha the texture tonic Aha liquid exfoliating treatment. I’ve been using this tonic since mid January & I’ve been looking forward to sharing my honest opinions. While I used a gift card to purchase this tonic, these are my honest opinions. Details: This tonic is a liquid exfoliator formulated  with fruit AHAs niacinamide, Japanese mugwort & wild rose. Designed to event both texture & skin tone as well as calm & leave your skin smooth. Recommended for combination or oily skin. Liquid exfoliation is gentle & removes dead skin cells to help with congested pores. In addition to the above, the tonic has the scent of the  sweet fennel & rosemary oil to minimize excess sebum & oil creation while it boosts your mood. This is a cruelty-free product My experience: For reference, I have oily, sensitive, acne prone skin with some redness & sensitivity. This is a yellow, watery tonic that removes dead skin cells, oil, & dirt as well as unclogs pores. It has a lovely scent that isn’t too strong. I’ve been using this since 1/17 & my sensitive skin hasn’t experienced any irritation. I do take care not to use it when I’m using retinol. My skin is more even & smooth with a healthy glow. This doesn’t dry out my skin luckily nor does it leave a sticky/oily residue. I also notice it helps with oil reduction. you can see lightening of my hyperpigmentation (not including the random breakout).  Overall: I am LOVING the results I’m seeing so far from my use of this Tatcha tonic. My skin is smoother, more even & with less oil. It doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin or leave my skin dry or oily. This retails for $59 which is steep. Keep in mind it will last a long time & works well. 4/5#BeautyInsiderCommunity #SephoraSkinGoals Smoother, more even, less hyperpigmentation
