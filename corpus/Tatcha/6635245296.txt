Definitely a luxury buy but it’s still a nice product. I see that my face is more plump and glows but for the price I think it’s a one time for me. I don’t have rosacea so all it does is moisturize my face. There are other creams that do more for less $. 4 stars because it’s overpriced and doesn’t do more than your average No7 overnight cream or Olay retinol overnight creams. luxury buy…
