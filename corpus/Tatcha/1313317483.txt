I bought this on a whim in December. I own so many different lip balms but I couldn’t avoid buying this as the Lunar new year edition packaging was so cute. If I were to directly compare the laneige lip sleeping masks, it’s a little less thick and heavy. While I still love the laneige lip masks, I’m so happy with this tatcha one for now. It keeps my lips hydrated and I can use this day and night. I love the slight red tint that it gives my lips as well. ❤️
