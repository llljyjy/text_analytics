Tatcha is my FAVORITE skincare brand for my dry, sensitive skin and this overnight cream is an amazing addition to my skincare routine.  I have an extensive nighttime routine, but I put this on over my serum and under a thick moisturizer - either the Tatcha dewy skin cream of the Tatcha indigo skin cream.  AMAZING results - your skin feels amazing when you wake up, it has helped correct my redness and uneven tone, and my dry skin!  DEFINITELY try this out if you have dry/sensitive skin! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE
