As a 14 year old girl who has a strict skincare routine, my dark circles are minimal. Still there, but minimal. I was running out of my other eye cream and wanted to branch out and try another, so I tried Tatcha’s! They always have aesthetic packaging and great products so I had high hopes. When applying this, it really does melt so nicely. I’ve tried the super pricey beauty bio eye balm and it wouldn’t melt into my eyes, as was thick and chunky. I hated it. This one feels so nice on my eyes, and doesn’t leave an oily finish, more of a nice healthy glow. Obviously an eye cream that “feels nice” isn’t worth $60. So as I mentioned my eyes have minimal darkness so I didn’t think my eyes could get any better- they did. After a week of using my dark circles cleared up so much. I literally switched to a lighter coverage concealer. My fine lines are still noticeable but the hydration of this is amazing. No more flakes around my eyes! Sosososo amazing!
