Due to all the rave reviews, I had been wanting to try this for a long time, but was hesitant because of the price tag. I was excited to receive a sample, but if I’m being honest, I was very disappointed. I have oily skin, and I prefer a moisturizer that doesn’t leave my skin feeling oily. This made my skin feel oily, which was a surprise being that it’s a water cream. I much prefer First Aid Beauty’s Coconut Water Cream, and it’s almost half the price of this one. I’ll stick with FAB! JUST OK
