This serum is so good under make up. I have super dry skin that foundation rolls dry, so I used to think putty heavy cream would solve that. Watching k beauty youtube videos told me I should try gently smoothing the skin with a toner then patting light with serum before make up. And I used this tatcha serum and my skin looks flawless. No more dry rolls on my skin. I wish it was more affordable because the bottle lasted 3 months and i didnt even use it everyday. The container looks deceiving because half is air. Container deceiving- very little product but great
