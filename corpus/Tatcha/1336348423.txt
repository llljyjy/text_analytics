Tatcha gifted me the Silk Sunscreen: Hydrating Mineral SPF to try in exchange for my honest opinion!The Silk Sunscreen: Hydrating Mineral SPF is a lightweight sunscreen that is hydrating and has a SPF 50 PA++++. It comes in an easy to use squeeze tube packaging that makes it easy to apply. The sunscreen itself spreads easily on the skin and absorbs quickly without leaving any white cast. Additionally, it is water resistant for 80 minutes making it a really great sunscreen for the whole year around.I would definitely recommend the Silk Sunscreen: Hydrating Mineral SPF to anyone looking for a hydrating sunscreen. Great hydrating sunscreen for any occasion
