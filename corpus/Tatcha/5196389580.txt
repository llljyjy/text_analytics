Wanted to love this so bad. I have normal skin. This broke me out after a week of using it. When I first got it, I broke out. So I waited and tried it again and the SAME reaction happened. Small tiny bumps. Makes me mad when all I want is dewy nice skin ha. The cleanser is amazing though. This is a hard pass for me- it can go on my neck now just to not waste it cuz itâ€™s so pricey. small bumps :(
