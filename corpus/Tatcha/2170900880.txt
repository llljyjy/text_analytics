The actual product is good but the packaging is ruining it. I have had it for two weeks and the bottle is flaking pearly purple blue plastic all over my hands. I didn’t notice it until my husband kept trying to pick off tiny pieces of pearly glitter. I couldn’t figure out where it was coming from until I looked at the bottle. For $60, the packaging should not be falling apart and ruining the product. packaging Ruining the Product
