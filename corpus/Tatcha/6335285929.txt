Seriously amazing! Great for those no-makeup days, when you want plump and glowy skin without applying a foundation or skin tint. The moisturizer glides on silky smooth and hydrates all day. My only complaint is that if you accidentally put too much on, it’s easy to start looking a little shiny on zoom calls. Works really well in conjunction with Caudalie’s perfecting serum. Perfect moisturizer for the no-makeup look days.
