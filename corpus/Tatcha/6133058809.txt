So disappointed  with this product. I love Tatcha but this is by far their worst product. It does leaves a white cast. I like the sleek packaging but the amount of product that you get is very small for what you pay, but I knew this before buying and I didn’t care because I thought I would love it as everything else from the brand. It does give a sunscreen scent snd it doesn’t sits well on the skin. i returned mine. Nor worth it
