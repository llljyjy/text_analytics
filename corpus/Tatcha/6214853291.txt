Got this because of a recommendation from a youtuber and does nothing for me. Tried with multiple formulas and followed instructions carefully, and its performance still disappoints (does not blur pores and only SLIGHTLY helps makeup stay longer)There are better primers out there (Sephora and drugstore) for way less. only ok-ish for already perfect skin
