I had really high hopes for this sunscreen because I’ve used and love their Silken Pore Perfecting sunscreen, but wanted something with a higher SPF rating. The packaging is slim and compact, which I love, but that’s where the love ends. Let’s start with the formula. It’s super thin, which sounds like a good thing, but in reality, the sunscreen is so thin that it erupts from the nozzle each time you open it. This leads to a lot of wasted product. The tint is a nice touch for preventing a white cast on most light to medium skin tones, however, the consistency is thick and sticky upon application. I’ve worn this over different moisturizers with the same result. It doesn’t sink into the skin and just feels heavy, which leads me to my next gripe. I’ve tried this sunscreen with different foundations and none look good. It even made my HG foundation look terrible. I didn’t want to throw it out because of the hefty price tag, so I decided to use it on no-makeup days. That was a fail because it remained tacky for hours after I applied it. I’m done trying to make this work...it’s going in the garbage. I’ll stick w/ their Silken sunscreen from now on. I give this one star for the compact packaging and one star for the tint. Not worth the spend
