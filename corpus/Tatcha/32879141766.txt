I got a miniature size of this product in a Sephora kit. This is the best primer I have used to date. It goes on smooth and stays smooth after foundation application. Also, I can use it on my eyes and they do not water like with some other eye makeup primers. Once Iâ€™m done with my other primer (different brand that is not as good) I plan to buy this in the full size. nan
