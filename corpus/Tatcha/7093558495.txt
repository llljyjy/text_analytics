I really like this product, it’s super hydrating, smells amazing and feels really nice on the skinsince the product is on the thicker side, you don’t need to use much and it lasts a lot longer than other moisturizers the only downside to the product is that it doesn’t absorb completely into the skin smells amazing and very hydrating
