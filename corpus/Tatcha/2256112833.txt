It feels like I had a nice cleansing facial; it got warm just like it said and it was a little harder to clean off than other masks Iâ€™ve used but the clean feels like a deeper clean. Normally I do anti wrinkle or puffy masks but this had such great reviews I decided to check it out and it did not disappoint. Recommended! SUPER CLEAN
