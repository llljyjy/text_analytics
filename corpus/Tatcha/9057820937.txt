The is the ONLY mask I will use. I react to every kind of mask especially clay ones, and I don’t like paper sheet masks. The texture is thick, creamy, and does not burn my skin. It has a light fragrance that isn’t overpowering, and leaves  my skin feeling soft, smooth and less rednes. My must have !
