I honestly did not want to like this product because of the price, but I fell completely in love with it from my first use. Price aside, this is my new favorite sunscreen. I have tried a lot of mineral sunscreens and this one is hands down the best. It is super lightweight, feels like I’m wearing nothing, and leaves zero white cast. It layers really well with other skincare products and wears well under makeup too. I also really like all the added skincare benefits it offers in addition to protecting my skin from the sun. If you’re looking for an amazing mineral spf look no further! *gifted by Tatcha, but opinions are all my own. nan
