This is my first time writing a review, and I usually donâ€™t write them, but I felt I should for this product because it was really hyped for me and I was told it was basically the best toner for my skin. The product did feel nice on my skin, but I quickly stopped using it after noticing it had caused some small red bumps to appear on my skin, which has never happened to me before, as well as making my face extremely oily, which was strange because my skin is usually dry or normal. I will be returning this because it did not work for me. Caused Red Bumps and Oiliness
