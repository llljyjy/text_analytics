Best eye cream I have ever used! Hands down! I will be 42 this year and the skin under my eyes was becoming very dry and crepe. This stuff really goes on like silk and blends in magically. Has added so much moisture and youth under my eyes, I honestly can’t believe it. Fine lines have disappeared. Under eyes are no longer dry and so moisturized!!!! And my makeup looks so much better in top of this cream. I had almost given up on anything that could help my aging skin until I found this. And I’ve tried a lot of under-eye creams. It is pricey but so worth it! nan
