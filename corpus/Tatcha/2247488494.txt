Not only is this extremely beautiful to look at, it also helped me with dry, chapped lips this winter. I layer on extra at night as a sleeping mask and wake up with moisturized lips. Not only is it beautiful to look at, itâ€™s also a nice consistency, not greasy or sticky, and it leaves a beautiful and subtle shine. Luxurious lip balm helped heal my chapped lips!
