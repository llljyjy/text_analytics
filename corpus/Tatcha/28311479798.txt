I bought this with high hopes, as it had so many good reviews but was sadly very disappointed. It clung to every dry patch I had, despite doing extra skin prep. It made my face look even more dry and settled into my fine lines and by the end of the day I looked twice my age. I do not recommend this at all. NOT for dry skin!!
