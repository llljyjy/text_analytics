I really wanted to love this sunscreen. When you first apply it the finish is beautiful! I love a dewy finish. Unfortunately, the packaging is horrible. The bottle started flaking and leaving silver little flakes all over the place. The nozzle is not ideal due to how liquidy the product isâ€¦it just spills all over the place. I do not have sensitive skin and this formula made me break out all over. A no for me, especially for the price! No thank you!
