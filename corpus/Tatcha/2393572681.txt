I followed the instructions and applied just one pump after applying sunscreen. Firstly it really pills around the eyes, once I applied my makeup over it, it seems fine at first but within the first 30 minutes my face was so shiny and slippery and all the foundation was just sliding off my face. Awful primer Not for oily skin
