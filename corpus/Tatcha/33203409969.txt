if I could give negative stars I would this is the worst face wash I’ve ever used! at first I couldn’t figure out why my skin had all these dry patches so I kept moisturizing then I would use this face wash and it would get worse mind you it’s new for me so I’ve only used it a few time’s and no not every day but I started noticing that when I used it my face was getting worse then I would go a few day’s not using it and the dry patches where getting better then I used it again last night and this morning it is so bad! it’s gonna take me a few weeks to get this under control now. Tatcha products are so over rated and I don’t understand why? I even have the silk canvas primer that everyone raves over I hate it even the moisturizer it would bead up it was just gross on my skin it would never absorb. For me it’s a BIG NO in general for this line of product everything I’ve used I’ve had issues with I won’t waste no more money or my skin on this product nan
