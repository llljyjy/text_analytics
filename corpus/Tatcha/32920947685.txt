This product did me wrong, hard. Got it on Hyram’s recommendation, and whoa, that was clearly a sponsorship without reality behind it. First of all, the stick is stupid, no one would use that, where would you even put it and just why? Landfill junk. Then the product itself is gluey and sticky. The smallest possible amount goes a long way, but without actually doing its job. Just being sticky. I eventually moved to using it to enhance the shine of waxy lame balms. It turned out though that this caused the utmost possible breakout situation around my mouth that you could ever imagine. And then because I contaminated all my other lip products with it, I have suffered continued breakouts. What’s really necessary is to replace them all now. The price is absolutely unacceptable. I have regrets. Wasted money, months of breakouts
