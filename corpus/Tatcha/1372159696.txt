I started using this cleanser and the next day noticed a breakout along my chin. I haven’t had breakouts in years and thought it was due to something else I was using. I tried using this wash again to isolate the issue and it was indeed the rice wash. It continues to break me out along my jaw with acne like I’ve never had before. I checked the Sephora community page and it’s a known issue with this product. Just stay away from it if you can — I’m tossing mine in the garbage. Broke Out My Jawline
