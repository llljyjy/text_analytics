This cleanser is excellent. I have been an avid user of Farmacy’s Clean Bee Ultra Gentle Facial Cleanser; it has been in my routine for roughly 3 years, and that will continue. I found the travel size rice water cleanser in the back of my product junky evident beauty cabinet, and randomly washed my face with it two weeks ago. Above 5 days prior I had completed my bi-monthly microneedling session, and this cleanser, specifically the “Saccharomyces/Camellia Sinensis Leaf/Cladosiphon Okamuranus/Rice Ferment Filtrate’ ingredients, provided a MUCH needed calming soothing effect. This is gentle, there is a light fragrance but it does not bother mean, it cleanses well, but is not stripping. Pricey yes, but great skincare is always a great investment to me. Its been 3 weeks now since I have been using this, and I believe we have a new staple Welcome to my routine!
