Tatcha has been a longtime favorite skincare brand of mine, and I’ve loved every single product I’ve tried from them so far. This Clarifying Clay Mask is exceptional! It’s a gentle, warming, exfoliating, and detoxifying clay mask, which makes it the perfect mask for my combination, acne-prone skin. It’s formulated with Okinawa kucha clay, Japanese konjac, and Japanese volcanic ash. I would 100% recommend trying this out! This was gifted by tatcha. nan
