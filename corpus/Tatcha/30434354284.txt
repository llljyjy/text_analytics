Absolutely OBSESSED! I fell in love with Tatcha when I tried the Rice Water Wash, it has completely changed the texture of my skin and almost completely eliminated breakouts. Both formulas work wonderfully with my combo skin ❤️ I use a gentle daily cleanser in the morning by La Roche Posay, and I alternate between this cleanser and the rice water wash at night. The best part is a very tiny amount goes a long way! So although the price is a little up there please believe me when I say it is so worth it! You’re definitely getting what you pay for. Wonderful ingredients, and beautiful results! New favorite!!!
