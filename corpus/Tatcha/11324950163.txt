So I didn’t want to like this because of the price, but for 3 years now my skin has been incredibly dry & because of it I get red bumps and redness on my cheeks. I’ve tried everything. & I know people say that but I really mean it. Then I found a pic in the reviews of this product of someone with skin like mine that saw results so I took the plunge & decided to try it. I bought this moisturizer, the dewy serum & face wash along with the overnight cream. I decided to take a picture every morning in the same spot at the same time to see how this affects my skin & boy it’s made such a difference after only 6 days of use. More than any other product I’ve tried. If you suffer from dry & dull skin with redness just try this product. I never write reviews but I wanted to leave this here to maybe help someone who’s struggling with the same skin issues & is frustrated that nothing works. I get it. But just try this. It’s working for me. Pics are of my skin before using this & now six days later using the products morning & night. I know the pics aren’t flattering & my face is puffy because it’s the morning but just focus on the skin ok? Lol The only thing that’s worked for my skin
