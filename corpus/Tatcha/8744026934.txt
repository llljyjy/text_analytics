I’ve been wanting to purchase this for some time but I’m always hesitant with commercial brand moisturizers/overhyped products etc. I typically only use professional grade stuff from the beauty store depots. However, I kept seeing how everyone raves about this so I I finally gave in. Here’s my insight.+ Feels nice on skin+ Hydrates + Feels nice in the morning+ Cute packaging?CONS+INCREDIBLE ARTIFICIAL SMELL. It’s so overwhelming, and can be a bit irritating to the face and nose!+O.K moisturizing. You can find so much better results.+Insanely Overpriced! If you want to pay for an overpriced product and get mediocre results, then this is for you.ALTERNATIVE:Try the SERENE lac 10 moisturizer for night time. You’ll wake up feeling like a different person, I kid you not. skin feels gooey and elasticky, feels amazing. similar price point for more product and MUCH better / noticeable results from the FIRST try. it’s a professional product so Im not sure if it’s available for everyone but if you can get your hands on it, dont hesitate. note: You cannot go into the sun with it on your face. it’s really for night time / morning and wash off before being exposed to the sun. I have sensitive skin / rosacea. Incredibly Overrated - Don't be fooled
