Got this as a sample with no expectations. Not a fan of the dewy moisturizer but wanted to try this brand’s other stuff. I have oily sensitive skin. The amount of times people have stopped to tell me how glow my skin is is insane! Thought I was pregnant lol. But nope. This is the only thing I changed. Now even my tried and true cetaphil burns my skin/eyes. This is perfect. Doesn’t strip my skin and gently exfoliates. I loooove it! And am buying the full size now lol. got a sample, became a fan
