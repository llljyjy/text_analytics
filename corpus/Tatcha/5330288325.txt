Immediately after using this product I broke out.  I never even had breakouts when I was a teen and I’m 50 now, so I don’t have breakout prone skin AT ALL.  So then I decided I would just use it under my eyes, which is definitely an area that has never broken out, ever!  Within 24 hours, I had three small pimples pop up under my eye!  This is the second time I have sampled a Tatcha product and this is the second time I’ve experienced breakouts.  I will never let another Tatcha product near my skin again!! Double Thumbs Down!
