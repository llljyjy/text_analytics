Complimentary from Tatcha. I’ve been enjoying this mask a lot! It has a very soothing feeling, it’s almost cooling too. I really like how much smoother it makes my skin feel afterwards. It has a very earthy scent to it, I personally don’t mind it but it is worth mentioning. It has grains that help exfoliate my skin more. I really enjoy this as a “shower mask” lol. nan
