If I were rating this sunscreen formula alone, it would be five stars, hands down. The texture is absolutely beautiful. The finish is flawless - not too dewy or matte. It’s a true satin finish that looks like your skin but better. It wears beautifully under makeup. Does not leave a white cast on my medium-deep brown skin. For the price, though, I expect using this product to be a luxurious experience in every way, as there are other products at half this price that function elegantly without all the hype that comes with a luxury brand like this. Tatcha is meant to have beautiful packaging and when this came out I know it was lauded for its sleek and elegant package shape and design. While it is visually beautiful and captivating, within weeks of using the sunscreen I noticed a small area of the coating on the package had rubbed off. I didn’t make much of it and then I packed it in my makeup bag for travel. Perhaps the added friction with other items in my bag made the issue worse, as tiny purple flecks were all over my other makeup items, transferring onto my hands every time I handled this sunscreen or any other item and rubbed onto my face when I applied the sunscreen. Because I was afraid I would end up ingesting the flakes in addition to having them stick to my face every time I applied the product, I actually scraped off all the coating to at least have a product that’s functional. I shouldn’t have to do this. Part of what I am paying for is an elegant experience with the packaging, which this definitely is not. Unless and until Tatcha improves the packaging, I cannot recommend to anyone to spend this amount, which is a shame because the formula of the sunscreen is so beautiful may actually be worth it for people who usually have bad luck with mineral sunscreens. Please, Tatcha, fix the packaging and I’ll gladly repurchase this. Great formula but package coating flakes off
