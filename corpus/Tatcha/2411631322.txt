Love,  love, love this cleanser. Only a small amount of this rather thick paste-like product turns into a creamy, smooth emulsion when water is added on the skin. It leaves the skin clean, soft and glowing. It does have a fragrance but itâ€™s not overwhelming and dissipates quickly. My new favourite cleanser. Recommended. Effective cleanser
