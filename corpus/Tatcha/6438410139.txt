I love the consistency of this wash. It’s thick and when first applying it, it has a very tiny exfoliant that disappears and rubs into a creamy thick soft wash.  It’s one of my favorite washes I’ve ever used, besides Origins frothy face wash. It definitely won’t cause dry skin. I got this as a birthday reward, the moisturizer and primer is just as amazing.
