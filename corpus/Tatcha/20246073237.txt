this product really improved the texture of my skin. I bought it once and stopped using it because of the price but after a while I bought it and I realized why I fell in love with in in the first place. it’s a very smooth formula that doesn’t feel greasy or thick while still providing a lot of moisture. plus it smells amazing and is a great addition to a nighttime skincare routine. A must have!
