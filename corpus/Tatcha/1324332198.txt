Wow, I have just been using this for a little less than a week and it has quickly become part of my daily routine. No need for foundation during the day. Not only does this protect you from the sun, it also moisturizes and evens out your skin. This will be on heavy rotation! Finally a spf without white cast and bronzer, highlighter, blush lay over it well. Yes, the amount for the price is a little crazy but worth it in my opinion. I have not had flaking issues with the packaging yet at least. SPF holy grail!
