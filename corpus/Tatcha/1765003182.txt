My lips are super sensitive and almost all lip products would cause them to have blisters, itchy and flaky. Vaseline doesnâ€™t even work on them. This mask does not set off any crazy response on my lips and they have been plump and soft ever since I started using this product. Highly recommend for people with very sensitive lips. nan
