I have sampled a ton of beauty products over the years. Most are fine but nothing special that I makes me go buy the full sized version (or write a review). I donâ€™t know what it is about Tatcha, but every product of theirs I try, I seem fall in love with. This one was no different. It feels instantly soothing and hydrating when I put it on my face and leaves my skin incredibly soft and bright. It also has a lovely smell and beautiful packaging and feels like a luxury to use. It is definitely pricey, but I would rather pay more for a product that I love and works well on my skin than one that is just ok. Love!
