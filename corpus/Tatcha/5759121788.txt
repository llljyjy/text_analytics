Incredible it’s sunscreen and primer in one. It’s fantastic. I won’t show as “verified purchase” because I purchased through Tatcha. But I did purchase it. I already put it on loves list to get another during sale in a few weeks. I was hoping for Tatcha liquid silk canvas primer with sunscreen and they delivered! Perfect. Do I wish it was less expensive? Sure but I feel it’s worth the money to me since it’s dual purpose. No white cast no fragrance blurs pores not greasy. 10/10 would recommend! Phenomenal under makeup. Perfect combo of primer and sunscreen. phenomenal
