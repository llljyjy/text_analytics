I’ve been using this moisturizer for the past 3 years and it has done wonders for my sensitive skin. It keeps my skin very hydrated. I keep my jar in a beauty fridge and its AMAZING when you apply it cold in the morning or at night. I did notice a change in the formula but I don’t have any difficulty applying or spreading the product. It is a great product but there are a few moisturizers that work just as well at a cheaper price point. nan
