Worst TATCHA product! Packaging flaked off into my hands and onto my face! After three uses, the bottle completely clogged. $75 wasted! Upon first use, I was splashed with running, messy, colored liquid mess. How does TATCHA put out a product without testing it. I donâ€™t know, like give a few samples out to employees and get their thoughts? BOTTLE CLOGGED AFTER 3 USES!!!!! WORST PRODUCT
