This product is amazing. It actually plumps your skin! It has a smooth texture. It has never clogged any of my pores no matter how much I put on and it is great for everyday use. There is a small matcha tea smell, but it is not overwhelming or irritating. You don’t have to use much for it to cover your face. Your skin is visibly plump, glowing, and smoother. You feel refreshed after putting it on and it definitely moisturizes. I have sensitive skin but the cream doesn’t cause any allergic reactions. I was at first skeptical but it really works! Highly recommend this product. Amazing!
