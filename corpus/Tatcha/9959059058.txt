Im pretty skeptical about whether this product protects my skin from the sun. I have used it several times and loved how it made my skin look great, but I still had redness and dullness after going out,which was bad. I am still thinking about if I should return it or use it as a primer, but not sunscreen. Dewy finish, but sun protection?
