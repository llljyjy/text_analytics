I love this product and tested it from a friend when they received their birthday set. However, my birthday set arrived today and it was hard like a putty and must have gone bad! I was so upset because I was looking forward to having another tester of their dewy skin cream, but I will be going into a Sephora to get a new product. I know this isnâ€™t how it normally feels/looks, so I am looking forward to get a new sample. Product Gone Bad Upon Arrival
