I had used this after fully cleaning myself for the makeup artist. She noticed it immediately started pilling when applying foundation... and even though she tried her best to make it work, in the end I had to wash my entire face again and start over without the cream. Definitely fragrant for anyone wanting to avoid scents. Itâ€™s too bad because the texure feels luxurious. Pills like crazy
