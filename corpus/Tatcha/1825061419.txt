This moisturizer is my all time fav. It is a bit expensive but I have searched high and low and haven’t been able to find anything that is remotely similar that works for my skin. My skin has been a mess since trying to find something less expensive. Needless to say I’ve given up, I’m back on tatcha and I’ll never stray again. Lesson learned! expensive but worth it!!
