Tried this as a sample and I loved it.It looks great under makeup and even alone it smooths out my pores and fine lines quite well, can’t even feel it on.Compared to my $9 putty primer though, it looks identical.This has more skincare benefits that other brands don’t offer so keep that in mind if you’re trying to justify the price but personally I’ll stick to my normal stuff. Also, I tried putting it over my sunscreen and it started pilling so beware of that. Covers Pores, Wrinkles and Secrets
