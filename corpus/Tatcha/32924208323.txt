This is honestly a really effective, high quality product. I normally don’t like clay masks for myself, just because they tend to be so drying and feel like they do next to nothing for my skin. However, this product is revolutionary, and I don’t say that lightly. It’s a comfortable on the skin, quick and easy to use, and it washes off fairly easily. After just two uses of applying it to my problem areas, my skin looked and felt cleaner and smoother than ever before. And, each time I used it, the next day my skin was significantly less oily than usual. I now use this every two-to-three days, just on my oily acne-prone forehead and nose area and I’ve already noticed a significant difference in my acne. It really pulls all the gunk buried in my skin to the surface and allows the resulting acne to heal properly and at a quicker rate. Afterwards, by skin looks absolutely beautiful and clear and my makeup applies like a dream. It’s a little bit of a splurge to buy, but I will definitely purchase it again when I finish this jar.
