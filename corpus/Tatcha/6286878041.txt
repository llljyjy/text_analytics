So, I’m lazy. I always want to do some kind of skincare routine but I never do. But this, because I know how expensive it is, I force myself to use it. And I genuinely notice the difference. My face is plumper, less dull, and noticeably hydrated. I have very dry skin, to the point of little flakes on my face appearing in dry patches if I don’t moisturizer. This helps tremendously. Bottom line, if you have a 3+ step skincare process already, you might not noticed much of a difference with this. If this becomes your only product after using nothing, you’re gonna love it. Also, for the added fun, I put every singly ingredient into Paula’s Choice ingredient checker, and nearly ever single one was of ‘Best’ or of ‘Good’ quality. Which is rare for luxe moisturizers. great for a one stop shop routine
