To me this is just a fancy lip balm. It’s rich, yes, but doesn’t do me any different than putting on good amount of balm before bedtime. I’ve used this for a week straight without skipping a day and my lips are more soft and more moisturized but I still have dry patches. It’s super cute and feels luxurious but didn’t wow me. However, I do love how it feels on the lips all buttery and shiny, and the fact that you don’t need a lot of the product. It’s good but I expected more.
