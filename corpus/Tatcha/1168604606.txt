I received this as part of the free Sephora birthday gift bundle. I try to use a sheet mask on the weekends since I am so busy during the week. This time I followed the sheet mask with the Tatcha dewy skin moisturizer two days in a row. I did not use this product again after the weekend, yet my skin continued to glow for days afterward! That simply amazes me and really speaks volumes about the effectiveness of this product. Also if you are experiencing dry skin due to any acne products like Differin, like I do, this product works like a dream to quench your parched skin. Glowed for a week
