I love this skin cream. It would be nice if it was less expensive, but it is definitely high quality. I use it at night, especially in winter. The fragrance is delicate and pretty. Texture feels very luxe, and absorbs well. If I could afford it all the time this would be my go-to. beautiful moisturizer
