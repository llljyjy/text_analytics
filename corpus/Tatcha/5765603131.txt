The sunscreen itself is pretty great. Goes on smooth, feels great, light tint that works well for my skin tone. It is rather runny and can come out of the bottle a little too fast. I do think the price is a bit high, but my main frustration is the bottle! The finish flakes off terribly, getting everywhere, including in your hands when youâ€™re trying to apply the sunscreen. I end up with little purple flakes on my face, which is pretty annoying unless you have plans for a day rave. Good product, terrible packaging.
