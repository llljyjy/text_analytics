What a wonderful face mask. I’m a fan of Tatcha’s skincare and was excited to try this new launch. The packaging is stunning and the mask itself color from algae green to rosy pink. How cool is that? This mask is made using great oil-absorbing, exfoliating and purifying ingredients that help get rid of all the impurities leaving the skin looking healthy. The texture is creamy with some grittiness in it. The mask is easy to apply and easy to remove. After the first use my skin looked clearer and glowing. It has a mild botanical scent and I didn’t experience any irritation. Luxurious
