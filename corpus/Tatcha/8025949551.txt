I love the way this makes my skin feel. I have tried so many different brands trying to find the best mineral sunscreen for my skin and I think I’ve found the winner! I have been dealing with some dry/distressed skin recently so I definitely make sure to prep my skin with extra moisture first but this just works perfectly on top of all that. I really love it. It’s pricey so keep that in mind. If you’re someone, like me, who doesn’t mind spending a little extra on skincare than it’s totally worth it! If not, totally understandable. But wow it’s good. love how this makes my skin feel
