Ok packaging sucks-Put tape around the bottle so that the purple coating on bottle doesn’t flake off.￼ The product itself is freaking worth it! It’s super lightweight, and works very well under make up. Plus it’s 50 SPF.  Great product! Someone else mentioned putting tape around the package so that it didn’t flake, then you are set. I could not imagine not using an awesome product especially when it comes to SPF￼ put tape around the bottle so that the purple coating on bottle doesn’t flake off. Great product with a package design flaw
