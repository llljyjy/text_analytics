This was gifted by Tatcha for my honest review:)Tatcha does it again!! Their formulas have always been 10/10 for my combo skin. This new Clarifying Clay Mask does exactly what it claims to do! It makes skin super soft and definitely evened out my skin and improved my pores…plus it doesn’t dry out skin! It smells so good too and has a grainy texture that changes to a reddish color once you touch it!! This chick little Tatcha container looks so cute in my vanity :) Their packaging is always minimalist yet gorgeous!! I love that it has a golden spatula that comes with it for easy application. This is a “Clean at Sephora” product that’s also Vegan, & Cruelty-Free!! I highly recommend you try it! Another 10/10 from Tatcha!
