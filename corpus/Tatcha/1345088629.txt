Overrated. The experience as a whole is well rounded. Luxe packaging, nice texture and light spa scent. Where it falls short is the price. It is just only a hair better than my other moisturizers in the $30-50 range. It’s great for my slightly sun and wind burned skin (it happens). Has been very soothing but has not sped up my skin recovery, just has made it more comfortable and tolerable. I mean it would definitely be a great gift to someone special. But unless I’m making 20k per month, then I really can’t justify this as an every day moisturizer. A little kind of goes a long way, but I usually have to go for more. overrated
