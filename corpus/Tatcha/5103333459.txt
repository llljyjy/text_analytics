Clay masks always make me very skeptical because I don’t know what my skin is going to feel like after I wash it off. not only did this mask have a quick turnaround, it immediately showed the results on my skin as soon as I washed it off just a few minutes after. I am so impressed by Tacha and all their products and I’m so happy that I was gifted by Tatcha to review this mask. nan
