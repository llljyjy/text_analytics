The sunscreen itself is fantastic and does really well under makeup. The packaging, on the other hand is horrendous. The product keeps leaking out all over the bottle. Also the paint flakes off everywhere. If you don’t notice a use your hands to put the product on your face along with the paint flakes, it’s difficult to remove. Great product, horrendous packaging.
