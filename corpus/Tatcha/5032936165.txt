I got this product as a mini-sized for my birthday gift, I absolutely LOVE it !! I am 51 and have seen a huge difference in my skin after 2 months, my fine lines are gone no joke, especially under my eyes. I have super sensitive skin (due to cancer) and no issues with it at all , I ever bought it after it ran out , some one on a huge budget , its a little pricey but its worth it . bought it after bday sample it was that good
