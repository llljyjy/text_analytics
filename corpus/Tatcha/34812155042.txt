2 stars for the cute packaging. Otherwise, this product is extremely priced and a bit overrated in my opinion. I’m a prime example of how if a product works well for a lot of people; it may not work great on others. I felt that even after washing it off as the instructions detailed, I felt a thick oily layer still on my skin. My skin didn’t feel totally clean. I much prefer Farmacy’s cleansing balm over this to remove dirt, oil and impurities. Didn't work for me
