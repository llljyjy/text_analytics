After using this product and testing it I hate to say it but if anything the texture on my skin got worse, and i didn’t see any benefit after using it. It’s nice for oily skin, I got it to use as a morning cream cause I hate the feel of heavy creams in the daytime, but it’s just really simple. It’s a simple moisturizer, it’s only benefit would be how lightweight it is. It’s not incredibly hydrating tho. There’s way better creams out there and the dewy skin cream is way better- I actually saw results after using the dewy skin cream. underwhelming & disappointing
