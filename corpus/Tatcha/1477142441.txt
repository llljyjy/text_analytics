I have combo skin, with light acne. Using tretinoin was drying out my chin, and other areas a little. I was told about Tatcha products, but didn’t want to spend that much. Thankfully I received a sample of the Dewy cream, and dear lord it’s fantastic. I bought the biggest size I could find. I will say a little goes a long way, and putting this over my tretinoin at night has really helped hydrate my skin properly. I tried the green cream sample as well, although I liked the feel of it, it wasn’t hydrating enough. This cream is thick/heavy, but it doesn’t just sit on your skin. Pricey, but worth it
