I have sensitive skin and I have been using this cleanser for a week now and has not broken me out at all! I tried YTTP superfood cleanser and sadly that did.This cleanser really makes my face feel smooth and does not strip my skin. Not sure if it can effectively remove makeup as I always double cleanse. But it does clean off the residue my cleansing balm leaves very well. Like mentioned before I have sensitive acne prone skin, and I hate fragranced products, tatcha deep cleanse scent did not bother me at all. It smells very light and like lemongrass. My favorite thing about this cleanser is the little exfoliating beads in it. The beads are not harsh and can damage the skin like a st Ives facial scrub. It has more of crystal like granules that you see in lip scrubs. Itâ€™s super gentle for everyday use and leaves my skin glowing after use! Sensitive and acne prone approved!
