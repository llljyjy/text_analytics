I’m in love with the whole tatcha line. I had a crazy allergic reaction to some new makeup I tried, and tatcha was the only thing I could use. It helped with everything!!! This overnight repair cream saved my face. It was so dry and full of hives that it hurt. In one night, my face was dramatically different. Best Skin care I’ve ever used
