This cleansing oil is absolutely LUXURIOUS! Most cleansing oils are “thin,” but this has a thicker feel to it and I love it! It feels like I’m bathing my skin in some sort of nectar from the gods. This cleanser also rinses easily and cleanly. The scent is very light and not at all offensive (I’m sensitive to smells). I don’t typically wear makeup, so I can’t attest to makeup removal ability. Tatcha, thank you for such a luxurious and decadent cleansing experience and please never stop making this! Decadent!
