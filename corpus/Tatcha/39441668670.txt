I get very dry and peeling lips. I have tried countless lip products. They work for a little while, then I’m right back where I started. I was influenced on Instagram and decided to buy this lip mask. I was hesitant, because I’ve spent and spent money on so many others that didn’t work long term. This lip mask is the winner! It moisturized my lips quickly, and I no longer have dry and peeling lips. I apply it morning and night. It’s on the pricier side of lip products, but you definitely get what you pay for. The little jar holds a lot of product and you don’t need to apply much, so it should last a while. It comes with a little gold spoon type applicator. It goes on smooth and is not sticky. I HIGHLY recommend! You need this lip mask!
