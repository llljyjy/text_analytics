At a loss w/the negative reviews… then again whenever a product blows up (makeup/skincare) chances are it DOESN’T work for me… so maybe it makes sense people hated this & my skin loved it?? LolSo, I’m in my 30s, SUPER dry (recovering from cystic acne) I had been eyeing this for awhile since tatcha has been a god send for me. I use the dewy cream but wanted something a little more intense (specially when using retinol)If your skin is anything like mine (or the others it seemed to work for) let me tell you… this stuff DRINKS it in.. not just sit ontop, but actually absorbs beautifully into the skin..Helped w/alot of redness/inflammation when I went a little too ham w/the niacinamide (and again during the time of the month)I got the small/travel to try & just how it felt on my face made me sigh knowing “why yes…. I have fallen inlove with the feel of ANOTHER expensive product.” Seeing results after a week tho is what sealed the deal for me. Dry skin & desperation= holy grail
