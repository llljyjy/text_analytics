Tatcha is the only sunscreen I’ve found I can wear without breaking out! I have extremely acne prone skin. I can wear this daily without worrying about having little whiteheads at the end of the day. It blends in well so there’s no white cast. “Silk” is a great describing word for this product. It’s super runny coming out of the container, but it blends in beautiful with that silky finish. It’s slightly tinted which surprised me at first, but that’s what allows it to eliminate that white cast. Hands down favorite sunscreen. best sunscreen for acne prone skin
