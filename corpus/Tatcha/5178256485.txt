Tatcha did such an amazing job with this clay mask! It has the iconic packaging and the formula itself is everything I need. Applying the mask, it has a subtle warmness to it which is so cool and it definitely helps to open up all of my pores so that way it could really get in and absorb all the oil and gunk that is in them. My skin seriously feels so clean after using it too. My skin felt refreshed and super soft. Plus, I love that it came with a spoon as well. It’s also super cool that it turns pink when it’s dried. Gifted by Tatcha. Yes Tatcha!!!!
