A bit expensive, but a little goes a long way. I love how my skin feels after putting this on and my makeup definitely lasts longer. One issue I’ve found is that it doesn’t go over all moisturizers very well. I use a moisturizer with spf that’s a bit dry (if that makes sense) and this tends to cause some pilling over that, but is perfectly fine over my other moisturizers. nan
