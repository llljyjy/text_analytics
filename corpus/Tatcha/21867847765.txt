I was excited to try this clay mask because I love TATCHA products. As you can see in the photos of myself that I’ve included after application my skin put forth a blurring effect. I imagine that’s because of the magnetic molecules that basically grabbed all the dirt and oil from my pores making them less noticeable. It didn’t add anymore redness or irritation which I’m so happy about. It felt warming and nourishing on my skin. I think this mask will be great to use on days my skin looks dull because it does amplify brightness and make my skin more shiny but not at all tight or dry feeling. I really like the fact it didn’t leave my skin oily either because my forehead tends to get oily, but not after using this! Smooth skin that glows
