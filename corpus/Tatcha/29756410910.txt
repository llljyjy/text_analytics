I have always believed moisturizer didn’t matter the brand as long as you had one. I typically buy the vitamin a b and c inkey list moisturizer. I think it’s good and much cheaper but simple. I have not found another one I really want to spend money one but after trying this one I knew I had to buy it. I don’t have to do as much treatment because of this moisturizer. Idk what they put in it but I have less skin issues like acne, redness, and white heads. My skin is super gooey and healthy. I maybe young but I feel years of this moisturizer will keep me looking young. Worth the $$$ nan
