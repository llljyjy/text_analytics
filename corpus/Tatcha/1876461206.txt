this is the most I’ve ever spent on a cleanser. I’ve sampled dermalogica enzyme powder and loved it. What I didn’t like was the design of the package and the scent. It has a chemical smell to it. I spent months researching other types of cleansing powders and finally decided to bite the bullet and purchase Tatcha Rice Polish. My skin is very oily and I have deep pores, which fills with oils and turns into sebum. Sounds nasty.  My pores tend to clog especially around my nose area. When I first used the polish, there was no scent and the color was lovely. It’s a mint green color. I added some water to the powder and it became a nice foam and cleansed my skin. My skin is absolutely smooth and the sebum is gone. I love it. It’s gentle enough where I can use it every day. I will try the other products. Sebum be gone! Lovely rice polish
