I wrote another review on the Dewy Moisturizer Cream also from Tatcha, so to repeat myself; before I bought the full size of both products, I did buy the travel size to use as a trial for my skin. It lasted me 3 whole weeks despite how tiny the packaging was—completely shocked me. A little goes a LONG way for both products. This rice wash is chefs kiss. It’s extremely gentle in exfoliating your skin, smells wonderful and leaves your skin feeling soft and surprisingly not dry even before moisturizing. I found that most gel cleansers would dry out my skin and most oil-free moisturizers would leave my cheeks and corners of my eyes patchy and my face would be greasy and covered in oil not long after moisturizing (for reference: I have combo-oily and acne-prone skin). Not a single brand I’ve tried from grocery store to other expensive Sephora brands helped with my acne or my oiliness. I was worried about trying the Rice Wash and Dewy Moisturizer because they were advertised to dry skin, but I was recommended online by a Sephora consultant to give it a try. And after using the trial size, I was honestly pretty amazed. I went from oily, patchy skin with irritated red cheeks and acne clusters all over my chin, jaw, cheeks forehead and hairline to nearly completely clear skin (aside from the occasional pimple and old acne-scars and discoloration from my awful skin-picking). I’m just so happy I found something that actually worked for me. If you’re interested in trying this stuff, buy the $25 travel size! A little goes an incredibly long way and this full size stuff will last you forever. Worth the money. I love it so much, I’m here as a lifetime buyer, baby! Non-Drying Even Before Moisturizer
