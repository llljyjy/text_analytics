This is probably my favorite cleanser ever, and I have combo/oily skin. I love the consistency, the subtle smell, and the lather. It actually does a great job at cleansing my oily skin and I surprisingly love it. It isn’t stripping and it gives such a luxurious experience. I will use this over YTTP and Herbivore! It’s so good. Only problem is the cap broke the day I got it :( Love everything about it
