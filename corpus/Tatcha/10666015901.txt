Wanted to love this enough to give 5 stars but ones this jars gone I don’t plan on buying again. While I love the consistency and how much a little goes a long way, the smell is way to perfumey and overpowering and even with dry skin it leaves me to oily. It’s almost so much of a dew. If I do my makeup it looks like a hot oily mess. I mostly stick to using it for bedtime now on hot summer nights or after showers nan
