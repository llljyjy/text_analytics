I LOVE THE SUNSCREEN but the packaging is just horrible. I’ve never seen a sunscreen like this. I shake the bottle and by the time I open it to use it, Half of the product spills. It’s too much money for the product to be packaged like this. I wish they listened to everyone else who is complaining. I won’t be repurchasing it nan
