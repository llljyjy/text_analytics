This has quickly become my holy grail cleanser. I have dry, sensitive skin and this works like a dream. When I use it my skin glows,is hydrated and smooth. You only need a small amount so a little goes a long way making it worth the price point. If youâ€™re on the fence I would say just go for it and treat yourself! Great for my dry/sensitive skin!
