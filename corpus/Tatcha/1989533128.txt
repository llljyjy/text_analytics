I received this complimentary from Tatcha for my review, and I was excited as Tatcha is one of my favorite skincare brands. The packaging is always so lovely, and this one especially so since it comes with the golden spoon to scoop out the mask. I like that I donâ€™t have to leave it on for so long, which is why I barely use clay mask - this one just needs 3-5 minutes. The color changing effect is so fun to watch as it shifts from sage to soft red. The skin warming sensation is so spa like and calming, especially because of the botanical scent. My skin was smooth and radiant after. nan
