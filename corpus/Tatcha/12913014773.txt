After all the amazing reviews I’ve seen on this product I decided to splurge and try it. Well, I’m not exactly sure what everyone is seeing that makes it so amazing because personally I feel like it’s just water. I’ve been using it for about 6 weeks now and I’ve noticed nothing. I feel like this item is the biggest scam of an item. Tatcha is an amazing brand and I love so many of their other products but this one is a total waste of money It does nothing
