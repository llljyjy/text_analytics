I use SPF daily whether I am inside or outside. I have a combination skin type and I do not need to use a moisturizer with this product. It rubs in and absorbs smoothly while drying clear and not leaving a white cast like some mineral sunscreens do. It felt amazing on my skin and really nourishing. It rubbed so nicely into my skin and did not make my skin feel or look greasy. There is no fragrance in the product which I prefer because sometimes scents can be overbearing. I have worn makeup over this and it does not pill. This SPF shields from UV rays AND blue light! I am a teacher so I have been on the computer everyday. I am happy to add this to the last step of my morning skincare routine! I genuinely recommend this if you are looking for a sheer, smooth finish while preventing signs of aging.
