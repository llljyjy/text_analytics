I will say that I think this does a good job at shrinking your pores. I used it for a month and think my pores are less noticeable. However I think this would be better for someone with oily skin as I felt like this dried my skin out a little too much. My skin type is normal but can lean towards the dry side at times. I like that it is lightweight and does not smell at all. I just wish my skin felt a little more moisturized with this product. Good product just not perfect for me. Good Product, Not Perfect for Me
