Let me start by saying, I am a Tatcha believer but this product did not work for me at all! I have eczema prone skin and this triggered the worst flare up for me, even my chest had a reaction when I washed this off in the shower. I used the mask once and the reaction was immediate. I would try a sample first if possible since this mask is on the pricier end. Not for Eczema Prone Skin
