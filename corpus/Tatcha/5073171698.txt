I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review and I am happy I was able to get my hands on the tatcha texture tonic AHA liquid exfoliating treatment. It is super gentle on the skin, my skin was super smooth after trying for the first time . My pores did appear visibly smaller after using for 3 weeks. It is not drying at all so perfect to use during the colder months. I definitely recommend trying this if you are looking for a gentle way to even your skin tone and texture . A great exfoliating treatment!
