I’ve been using this for a while now on and off but recently started using it consistently for the last month or so and it’s not really hydrating. When I wake up on the morning my lips are fairly hydrated but not as much with other products I’ve used in the past. When I wear it during the day I don’t find it does too much and slides off extremely easily. It feels like it just sits on top of the lips.. not a terrible product but I don’t think I would repurchase meh
