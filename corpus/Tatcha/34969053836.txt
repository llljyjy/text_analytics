I was gifted by Tatcha in exchange for my honest review. I love this luxurious mask! I also own the Texture Tonic & have been loving that, so this was a great addition to my routine. It is gentle, lightly exfoliating, but not as drying as some clay masks can be; instead of completely drying down, it stays moist & pliable, & is easy to wash off - it almost turns milky like a cleansing balm, while the tiny particles gently polish the surface of your skin.  I love that it changes color as it works, and the warming sensation is very gentle & never feels uncomfortable. I really feel that this absorbs impurities & helps to clean the surface of pores. The light herbal smell reminds me of mugwort or a spa herbal bath! A balanced, gentle, & effective mask
