I’m over 70, and buying and testing sunscreens are my passion to protect my skin. Skin thins and gets drier as we age, so sunscreen is the sine qua non of my daily routine, indoors and out. This is by far the best sunscreen I have ever used, and now I wear it almost exclusively. I’m not happy about the ridiculously poor quality flaky container, or the high price, but the sunscreen is worth it. Dewy finish, continuously moisturizing, perfect tint from a mineral sunscreen. Yes, please. holy grail for mature skin
