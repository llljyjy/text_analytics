I have pretty dry skin and I found that this wasnt enough for me especially since it’s been raved about as the HG for dry skin. It does go on quite nicely and feels luxurious but I found my skin felt tight and dry a short while later.I wouldn’t repurchase and I’ll continue to search for a better moisturizer for dry skin. Only okay for dry skin
