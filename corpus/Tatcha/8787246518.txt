I ABSOLUTELY love this product - but I’ll never repurchase it. Well, not unless Tatcha changes the packaging. Despite other reviews I bought it, bc I enjoy their products. As far as the sunscreen goes, it’s amazing! Not oily or irritating. Smooth and the tint is a great color for my fair skin. SPF 50 is my go to. It’s perfect! But the package sprays out so much product that you’re wasting about half the tube. Love it but won’t re-purchase
