I love the Tatcha Dewy skin cream moisturizer and the accompanying face wash, and have been using them over a year. I decided to spring for the eye cream next. I’m more than halfway through the little jar I am sad to say I am very disappointed. The eye cream feels ok but is very thin, it doesn’t do much to hydrate and I haven’t seen any noticable changes. It’s not thick and creamy like I had expected it to be, which I could live with if the product did what it promises, but it doesn’t. For over $60 for 15ml I expect some kind of result, especially when the other products in this brand work very well. Instead I find myself supplementing with a second eye cream which ends up being a huge waste of money. I won’t be buying this again. I have tried many eye creams and surprisingly the best eye cream I’ve used is CeraVe eye cream which I can get at Walgreens for $18. A high pricetag doesn’t always reflect the quality of a product. This is a case of paying for a name, not quality. Overpriced and disappointing
