So I picked up this product when going to check out at Sephora and I’m really happy that I did. Ladies the one thing I would like to say is making sure that you’re bringing Seltturn over to the lips before using this mask is going to be very helpful. I use the UAE cosmetics lip scrub which is also Emoleet Rich and then I put this cha-cha lip mask on top my lips are super Duper pillow soft I use this all throughout the day and my lips are hydrated and right before bed and it has never been better. I love to wear a matte lipsticks so to have some thing like this to really help my lips to stay without deep lines is a plus.  I highly highly recommend and I understand the price point now because a little bit goes a very long way you can be confident with this product It’s the best
