When I tried the sample in the birthday gift it left my skin feeling supple after washing so I decided to buy the full size. My skin feels drier than it did with the birthday size but I still like the wash & it’s consistency. I have dry skin so I need creamy washes. I like the texture, it’s like a light exfoliant. A little goes a long way. nice texture
