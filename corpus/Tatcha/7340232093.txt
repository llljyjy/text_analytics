I received this and the light cream cleanser as the birthday set from Sephora. I wasn’t sure if I would like it. I have sensitive skin and it gets irritated easily. This moisturizer and the cleanser made my skin feel very soft and it has a very light sent to it. It’s texture is thick but it dries easily and doesn’t leave that greasy feeling and my skin feels like it can breath. I’m already ordering more products. 100% recommend this. nan
