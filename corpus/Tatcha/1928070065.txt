Iâ€™ve had dehydrated skin for months and nothing was working like how I needed. When I tried this I was a little skeptical but from the moment I put it on it felt like a moisturizing gentle hug. My skin has experienced no irritation and the moisture I get is apparent even during the next day. I have tried tatcha water cream and that irritated my skin a little! But this one is so gentle and baller especially for winter. Agreed with other reviews that a little goes a long way! HOLY GRAIL
