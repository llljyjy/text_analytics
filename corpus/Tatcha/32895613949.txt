Got the birthday gift set of this stuff & I love how it looks & feels on my skin, came to the page to buy it but didn’t realize it’d be so pricey that I almost want to give it 3 stars, I’d give it 5 if it was more reasonably priced. Stuff looks, smells & feels great. But definitely overpriced. Good, not worth 60-80 bucks.
