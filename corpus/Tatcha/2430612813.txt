As a person who loves Vitamin C and so does my skin, this did absolutely nothing for me. Only one star because I have to check a star. However, this did not deliver. The Vitamin C did not brighten anything up. The AHA did not exfoliate or change my texture. You can try a cheaper Vitamin C that performs at Sephora. I used it to the last drop with high hopes that I would see some result as other reviewers mentioned. Would never buy this again. Find a better option
