I don’t know if it’s just me but this product is extremely drying and my face is left feeling dehydrated to the point it hurts because of how tight my skin is left after each use. I don’t even use a large amount too… I wanted to love it, I really did and I bought it because of all the great reviews but I guess my face is way drier than normal so I need to buy a cleanser that’s more hydrating. I won’t be repurchasing. I do absolutely love their makeup primer though - now that, I will repurchase. Way too drying for a soft cleanser!
