After picking the Tatcha gift set for my birthday gift I fell head over heels in love with this face wash! I already have a moisturizer that I love and it is actually more expensive than the Tatcha Dewy Cream. I finally got my acne under control otherwise I probably wouldn’t have bought this due to fear of it making my skin worse. I’m glad that isn’t the case though because I’m pretty sure I will be repurchasing this face wash forever! Makes my skin super soft and clean, and doesn’t break me out! It smells like fruit loops to me! While I did receive the birthday set for free I just purchased a full size of the face wash. Love it!
