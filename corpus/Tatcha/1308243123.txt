I agree with all of the good reviews that encouraged me to purchase this product. I haven’t really figured my skin out yet: it gets oily but I think it’s actually dry and i breakout but can’t really figure out why. So, on my skin care journey I bought this when I saw it’s good for people who have clogged pores. I really love it! I bought the blue one and use it about once a week or as needed and my pimples will reduce and I always wake up to glowing skin. I realize it’s pricey but it’s fair to say you can be conservative with it and still get excellent results. nan
