I have literally never left a review on anything, but I felt like I should for this product. First of all, I LOVE the actual product. Would give that five stars. So light and glowy. Doesn’t pill under makeup, actually shields face, and blends into skin perfectly. Now, as for the packaging… what even is this?! I had the same experience as others. It oozes out and continues to ooze out. I thought it may have just been from traveling at different elevations or something, so I put a massive amount on for my first use because I didn’t want to waste this pricey product. Fast forward to the second use, I had another container prepared in case it did it again. It sure did. I immediately squeezed it into a different container to avoid future waste. The first time I held the container, the purple also came off on my hands. It was quite a sight. Trying not to waste the stuff, then trying to get the purple off my hands so I could apply makeup without it getting all over my face and everything else. TATCHA!!! Foe the love of money, FIX. THIS. PACKAGING. nan
