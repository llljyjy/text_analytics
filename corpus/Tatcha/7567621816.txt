If you have oily skin definitely pass. My skin is extremely dry, I rarely ever see oil on my face. I also Donâ€™t have the type of skin to get breakouts or pimples. I am a skin care junkie and With other moisturizers my skin would feel a little better but still a little rough. This is the only moisturizer that leaves my skin actually soft and glowy. Been using this for over 2 years.  It is definitely on the heavier side and I can see why people with oily skin might hate this. If you have normal skin use a small amount. If you have extremely dry skin like me, using more pays off, but still a little goes a long way. I usually Apply a good amount before bed and wake up in the morning with beautiful skin. Keep in mind guys you need to get what works with your skin and companies make different items to suit your needs. Any light moisturizer that has a water base is perfect for oily skin. Any dewy glowy heavy cream is great for dry :) YOU NEED THIS IF YOU HAVE DRY SKIN.
