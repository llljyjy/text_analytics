The best way to say it is that I have repurchased this ever since I started using around 2 years ago. I went through multiples of this cream. I use twice a day and it keeps my skin in a normal level and keeps dry spots away in the summer alone. In the winter I need to add oils serums at night or use a heavier cream. I feel this tightens my pores, doesnâ€™t break me out and is amazing base under makeup although I still like to used primer since I love combining products together. It keeps my skin from getting tight at the end or the day or too oily so it is simply perfect for my skin! nan
