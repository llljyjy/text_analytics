My skin has never loved a moisturizer this much until I started using this Tatcha dewy skin cream. The application glides on as smooth as butter. You only need to use a small amount to nourish your skin. I have tried switching moisturizers because of the price of this one, but other moisturizers didn’t leave my face as hydrated as tatcha’s; With other brands, my skin felt bumpy and flakey, but with tatcha, it becomes so smooth and even!!! This moisturizer has a slight sweet fragrance, I highly recommend it for people who normally dislike products with fragrance, it just leaves you smelling fresh, yet it is not overpowering what so ever. The price is quite shocking but it is well worth it since you only need to use a small amount to cover your face, it can last for up to 5 months with the standard size. My skin is obssessed for this and nothing else
