I’m absolutely in love with the Silk Sunscreen!! I’ve tried many sunscreens and have a few that I love under makeup, but none as much as this one. And this is 50 PA++++, I’m impressed! Yes it’s on the pricier side, but for me so worth it. It’s like magic. Melts into the skin and makeup glides on smooth as butter. My foundation looks flawless!! I have combo to dry skin and with this my skin stays moisturized all day, it does not get that tight feeling many mineral sunscreens can give after wearing all day. Highly recommend! My new holy grail SPF. Best SPF Under Makeup SO WORTH IT!!!
