I didn’t want to like this. I really didn’t want to like this because I just shouldn’t be spending this amount of money. I really hope I can find a dupe because, at least for ME and my specific skin tone, this is the quite literally best mineral sunscreen I have tried and has come the closest to my personal ideal sunscreen type since it also works great for my dryer skin and doesn’t make me itch even a little. It applies so beautifully and the feel when it dries is my ideal balance between matte and moisture. I never have found a personal standout mineral sunscreen in the past and this is the one exception. I think it would be great if they made this in multiple shades because I have a good feeling this tint might not work for everyone, although, it does seem to do a good job dissipating compared to other mineral sunscreen options. Probably best to test it in the store before dropping money on it because it is VERY expansive and might not be worth if the tint doesn’t fit with your skin well. Works for me, but definitely test in store first
