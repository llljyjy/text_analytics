This was gifted to me by Tatcha, but all opinions are my own. I usually only use mineral sunscreens but the problem is that they usually leave a white cast. This one has a little bit of a pinky-beige tint so it doesn’t leave one at all! It’s really lightweight and great for my dry combo, sensitive, acne prone skin (no breakouts!). nan
