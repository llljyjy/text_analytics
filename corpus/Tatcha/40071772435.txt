I recently received the mini version for the birthday gift and let’s just say it did not go as expected. After using it for a few days I began to notice bumps on my nose! send the next morning I noticed acne in between my eyebrows and on my chin… in conclusion I’m very disappointed with this product I think irritation was caused by the fragrance in this product. DO NOT RECCOMEND
