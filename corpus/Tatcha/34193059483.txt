this product was a win-lose situation. i received it as a sample with my points. it’s the best moisturizer i’ve used on my oily skin that hydrates and makes me feel and look dewy and not greasy. HOWEVER i discovered it was the reason why i was having some very deep, painful inflamed pimples come in. i first tried it and after 3-4 days i woke up with 2 nasty pimples and switched to my regular moisturizer. after letting them heal for a while i decided to try it again and test it out. sure enough the next morning i had another deep pimple. as much as i love the hydration, it’s not worth sacrificing my pores. nan
