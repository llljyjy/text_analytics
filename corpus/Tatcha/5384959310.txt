I really love the tatcha products and the way this product sits underneath my make up is great. What is a bummer is the packaging. The product doesn’t seem to want to sit in the bottle and every time I open it the product spills everywhere. It’s a waste of money because the majority of the product ends up on my counter and not on my face nan
