This primer is just alright... It is too expensive for the results you get. It latches onto my dry spots and does nothin to extend how long my makeup looks good. The areas where my skin isn’t dry or oily (as I have very combination skin) the primer does make my foundation look nice, but again, it doesn’t last all day. Too expensive for the results
