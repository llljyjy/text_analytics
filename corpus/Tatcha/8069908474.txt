I received this in a promotional package and I was looking forward to loving it as I’ve heard such great things, but I was left disappointed. I used it first at night and it was fine. Thick and creamy but didn’t actually leave me feeling moisturized. Reapplied in the morning at 8am (did not put makeup on) and it did not sink into my skin until around 3pm. My face felt sticky to the touch and looked greasy. Definitely did not see any plumping or moisturizing results as my skin is still dry to to the touch. Will not purchase Sample
