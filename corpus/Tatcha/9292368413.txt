This mask was gifted by Tatcha and is  the perfect addition to my skincare routine.  I use it a few times a week to exfoliate my skin and it truly reveals radiant skin afterwards. It helps control oils and cleans my pores, which left my face feeling refreshed. The exfoliant is very gentile but does a good job. Helps remove dead skin and leaves my face feeling so soft! I would recommend to anyone looking for a mask that doesnâ€™t have to dry on your face and is gentle on sensitive skin. A Perfect Mask
