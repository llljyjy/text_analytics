I hate how much I love this moisturizer! I have acne-prone skin and have always struggled with hormonal breakouts. I also have dry skin, especially in the winter. I’ve tried countless moisturizers from drugstore to medical grade. And this is the best one I’ve found for my skin. It feels so luxurious I haven’t tried anything that’s like this at all. The texture is so unique: it’s rich enough to moisturize my dry skin, yet it absorbs so easily (which I LOVE because I hate moisturizers that just sit on top of the skin). It’s also super gentle so if my skin is irritated this soothes it. I use this every night and I can’t see myself ever going without it. My skin loves it, my wallet doesn’t!
