Love love love it. It’s jelly-like, and leaves my lips somewhat sticky and very shiny, but it’s my best protection against chapped lips. I use this overnight every night, and whenever I run out of it I get those nasty dry cuts on the corner of my mouth. Absolutely can’t live without. The price point is a bit steep but a little goes a long way. nan
