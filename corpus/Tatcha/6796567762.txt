My skin absolutely loves this cream.  I have dry skin in the winter and my cheeks flake a bit.  This cream solves the issue.  I also noticed softer lines around my eyes and my pores are pretty much invisible(I’m 40yo). I don’t get pilling or oiliness from this and my skin stays hydrated through the day.  I’ve used about 3 samples and saw a difference so I bought the full size container, and won’t be my last for sure.  Give it a try before you buy it.  I def recommend this for dry, ageing skin. miracle in a jar
