Do not bother trying this at all if you have oily/combination skin. That is my skin type and this was just horrible on my face. Did not absorb and felt super sticky. I had to completely wash it off and even under the water it felt waxy. This really is strictly meant for dry to normal skin. if youâ€™re oily/combo, do not bother at all
