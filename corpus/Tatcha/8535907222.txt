I got this as my Birthday Gift option this year along with the cleanser. I’m not someone who cares what the packaging looks like, I’m more concerned with if the product preforms. I hate to say, this is pretty awful. It’s incredibly fragranced, tinted purple (why?) and stays tacky for quite some time. I don’t see any benefit to adding fragrance to skincare. nan
