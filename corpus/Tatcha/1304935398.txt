I have an arsenal of sunscreen: powdered, tinted, mineral, stick you name it. This product is lovely and works well. Makes my skin look glowy and does not burn my sensitive skin. This with my hats in summer does the trick. No white filmâ€™ Will use in winter as well since it adds moisture. Lovely Sunscreen
