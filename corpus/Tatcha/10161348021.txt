I used a tiny bit more than the pea sized amount which, I am assuming,  is why my face felt so extremely greasy. I gave it some time to absorb but in the end I just wanted to wipe it off. If you’re going to spend this much money I recommend Dr Jart instead. The plastic looking container made it feel more cheap, too. First impression was very unimpressed, but note that this is based on my first use. Personally, I don’t think I’ll return to this brand. Greasy feeling
