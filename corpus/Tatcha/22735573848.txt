I made my sister buy this for me since I couldn’t justify buying this without even really hearing about it or trying it. Needless to say, I feel perfectly fine purchasing this product on my own now. It has such a soft feeling and since it is an oil, I always use this before putting in my moisturizer otherwise it’ll have that oily feeling on my face. nan
