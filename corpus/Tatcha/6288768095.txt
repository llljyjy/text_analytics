I received a sample and fell in love with it after 1 use. My makeup applied so smoothly after and reduced the appearance of texture. Even my boyfriend noticed and said my makeup looked really smooth and good and that says a lot. I have only skin and this kept controlled my oils all day and my makeup stayed put for the whole day. Honestly quite impressed now I’m considering buying the full size...unless anyone has a found a dupe for this I’d love to know. Best primer i've used
