my first tatcha product and i am not disappointed :) i’m v simple when it comes to my skincare and i prefer to keep my products as minimalist as possible. this is the only product i use at night (after cleansers ofc) and it is wonderful. my skin is a lot less red and i’ve noticed i’ve been breaking out less, despite my dog always being in my bed. however, it does sometimes feel kind of heavy/oily(?) right after i apply it but that feeling goes away by the morning. i will say that it is pretty expensive but imo, it’s been worth it so far :) worth it !!
