I bought this product in the summer time but was using another lip product for moisture at the time so had only used this maybe once or twice. For the past 2 weeks I’ve been using only this product at night time and OMG it looks like I’ve had a lip job with how much hydration it provides… when I wake up my lips look huge and it pretty much remains that way all day even though I don’t use it during the day. My lips are always super dry and I have never had something work so well. It took a few days for me to notice a difference but it will be a staple moving forward. It seems expensive but you don’t need a lot at all so im okay with the price! nan
