Best moisturizer I have tried in years. Nice light scent not over powering and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. Leaves my skin dewy & soft. Super hydrating and no issues with layering under makeup. The price is a bit high but it’s definitely worth it for me. You get what you pay for and this moisturizer won’t disappoint. Comes with super chic box and spoon for applying. Excellent product. Worth the $$
