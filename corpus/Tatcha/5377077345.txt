Generally speaking I love tatcha products. The cleansing oil and the water cream are part of my regular line up. I have tried this product twice, when it came as part of a set, and both times after a week of use I ended up with dry, flaky skin that resolved after I stopped using it. My skin is typically normal-to-dry but I also live in a very humid climate, so I wouldn’t say dry skin is a major problem for me, but with this product it was noticeable. I couldn’t wear any face makeup for a week or two because it would highlight the flakey spots. It has a lovely smell, and it feels nice, and the light texture seems to vanish when it’s rubbed in (I’m not sure if it provides any exfoliating at all, it’s so fine and disappears so quickly), so two stars for “cosmetic elegance,” but ultimately it is not for me. I really can’t understand how this would be called “hydrating” or described as not “stripping” the skin because neither of those were true for me. Dried me out twice
