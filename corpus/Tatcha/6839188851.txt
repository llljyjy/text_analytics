I love the product which is a rarity for me. I have extremely dry seborrheic dermatitis and this has not caused any flare-ups for me which is unheard of. Though, the packaging felt cheap. The cap broke off which was a nuisance and the product was hard to squeeze out sometimes. But, overall I would recommend this product. Pro- Soft Skin, Con- Cheap Packaging
