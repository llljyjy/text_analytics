I’ve been looking for a really good cleanser for a long time and I finally found it. After once use I saw a difference in skin texture, appearance of pores, and overall brightness. Doesn’t make my skin feel “stripped” or dehydrated. Now that I’ve used it for over a week (in combination with my other skincare products) I can honestly say my skin has never looked better.  Will definitely be repurchasing when I run out. holy grail!
