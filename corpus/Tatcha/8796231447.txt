I rarely write reviews on skincare because of how subjective it can be, but this product is seriously amazing. I have been using it for about 2 weeks now, about 4 times a week and I have never had a product that made such an impact on my skin. I have seen the biggest improvements in my overall skin texture and tone. I was using an exfoliating toner before this that I thought worked fine but this overtakes it, no questions about it. I know the price is quite hefty but I promise you itâ€™s worth it. The only negative I have to say about this product is the smell is a little strong.  Other than that I will be buying this again when it runs out. BUY THIS NOW!
