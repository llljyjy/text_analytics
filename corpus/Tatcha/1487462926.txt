The tatcha blue bottle spf is one of my holy grail products so was elated to try this one especially since it has a thinner texture. I was surprised to find out that it is not certified non-comedogenic by tatcha. Maybe it was a coincidence but I broke out with new pimples every day using this for about a week but it was the only new product added to my routine. The packaging is pretty bad too it spills very easily. I ended up returning bc now I’m trying to fix all the breakouts I have. Again, maybe a coincidence but the fact that it’s not for sure non comedogenic is a big red flag. nan
