Not sure who wrote those 1 star reviews but this is the best cleansing oil I have ever used and I have used all the cleansing oil and balm on the market. I have been double cleansed before the term double cleansed was invented and when Shu Uemura was the only cleansing oil on the market and my mom had to ship to US from Hong Kong. I’ve strayed away from Tatcha’s cleansing oil a few times just cuz I got bored using the same thing everyday but everytime I came running back to Tatcha again and again and again.FYI I have the most sensitive and acne prone skin one could ever have and this does not break me out and in fact I will always break out when I stopped using this. Buy this right now! nan
