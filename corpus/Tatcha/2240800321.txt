Tatcha’s first sunscreen is a HIT! It’s lightly tinted, & luckily doesn’t leave a white cast on darker skin tones. It’s a very light & runny formula, which makes it absorb into the skin quickly! It can pill, so if you’re adding things on top of it, make sure to let it fully absorb before doing so. The packaging is also beautiful & super sleek! The price is a little high, but Tatcha is a more luxury brand, so it’s to be expected. I would definitely recommend this sunscreen to all. *Gifted by Tatcha. Love It!
