It’s a good moisturizer but only if you have extremely dry skin. I have combo-oily skin and I can only use this at night because it’s extremely greasy. I don’t think it’s worth $68 there are definitely way better moisturizers out there. I got this as part of the bday set and will not be repurchasing. nan
