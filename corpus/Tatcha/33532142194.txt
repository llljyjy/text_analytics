I received the mini size in a subscription box and it has lasted me awhile (little over a month). At it’s price point I was expecting a lot more, but I honestly don’t see much of a positive difference. *I have pretty normal skin that can get dry patches if my eczema is flaring up or if it’s cold outside but I also lean combo in the summer.* I tried to use only the dewy skin cream twice a day (with cleansing and toning) but I found it was too drying to use at night so I opted to use it during the day with a heavier cream at night because it was causing my skin to peel around my nose and forehead, as well as cause more dryness overall. I only got one or two pimples while using this, but that may have been for hormonal reasons. The most effective way to apply this (for me) was by cleansing and toning, then waiting a few minutes and wetting my hands with water to apply about a dime sized amount to my face by pressing it in. That was the only way I could actually get this to sink in, probably from the HA in it. I really can’t justify the price point but I feel this product may be much better for people with very oily/combo skin, and there is a light citrusy fragrance but nothing overpowering so if you’re sensitive to fragrance it’s not too heavy especially if you like citrus scents like me (lol). Overall, not my cup of tea. Meh For My Normal/Dry-Combo Skin
