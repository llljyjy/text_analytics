I was impressed with this primer. It is non-greasy, smooths my skin, makes foundation go on like a breeze and doesn’t dry out. I can’t use the Tatcha primer in the compact. I have dry skin so this liquid primer is much better. I have been using Lilah B. oil primer which keeps my skin moisturized but it is nice to have a primer that I don’t have to mix with my makeup to get the two of them to go on smoothly. Also it takes a bit for the oil to soak in. I read this has silicone but with my dry skin it helps keep the moisture in and I normally have to add the oil to makeup to keep it from chalking, etc. but with Tatcha liquid primer I can just put the foundation on without the oils. I did not use this extensively so I can not say how my skin would react after couple of months of use. Seems like a Wonder
