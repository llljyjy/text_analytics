My skin feels so good and soft since using the Dewy Skin Cream Plumping & Hydrating Moisturizer.   I have tried different moisturizers over the past couple years with never results like this as I would have irritation as the different lines would be either too rich, have properties that would cause breakouts or even worse dry my skin out even more.   My skin has changed in the past five years from oily combination screen to dry rosacea break outs and some fine lines. I tried the cleanser from this line with the combination of this moisturizer but found the cleanser stripped moisturizer from my skin so for me it was not a good combination.  My skin was just ok but didn’t feel great and felt dry.   I really loved this moisturizer though and knew there must be a cleanser  that is milder but yet soothing for my acne rosacea skin that would be complimentary with this moisturizer.  I lucked out as after experimenting using  CeraVe SA cleanser and the Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream moisturizer found it was a winning combination. Must be the ceramides & salicylic acid in the cleanser that keeps the skin blemish free. The Tatcha moisturizer works beautifully after I cleanse my skin as it gives the bonus moisturizing plumping properties. My husband complimented my skin and and that made me feel so good that it is noticeable.  I’m happy as my skin feels healthy and youthful again. My skin feels so soft and youthful
