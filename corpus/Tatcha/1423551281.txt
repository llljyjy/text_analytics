By far the best sunscreen I have ever used. I don’t feel like my skin has a cake on it. Doesn’t leave me a white cast while blending in so easily. Even keeps my skin hydrated through the day with reapplication. Con - does have a light doughy smell but barely noticeable. In the image the sunscreen is on my left hand versus nothing on my right.
