It’s very fluid and has a nice feeling on the skin with no white cast. The color is like a somewhat peach skin color that blends out very good. It pretty good for a physical barrier sunscreen. Seems hydrating after applying. I’m not sure how it will hold up to day to day use, I do have dry sensitive skin so I’ll update if I have any problems with sensitivity or dryness. My issue is the price and the amount you get for the price. Whiles it’s a good sunscreen it’s still not that much better than other more affordable sunscreen. I think if you got a little bit more for you money I would of given a better rating but $60 for such a small amount doesn’t seem right. I don’t have an issue paying for good quality skin care but at some point it’s just not worth it. Also it’s hard to find an honest review because everything is “incentivized”. nan
