i wanna start this review by saying i love tatcha, im a huge fan of the dewy skin cream and their rice polishes, i was really excited to try this product because of the amazing reviews so i went ahead and bought it, i gave this product a good try i made sure to finish the jar before writing this review, for my nightcream i like a really thick moisturizer so i use creme de la mer and that’s just an amazing night cream, however for the day time i wanted something more lightweight as i was using the dewy skin cream and that worked amazing but i wanted something lighter so i tried this,  it’s just not moisturizing enough, i like that it adsobs quickly but that’s about all it does since my skin feels dry after a few minutes and i found my self having to re apply more moisturizer which is something i never do, if you have dry skin this just simply isn’t for you, going back to the dewy skin cream for my day cream not moisturizing enough
