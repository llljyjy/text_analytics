Let me preface by saying I’ve tried countless lip masks and lip balms. I live somewhere that gets super cold in the winter so the heat blowing in my house is a daily thing. Without a nightly lip mask my lips become a cracked painful mess. Many masks have a tendency to absorb or dry down too quickly for my liking and don’t actually keep my lips protected through the night.Out of all the masks I’ve tried from Laneige, the new Fenty Lip Mask, lip oils and balms, this one has felt the most protective and long lasting. I’ll put this one on and I’ll wake up the next morning not only feeling moisturized and soft but I can still feel some of the mask ontop of my lips!! I’m super impressed.My only con is it feels a bit messier than something like laneige. But once you get everything on you’re good to go. THE best lip mask!
