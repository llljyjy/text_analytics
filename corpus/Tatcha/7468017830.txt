This is by far the best sunscreen I have ever used. It is so lightweight and watery, and blends into the skin effortlessly. It doesnt leave any sort of white cast and has a perfect natural, yet slightly luminous looking finish. I am more combo oily in the summer and I have had zero issues with this causing breakouts or being too greasy or heavy. Another huge selling point is it layers well as the last step of my skincare routine with or without makeup. I actually prefer how my skin tints and foundations look on my skin using this as a primer vs my actual primers. If I am wearing makeup over this, its not cakey, doesnt seperate, and lasts all day. It is pricey but its worth every penny - best face sunscreen Ive tried to date. It doesnt feel or look like sunscreen on the skin, has skin benefits of its own, and works well as a makeup primer. Give this a try! nan
