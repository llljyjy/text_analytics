I got a one use sample of this product and thought I was obsessed so I purchased the travel size (which is basically maybe 3-4 uses worth) still thinking I loved it. I ended up purchasing the largest size and after a month or two of using I noticed my makeup at the end of my 8 hr work day was off in patches (my chin, around the nose and forehead especially) and I couldn’t figured out why. I stopped using this primer and instantly my makeup was waaay better. I think it’s just too slippery if you wear makeup. It might be nice for a no makeup day but otherwise it didn’t work for me. I was sad because I wanted to love it so bad!!! nan
