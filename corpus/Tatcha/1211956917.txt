I LOVE the formula. No white cast, dries down nicely under make up, high spf. But the packaging is AWFUL. It’s been peeling and flaking all over my make up drawer and all over my hands any time I use it. It’s enough to make me not repurchase. I’ve considered re-bottling it, it’s that bad. great formula, terrible package
