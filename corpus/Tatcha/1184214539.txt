Good product formulation - horrible packaging that peels off and ends up on hands/face. I won’t be rebuying this again.. There are superior or equally as good sunscreens out there at a much cheaper price with better packaging. I bought this due to hype of the formulation online. Funny how many people who promoted this product didn’t mention how bad the packaging was. Most likely because they were paid promotions which again I’ve fallen sucker too. :/ Good product formulation - horrible packaging
