Y’all, this is a really good sunscreen! It’s fairly light weight and hasn’t triggered any breakouts on my acne prone skin. I can detect a slight film on my skin after I apply it but I am quite oily so I don’t see that being an issue for normal to dry folks (the finish reminds me of the LRP Shaka Fluid). It has a slight tint to it but I don’t notice any coverage from it. Overall, its a great formula and it even reapplies beautifully. My only complaint is the fact that the packaging has started flaking horribly. I end up with little purple bits on my face after application. I expected better packaging for the price. Not a deal breaker, but definitely annoying. Really good, but...
