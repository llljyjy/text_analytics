It does feel like its moisturizing, but thats the dimethicone. it forms a barrier that sits on the skin which is fine. that barrier helps seal in your serums so they work better. But I wasnt floored by the results for the price. Im also a big “clean ingredients “ person, and shame on me for not checking, the PEGs are a HUGE NO for me. I returned it (thank you sephora for your return policy.) I decided to pick up The Ordinary hyaluronic + B serum and was ecstatic with the results. Same moisturizing effects and barrier to allow other serums to work that come before (i like to layer serums) and a simple clean inexpensive moisturizer on top make for incredible results. and TO was all of 8 bucks and not 80 for Tatcha. Bonus: the tachta was a 5 on EWG and TO serum was only 1. Not for me
