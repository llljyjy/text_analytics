I have used many of Tatcha products and always impressed! Mostly I have  used the oil Cleanser. But for some reason it is not easy to get now so I bought the Tatcha Rice Wash Cleanser. This cleanser goes on as a thick paste until I blend with water all over my face. It seems to exfoliate as well as cleanses. Lately, I have been double cleansing once with the Rice Wash and then the oil cleanser. Double cleansing with these 2 cleansers allows the serum and creams I use in the morning and at bedtime to immediately soak into my skin more quickly than with only the one cleanser. I love Tatcha products!!
