While living in Houston , I’m always looking for a good sunscreen for my pale skin, because we need it all year long. I received it complimentary from Tatcha, and already love it. This sunscreen is smells good (I’m scent sensitive so can’t use some of them), really easy to apply, and also makes my skin smooth. The bottle is the perfect size for carrying in small bags or even pockets. My new favorite to go sunscreen.
