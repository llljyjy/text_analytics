This cleanser is really strange. I received it as my birthday gift. It’s very thick and once you mix it with water and apply it and rinse it off, it leaves some kind of “film” on your skin. I don’t wear makeup so the only thing this product had to go though was my daily moisturizer (no other serums or anything). My face did not feel clean even after massaging the product thoroughly for two minutes or so. HOWEVER THE FRAGRANCE IN THIS PRODUCT IS HORRIBLE. I don’t understand why there has to be a fragrance added to skin care (hello irritation!) in the first place and let alone a product that washes off your face. The smell is very synthetic/artificial and very strong. HOW IS THIS PRODUCT LABELED “CLEAN AT SEPHORA” when the ingredients are clearly NOT CLEAN ?! NOT A “CLEAN” PRODUCT
