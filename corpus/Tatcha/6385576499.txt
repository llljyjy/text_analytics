Pros: - Keeps my lips plump and pillowy throughout the day.  The hydration it provides has also helped my natural lip color shine through so I don’t need lipstick on my casual days.- The texture is super luxurious! About halfway between an oil based gel and a light, hydrating, water cream, and so very very smooth.  Its sticky enough to stay on your lips without being tacky or making my hair stick to my lips. I love the way it feels on my lips and actually look forward to putting it on!- A little goes a LONG way.  I find that the gold applicator is best dipped in rather than used as a scoop, since a scoop is way too much for my decently large lips. I’ve been using mine for about a month now (probably once every couple days on average) and have barely made the slightest dent.Cons:- This is very much a night time treatment, the treatment sits on top of your lips and absorbs slowly, so I would not recommend eating or drinking (or kissing) soon after putting this on. It’s also not a product for stomach sleepers.  That being said, I’ve found that even if I accidently rub it off within 15 min of putting it on, what is left on my lips has been sufficient to give me a pretty good hydration boost!
