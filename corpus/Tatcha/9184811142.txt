I loved the gentle, warm sensation that I felt upon massaging the mask onto my skin onto my skin. The mask has a light, natural fragrance. What I enjoyed most was how soft and bright my skin looked after using the mask the firsttime. I also noticed that my skin didnâ€™t feel like itrequired much moisturizer afterwards. 10/10 product.this was gifted by tatcha but i will be purchasing itonce this runs out. nan
