i will literally use this face wash until the day i die or god forbid that stop making it. so gentle, so soothing. feels amazing and lightly exfoliating. i havenâ€™t strayed from this face wash for the past 2 years, it really is my holy grail. love the natural citrusy scent. i even convinced my husband to start using it! nan
