this one gets a star because it doesn’t leave a whitecast! other than that though this is terrible. It feels so greasy and thick when I apply it on my face, and it doesn’t dry down unless I use powder. the glow is very pretty, but there are a lot of other SPFs under $20 that do the same thing. Without the heaviness, stickiness, and greasiness. not it
