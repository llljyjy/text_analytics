My sister swears by this. She said she only needs the tiniest amount and it instantly moisturizes her skin and even lips. She said it instantly made all of her wrinkles disappear. I’m 36 & she’s 38. I found it didn’t moisturize my skin at all, only seemed to smooth over the dryness, accentuating my wrinkles as I wore makeup during the day. I noticed my t-zone get greasier than usual also. When I went to look at the ingredients I noticed that it’s oil free and full of dimethicone (on the ingredient label 3 different times). Dimethicone is a type of silicone also used in hair smoothing products. It coats the hair or skin, giving it a smooth feeling texture, but doesn’t not actually hydrate. This made perfect sense why it felt the way that it did on my skin. I prefer Biossance. I have many of their products and love to slather their oils and natural moisturizers, serums and creams all over my face! I also love Evan Healy pomegranate repair serum/oil. Full of dimethicone—didn’t moisturize my skin
