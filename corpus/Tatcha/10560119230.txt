Definitely the best cleanser for sensitive skin. It cleans and very gently exfoliates. I use it everyday and it really takes care of removing all the makeup and hydrating my skin. I use half of a dime size, massage into my face, emulsify with a bit of water and then rinse it off. Tacha products are not cheap but so worth it! nan
