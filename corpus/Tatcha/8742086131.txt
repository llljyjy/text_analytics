This is my first time ever using and splurging on any Tatcha product, in exception of the Dewy Skin Mist. Yet I am completely in love! The ingredients are beautiful and clean (I am quite the stickler), it is very thick and leaves my skin very dewy and moisturized throughout the night, and the fragrance is very light and I can only compare it to a “tea-like“ scent. If you are looking for a moisturizer that is heavy, hydrating, and you’re down to spend the money on one...this is it. I have dry/combo skin so putting this on, and layering with a serum, works wonders on my skin and leaves it soft and is great if you’re a skincare guru like me. Worth the Splurge...Just get it
