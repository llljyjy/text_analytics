I bought this after reading rave reviews about it on Reddit and thought, here’s something to add moisture and tint to my lips during the day! I own and like the Laneige lip masks but I have very pale lips so I look dead with colorless lipbalm on. Enters Tatcha Plum Blossom. When I first received it, I realized how tiny it is! It contains only 9 g but the cream looks denser than that of Laneige just by comparing the jars side by side, which means we get even less product per volume than Laneige. The Tatcha mask has a bunch of empty space in the bottom of the jar. I put the first picture for size reference because I got tiny hands and this lip mask looks like a sample in my hands. Speaking of the jar, since it’s clear, once you run out of the balm, the pretty pink color is going to disappear too, because I scoop from the borders and I can see the jar itself isn’t tinted. Let’s talk about that spatula, oh, my gosh. It’s two pieces of cheap gold-painted plastic sticks glued together. The image online looks way better than in real life. Also, this costs like 20% more than the Laneige one, but they didn’t think of adding a sleeve for the applicator. It just gathers dust and germs when I’m not using it. Since they didn’t add a tiny hook for your applicator, I decided to stick it to the top of the lid like the Tatcha creams with some masking tape. The mask itself performs very similarly to Laneige lip masks, and the tint is actually quite appealing. That’s the one thing that’s stopping me from return it right now. However, since I own and love Laneige Gummy Bear lip mask and that one also has a visible tint on me, I’m pretty sure Tatcha doesn’t have a place in my routine. Overall, underwhelming and I’m considering returning it. If it wasn’t for the sale I would never have bought this in the first place. Underwhelmed, works fine, but...
