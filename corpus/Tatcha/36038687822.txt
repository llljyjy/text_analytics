This didn’t live up to the hype for me. It does feel nice when first applied and my makeup looked good over it at first, but each time I’ve used it, I’ve had a painful zit pop up somewhere on my face during the day. And after about an hour, my makeup starts getting patchy and moving around my face, and oil breaks through. I’m still experimenting with different combinations of moisturizer, SPF, primer, and foundation (and different application timing and methods), so maybe I just haven’t hit the magic combo yet. And maybe it’s just my skin. It isn’t worse than other primers I’ve used, but at this price, I don’t like it enough to buy a full-size when I finish this one. Just OK
