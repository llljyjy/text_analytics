Received this product as bday gift from Sephora and was excited to try it.  It’s quite heavy so works best for me as a night cream. The texture is amazing and luxurious, a little does go a long way and there are no harsh scents. The dewy finish is likely because it tends to sit on the surface of the skin and never fully absorb, leaving an almost sticky feeling.  The biggest disappointment is the cost.  I don’t mind spending a bit more for a good product but this is way over-priced. Was prepared to luv it
