I wanted to love this product due to my sensitive skin but sadly, this will be going back. After trying this for a week, my skin was noticeably drier the following morning after applying the prior evening. this moisturizer simply “moisturized“ - it did not hydrate my skin. also, I wish this product didn’t contain nearly as many silicones as it does but had more proper hydrating ingredients (which is likely one of the leading factors to the lack of hydration I experienced). moisturizing but not hydrating
