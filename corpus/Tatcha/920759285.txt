The product itself is fine. Doesnâ€™t feel sticky or oily and has a very light tint which blends in well. The issue I have is with the packaging! Every time I open the bottle an excessive amount of product oozes out even when the bottle is upright? Why does this happen? I feel like I am wasting so much product with every use and this is not a cheap SPF. Unless improvements are made to the bottle unfortunately I cannot recommend this product. terrible packaging
