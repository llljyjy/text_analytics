I love these sheets! My skin type is normal to dry, depending on the weather and what kind of moisturizer I have on, so one sheet usually works for my whole face. I think if you have oilier skin, you might need to use more than one sheet. For $12, I feel like there should be 50 sheets per packet, not 40. I get this is more of a luxury brand but blotting sheets shouldnâ€™t be crazy expensive, just my opinion. does the job
