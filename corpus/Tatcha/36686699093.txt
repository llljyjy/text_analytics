This is definitely one of the best face washes for oily skin. It leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh. Doesn’t make my skin breakout so that’s definitely a huge plus. At first I was worried about the harsh grains in it, but they’re actually pretty good to lightly exfoliate your face. The only downside is the price, but imo it’s worth it especially if you have breakout prone oily skin Good for oily skin
