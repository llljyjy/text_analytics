I’ve tried Tatcha cleansers before (the camellia cleansing oil, which I absolutely love) but this was an absolute let down. I have dry/combo skin that rarely breaks out and the scent and texture of this cleanser made my skin feel itchy and red. I couldn’t wait to wake up the next morning to wash my face and use my regular gentle cleansing bar to soothe my skin. Will definitely not recommend to anyone especially if they have dry sensitive skin! Scented & Abrasive for dry/sensitive skin
