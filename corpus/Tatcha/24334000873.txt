Iâ€™m not sure what ingredient could be causing this reaction, but my skin can not tolerate it. I used the sample size. It feels great during the cleansing process and I do enjoy the scent. Just moments after cleansing, I notice a burning, itchy , tightness in my skin followed by microscopic size bumps. So sad, the product has the right look, feel, and texture but my skin does not like it. Mixed Feelings
