I have super oily skin and this moisturier goes on like water, but in the best way. It’s super hydrating without being oily and does not cause break outs.It smells great and a little goes a long way. It’s pricey and I don’t know if it’s truly worth the price, but It’s one of two moisturizers that i swear by. I also love Bliss Drench to Quench and it’s a steal, but I like Tatcha just a bit more soi splurge. Great for Oily skin
