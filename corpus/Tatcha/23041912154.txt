I bought this as a treat for myself, and the truth is, the luxury of this product is in the brand. It’s expensive because it’s Tatcha, not necessarily because the lip mask formula works any better than the Burts Bees overnight lip mask (which I also love!). This is a squeeze-tube jelly formula in a fancy pot with wand applicator - and it’s lovely! Gift quality. The mask is nice, hydrating, and I still had a wee bit on my lips after waking up in the morning. It doesn’t take too much product, so it’ll last a while. But, unless you’re looking to really treat yourself, there are other brands at 1/3rd of the price that work equally as well. nan
