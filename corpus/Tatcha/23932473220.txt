I have been using the Tatcha Silk Sunscreen and It’s already a new favorite. I get sun protection without the bad aspects of standard sunscreen. This goes on so smooth and absorbs into my skin quickly. This product actually contains hydrolyzed silk! It is lightweight and doesn’t feel at all heavy on my face. My skin feels smoother and looks glowy due to the nice tint it has. Highly recommend. nan
