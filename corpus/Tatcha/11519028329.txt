I have used the trail size moisturizer several times, I have always been pleased with this product. I have finally broken down and purchased the full size this time. This moisturizer is very hydrating for dry skin and non-reactive to my sensitive skin. Trust me I have tried many!!!Love this product for my skin type (Very sensitive and dry) Love this moisturizer
