I really love the actual sunscreen, so much so that I repurchased. I don’t wear foundation but mix this with a few drops of the Colorscience bronzer to get an all over glow. It doesn’t make me greasy or break me out. For days where I want to have more of a “makeup” look, it’s worked well with every cream and powder I’ve tried. The consistency is very watery, which I think makes it easier to work into my skin. I’ve spent full days outside in the AZ sun and haven’t burned yet!Minus one star for the packaging, because it really sucks, as other reviewers have noted. The purple stuff peels right off and looks like big chunky glitter on your face. My current solution is to wrap it in a tissue and that really helped. great product, terrible packaging
