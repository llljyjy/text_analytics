To be honest, it’s quite expensive and the product feels like a film on the skin. Even when I wake up it hasn’t absorbed and I feel the need to wash it off before putting on makeup. I can’t even tell a difference in my skin after using it for months. There isn’t that much product in the jar too, it is lasting long because I don’t want to use it often. Not buying again. Goodbye, see you never.
