I bought this with my own money. Wish it wasn’t my new favorite -because it’s $$$$. But it’s a mineral sunscreen with many antioxidants. More importantly there’s no alcohol, fragrance or fragrant oils which are extremely irritating. I’m also really happy about the SPF 50.  SPF 30 isn’t enough for me. This looks great under makeup. No pilling, no greasy shine, no irritation. SPF is really important. Everyday. nan
