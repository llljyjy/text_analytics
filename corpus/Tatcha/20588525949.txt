There’s so many things I like about this night cream. For starters it doesn’t feel thick or extra creamy (heavy) but it stays on like one. I wake up & my skin feels as though it still hasn’t fully absorbed it. Which is FANTASTIC because that means my skin was protected all night. I have one cheek that’s red, rough & dry mostly & this helps significantly. glorious
