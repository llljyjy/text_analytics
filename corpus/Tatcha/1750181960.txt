I have tried many, (seriously) many, facial washes....from high priced, prestige lines to vegan, to back to basic brands.  Without question, this wash is the b-e-s-t!  It thoroughly cleanses away the days makeup (even eye makeup).  I have dry/aged skin and the Rice Wash leaves my face feeling soft, clean and ready to prep my skin for my serums & moisturizer. BEST EVER FACE WASH
