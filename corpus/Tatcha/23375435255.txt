Sad to see all the negative reviews of this moisturizer.  This is the best cream I’ve ever used. It’s aided me in getting my glass skin and keeps me from being a dry horrible mess. I have noticed less wrinkles and can feel the plumpness on my skin due to how much it hydrates me. She is a staple for me and I honestly cannot see myself deviating and trying another product.   This product is what my skin has been looking for! Been using for 4 months, never using anything else
