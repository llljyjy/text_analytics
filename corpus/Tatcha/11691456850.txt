I’ve been eyeing this product for a while and finally purchased. And I love it. I love the way it feels on my skin, it’s very light and lovely. I purchased without reading these reviews. I noticed though, when I used it, the sunscreen would keep oozing out of the. container and run down the sides. It was really messy and very unappealing. I came here to see the reviews to see if anyone else had the issue and yes they did! The container for this sunscreen is pretty but TERRIBLE functionality. Tatcha, please read this. I love your products. But fix this purple sunscreen bottle. It’s BAD. Great product but absolutely terrible container
