I got this for the birthday gift. I went away and forgot my face oil and cream. I used this and was blown away !!! My face felt wonderful. when I put foundation, it made my ski. look wonderful. Even without using oil,y skin was so soft. I have dry mature skin and normally my face feels tight and very dry. This cream is fantastic. I’m not sure that a much younger person with oily skin would like it but if you have dry skin you will adore this. I better get more. I couldn’t stand to be without it now. Amazing
