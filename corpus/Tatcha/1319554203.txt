I’ve tried a lot of cleansing oils.  Most are too heavy and leave an oily film after rinsing.  The two I like best are this one, Tacha’s, and DHC’s.  This one is based on camellia oil.  It smells great and dissolves makeup easily.  It rinses well, leaving my skin feel soft and moisturized but clean.  DHC’s is good too. It smells like olive oil and cleans and rinses off just as well.  However, it doesn’t leave my skin feeling as moisturized.  Of the two, Tatcha’s works best for me. Best Oil Cleanser for Me
