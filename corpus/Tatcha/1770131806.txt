It’s a very fine and gentle polishing powder.No tightening or dry feeling. It felt like the luxury version of DHC’S Face Wash Powder with a bit more of deep clean and a better smell. Love the old bottle design, loathe the current bottle design. It felt light and cheap. Love the powder, dislike the cheap looking jar
