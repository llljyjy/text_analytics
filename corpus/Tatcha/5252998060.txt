My long and frustrating search for the perfect mineral sunscreen is finally over!!! This is my holy grail, absolute perfection. I have acne-prone, sensitive, and combo skin that gets very oily in the T-zone. I prefer mineral sunscreen for that reason and let me tell you I was about to give up on finding the one. Everything I’ve tried was too greasy, left a white cast or pilled. This tatcha sunscreen is the only one that hits all the marks. If I could only keep one thing from my entire skin care collection it would be this product.But PLEASE PLEASE change the packaging!! I’m begging. The purple coating flakes off and sticks to my fingers and it transfers to my face and it’s hard to get off too. The packaging doesn’t match the price tag but that’s my only complaint. HOLY GRAIL PRODUCT
