This product is amazing. I’ve been using tatcha primer and I fell in love with that, and then I tried the rice wash and I love that. I decided to try this dewy cream after using the belief moisturizing bomb for a couple years and it is not nearly as moisturizing as this cream is. If you already have a normal/combination skin this is not for you! As someone with super dry skin I want to feel greasy and I want the moisturizer to be thick that’s the only thing that helps me. Love it!
