Love this Tatcha product! I’ve used the Water Cream too but it wasn’t hydrating enough for my combination skin on days where I use AHAs or acne treatments. This was the perfect cream to top off my PM routine and it even works for some light gua sha movement cause it’s so oily when applied but it absorbs into the skin nicely. Great for dry skin and hydration
