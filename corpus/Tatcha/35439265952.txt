At nearly $25 a pop for 0.68 fl oz (20ml) this is one of the more pricier masks (of many) I’ve tried this past year, but in terms of serum amount per sachet - definitely one of the most generous! This mask is now known as ’’Luminous Hydrating Lifting Mask’ with a slight tweak in ingredients but works the same as the previous version which I also tried a while back. Like all sheet masks I found this a bit tricky to apply although once in place it didn’t shift. Instructions say 15 minutes but knowing there’s nothing in the ingredients list that would cause any adverse issues, I decided to leave it on for double that time. ’Luminous’ and ’dewy’ is exactly what my face was, once I removed the mask and massaged the excess serum into my face, neck and hands - would be a shame not to! No moisturizer was needed after this and even by the next morning my skin was still feeling hydrated and looking fresh. Was slightly concerned about the ’tingle’ that other reviewers online have mentioned, but luckily I didn’t experience that. This does leave your skin tacky and lightly congeals on brows and hair if you apply aimlessly and leave on for as long as I did. Definitely best to use on an evening or right before bed when you can let it work its magic and not have to worry about going out with bits of serum stuck in your hair! ~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~(My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)1.
