The consistency of this sunscreen is really nice.  It’s light, it’s slightly tinted, it’s super smooth and leaves a nice dewy finish.  The packaging is the death-nail.  As others have mentioned, the container flakes horribly, especially if you’re someone who travels a lot and throws this in your cosmetics case.  It scratches off and leaves silver bits everywhere, including all over your hands and face when you go to apply it.  Because you have to tip it upside down to dispense, and because the liquid is so viscous, it flows very freely and gets into the cap which then drips all over.  It’s a shame because I do like the formulation and the active ingredients and it’s hard to find a 50 SPF that feels so lightweight but delivers an efficacious result.  That said, the packaging flaws are significant and are a gating factor to repurchase. I would rate this a 6/10
