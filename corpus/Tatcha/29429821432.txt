I just purchased this for a second time and absolutely love it. My skin has been so dry and flakey (especially my nose) since moving to Colorado and this has been a savior. I use it before bed, before my sleeping mask. I also use it before putting on makeup. Leaves me with soft and plump skin that I have to force myself not to touch every 5 min. The little spatula on top is pretty cute too! Very hydrating
