A MUST for tretinoin users, especially for percentage increase. The corners and under eyes, corners of my mouth, and around the nose used to get really irritated from tretinoin (even though I avoided those areas when applying). I started using this sick morning and night and havenâ€™t had irritation since. This even improved the texture under my eyes. works well under concealer too! nan
