I just switched out all my other sunscreens for this one. My packaging is still intact, but I understand others frustration with package integrity considering the price of this product. Formula aside, as a woman of color, this sunscreen applies beautifully, seamlessly, and is undetectable on my skin. Pairs well and does not pill with my skincare (which has ALWAYS happened with others) and it enhances the look of my makeup when I wear it. I have been using this everyday since I got it and I’m very much obsessed. I hate to say it is well worth the price tag and will be my only sunscreen I use. It’s just that quality that is unmatched although we all wish it didn’t have to be so pricey. Best Sunscreen I’ve Used
