Didn’t think I’ll love this lip mask so much when I got it on the holiday set. It’s a jelly like consistency which leaves my lips very hydrated in the morning after waking up. I have get skin flaking around my lip area Ana no other product worked, and I’ve tried almost all of the ones available on Sephora. It’s a bit on the pricy side so I’m on the lookout for a cheaper dupe. But until then I’m gonna keep on purchasing this one GET IT!!
