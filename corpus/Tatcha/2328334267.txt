Received this product as a birthday gift and I absolutely love it. I have dry skin, and over the years it’s started getting flaky around my mouth. Now after giving birth, it’s like it’s spread to my whole face. This product doesn’t exactly fix the problem, but my skin definitely feels hydrated and doesn’t look flaky at all during the day after a morning wash and moisturizer. Loved it so much I instantly bought the full size! great for flaky skin
