Love using this sunscreen with Tatcha the liquid silk primer. Truly a match made in heaven.  The only issue is I have to pick off small particles of plastic from my face that manage to come off the sunscreens package during application.. I think the outer packaging is sensitive to ingredients and/or humidity. For $60.00 this can definitely be improved. The sunscreen itself is amazing! . Has excellent ingredients such as Niacinamide , Hyaluronic acid, SPF 50 , 10% Zinc Oxide, Amino acids, and more.. this apply’s very sheer so you don’t have to worry about a white cast. Feels great on my skin. Highly Recommend. Excellent when used with Liquid Silk Primer …
