As a 55 year old physician,  I understand belatedly the importance of daily sunscreen. It seems as if I have truly tried them all trying to find one that doesn’t leave a white cast, doesn’t irritate my increasingly sensitive skin (acne prone, even at my old age), doesn’t look greasy, and applies well under makeup. Since purchasing a month ago, I reach for it nearly every day, despite having 10+ other high end sunscreens on my shelf. Even in Mexico it kept my face from burning or tanning. I didn’t love the prior sunscreen from Tatcha but this one is amazing. Best sunscreen yet!
