This is my HG cream. It is extremely moisturizing for the dry climate I live in (and I have fairly mature skin). It feels great going on - very emollient - and then is quickly absorbed by my skin, leaving a soft and silky texture, not sticky, slimy, or oily. I have tried a few products and nothing else so far comes close. HG moisturizer (dry climate, mature/normal skin)
