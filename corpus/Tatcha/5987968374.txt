I have been using this sunscreen for months and can confidently say that this is the most beautiful and cosmetically elegant mineral sunscreen I have ever used! The pink-beige tint works well with my very fair skin tone. I usually have issues with tinted sunscreens being too dark or warm on my fair skin. This sunscreen blurs imperfections and the finish is satin with a slight glow on my dry skin. No coverage, but helps even out redness. Due to the runny consistency, I shake the bottle and dispense directly on my face to isolate a potentially messy situation. I haven’t had issues with the packaging as other reviews. I prefer the original Tatcha sunscreen because I prefer a more satin-natural-matte finish, but this is pretty nice for a mineral sunscreen. I don’t think I will be repurchasing and will stick to the original Tatcha sunscreen.Pros:-Cosmetically elegant for a mineral formula-Blurs imperfections -Pink-beige tint works well with very fair skin-Offers sun protection-Acne-prone skin friendlyCons:-Price-Glowy finish-Accentuates dry patches-Can pill with certain make-up Cosmetically elegant mineral formula
