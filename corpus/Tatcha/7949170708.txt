I always go back to this and the white face polish from this brand. Any other skincare I’ll try new stuff and never really stick with anything. Anytime I try a new moisturizer it just does not compare. I always always always come back to this. God tier. Definitely the item I’d have with me on a desert island. Goes great under make up and does not pill. my desert island staple
