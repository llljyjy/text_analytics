At first my skin needed to get used to it. It got a little bumpy. But that’s often with my skin when trying new products. Then I was going to send it back because I didn’t notice much of a change after a week or 2. Now that it has been a month, I am keeping it. My skin looks so healthy, no bumps and overall better! It’s the first moisturizer to not clog my pores!!! That alone is magical to me. All moisturizers usually clog my pores and make me sweat. Great job Tatcha! Oh and the packaging is gorgeous. worth it!
