Love this moisturizer. I have sensitive skin and there is no irritation. I am in my late 30’s and needed something more thirst quenching for my “not so young skin” anymore. This stuff hydrates very well and a little bit goes a long way. Especially with the applicator tool, it helps to not waste. Well worth the money in my opinion. Love it!!
