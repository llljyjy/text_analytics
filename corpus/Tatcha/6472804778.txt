This moisturizer covers all of the bases in terms of diminishing the signs of anti-aging.  It leaves my skin  soft and hydrated, firm, fine lines and even deeper wrinkles are decreased markedly and areas of discoloration are reduced.  I’ve been using Tatcha’s skincare for 7 years now, and am very pleased with the results.It’s important to purchase the products that are matched with your personal skin type.  If you’re in your 20’s and don’t have any prominent signs of aging OF COURSE you may breakout because this cream is meant for dry, aging skin.  Tatcha has products for every skin type, you just need to use those products that will benefit your own individual skincare needs. My favorite moisturizer
