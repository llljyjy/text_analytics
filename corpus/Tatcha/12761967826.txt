What a great moisturizer ! I have pretty dry skin in the winter and this felt great on my face. It’s a nice thick formula and makes the skin look amazing. I got this as my birthday gift this year and I would repurchase but the price is just too high, that’s the only reason it’s getting a 4 and not a 5! But really a great product nan
