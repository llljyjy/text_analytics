For context - I started working in cosmetics at 19 years old and was quickly introduced to quality skincare products. For ten years, I could not find anything that worked for me despite my willingness to invest the money and all of the research I’d done over the years. I had very dry, patchy skin that is also very prone to breakouts. This moisturizer is the only thing that was able to cure both, while still delivering some preventative benefits for aging. I don’t even know if I can classify my skin as dry, anymore. Am I normal now?! I’ve been using this moisturizer for 3 years and still get excited every time I apply it. cured my bratty skin - thank you Tatcha!
