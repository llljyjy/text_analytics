I recieved a sample packet with my TATCHA birthday gift trio.  Normally I dont use primer...or foundation, concealer, bronzer, or blush.  I usually focus on my eyes and lips.  However I wanted to give this a try and I found that I liked how smooth it applied on my face.  As it states in the name it really does leave your skin feeling like “liquid silk“.  I was so impressed I couldn’t stop rubbing my cheeks.  I would say if you are someone who uses primer on the regular it would be worth your while. Pleasantly Surprised!
