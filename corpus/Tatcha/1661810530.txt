I got the mini. The smell is awful. I put it on my hand and I can’t imagine putting it on my face. There is a purple cast initially but it fades. The texture is nothing special. I wanted to try it because of the high SPF and the additional ingredients. But it’s the first Tatcha product that I do not like. nan
