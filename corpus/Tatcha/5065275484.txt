Not only is the UVB protection great, but the PA rating is incredible. I have dry skin, and even the hydrating/moisturizing mineral sunscreens still dry out my skin by the end of the day. This blends in so effortlessly and looks like I’m wearing nothing! With other tinted mineral sunscreens, it’s obvious that I’m wearing something tinted or gives a foundation look. Not this one, which I really like. It goes on looking dewy but dries down to a very comfortable matte/natural finish that doesn’t dry out my skin. I don’t know how they did it! It definitely blurs the skin too which is a huge plus. I’ve never been so in love with a sunscreen and will continue to repurchase this. HIGHLY recommend!!!! Favorite Mineral Sunscreen Hands Down
