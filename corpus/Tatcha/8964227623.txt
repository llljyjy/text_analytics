I got this a sample for my gift. I use it at night even at summer after cleaning my face. It is a great moisturizer for winter, or if you have dry skin or if you are using retinol. I donâ€™t know if I would buy it again, but Japanese skin care is the best. I use Shiseido a lot too. The purple one is perfect for a very dry skin.
