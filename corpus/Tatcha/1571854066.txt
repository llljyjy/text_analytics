I just received this today, and I love the product, however upon first touching the surface of the cream with the little spoon I heard an audible POP and the surface of the cream dropped by at least a third. It seems there was an air bubble. I’m a little sad to lose so much product as it’s so lovely and quite expensive. Has anyone else had this experience? Air bubble :(
