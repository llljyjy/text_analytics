Love this sunscreen! It’s a beautiful natural finish and feels so great on my skin. The biggest downside for such expensive product is the packaging. In the name of compact packaging, they have created worst one I’ve seen. The product keeps oozing out as soon you open the lid without squeezing the bottle. And the purple packing starts chipping off only after the second use and ends up on your face worst packing, great sunscreen
