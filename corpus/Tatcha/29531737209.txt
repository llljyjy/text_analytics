I received this product complimentary from Tatcha for an honest review. I really really love this mask! I have combination skin that can get pretty oily in certain spots. This mask worked so well at removing excess oil and clearing out my pores, but didn’t leave my skin feeling tight/dry. I love that it is a clean beauty product and the packaging is gorgeous! The mask applied really smoothly and I like the gentle warming feeling. Be sure to read instructions and not leave it on for too long, just like 3-5 min. That’s another great thing, all the great benefits of a clay mask without having to keep it on for so long! nan
