I love it! After being upset about amore pacific changing the formula of their face wash, trying many then being disappointed, I found this and it’s wonderful. Hope they don’t mess with the formula! I use this as a first step and follow up by the Tatcha deep cleanse powder. After whining about amore pacific changing their “perfect“ face wash, I hands down prefer this combo. Thank goodness!
