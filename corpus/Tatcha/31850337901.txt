I love this face wash, lately I’ve hit a patch of extremely oily skin especially around my forehead and I’ve tried everything from online to store bought and everything either built up more oil or scratched my skin off and marked it up, I ordered some things and this was what I chose as a sample,  I was hesitant but tried it and it is literally the only face wash I can use, it gets rid of oil before it comes in without over drying my face or tearing apart my skin! I’ll never go back to cheap face wash!!! Received as a sample and bought full size!
