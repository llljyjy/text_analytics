I patch tested a tiny amount of this on my cheek and woke up to a silver dollar sized red dehydrated splotch with pimples scattered around it where the cream must have migrated overnight. The red spot feels almost like fine grit sandpaper - there is ZERO moisture. It has been four days and seemingly no amount of moisturizer or hydrating masks will bring it back to life. The surrounding bumps have calmed so that is a plus. My skin was in excellent shape before I gave this a try - PLEASE be careful and patch test in a discrete area before using all over your face. Use With Care
