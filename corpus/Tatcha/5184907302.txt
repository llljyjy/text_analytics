This tonic is AMAZING. I donâ€™t know how i lived without it before! First week of using:I replaced my toner with this treatment and applied the product on a cotton pad and followed with my typical routine. After a week of using it, my face was super dry and started getting patchy. I was super confused because I have never been disappointed with Tatcha products before so I decided to change it up.Second week and counting:I decided to go back to using my toner and then using this tonic after applying toner and applying it straight with my hands (no cotton pad) following with my typical routine and after a week of doing this routine I have seen the build up of white heads on my nose area gone! It has gotten rid of my dry patches as well. I use it daily morning and night time and am so impressed. nan
