Everything about this moisturizer is amazing ! The texture, hydration level, and scent is perfect ! I do have acne prone skin , so I was worried it will break me out because of the fragrance , but surprisingly it didn’t ! I will say that if you apply too much , your face will feel too “suffocating”, so a little does go a long way with this moisturizer ! If your like me , and have tried Drunk Elephant Lala retro and that breaks you out , this might be the moisturizer for you ! Much more hydrating also ! Finally!
