I know its a bit pricey, but hear me out. I have extremely dry skin and eczema on my face and this stuff is like a miracle worker. I have tried soooo many products trying to find a dupe for this and literally nothing lives up to it. Also, you get quite a bit in the container and since its only going on your face and neck it will last longer than you think. Your skin is SO important. Its worth paying a little bit more for! LOVE this.
