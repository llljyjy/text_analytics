I like the way my skin feels when I wake up from using this moisturizer, however….it is a bit greasy upon initial application and reminds me of a lighter scented version of Vicks vapor rub (the texture is even similar lol). I received this as a birthday gift so I’ll finish it and see if there are any real results with use, I probably won’t purchase it though just because of the scent. Vicks vapor rub?
