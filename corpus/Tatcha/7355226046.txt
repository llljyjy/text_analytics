I wanna give it a five but the packaging is so awful it makes it not worth the product, I never thought I’d love a product so much but not repurchase because of packaging but this is so awful. It flakes and gets all over my skin and it’s impossible to get off and the product just pours out uncontrollably. Hopefully they fix this. Very bad packaging
