I love this cleanser! Luxurious and spa like. I use this at night to wash the day away. I always look forward to using it. I read on some reviews that it didnâ€™t remove makeup but I have no problem with it removing mine. I go in with a dry cleanse, work it in, then emulsify it with a small bit of water, then rinse. nan
