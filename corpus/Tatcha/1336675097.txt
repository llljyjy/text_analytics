I bought this based on a review in a magazine. I do like that the product doesn’t leave a white sheen on my skin but what a mess! It’s very runny and every time I use it, a portion of this expensive lotion ends up on the bathroom counter and puddled around the top of the bottle. And then, as others have stated, the color on the bottle begins to flake off. I’ve gone to wash my face at the end of the day, and noticed a few of these little silver lavender specs stuck on my cheeks. :-( Messy formula, messy bottle.
