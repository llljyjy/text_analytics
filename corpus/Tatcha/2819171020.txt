This is not worked for me, from the beginning I was applied into my skin I have a feeling slight tingling and soreness and then when I washed the skin after 15minutes of application. The cream was not easy to washed with water and it’s seems like the water textured it’s lingering into skin like oil and it’s makes my skin had a small bumps too. And yes I maybe recommend this products to anyone who have not a hypersensitive skin. Hypoallergenic/sensitive combo dry skin
