First off, i love this product itself but the bottle design is TERRIBLE. All I have to do sometimes is simply take the lid off, and itll start a volcano eruption out the top of the bottle and leak product everywhere! Such a mess and a waste of expensive product. Also, the bottle itself started shedding within a month and gets tiny little purple pieces all over my hands and face when applying product. (See pictures)Terrible, terrible design. Do better Tatcha. Needs new bottle design!!
