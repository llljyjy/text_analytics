I have had combination skin through most of my life, until earlier this year I had my first real eczema break out for the first time. So now that my skin is acne prone and has dry patches here and there, I’ve had to reconsider my skin care routine. I’ve been using dermatologist recommended “CeraVe” face wash and found that it does absolutely nothing to help my face! I got the tag a rice wash skin cleanser and moisturizer mini set as a free Sephora birthday gift and I am SO happy I found this product. I got the full size for both wash and moisturizer and found that the wash moisturizes enough on its own. My skin feels so smooth and my dry patches don’t feel so dry. If you have a similar issue like I have, try this product!! wonderful for eczema skin!
