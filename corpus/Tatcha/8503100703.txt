I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. I’ve been using Tatcha products for a while but have yet to try the texture tonic so I wanted to give this a shot! First of all, I want to say that I have sensitive skin and Tatcha products can be hit or miss with me. I’ve been using this for a few weeks now and have seen some improvement with my skin tone evening out. It also helped remove any excess dirt and make up! I used this twice a week as it is an exfoliator and exfoliating every day can be bad for your skin. It’s a nice refresher every now and then! And a little goes a long way so you can make it last as long as you want! nan
