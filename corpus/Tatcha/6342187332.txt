It has taken me so many years to find a moisturizer that works for my oily complexion. My skin is such that no “mattifying” product would ever truly make my skin matte all day. At best, shine will start poking through my makeup within a couple hours, and at worst my skin looks terribly cakey, especially if I use any setting powder. This moisturizer is not itself a mattifying product, BUT after I started using this moisturizer, somehow miraculously my skin doesn’t look cakey anymore if I use powder! Truly amazing. Goes to show me how “sticky” other moisturizers are, unlike this one. The product also smells and feels amazing on the skin when you put it on, with a very slight cooling sensation. Now that I have tried this moisturizer, I will never go back. 100% recommend to anyone with oily complexion. Worth every penny! Finally, I have found my true match
