I ordered the 82 dollar one, and when I opened it, this is what it looked like, I was disappointed to say the least. It looked brand new, just was never filled. Also the way the jars are made trick the eye until you receive the item, so you are already getting much less product than you originally thought. I feel scammed so I would not buy again. 82 DOLLARS, HALF FULL, DECEIVING JAR AND PHOTOS
