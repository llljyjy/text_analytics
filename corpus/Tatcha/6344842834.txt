Pros: -fantastic formula, absolutely weightless on your skin, smooth, does not pill and is not sticky at all once applied which I love.Cons:-packaging flakes on your hand-sunscreen erupts out of container no matter what method i use to open it. Tapping the base on a counter does not help. Shaking it and letting it settle does not help. Refrigerating the bottle, shaking it up and tapping the bottom on a counter does not help. You have to squeeze the sides aggressively so that sunscreen doesn’t come squirting out of the bottle every time you open it and you can’t let go until you put the cap back on because for some reason it erupts every time. I had to transfer it to a small silicon travel container. Great Product But Defective Flaky Packaging.
