I wanted to love this product. I loved the fragrance!! This should have caused concern for me but again I wanted to love it. After a month of use, my face continually got worse. Small blister like bumps on my t-zone. As soon as I stopped it, my face has cleared up. I went back to my fragrance free organic cleanser. Didn't work well for me!
