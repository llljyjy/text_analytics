This is hands down my favorite moisturizer. I’ve tried sooo many, more expensive ones, drugstore, all of them. And this one takes the cake. It seems expensive, but for the phenomenal and aesthetically pleasing packaging, with the amount that lasts me about 6 months even if I use it everyday, it’s absolutely worth the price. It smells amazing and makes your face look glowy and beautiful. treat yourself, you won’t regret it.
