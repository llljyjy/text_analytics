It’s a nice cleanser. It does what it’s suppose to, but it’s nothing special. It has a soft scent and it feels nice on the skin. It doesn’t foam much if that matters to anyone. It doesn’t dry out your skin and leaves it very soft. It also doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. You also don’t need a lot so it will last pretty long. But there’s some grains in there that doesn’t do anything. I think it might be there for exfoliation, but you don’t need to use enough for that to matter. It’s also very overpriced. I’ve used cheaper moisturizing cleaners that leaves my skin feeling the same way and they also have ingredients good for your skin in there. If you have the money to burn, it’s a good cleanser. Nothing special
