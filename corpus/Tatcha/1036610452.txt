This is by far the best mineral sunscreen I have tried, so light, moisturizing & slightly tinted to avoid a white cast/blurs imperfections. (Mini size is great too, for traveling) Would give it 5 stars,BUT:The coating on bottle is dissolved by product on your fingers and flakes off, often ending up on your face as you apply. It’s awful - bottle either needs to be dyed whatever color, or just white.This does not happen with the cap where the color is in the material, not applied. Have to put tape around bottle to stop the flaking, and will not buy again until this is fixed.Have photos but don’t see a place to upload. TERRIBLE packaging/Excellent product
