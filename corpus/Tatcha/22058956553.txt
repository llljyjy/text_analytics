I would have definitely given this 5 stars- it blends in super well and it makes my skin feel so smooth!! However…if you think the packaging of this product won’t flake, you’re sorely mistaken. It gets ALL over your fingers and it sticks to your hands just by lightly touching the bottle. It’s so annoying to use without getting the packaging to flake off into your hands when you’re just trying to apply product. The experience is definitely too high maintenance, but the product itself is superb. Packaging will give you a hard time
