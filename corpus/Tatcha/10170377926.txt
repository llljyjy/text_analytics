This is hands down the best mineral sunscreen I’ve ever tried. They didn’t go wrong with the name of it, it truly feels like silk and it layers beautifully on the skin leaving my face hydrated, plump, healthy looking with the most luxurious glow from within, no white cast, no sticky feeling. The only downside of course, the price point. It’s an expensive sunscreen but the quality is there. Don’t pay attention to the other reviews about the packaging, I don’t understand what they do or how their bottle peels and gets so messy. Mine still looks like new after 2 months of daily use.
