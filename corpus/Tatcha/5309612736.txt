Just like all skin care products, it’s a trial and error. I personally have had no issues and really love the feel of this product. My skin is beautiful when I wake up, but I assure you less is more with this. Yes it is thicker, so again, trial and error. I never buy a full size product without giving it a with a mini size first. The rice wash is beautiful and I use this moisturizer JUST at night because it is heavier. I’ve purchased cheap a** products off Amazon that have worked great, and I’ve also splurged on brand name products that do nothing for me. I got lucky with this one, but again I get the mini sizes to try first. Cleansing oils/moisturizing oils make me break out, whereas other people love them. I recommend this product and I am a fair, sensitive skinned, freckled ginger. Nice product!
