I got this product in a set for my birthday gift and I hated myself for falling in love with it but it happened. I have very dull/ dry skin and this moisturizer makes my face glow. I like using it after I wash my face at night because it is a little more on the heavy side but not in a bad way. And the smell is very light, clean, and a little bit does go a long way, I love it. nan
