I love the product itself. The way that it provides moisture, blurs skin, and doesn’t have a white cast is unmatched. However, between the terrible packaging and steap price tag, it’s likely that I will not be repurchasing. The bottle is truly terrible with a pearl lavender coating that flakes off everytime you touch the bottle. When you’re done applying your sunscreen, you’re left with lakes from the bottle stuck on your face because the bottle flaked onto your hand and mixed with the sunscreen. It is infuriating and for such a steap price, the packaging should be impeccable. Additionally, the product runs out of the packaging too easily and product is wasted easily. TATCHA, PLEASE FIX THE PACKAGING! This product has a luxury pricetag and should have packaging that fits the bill. Tatch, PLEASE FIX THE PACKAGING!
