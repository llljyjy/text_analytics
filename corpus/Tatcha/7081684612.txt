I was so excited to try this cream since I’ve only heard great things about Tatcha. I’ve been in denial for the past 1.5-2 months I’ve been using it that my face is NOT looking or feeling good. I suddenly have breakouts and my face looks oiler than ever in the middle of winter! This cream just sits on top of your skin giving it a greasy sheen. Wearing it to bed made it even worse. Sadly this will have to go to waste. Hopefully I can repair the damage it’s done to my skin soon… this is not it!
