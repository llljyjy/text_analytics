Was looking for an alternative to a Korean foaming rice wash cleanser, but I didnâ€™t expect that this cleanser was bit more of an exfoliating type. It is important to note (specially to people with extra sensitive skin) that it has microbeads in it that dissolves after a while. All in all, does the job ok as a cleanser, but might not repurchase cause of the microbeads) and will look specifically for gentle foaming cleansers instead. nan
