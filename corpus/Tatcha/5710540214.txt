I had a sample of this and liked it while i was using the sample so bought the full size. I’m about half way through now, and I can say that this is not for me. I have very dry skin, and this didn’t provide the moisture i needed. It feels a bit heavy and greasy on my skin when applied, and it’s fine when it’s been absorbed, but my skin does not continue to feel moisturized for as long as it should. I also end up adding a drop of facial oil to my moisturizer before applying. Honestly since using this moisturizer my skin has gotten worse , more acne than I’ve had in years, Nothing else in my skincare routine has changed. Maybe this moisturizer would be good for me once i n a while but not a go to, so i wouldn’t recommend it. many people like it, so it’s not to say this isn’t a good one. like i said, i liked the sample. but my skin then was clear and good overall. Not for me
