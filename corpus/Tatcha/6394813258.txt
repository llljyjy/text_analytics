First: disappointing amount of product for price and I don’t usually give this critique because that’s just how it works unfortunately. However, this is the only product I’ve run out of in my last bill order despite similar or same product amounts. This alone is stopping me from reordering and instead trying a different brand that may work as well as this but with more product for price. The good: it did amazing things for my skin, I remember thinking in the first week that it changed my skincare routine and was just what I needed for better hydration! I really did feel the plump and hydrated, soft skin from this. The product is great and I really did love it but for $89 knowing how fast I went through this I’m not sure if I will reorder or try something new. Amazing But Not Enough Product
