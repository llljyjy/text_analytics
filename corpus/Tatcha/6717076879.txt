I think for a $60 mineral foundation I was expecting a lot… but it’s just okay for me. The packaging is unique and I love the sleek thin look. The  products it ok. Still has that mineral feeling but it didn’t leave much of a white cast which was good. I think there are more affordable options out there.  Gifted by tatcha It’s okay I which is was more affordable
