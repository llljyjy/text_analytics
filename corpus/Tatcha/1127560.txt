Like so many others are saying, the packaging is horrible. I bought this about 6 months ago and LOVE what’s inside:mineral sunscreen with spf 50, a nice blurring tint, lovely texture, but recently the paint has been peeling from the package and no matter what I do it transfers onto my fingers and into the product. Sadly I’m just going to throw this away. Inside great, outside awful
