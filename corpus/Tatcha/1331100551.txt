I got this as a free sample and the first time I used it I was convinced that I was going to hate it. I’m VERY fair with oily/combo/sensitive skin. When I first applied it I was underwhelmed. The cream instantly melted to (what felt like) water upon contacting my face and it kind felt like I was just smearing H2O around. BUT the magic happens once it’s had a chance to absorb for a few moments. My skin felt SO soft and silky. It somehow manages to make your face feel moisturized but somehow super soft like a rose petal. It leaves zero film, tackiness or stickiness. I love that it’s oil-free and doesn’t make me breakout but I feel like my skin is drinking it up. I use an extra dab around my eyes for extra hydration as most other facial moisturizers make the skin around my eyes sensitive and burn. I’m the type of person who can’t stick with one product long enough to use up a whole container but after I finished the sample I splurged on the full size. Weird at first but worth the $$$
