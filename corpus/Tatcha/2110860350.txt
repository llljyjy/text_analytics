I absolutely love this range from tatcha, especially the newer products. This mask is the best clay mask Iâ€™ve ever used for my sensitive, acne-prone skin. Not only does it work faster than most other ones (3-5 mins is nothing and I can easily work it into my regular morning or nighttime routine), but it leaves my skin so so soft and hydrated. I see an instant reduction in my clogged pores too. My skin looks mattified almost. nan
