I got a tester/sample of this as my free birthday gift from Sephora. I was excited to try it because of the hype reviews but was honestly left really disappointed. I used it for 10 days during my night time routine hoping for some extra moisture but was left with my skin feeling even more oily that it already is. This cream feels very heavy and sits on top of the skin instead of absorbing into it. I know a lot of people love this but it just wasn’t right for me. I’ve used a lot of other (way less expensive creams) that have worked much better for my skin. Just wasn’t right for me
