So I’ve only used this product once so far, but I don’t think my skin has EVER felt this soft. Especially this time of year when my skin is so dry from living in a cold climate. I have sensitive skin that’s prone to breakouts so I’m keeping my fingers crossed that I can continue to use this without any breakouts or irritation. Makes my skin SO soft
