I’ll start off by saying the packaging is absolutely so chic and luxurious! I am a tried and true LANEIGE lip sleeping mask fan, but I was compelled to try something new this time around. While it doesn’t live up to LANEIGE, I can still appreciate the creaminess of this lip mask. It is a bit sticky and I find that it doesn’t feel as hydrating as LANEIGE. I would say try it just once but I will not be repurchasing in the future. Try it once!
