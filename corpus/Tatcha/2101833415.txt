I am giving this a 3 for several packaging reasons. 1. The coloring on the bottle flakes off all over your hands and then transfers to your face. 2. After storing in my luggage, once I opened the bottle to apply, the product went everywhere! You have to keep this bottle verticals all the time or the air inside forces it’s way out bringing the product out as well. It wasted so much because I didn’t need all that but it wouldn’t stop oozing out of the bottle. The product itself was good and it worked really well on my oily/combination skin. But I won’t be purchasing again unless the packaging changes. Horrible Packaging
