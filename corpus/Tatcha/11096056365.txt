I got this product in the birthday gift pack that Sephora offers for free. I decided to put it on when doing my makeup for dinner and had to wipe my entire base off and redo it. This primer was awful. It pilled so badly I had stuff in my hair and eyebrows, and it made the spots I tried to conceal very patchy. For transparency, I did my skincare routine before using the primer (face wash and ninacinimide). I had left that to dry for about 15 minutes before applying the product. My other primers have not done this even when I used the same skincare routine. For the price point, I would expect much better. Save your money
