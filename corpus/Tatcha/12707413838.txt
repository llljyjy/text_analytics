This cream leaves my face feeling moisturized and dewy, and I love the cooling, relaxing feel of it. I have normal skin which is easily irritated by new products but this did not irritate me at all! I know its a thick cream but I found it okay to use year-round. As a comparison, the thick Sunday Riley ICE Ceramide cream DID cause my skin to break out. Hydrating for normal/sensitive skin!
