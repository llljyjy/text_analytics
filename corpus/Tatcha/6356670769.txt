She’s a 10, but her packaging sucks. Seriously though, the product itself is great and has made me love sunscreen as a daily moisturizer. However, because of the flaky bottle, I had to knock off 2 stars. The bottle flakes get all over my fingers, my face, and even in my eyes! I have to pick off the pieces all day. And to reapply during the day, I have to carry it in the box, but it still doesn’t keep from the flakes getting EVERYWHERE. Tatcha, please change the bottle material! Terrible Bottle Material
