This product is the best moisturizer I’ve ever used! Seriously! I’m new to the skincare game and I got gifted a travel-sized set and this moisturizer was included. I used to have very dry and flaky skin, but after a week and a half of using it, that is no longer the case! My skin is so smooth and hydrated! I’m new to the skincare game and my skin is very sensitive and reactive to skincare, but I didn’t have any problems with this moisturizer! I also have rosacea but this moisturizer didn’t really help with that. I previously tried the banana soufflé moisturizer from Glow Recipe and my skin had a very bad reaction to that moisturizer, so I’m glad I actually found a product that works for me! You should definitely give this product a try!! Holy Grail!!
