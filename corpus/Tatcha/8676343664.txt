I’m so surprised reading the negative reviews, I absolutely adore this product. I would never count it out of my routine! It’s cool and refreshing and does a great job hydrating, really preps the skin for following treatments. I follow up with the Silk Cream and it glides on. It’s also a huge container and lasts me around 4 and a half months! Wouldn’t go without
