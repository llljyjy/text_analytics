I was so excited to try this sunscreen because I love Tatcha’s Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen. Pros: The idea is great: SPF 50 that’s ALL mineral is a dream come true! Also, the formula is very easy to spread.Cons: The packaging is absolutely atrocious! Mine is peeling heavily. Also the sunscreen is tinted Which I hate because it’s darker than my skin. I imagine Tatcha did this to avoid the white overcast from mineral sunscreens. But the general overcast is better than a pre-picked shade which wouldn’t match everyone. Has potential, but needs some changes!
