After using up the entire jar of this product I can confidently say that I enjoy this serum in cream product very much.I really love the way it wears under makeup or mixed with a little foundation during the day time. It feels very light on the skin and doesn’t smear or wear off harshly. I also used it as a night cream and it played nicely with all my usual products. It helps to comfort dry and irritated skin. My skin felt soft and nourished while using it. I didn’t repurchase yet because I am trying out the dewy skin cream, which I got in my birthday gift and I really like that too. I wish this came in a value size like that one does. Many people say they don’t like creams to come in jars because it is unsanitary. I lost my scoop basically as soon as I got the product and I never had an issue since while I had it, it was the only thing I wanted to use. It took about 6 weeks to completely use up. During that time I just don’t see it getting gross, so I am cool with the packaging. I kind of wish it has the little spoon clip like other Tatcha creams because that is cute though. Very comforting and cosmetically elegant
