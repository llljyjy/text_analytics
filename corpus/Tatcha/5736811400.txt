This is by far my favorite moisturizer ever. I love how it applies and consistency. It hydrates my skin and leaves my skin looking dewy, while helping me breakout less and reduce my pores. If you want dewy skin, and suffer from blackheads this is for you. I also have sensitive skin and a lot of food/skin allergies, and Iâ€™ve never had an issue with this moisturizer. THE BEST moisturizer ever
