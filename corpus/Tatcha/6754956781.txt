The consistency is really nice, but it does not hydrate my lips at all. I wanted to love this and I was so excited to try it since I love Tatcha, however this was really underwhelming. It it way too much money not to work and it doesn’t work. It’s pretty on and had a nice texture but does not hydrate at all and it actually dried out my lips more. Not worth the money
