I realize that for many of us, this is quite expensive but it is worth EVERY single penny. This is hands down the BEST cleanser I have ever used.. and trust me I have bought many, MANY cleansers from Sephora. 100000/10. I have dry skin, and after using this, I have almost NO pimples, soft, smooth skin and NO dry patches. My Mom told me that my skin was glowing!! :) The best part is that you donâ€™t need to use a lot of it either, so it lasts a long time. Trust me, you will NOT regret it. :) YOU NEED THIS
