I just started using this and I am really pleased with how hydrating it is! My skin is sensitive, combination, and I tend to break out here and there. So far I’m not sure if this will cause blemishes, but it has done a great job keeping my skin hydrated, and that is with just using this and sunscreen. No moisturizer. I just want to note that I have tried more expensive moisturizers than this line carries that left my skin tight and dry feeling. I am going to start using a moisturizer from Tatcha with this and I’m sure I’ll get even better results! hydrating
