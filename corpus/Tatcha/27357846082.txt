This cleanser is fine. It has a mild scent that’s something like a cross between lemongrass and lychee, and it comes out of the tube as a thick, viscous gel intermittently studded with exfoliating beads. It lathers and rinses well, considering the texture, and a little bit really does go a long way, but it took me a while to get used to the fact that there isn’t much of a foamy quality to it. Other reviewers mentioned that their skin felt significantly softer and smoother after adding this to their routine, and while I am delighted for them, I did not personally notice any marked difference in my own skin. The packaging is pretty, but the plastic flip-top felt sort of cheap, considering the brand and price point.I bought the standard 5-ounce tube, which took me about twelve weeks to get through. I used it once a day for the first two weeks—which is how I expected to use it—and twice a day for the remaining ten weeks. Despite my vaguely temperamental combination skin that tends to reacts poorly to harsh exfoliants, I didn’t experience any redness or sensitivity while using this. It’s definitely gentle. Almost too gentle. Aggressively gentle, even.I won’t be buying this again, but I do think it’s probably worth a try for people with extremely sensitive skin who might be struggling to find an exfoliating scrub that doesn’t turn them into the shriveled, sunburnt husk of a dehydrated live-action SpongeBob. nan
