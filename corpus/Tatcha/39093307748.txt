My skin has been looking great since I started using the Tatcha Water Cream a few weeks ago. My pores are less noticeable and my face is well moisturized. My only complaint about the water cream is that it is just that, a bit watery. It doesnâ€™t have that rich, luxurious feel that the Tatcha Dewy Skin cream has when I blend it in. Great moisturizer
