I have tried all three of this sunscreen mists. I thought the cucumber mist was my fave but this one is the new fave for sure! The scent is so nice, and soft. This is the best spf mist I have ever used. The mist is so fine and evenly disperses, Iâ€™m so obsessed. The packaging is also so high quality and aesthetically pleasing and you can just throw it in your purse and stay protected all day! I love it! get it!
