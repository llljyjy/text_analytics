The N° 41 mister is the perfect SPF for on the go reapplication. It’s a lightweight must that leaves a nice glowy finish. It has a natural floral scent (not too strong) and doesn’t leave me greasy. It’s such an innovative and convenient product. Just spray it on and you’re good to go! No excuse not to reapply. Sun damage is the number 1 cause of wrinkles and Sunscreen is the number 1 investment you can make for your skin. Perfect for on the go
