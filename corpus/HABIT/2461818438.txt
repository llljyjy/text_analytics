I loved this! The smell was lovely. I gave it 4 stars because I found it to have more of a residue than the original, and it made me break out for a couple of days while my skin got used to it (which is typically the case with me, but it didn’t happen with your OG)! Overall a really awesome, innovative, easy-to-use product. Totally alleviates that post-makeup, “oh no I forgot my SPF“ moment. Love
