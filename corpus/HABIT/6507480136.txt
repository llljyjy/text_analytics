I love this sunscreen because it’s easy to apply and I don’t have to touch my face! The smell is lovely, and my favorite amongst the HABIT line. My only issue is that it leaves my skin oily. Others might call it “dewy,” but on my skin… it’s oily lol. But it’s nothing a translucent powder can’t fix. After spraying my face, I mattify my face with a powder, and it’s completely undetectable on my skin. I have very sensitive skin, but I’ve been able to wear this daily (with multiple re-applications through out the day) and had no issues. nan
