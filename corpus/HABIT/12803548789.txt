this looked like a good spf spray and I’ve tried so many and all of them leave my skin so oily looking and melts the makeup off. so I decided to try this and this spf spray did the same thing. it ruined my makeup for the day. and I wasn’t even wearing much. it made it look so oily and  throughout the day my makeup was coming off. the size of this bottle is also very small. looks like a mini size. this might only be good if you not wearing makeup. Melted makeup off.
