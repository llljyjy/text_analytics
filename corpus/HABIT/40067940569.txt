I absolutely love the concept behind this sunscreen. Its super light and felt amazing on my skin. I have super sensitive skin and even products made for sensitive skin hurt, but this actually felt super hydrating with no burning or anything. The reason I gave it 4/5 rather than 5/5 is simply the smell. If you love floral scents and don’t mind scents in your beauty products then this wouldn’t be a problem for you. I on the other hand just didn’t like the floral scent and wish there was no scent or something light. If you’re like me and don’t like it, I would go for the Habit Facial Sunscreen Mist in either the cucumber or white peach. Loved the idea and it felt great on my skin!
