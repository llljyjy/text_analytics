I really wanted an easy solution to reapplying sunscreen throughout the day.  Unfortunately, this isn’t it.  It didn’t seem to ever soak in, leaving it visibly oily and shiny.  Plus, the product was still just sitting on my face - completely wet.  It then started melting into my eyes and I had to go wash my face.  I ended up returning it. Oil slick
