Without a doubt, this is my favorite sunscreen product. The sun is so luxurious that it feels more like a face mist to rejuvenate my skin. I look forward to reapplying this product since it is a breeze, and the fact that I can’t get enough of this scent. It’s also the perfect size to fit in my everyday bag. As someone who can get sunburnt year-round, I bring this everywhere. I bring this everywhere!
