I’ve been using HABIT since they launched in 2020 and I can say, without a doubt, this is the best sunscreen on the market. It’s super convenient for reapplication, smells great, and it has never irritated my skin. The mist is so fine and refreshing, and I can’t recommend this enough! The best, by far!
