Wanted to like this, as I hate reapplying SPF. Tried Coola Sunscreen spray, it was ok but didn’t feel that fluid particles were fine enough (drippy at certain areas, not enough on certain areas, so had to rub onto the face anyways). Saw this on Instagram ad (The model just sprayed onto her face and walked away). It’s little greasy and smell is too strong. But the worst part is that it stings my eyes so much!   If it didn’t sting my eyes, I think I will be able to ignore the smell and use daily.  But unfortunately no. nan
