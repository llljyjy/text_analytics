For the price and small amount I expected a glass bottle but everything is cheap plastic. Gives a “dewy” finish and has a botanical smell that some won’t like.  Smells the same and applies the same as the Supergoop! Sunscreen setting spray which is cheaper and has more than 3x the amount. Overpriced
