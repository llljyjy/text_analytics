I’ve been using this product for a week and it makes reapplying sunscreen so simple. A few sprays and you’re all done with the reapplication! The mist is light and smells really nice. It’s easy to travel with and fits in even my smallest bags. The packaging/messaging was simple, no mess, and straightforward. I love the bright coral color as well! I did not experience any irritation on my skin or breakouts while using this product. It’s so good! I’m bringing it along with me on my vacation and happy to finally have a way to keep my skin protected throughout the day. Can't leave the house without it!
