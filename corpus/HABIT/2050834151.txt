So this is a great summer item! It did burn my eyes when sprayed on my face directly but I have very sensitive eyes to begin with. So instead I spray on my hands then rub into my face and itâ€™s perfection!! Works great and you can tell the SPF is there but no stickiness like some SPF for your face. Great summer item for your purse or travel
