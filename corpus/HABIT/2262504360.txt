Wanted to love this but hard to. The fragrance alone was so off putting. It’s stronger than perfume and that is just unnecessary for a product on your face. Also, the price point is not sustainable. I messaged the company and you need 7 squirts to get this fully on cause most of it misses your face. It’s very tiny as well so it did not last long. Cute concept but expensive and not smell friendly. nan
