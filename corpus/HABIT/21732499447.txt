I was really excited when they announced that they were releasing a new mist. I own the other two and have been using them everyday. This one is probably my favorite scent and after would be the original. I didn’t use sunscreen as much prior to buying so I’m grateful that it really has become such a easy thing to do and reapply. It doesn’t irritate my skin or make it feel oily/greasy heavy like some other sunscreens. Light pleasant fragrance
