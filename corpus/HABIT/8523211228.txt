Habit did it again! The N°39 mister not only provides great protection for my skin but also smells fantastic. It’s a very soft floral scent with a hint of sweet peaches. The convenient size of the bottle fits in any purse, I always have mine on me. Which makes reapplying sunscreen throughout the day SO easy. Big plus, you can apply it on over your make up without messing it up! Protecting my skin from the sun is so important to me and trying to find something that’s effective, convenient, and affordable has been a journey long in the making. Habit hits all the requirements I wanted for a sunscreen. It’s a huge win for skin care. I’ve been recommending Habit since their first N°41 mister because it is such an easy step to add to your skincare routine. They just keep making their products better and better! I can’t wait to see what they come up with next. Effective, Convenient, and Affordable Skincare
