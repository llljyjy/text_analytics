So full disclosure: I very rarely do chemical formulas, my skin is very sensitive and doesn’t tolerate formulas like this well, also it’s fragranced haha but honestly here’s the thing, this stuff is definitely more of an experience than the kind of product you would use everyday, it smells lovely and comes in a very cute tiny bottle! I feel like this would make for an amazing gift for a beauty lover! nan
