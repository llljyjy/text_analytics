I’ve tried all the scents of No39, and the White Peach + Neroli is definitely my new favorite. I love that they offer a neroli scent. I was worried that the smell would be overpowering, but I think it’s actually the lightest scent of all the options. The bottle seems small, but it does last a decent while. love it
