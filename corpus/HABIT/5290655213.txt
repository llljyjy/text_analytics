I’ve been using different scents from this sunscreen line, and I’m a  customer for life. I have a bottle for myself, and a bottle for my kiddo. A few sprays, and we are protected for the day.... I love it. No more battles over sunscreen, no more wrestling as I try to rub a lotion on, and no more terrible smell and taste from the other brands. I cannot overstate how worth it this product it. It’s a self-care thing for me, at this point. I know my future self will thank me, and it takes a stressor off my plate. You won’t regret it. Pampering myself with sunscreen? Who knew.
