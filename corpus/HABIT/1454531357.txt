I LOVE this sunscreen!  I have tried all 3, and this one smells like peaches, but has a very gentle scent.  I love how you don’t have to rub in the sunscreen and have white residue, it dries quickly, and it’s easy to reapply during the day, especially over makeup.  I originally found them on Instagram, and have bought from the website and Sephora ever since.  I have recommended to friends, and even my boyfriend uses it! nan
