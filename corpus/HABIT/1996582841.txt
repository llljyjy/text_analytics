No clue how this has good ratings. I have dry skin and hate using sunblock lotions on my face so decided to try this. It is so oily!!! I would be better off using cheap normal sunblock spray. I tried with bb cream, normal foundation and my airbrush spray, it looked ridiculous w all of them. I didnâ€™t put too much on and obviously made sure not to get much in my hair but it ended up weighting down my hair and had to wash it when I got home. It also irritated my eyes, they were red all day until I was able to wash my face. Horrible
