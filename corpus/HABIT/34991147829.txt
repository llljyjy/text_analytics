I LOVE this sunscreen! It’s super lightweight and does not feel oily. Not only does it have an SPF of 41, but it has ingredients that are good for your skin. The mister sprays really fine, and it’s perfect to take with me and reapply during the day over my makeup. I love the light, fresh, floral scent. My new go-to sunscreen
