Iâ€™m an avid habit user and they finally nailed it with this one where the scent is fresh but not overpowering. This like the others in their line can be applied and most importantly reapplied over makeup. I am naturally fair but will tan and can easily get sunspots so sunscreen is an absolute must in my skincare routine. The cucumber one ended up being more like pickle juice and the orange is fine but a bit more alcohol smell than this one. Peach will be my go to from now on. Peach is divine my new fave
