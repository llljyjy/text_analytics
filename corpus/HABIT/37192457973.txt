I love the Habit spray sunscreens. I have multiple bottles in my bathroom, car, gym bag, and purse. Not only do they protect my skin but refresh my face and smell great. The only reason I give this a 4/5 is because I’m comparing it to the cucumber spray N38. The N38 is so fine and the smell is amazing. I was very much looking forward to a similar experience with the peach but I really don’t notice anything. Feels no different than the original and it doesn’t feel as refreshing on my face comparatively to N38. Now it still feels amazing and it protects my skin so I still love it and use it daily but after it is done I will be sticking with N38 Amazing but not as good as N38
