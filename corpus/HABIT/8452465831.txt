I love the concept, but for me the smell is pretty bad during application. I thought it would be more of a cucumber smell. I think it’s a good sunscreen, but after walking my dogs for 45 minutes, there was some peeling around the T zone. That could have been from sweating. I know you’re supposed to reapply more often if you sweat so keep that in mind. I would recommend because some sunscreen is better than none, but the smell is strong. nan
