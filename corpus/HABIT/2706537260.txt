It works BUT it really STINGS my eyes after an hour -and that is without getting wet or sweaty.  Worried about applying enough and their website says to spritz SEVEN times for full coverage. Their website also says there are 30 measured sprays. I’ve used it 3 times and have gone through a third of the pricey little bottle, with 3 to 5 spritzes each time and not the recommended 7.  It leaves a very shiny glow BUT it does seem to work.  I tried spraying it on my fingers and pasting it in and that doesn’t really work. You have to spray it on.  I bought mine directly through Habit before I realized Sephora carried it.  Habit does NOT allow returning products that have been opened and used. Had I purchased it from Sephora, I probably would’ve returned it since it stings my eyes. nan
