Surprised by how much I like this. Cucumber I was pretty iffy if it was going to be overbearing but the scent is really refreshing. It’s sprays out really evenly I feel like it gets a lot of your face at once which I like but it doesn’t make you feel sticky or watery. I think this is a really good addition to my regular every day routine and its so easy to apply. pleasantly surprised
