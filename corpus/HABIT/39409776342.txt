I am a big fan of the HABIT sunscreen line, they are all both light and easy to apply as well as effective in protecting my easily burned skin. This is definitely my favorite scent of the three I have tried (Floral and Cucumber are the others)- it is lightly fruity and the blend of peach and neroli is layered. I will also note that I have super sensitive skin and tend to break out with a lot of sunscreens, and this is one of the few that donâ€™t cause me break outs. Favorite Scent So Far!
