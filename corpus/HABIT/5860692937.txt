The mist is ultra fine which i love and it gives me a nice dewy glow but the scent is a little too strong for me so i would love to try their other ones to see if the scent won’t be so strong. it’s doesn’t smell bad it’s just strong. otherwise i love this over make up and great for easy reapplication! ultra fine mist!
