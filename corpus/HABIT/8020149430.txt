Everything I read about this SPF is true!! I’m a first time user, it’s been about a month now and I’m HOOKED! I feel like kinda BAAAD having this as my secret weapon. But the look of it on bare skin alone is beautiful, so glowy and healthy. Not to mention the CONVENIENCE of this spritz bottle is a game changer! I chose the cucumber scent and it’s not overpowering for once! It’s refreshing and sets in nicely!! Wait no further to decide, it’s a yesss! your SPF bestie!
