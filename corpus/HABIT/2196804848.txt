Perfect on-the-go solution to reapply sunscreen over makeup throughout the day! I’ve been getting many sun spots/hyperpigmentation spots on my face from the sun, so I am trying to reapply sunscreen throughout the day. However, I wear makeup almost everyday, so it was hard to find a solution. I didn’t want to use the powder because it’s not enough sunscreen and didn’t want to use sticks because I didn’t want my makeup to move. This spray doesn’t move my makeup when applying! It’s also really easy to carry around because of the small size. The spray is not really a mist, it’s definitely more of a wet spray - would be nicer if it was more misty. The smell is kind of strong, and the spray will burn your eyes if you don’t keep your eyes closed for at least 3-5 seconds after spraying. Great way to reapply sunscreen over makeup
