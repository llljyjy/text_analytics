The concept of this product is great! I believe that a spray SPF is the best and easier way to reapply your SPF especially for people who don’t like to reapply or forget to. I will say this product is very fragrant so if you’re not a fan of using skincare with a scent then it is definitely not for you. Also make sure that after you spray you keep your eyes closed for a few seconds so nothing gets in your eyes. Overall I’ve been enjoying this product. nan
