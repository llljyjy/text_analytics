I am a big fan of the HABIT mists. I have at least two to three in rotation at any given moment. I work outside most of the day and they are life savers. Very easy to pull out, do a quick spritz and be safe from the sun. The smell of the white peach and neroli is very nice. Subtle, not to overpowering. Light scent. Heavenly mist as always.
