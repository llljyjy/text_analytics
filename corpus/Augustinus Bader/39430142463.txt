Augustinus Bader The Light Cream with TFC8 is amazing. Saying I like this cream it’s an understatement. I LOVE IT! I was amazed from the moment I first applied this cream. I am a 40 year old woman and preserving my skin as I age is very important to me. I loved how immediately My complexion looked brighter and I somehow looked younger from first application. The smell was not bad but I think no smell would of been better. I did apply twice at first but now I’m applying during the day under my makeup. I absolutely love this cream & do plan on purchasing it again. My skin in oily but the thick texture of the cream doesn’t seem to off set it at all. My skin looks brighter & feels more firm. I can guess if can only get better. I’m really thinking of trying out other products to prevent wrinkles and fine lines. Augustinus Bader The Light Cream I LOVE IT!
