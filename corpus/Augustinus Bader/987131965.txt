Love this lightweight moisturizer for summer! It sinks right into my skin and it feels moisturized but not greasy. It felt nice on my skin, and didnâ€™t break me out. I have not noticed any high improvement yet but only been using for about 3 weeks. It did slightly mattify my oily T-zone but was still a bit oily at the end of the day. Overall would recommend!  Only knocked off one star for the price. great lightweight moisturizer
