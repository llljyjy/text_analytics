It is hard to justify the price on this! I really like the cream and it made my skin feel soft and it absorbs well. It didn’t have any miracle effects. I feel I can find something just as good out there for half the price. I also think they need to change the container. The test tube is just awkward and it doesn’t sit on the shelf very well. All that being said the cream is really nice. I received this free from Influenster for my opinion. Great cream too expensive
