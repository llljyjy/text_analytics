I personally did not like the bottom of the package and the fact that you had to lay it down. Also I personally prefer a product that has sunscreen in it, but would use this at night instead.  I took off one star for the packaging and one star for the price. I personally just think that there are so many products out there that at this price point you can find exactly what youâ€™re looking for and this was not it for me nan
