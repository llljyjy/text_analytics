I was pleasantly surprised from the first use. The cream is lightweight with a serum-lotion texture, and instantly absorbs into the skin. After a few days I noticed my skin felt really soft and radiant. I suffer with blemishes and this has been great.  My makeup goes on so much better after using this. I can definitely see a difference.  I got this free from Influenster to try and review. Great product!
