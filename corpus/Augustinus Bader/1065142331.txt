I have nothing bad to say about this cream other than it is extremely expensive. The packaging is lovely. the ingredients are great and I appreciate that there is no fragrance. My skin is hypersensitive and always irritated in this soothes that and adds plenty of moisture. However I haven’t seen any difference in radiance, fine lines, hyperpigmentation, texture, firmness etc that the cream promises, but I have only used it for a couple of weeks. I have been applying it once or twice daily for over a month.I can’t honestly recommend as it is absolutely not worth the price... Perhaps if it was $100 less... Expensive but nice
