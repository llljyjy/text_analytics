I received this product for review from Influenster. The packaging is very luxe! It’s a light weight cream, andfeels good when applying to the skin. I have been using inthe AM for a few weeks and so far I like it. No issues with myskin breaking out or redness. I don’t generally getbreakouts, but sometimes a new product can cause apimple to pop up. I have combo skin, and this productseems to work well for that. I’m not sure if someone withdry skin would get the needed hydration. I have noticed itpilled up a bit a few times, but that could have been a userissue. The Light Cream
