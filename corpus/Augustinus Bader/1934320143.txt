I received this product free from Influenster and Augustinus Bader in return for my honest review. Upon first use I noticed that there is no scent to this light cream, which I prefer. The texture and consistency is thin and smooth like satin. I applied it to a freshly clean, dry face and it absorbed quickly and evenly into the skin. It immediately left my skin feeling very hydrated, like it just drank a tall glass of water! I have a dryer skin type so I usually prefer a creamier consistency in my moisturizer, however I have found this is actually perfect for use in the summer or hot weather or under make up. It performs true to its claims of mattifying the skin and evening out skin tone/redness. You can definitely tell this is a superior luxury product, from the packaging to the overall performance, it is superb. Luxury!
