Is this serum nice? Yes. Is it worth hundreds of dollars? No, absolutely not. I’m incredibly disappointed to see other reviewers using blatant fear mongering to shame other (typically less expensive) products and using their review to advertise other sources that do the same thing. No one needs a $495 CDN serum - if you think this serum is worth it…you’re easily fooled and that’s nothing to boast about. If you’re happy to waste your money than by all means go ahead and buy this. ABSOLUTELY NOT WORTH IT.
