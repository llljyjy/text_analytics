I’ve been using this face cream for a few weeks now. First of all, it is very thick and I only needed to use a small amount day and night. There’s no fragrance to speak of. I really enjoyed the calming effect this has on my dry skin. My face has been a bit more irritated from using retinol products, so this cream was divine for me. Leaves my skin soft, hydrated and calm. Also, I am impressed that the container has refills available for purchase. I recommend for mature skin. Beautiful cream!
