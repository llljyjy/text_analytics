This product is super thick, but feels amazing when you put it on!! I use just a pea sized amount every time I use it and it covers my whole face easily. I don’t feel like this leaves a greasy residue after applying it either. After the first week, I noticed the fine lines on my face were looking less noticeable. After two weeks, they had pretty much disappeared. I feel it has also evened out my skin tone. I don’t wear makeup quite as often as I did before trying out this product. The price is a little more expensive than I would ever spend on a facial cream, but I feel this cream does an amazing job of smoothing out fine lines and evening out your skin. With the amount I used, I could make this last a rather long time and could justify the cost. Amazing product
