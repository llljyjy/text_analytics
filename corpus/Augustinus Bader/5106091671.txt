Not only does this light cream have an amazing feel when you put it on but it looks gorg! There’s not a shine to it so if that’s what your looking for it’s not that but it does leave your skin feeling moisturized and not looking or feeling dry. Alittle pricey I will admit but if it works as well as it has been it could be worth it… I would like to do a new review after a 3 week period at least before giving it a whole 5 stars at a price tag near $200, but if you have the money and have oily skin but don’t want something drying give this a try I love it so far! nan
