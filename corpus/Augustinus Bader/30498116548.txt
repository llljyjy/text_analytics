I love this light cream I noticed an immediate difference in my skin and the lines and wrinkles disappearing. My face looks much more radiant and soft looking and feeling great. I like that it’s vegan formula without dies and scents because I tend to have allergic reactions to products with added ingredients that aren’t needed it’s extremely important for myself to use products that are natural and vegan without any additional additives that are going to cause me to have allergic reactions and ruin me being able to use the product, this product definitely is natural and vegan because that’s the first sign that the product isn’t going to work for my skin.  I just can’t wait to see the continuing difference in my face skin and appearance with the continued use of this amazing product. I also like the texture and feel of this cream it goes on with ease and soaks right into my skin no issues with how it feels afterwards I actually love using it as my daily routine. I am recommending it for everyone to try it. I am doing this review and testing this product out for free. It is definitely a bit pricey but I honestly think you can’t put a price on products that actually make a difference in your face skin care. I’m going to purchase other items and try them out I would definitely love to continue to get free samples of this companies face skincare line and see what awesome other products they have.
