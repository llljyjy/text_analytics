I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I had been wanting to try this brand for a long time and I’m so glad that I finally did. My skin is so moisturized and glowing. The price point is high but a little bit really goes a long way. This has definitely earned a permanent spot in my skincare rotation. I also love that it’s safe during pregnancy. Obsessed!
