This is a pretty good moisturizer, I’m in a humid climate - so I didn’t notice too much of an improvement on mattefying my skin. There’s a slightly odd scent to it, not super off putting, but not great. And just a weird thing, I hate that the bottle is shaped like a test tube. This makes it so it can only lay flat or roll around in a drawer. Not a terrible purchase, but there is better out there.*I received this product complimentary and this is my honest review in exchange for the product Decent
