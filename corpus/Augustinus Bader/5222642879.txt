My skin liked its gel/milky texture. Went on smooth and stayed a little tacky while the skin absorbed. Skin felt hydrated despite it being oil free. I would totally recommend to anyone who enjoys lightweight moisturizers. I use this everyday before I apply my makeup. I especially love that my skin isn’t shiny after a few hours. I have combo skin for reference and I live in Texas where it’s scorching hot. Happy I was able to test and give an honest. I’ll definitely repurchase despite the price tag. Well worth it for my combo skin. underestimated this gem
