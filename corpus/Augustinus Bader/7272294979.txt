This cream is super light on the skin, dissapear in seconds but keeps skin hydrated and fresh. I have rosecia and my main goal is to find a face cream that will calm it down and not cause irritation. This light cream is pretty good for my skin, no redness and skin looks healthy in the morning when I use it for night. I also love tube package, it keeps cream cool all the time, and feels expensive:) I  got this cream free in exchange for my honest review. Light:)
