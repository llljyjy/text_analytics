My dry skin loves this moistrizer, it is perfect for summer and feels good on my skin. I have dry acne prone skin and this has not triggered any breakouts. It also works very well under makeup. Looking forward to continued use to benifit from the skin improving features of pores and file lines reduction. This cream is pricey but in my opinion very worth it, really hydrates the skin from the inside not just on top, my skin looks and feels healthier in 10 days of daily use. Feels amazing...
