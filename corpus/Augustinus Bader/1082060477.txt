I received this as a Voxbox. I really liked this cream and couldn’t be happier with the product. It came as a full size which was an absolute surprise. It’s thick and spreads very evenly. It absorbs into the skin extremely well and is not greasy. It didn’t make me breakout which is a huge plus! The product does not have a smell and would be great for people who don’t like strong scents. It’s definitely expensive but the phrase you get what you pay for is very accurate. I’m investing in my skin long term and I’m happy knowing that my money will help me maintain my youth. Excellent!
