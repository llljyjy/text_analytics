This is the best cream I’ve ever used, and I tried a lot of them. I have dry sensitive skin, I’m in my 40s. My skin looks better than ever, I am on my second bottle already. The first time I tried it, it seemed that it wasn’t moisturizing enough, I didn’t see any results in the first 2 weeks, but I kept using it since you are suppose to use the cream for at least a month. All I can say is do it, if you can afford this cream, you won’t regret it, just stick with it and the results will come Best cream ever
