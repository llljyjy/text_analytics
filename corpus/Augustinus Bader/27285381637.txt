I wasn’t very impressed by this moisturizer especially in view of the hefty price tag. It never fully absorbed into my skin and was left with a greasy feel I didn’t like at all. It was somewhat hydrating but made my skin look way too shiny. It has a strong scent that I really didn’t care for also. A little goes a long way so this does last a reasonable amount of time but that’s about the only redeeming thing I can say about this product. nan
