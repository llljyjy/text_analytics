I received this product in my VoxBox to sample and was so excited to try it as I have combination skin that leans more towards oily in my T-zone. The packaging is beautiful with a satin finish bottle and gold trim but I am puzzled as to why it stores upside down as it seem this would be an issue as the product volume decreases with use. While it is supposed to be a moisturizer, it seems more like a serum. It applies easily, is fragrance-free and leaves my skin velvety soft which I really liked. I could also see and feel it “lifting” well after applying. The formula is lightweight and does absorb quickly but anything I applied over it would pill up. I tried waiting for up to a half hour but got the same result. The product description makes the claim that it would help with oil control and reduce pore size and unfortunately I experienced neither. I have used this for about 10 days so can’t attest to the long term effects (over the course of 60 days) which are improved elasticity, wrinkle reduction, firmness, tone and texture. This did not irritate my skin or cause redness so I will continue to use it until it’s gone and will update my review if needed. Underwhelmed so far…
