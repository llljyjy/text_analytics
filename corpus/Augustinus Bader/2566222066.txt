I’m so puzzled by this cream. When I first tried it as a sample (before it was reformulated) I was surprised by how effective it was--I really did see an improvement in my skin tone and texture. The first day I tried it, I had a few pimples that shrunk overnight after using it. So I used up the sample over a few weeks and then went ahead to purchase the full size, noting it’s been reformulated. I’m not sure if that’s the reason why I’ve run into issues with this but I will need to return it. I see no noticeable difference when I use it anymore and I actually think it’s broken me out a bit. I will say it is super rich and hydrating but not a good product for me anymore. Sad because I really did love the results I saw with the sample... nan
