I received this complimentary in exchange for my honest review.  Hair up is after Hair down is before. I started using it on July 13th.  After pic was taken July 29th.  Trust me, I know that 2 weeks isn’t enough time to fully review skin care.  The first few days I was using this I really didn’t like it at all.  It dried out my skin so much it was almost unbearable and I thought about discontinuing use of it.  Over time it hasn’t dried out my skin as bad.  It has helped with the oil production in the t zone.  My skin feels a little more firm, too.  I also feel that my face looks younger, too  It absorbs very quickly into the skin, almost too quick.  I may actually buy this in the future It's a Nice Product
