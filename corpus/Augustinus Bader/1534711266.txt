I really enjoyed this product! I absolutely love the rich cream by them. The rich cream is a thicker cream more suited  for winter. This is more of a milky gel cream consistency. Great for the summer. I also love that ingredients are clean, especially fragrance free.  Sometimes I feel like you pay too much for certain brands just for the name. But the ingredients are top notch like rice bran oil, baobab leaf extract, and Australian lemon myrtle extract, People say the bottle is a little annoying but you can turn it upside down. The only downside is that it is pricey. But It feels great on the skin, moisturizing , doesnâ€™t break me out and good under makeup. great summer moisturizer
