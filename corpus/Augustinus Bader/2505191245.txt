I received this product in exchange for an honest review, and I couldn’t recommend it highly enough. It absorbs quickly, doesn’t feel greasy or oily, and leaves my skin feeling fresh and supple. No strong scent, and a perfect texture. I wake up with glowing, dewy skin that feels fully rested and moisturized. The only negative thing is when the container is empty. Go to night cream
