Nice product. It blends immediately and did not leave my skin feeling unhydrated. It wears well under primer and foundation.  I love the silky texture and that it is not scented.  I would recommend this product especially in hot humid locations. Wore this in 104 degree weather and It kept me from having to touch up with powder for most of the day. Give this a try if you love a good matte look! Lovely product.
