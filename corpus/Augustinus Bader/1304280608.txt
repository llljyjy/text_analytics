This cream is so light it almost feels like a serum. As soon as you put this cream on you can see the difference in your face. Any shininess on my face goes away. I’ve been using it for a few days now and my face have not gotten shiny other than the areas where I have applied highlighter. I saw some people complaining that a downside was that they couldn’t keep the product standing due to its curved bottom but this is actually like a case for the actual bottle which has a flat bottom.I would definitely recommend it if you have oily skin.
