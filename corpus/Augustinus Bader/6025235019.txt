The cream instantly soothe my eczematic skin. I also felt like my skin barrier was repaired after using it for a week. I didn’t see a huge difference in fine lines or wrinkles. Perhaps because I’ve only used it once a day for three weeks. My skin did feel super hydrated even on the next day. The biggest difference I’ve seen from the cream is my skin’s overall skintone. My skintone looks more even and less dull. However, I didn’t really see a drastic improvement on hyperpigmentation. Overall the cream works best on soothing my eczematic skin. It’s contains a very balanced skincare ingredients including anti-ance, antioxidants, and cell communicating properties. Not sure if I would repurchase this cream myself because results are just not astounding. nan
