Wow, what a scam. This cream isn’t remotely moisturizing. And did you see how far down on the ingredients list the ascorbic acid is? Ridiculous. The only thing going for it is that it’s unscented. This product exists to separate people from their money and that’s it. Got this in a mini size with my points and regret even doing that. nan
