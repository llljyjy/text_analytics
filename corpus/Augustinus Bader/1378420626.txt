After trying this cream for 1 month , I can say I think it is a quality product . However , for the price , I would expect miracles . It did mattify my skin slightly and it did reduce my redness over the month. It feels nice and absorbs easily. I have gotten better results from other skincare that was at least half the price. If price is not an issue then itâ€™s great to test drive. I just expected more . The tube is also rounded like a long capsule , so it does not stand up on its own, which is annoying ! I do plan on finishing the tube and If there are more positives or negatives , I will update my review. I received this Augustinus Bader The Light Cream from Influenster and Augustinus Bader for free, in exchange for my honest review. Good but not spectacular for the price !
