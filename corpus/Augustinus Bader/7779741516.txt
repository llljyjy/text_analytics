This isn’t a put on your skin and see the benefits right away.  You have to put this or any of the moisturizers as the first step on your skin, and use it consistently everyday for about a month before you see any change.  After that month, my skin was calmer, smoother, smaller pores, if i get a pimple it’s small and only last about 3 days, and the redness from it goes away quickly.  This line teaches your skin how to heal itself.  If you try it out, use it for a month everyday.  It works.  This rich cream is too much for day use in the summer so I use the cream. Give it a month, it works.
