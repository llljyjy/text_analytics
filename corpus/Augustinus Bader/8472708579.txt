This cream is okay. It feels luxurious and the packaging is lovely, but it did not effectively moisturize my skin and I didnâ€™t notice any differences with this compared to my other (less pricey) products. With the price tag, I was looking for something that would really rejuvenate and imbue with moisture my winter dry skin. Or at the very least make my skin feel more moisturized than my cheaper creams. This was not it. It's fine, but not worth the price
