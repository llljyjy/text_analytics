It goes on smoothly, like velvet, and moisturizes wonderfully. I also like that it is mattifying as I struggle with oily skin. I like that the cream is vegan, very light, and does not have a scent. I have not used the product long enough to notice a big difference in fine lines. I will definitely purchase this product when I run out of this bottle. Worth the price!
