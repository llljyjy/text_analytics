I donâ€™t typically write reviews but felt inclined to write of my experience given the high price of this cream. I had researched this product and found many people were very impressed with the performance of this product. I eagerly awaited the arrival of this cream so that I too could start to see and benefit from the impressive results that so many reported. My first application of this cream was brief and it was my last!  As I applied it to my face it started to burn. I thought it might get better as it soaked in, but instead it worsened and turned bright red with increased pain and burning the longer it stayed on. I do have sensitive skin and obviously this formulation has something in it that is not for the sensitive types. There is no way that I could continue with this cream. So disappointed! But also relieved as I could not afford the price tag long term. Not for sensitive skin ...
