I received this product as a promotion from Influenster, and waited 30 days to ensure I gave it a fair shot. Spending this kind of money, you need to see results, and I will definitely repurchase this product again and again. I used exclusively this for moisture, and have never received so many compliments on my skin. My oily t zone was completely resolved within days, and my fine lines have continued to subside. I went to my Botox appointment and the esthetician immediately asked what I’d been using; she was astounded by the level of hydration present. While it is expensive, I no longer have to use a serum and vitamin C and eye cream and THEN moisturizer, which is incredibly convenient for my hectic schedule. If you’re looking for results and ease of use, this is your product. Worth the splurge
