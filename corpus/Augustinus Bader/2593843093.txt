I received this product complementary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. When I first got this product in the mail, I was very impressed with the packaging and the beautiful blue tube that this cream comes in. You can tell it’s definitely a luxury product. I love the texture of the cream very light weight yet moisturizing. Been using it under make up and it’s been wonderful. I’m 53 years old, and need just a bit more moisture. So for me I like more moisture at a lower price. And there are some other really good ones on the market that I would purchase instead of this one. But, if the price point is not that big a deal for you… Then this is a really great lightweight moisturizer. In fact, if I was in my 40s it would be a bigger hit for me. REALLY like it, but…
