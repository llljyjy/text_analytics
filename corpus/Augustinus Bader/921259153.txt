This had a very thick and rich texture. Even though it’s fragrance-free, I did smell a slight herbal peppery note which does go away after applying it. The first night I could have put too much on and had some breakouts. I changed my method by applying it to areas as needed and by reducing the amount used. I loved how super hydrating it was. It did not leave a sticky residue and was nongreasy. I only needed a little for my skin to feel nourished and restored. I did notice that it helped reduce my fine lines and left my skin feeling soothed and softer. I almost gave up on it after the breakouts. But after modifying how I applied it and with continued use, I’m seeing results and loving it. Very hydrating!!
