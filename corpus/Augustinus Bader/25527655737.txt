This moisturizer feels so soothing and decedent on my skin. I have a few fine lines from years of not properly wearing sunscreen and maturing and this moisturizer has helped immensely! I’ve been using this only once per day as my night cream for the past month and it’s made a big difference in the smoothness and radiance of my skins tone and texture.My fine lines by my eyes have diminished greatly and my overall skin texture has improved and is looking smoother and more hydrated.While it is on the more expensive side, I do believe in quality over quantity in my skincare routine. I would recommend this if it’s in your price range. nan
