Beautiful light cream.  It has an odd texture, but works fantastic.  I have noticed improvements already.  It doesn’t have any smell.  No burning, redness, or stinging.  The only down side is it’s vial shape.  I kept the box because it won’t stand.  I think it would work for anyone with oily or acne.  Highly recommended.  I will definitely buy this again. Great light cream
