I received this in an Influenster box for review. I actually really liked this cream and have continued using it throughout these summer months. It works really well with my skin. I do tend to have drier skin in the winter so I use a heavier cream to help with that but this is light and not greasy at all. Perfect for the summer months. My skin felt plump and moisturized yet did not have a shiny or greasy feel. Didnâ€™t sit in the skin , perfect for under make up also. My skin almost felt healthier when I used this . The price on the other hand is a bit out of my normal range. nan
