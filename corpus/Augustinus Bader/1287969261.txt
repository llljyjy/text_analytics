When Influenster notified me that I’d be receiving the Augustinus Bader Light Cream in exchange for my honest review I was confused. I routinely answer surveys indicating my skin concerns are dryness, dehydration, and aging. “Why would they send me a product who’s own website recommends for oily and combination skin?” I thought. I was sure I’d seen this product before in countless prestige skincare lines marketing “hydration” (not moisture) and typically too light, not moisturizing enough, creating a crackling effect under makeup as my skin rapidly absorbs whats there leaving a filmy pilly layer behind. The reality? I WAS WRONG. I’m pleasantly surprised by this light moisturizer. It’s been a great addition to my routine for a very hot and sweaty summer. I find the formula to be extremely lightweight, very hydrating and lightly moisturizing. If wearing foundation, I do have to prep with my Fresh oil infused serum underneath in order to prevent patchy dry makeup issues, but that’s just because my skin is chronically dehydrated and dry. With the serum under it, this moisturizer works great with makeup for me. I probably wouldn’t be able to use this during winter, but even my dry skin produces more oil and sweat in the summer, so this stuff is the perfect weight moisturizer. The only negative, as others have mentioned, is the package. The shape of the bottle is pretty, just impractical. I had to rearrange my routine to keep it in a drawer since it doesn’t stand up and thus cannot sit in my medicine cabinet with all of my other skincare products. Pleasantly surprised
