I’m currently using both the regular cream and the rich cream, which I bought with my own coins, and I find both products wonderful. I paired the cream with my usual toners and serums, and they work together beautifully. (Though I do think the cream on its own might be not enough for very dry skins.) I almost feel the regular cream has a slightly tightening effect, because I can seriously see a difference in my face the second day. My skin now has this reflective quality because it’s tighter if that makes any sense?? Also my skin texture has been much better and smoother since using this product. The price is a little bit steep but I’m willing to cut out other products that are more of a fluff because the cheaper products do add up quickly but don’t offer even remotely close of a result. Just beautiful.
