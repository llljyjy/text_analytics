This cream is very light in texture andseems more of a treatment than amoisturizer. In my younger years when I wasoilier I would have preferred a lightweightmoisturizer like this one. However, now inmy mid-40s I prefer a slightly heaviercream and when purchasing I definitelywould choose the the The Cream or TheRich Cream. But any product fromAugustus Bader is a stellar product! Love The Light Cream
