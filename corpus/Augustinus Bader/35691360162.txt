In my younger days I often went out in the California sun without a hat or sun screen and my face paid the price.  I have some small areas that are just always red and perhaps unrelated I had permanent dry skin just above my eyebrows.  Now the dry skin is GONE and the red is much less red than before.  Super happy with these results. Super happy with these results
