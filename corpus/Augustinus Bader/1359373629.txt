This is a really great product. It’s light and refreshing. It’s enough to hydrate my skin without needing to use a separate moisturizer. I have combination and am currently using cream face makeup. If I don’t use this product, I’ll look really greasy/sticky. If I do use it, my cream blends in flawlessly and looks matte. Does as it says
