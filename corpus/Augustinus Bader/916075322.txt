So I waited a few weeks to be able to use the product before writing my review. I have combination skin, in my 40s and sensitive. So if my skin was going to have a reaction it would have happened. It does what it says - moisturizes but is mattifying. Usually my skin produces oil in my t-zone and I either blot it or use pressed powder but it has not been as necessary when using this cream. My makeup goes on beautifully over it and my skin feels velvety all day. The only con I could find is the price. nan
