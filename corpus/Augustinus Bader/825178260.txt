I received a full-sized bottle of Augustinus Bader Light Cream for free from Influenster for my honest review of the product.  The product packaging is beautiful except for the fact that the bottle is rounded at the bottom so it cannot stand up on its own (which I find annoying).  One pump is about all your need for your face and neck which you apply in an upwards sweeping fashion, on clean, dry skin.  It was easy to apply and I found my skin to feel soft and moisturized, even eight hours later yet it was not greasy looking at all.I also really appreciate the care they took when creating this product as it is vegan, without any fragrance, and the packaging is 100% recyclable. Again though, the round bottom is very annoying especially since the sides are also round so you have to make sure it doesnâ€™t roll off the bathroom counter. Great product, annoying packaging
