This is a light lotion that has a beautiful, soft-matte finish on the skin. It softens, smoothes, and plumps my skin, but it would not be enough in the winter months and for really dry areas of my 50-years old, combination skin. Also, I didnâ€™t notice this on my face, but on my hands, the softened, smoothed and plumped effect lasted even after hand washing! For those of you who wants to store this on a flat surface, you can remove the outer aluminum tubing. nan
