I received a complimentary bottle of this cream from Influenster in consideration for my honest opinion.  I have used this product for almost three weeks now and although I love the consistency, I don’t feel it’s worth the high price tag. The formula is lightweight and it absorbs quickly, but I didn’t notice any improvements in elasticity, firmness, or wrinkle reduction.  It feels nice on the skin and I love that it is pretty much unscented, but I don’t feel it’s special.  I am also confused by the packaging.  It comes in a metal test tube casing that doesn’t stand up on its own. I figured out how to remove the casing, but for the price, the packaging should be more user friendly. I had higher expectations for this cream
