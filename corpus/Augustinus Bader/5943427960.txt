Writing this now that my bottle is empty and I’ve had several months to see how well it works. I honestly do not think this is worth the price whatsoever. I bit the bullet and bought it during the VIB sale, and even with 20% off I don’t feel that it was worth it. It’s not bad and it absorbs very quickly, which I liked, but there’s no magic here! I did not see any difference in skin tone or aging. I personally have preferred my la roche posay over this AB one. If you can comfortably afford this, try it out, but if it feels like a splurge, I’m telling you it’s not worth it...you’ll probably get the same or better results with a consistent skincare routine using more affordable products. dont do it girl its not worth it
