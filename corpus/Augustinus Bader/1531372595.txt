This cream is very lightweight and blends into your skin nicely without leaving an oily residue.  I like that is is so lightweight I can wear it under my makeup but also moisturizing enough to wear at bedtime.For efficacy I can definitely see my fine lines disappearing and pores becoming less visible.  Another thing about this product that people will appreciate is that it is vegan and contains no dyes or scents.I will definitely be purchasing in the future! Light but moisturizing
