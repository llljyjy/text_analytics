I had been wanting to try this based on what I’d seen in recent media so I grabbed the small size during the big 20% off anything in Sephora event. I will definitely go back for the large size when I’m out of the small size. I absolutely love the texture. It’s not too heavy nor is it nonexistent. I feel dewy and glowy after using it. I generally use it during the day on clean skin when I plan on going barefaced. I use it all the way up to my lower lash line and forego eye cream. I’ve seen reviews that said that it pills when you apply it over other products. I can’t speak to that, but every so often when I’m not barefaced, I apply a tinted sunscreen or Ilia Super Serum Skin Tint and concealer over this moisturizer. These products sit beautifully on top of The Cream. It’s pricey but a little goes a long way. Love it so much! Love love love!
