I received this free from Influenster for my honest review. I would classify my skin as oily so I was excited to give this a try! Interestingly, the container is rounded on the bottom so it has to be stored on its side (doesn’t bother me). The delivery of product is done through a smooth and easy to use pump - I need two pumps to cover my face (volume of two pumps shown in image). There is a soft but quickly fleeting medicinal smell when first applied.  The texture (a cross between a lotion and a gel) provides for an easy application and it is hydrating without being greasy.  I have worn solo and under makeup and can absolutely notice a vast decrease in oiliness that lasts all day!  Also, didn’t cause any breakouts! Would definitely consider repurchasing once my bottle is empty even with the hefty price tag as this stuff does really work and omits the need to blot and powder through out the day. Holy Grail Daily Face Lotion!
