I received a complimentary jar of AugustinusBader - The Ultimate Soothing Cream to try andreview. Upon unboxing, I was exited to try it once Isaw ’Soothing’ as my skin tends to be sensitive,sometimes itchy, and irritated. I tried it on myhands first, and it went on so creamy & buttery!! Idid half of the back of my hand and the differencewas huge! It seemed to blur any lines and was sosoft to the touch. It had stayed that way for hours!I used it on my face daily, and I notice a differencein fine lines on my forehead, the “11’s“ and overallappearance. It’s expensive cream, that’s why I removed a star, but it’s awesome! Thanks for letting me try it Influenster!! Like Butter!
