I waited a few weeks to see the impact before posting. This cream is amazing and worth it. I have combination skin with acne scars from my late teens/early 20â€™s. This cream has made my skin soft, more supple, less inflamed and gives me a glow. My skin feels hydrated and not oily. This was the only new thing I added to my skincare routine and it looks the best it has in years. nan
