Very expensive with zero results; my skin is just as dry as before. I previously was using Skinceuticals triple lipid cream which is half the price and effective. Always open to trying something that might be better I tried this product but... it’s all hype, don’t waste your money. Feels good but... it’s all surface and doesn’t have lasting effects at all. Overpriced with no lasting results.
