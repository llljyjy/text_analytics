I’m currently age 55. At age 46, I went through chemotherapy/ mastectomy for breast cancer and required a hysterectomy. Due to the type of breast cancer I had, I could not use hormone replacement therapy after my hysterectomy because the hormones could feed my cancer. I noticed that I really started to age fast. I’ve always been very diligent about taking care of my skin but the aging really seemed accelerated. The Cream is the only product that has given me that “Aha Moment.”  It is very noticeable for me. Although it is expensive it is a must have for me. I’ve tried them all regardless of price but this one stood out for me. It’s the only one that I won’t do without. No other product compares to the results for me. I’m giving it a 4 star rating only because of the price. But the product itself amazes me and I am not easily impressed. Love this product! “Aha Moment”
