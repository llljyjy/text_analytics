First, let me say that this product works well at preventing shine and improving your complexion. After a couple weeks I noticed a smoother and supple complexion with less fine lines & wrinkles. The cream is light, and although it claims to be I scented, I noticed a strange scent. It provides a matte finish, which may be too much for those with dry skin. I noticed flaking when I rubbed my face & hands, however, the product works well under foundation. A quick note about packaging: itâ€™s interesting! You have to twist & pull the capsule down to get to the flat tube that will stand on your cabinet. It Works Well! Packaging is Interesting
