I tried this cream for a week and I believe itâ€™s well and enough time to see some results. I definitely had some moisture and less shine. There was no irritation and no strong scent. I will continue to use it to see more results. I apply this about 5 mins after washing my face in the AM. Nice light weight cream/serum
