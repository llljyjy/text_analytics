The light cream is as the name says a light cream so if you looking for a heavy moisturizer then I would skip this one. Overall I liked it. I just felt my skin needed a little more so I added my favorite moisturizer on top of it. Itâ€™s almost no smell to it which I enjoyed. Also no breakout or irritation to my skin. nan
