I have very oily skin so I love the idea of this lessening oil over time and shrinking pores. It’s a very light formula. Like a lotion, not a silicone feel. It sunk into my skin right away. It didn’t mattify like I thought it would.  I didn’t notice any immediate changes as I’ve been using it for 4 weeks. I think I need more time but I’m excited because I do have some fine lines around my eyes. This fills in the lines nicely but it isn’t a permanent change yet. It definitely feels like a great moisturizer in the time I’ve been using it. I like how it doesn’t leave my skin feel greasy. It’s nice that it isn’t irritating. When I try a new skincare routine, I worry about rashes. nan
