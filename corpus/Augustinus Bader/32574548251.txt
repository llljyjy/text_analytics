I received this product for free from Augustinus Bader and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using it for a while now, and I have to say that I don’t like it at all. The product has a very rich, creamy texture. It’s so greasy, and doesn’t absorb quickly. I haven’t noticed any difference in my skin yet, and it’s so expensive as well. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this product. nan
