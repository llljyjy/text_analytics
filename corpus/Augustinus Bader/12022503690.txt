This cream is amazing! Word to the wise, though- it’s THICK. A little dab will do you! And I’ve been using this product about 2 months and I still haven’t figured out the perfect routine for it! My face was INCREDIBLY dry when I first started using it, so using it twice a day for over a week worked GREAT! ... Until it made my face INCREDIBLY oily. I cut down to once a day. Now I use it every other day, only at night. I really liked the fact that the jar was refillable, and the lotions snap in/out! The scent was incredibly neutral- almost undetectable (which made me nervous, because I kept thinking it should smell like something!) This honestly was a treat to use, and one jar will last an incredibly long time! Apply when your face feels like it needs a SUPER hydrating boost! THICC
