The things I like: the lightweight (almost gel-like) texture* No fragrance * soaks in quickly * is not greasy The only thing I do not like is the level of moisture it gives, but this is relative to each person’s skin type so it’s not necessarily a negative for everyone. I have acne prone skin that tends to dry out because of retinol use so I need a higher level of moisture. overall thumbs up
