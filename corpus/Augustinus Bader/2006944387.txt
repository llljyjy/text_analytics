This cream really smooths out the skin and gives it a “flawless“ look. I use a moisturizer on top of this because I have really dry skin, but it may not be necessary. It’s a amazing cream. I use it several days a week - On the other days, I use Le Mer’s moisturizing soft cream and Orlane’s super moisturizing concentrate. Great cream - smooths skin & leave flawless look
