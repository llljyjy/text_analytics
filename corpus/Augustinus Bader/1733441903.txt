I really liked this cream, it is light weight and perfect for summer.  I found I needed a sleeping mask a couple of times a week, but other than that it was great.  The package is designed to be kept upside down but it isn’t terribly stable, I would like it a little wider and a little shorter.  I also would have liked the writing upside down so I didn’t keep trying to automatically stand it right side up.  Nice packaging but needs a little tweaking.  The formula of the cream is good though Nice light summer weight cream
