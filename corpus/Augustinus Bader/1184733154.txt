I received a deluxe trial size of this cream in a beauty box. I cannot understand why this cream is so expensive. It separated in the tube and smelled slightly rancid. It squeezed out easily, but was so hard to spread. It also left a white cast on my face. I have tried drug store creams that perform better than this. Save your money. This is not it. Not Worth The Price Tag
