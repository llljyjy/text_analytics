I had a few extra dollars to spend, so I bought this. Biggest shopping mistake of my life. This cleanser is absolutely amazing. At the time, I was also searching for new skincare products and to be honest, this stayed as my only skincare item for a while (I couldn’t find a moisturizer that checked all the boxes for me). Well, this became an all-in-one skincare routine for me: never left my skin dry, kept my oily forehead and chin perfectly balanced, prevented future breakouts, boosted my skin’s healing of pimple scars and left my face looking and feeling plump and cleansed everyday. It lasted me five months. Yeah. So, if you’re ready to be unsatisfied with possibly all future purchases of cleansers in your life, then buy this. Biggest shopping mistake of my life.
