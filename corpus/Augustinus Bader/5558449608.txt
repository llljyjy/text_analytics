I just started using this moisturizer and already know I’m going to have to continue to buy it. It leaves my skin supple but also matte (in a good way) as so I’m not overly shiny. I really love that it is a vegan formula without fragrance, irritants, and allergens. Any redness I may have going on this cream has helped calm it down as well. All around great moisturizer!
