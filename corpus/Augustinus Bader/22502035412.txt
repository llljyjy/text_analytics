Iâ€™m so happy that Influenster sent me the Augustinus Bader - The Light Cream to review. The first thing that caught my attention was how sophisticated and expensive the packaging appears. Right from the very beginning, you are greeted with luxury. The feel of the cream is lightweight as the name implies, while providing a really nice level of moisture to the skin, leaving it feeling smooth and supple. I also appreciate that there is no detectable sent to this cream. I have sensitive skin that is often irritated by heavy fragrance. Overall, using the Augustinus Bader - The Light Cream has been a wonderful experience. Luxurious
