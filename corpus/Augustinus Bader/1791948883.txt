I was excited to try this product. I live in Washington DC and try to walk everywhere even in the middle of August. It was literally built on a swamp and most days you can feel it! The product is meant to hydrate with a light touch for just this type of climate.   At first glance, the packaging seemed sleek and futuristic but it was actually sort of awkward to use. Only one surface is flat so it has to sit upside down. Not exactly aesthetically pleasing for the counter top.   Of course, it is what is inside that counts. I didnâ€™t notice much of a difference from other moisturizers that I typically use at a better price point. But what was really disappointing was that I found it to pill and ball up under my makeup. Just not worth it. Lot of Hype, Poor Results
