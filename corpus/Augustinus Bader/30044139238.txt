I’ve gotten so many nice products on Influenster but I think this is my absolute favorite! I am so happy I got the opportunity to test and review this cream. It is super hydrating but also instantly absorbs and feels great in the summer, not heavy at all. It seems to mattify my skin and skin looks instantly better with this cream. There’s no bad scent to this, it is all around just the perfect moisturizer. You hear of products where you instantly fall in love and see these amazing results, and this is definitely that product Wow!
