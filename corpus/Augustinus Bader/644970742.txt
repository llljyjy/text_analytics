I really liked the light cream.  I think it’s a great summer weight product.  It works really well with primers, foundations and highlighters, I didn’t experience any piling which was nice.  I have really dry skin so I’m not sure this would be enough in the winter, it would need to be paired with other things.  If you are normal/combo skin it will prob be fine year round. nan
