I have combination skin so finding the perfect moisturizer is tricky. After a double cleanse, toner and serum I applied a nickel size amount of The Light Cream from Augustinus Bader to my face twice daily for 3 weeks and I noticed a softer well moisturized face and décolleté. My face has actually never looked any better and it is very light and weightless on the skin. My face didn’t have any break outs and I love this cream. I have found my new go to moisturizer. Great weightless face cream
