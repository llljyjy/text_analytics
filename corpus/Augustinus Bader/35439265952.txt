It wasn’t the ’hype’ surrounding this product that drew me in, but the ingredients - Retinol, 2 forms of Vitamin C and even ’Ceramide NP’, Interestingly none of these are present in the ’rich version’ which contains more emollients and less of the beneficial stuff. It’s very rare to find two formulations of a product, with the one aimed at oilier and younger skin types turning out to be the better of the two! Anyhow, I used this daily as instructed, followed by SPF until I’d used up the product. It absorbs quickly and has a very light scent to it which reminds me ever so slightly of a bakery with a hint of cocoa powder! Packaging is stunning too. Did I notice better skin? Yes, a slightly brighter, more even and hydrated complexion for sure. But...nothing out of the ordinary. In fact speaking of ordinary I could achieve the same results with an assortment of The Ordinary serums (which I’ve also tried extensively) and all for about 1/15th of the price of a full size jar of this, and they would last much longer too! This is why I cannot give ’The Cream’ 4 or 5 lippies, the price point is just absurd. If I can achieve similar results for less money, why would I pay more?  ~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~(My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)1.
