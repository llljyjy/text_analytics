The brand has already captured my heart.The packaging is so luxurious and stunning that it caught my attention. Also, because of the fact you can buy a refill, I love sustainable products.The natural and gingery smells are also a plus for me, as I get easily annoyed with fragrances. I loved the quality of the moisturizer and the glow it left on my skin. The best glow ever!
