Beautiful packaging and product as always with Kora. I am liking this cleanser in my AM routine. It is a gel that lathers well. It is effective at cleansing and overall a very nice product. The stand-out is how invigorating and refreshing it is which is why I prefer this in my AM routine. It has a similar minty zing like the Minty Hydration Mist. Lovely Cleanser
