This moisturizer from Kora is so nice and hydrating for my dry skin. I love the fact that numeric is a main ingredient because of the antioxidant properties. This cream glides on the skin and has a lovely subtle glow to it. It leaves my skin glowing and radiant! I love to use this as a base for makeup or as a night cream, itâ€™s very versatile like that! Hydrating and glowy!
