This is such a refreshing cleanser! First off, the bottle has a really nice look and feel to it - very high quality. I used this to wash my face/remove my makeup in the evening for my first use and was surprised by the level of minty scent, but not in a bad way! I used three pumps and was able to easily remove my face makeup, and with a little more gentle coaxing, my (non-waterproof) eye makeup too. The cleanser had a light gel consistency and came out of the pump without any problems, and it became a gentle foam as I rubbed it in. My skin felt fresh and cool afterwards, with a slightly drier feel than using a cleansing balm but definitely still “fresh” and not over-stripped. Using in the morning is even nicer as the scent is really invigorating and I feel like this will be great for summer when I’m feeling more oily (my skin is usually on the drier side). Nice and fresh and feels fancy
