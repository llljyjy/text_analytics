I love this oil. First time trying anything from Kora beauty and this one is surprisingly pleasant formula. Smells really nice, oil os so lightweight and absorbs really quick. Leaves skin soft and hydrated all day, I notice that my skin becomes more even and feels softer after the application. Nice oil for winter months
