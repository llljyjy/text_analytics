First off, the packaging is GORGEOUS. And the fact that it’s refillable makes it 10x better. The cream itself has a beautiful texture, it’s a very thin, runny cream that absorbs in the skin very easily. My skin is sensitive and reactive and I was overall very pleased with this product! Thin texture and love the refillable packaging!
