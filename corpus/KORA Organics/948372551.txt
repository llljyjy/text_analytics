This is my first time trying a face oil with Noni Extract.  I have combination skin that gets very oily in the t zone.  My skin has done great with the other ingredients of rosehip and sea buckthorn oils in the past and the addition of noni extract blended in beautifully.  I used this as a last step and more of a ritual, really blending into my face.  I also tried it with a moisturizer on top.  After using it both ways, I like that I can really blend it in as a ritual or use quickly depending on how tired I am.  My skin looks healthier and hydrated the following morning no matter how I apply. nan
