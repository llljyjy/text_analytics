I have tried Kora products before and was impressed, so I was very excited to try this product. I always love the exquisite packaging. Most of the products have tumeric in them and this isnâ€™t an exception, but it makes them perfect for brightening the complexion. There is a scent but not overwhelming. It lathers enough to get your face clean but not feeling stripped! I am very satisfied with this product!! nan
