I recently received the Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser from KORA Organics. I have skin on the dry side, with my nose and chin area leaning more towards combination skin. A lot of cleansers I use leave my skin feeling tight or even “stripped” (unless they are specifically for heavy moisturizing, but then some of those don’t feel like they provide a deep enough cleanse). However, this cleanser is nice because it feels like I’m getting a sufficient cleanse, but since it’s got a lot of hydrating ingredients my skin doesn’t feel tighter after using. I was pleasantly surprised to see that aloe is the first ingredient, which is very soothing for skin. I also love turmeric since it gives my skin a natural, subtle tint and glow. It has a strong peppermint scent, but it didn’t bother me too much since it fades after rinsing and this cleanser contains clean ingredients. My skin was left cleansed while still retaining some moisture. I think it’s perfect for morning cleansing in particular and can be used summer or winter since it has hydrating properties. Overall, a nice cleanser that is gentle on skin. nan
