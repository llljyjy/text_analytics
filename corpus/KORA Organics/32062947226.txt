I have combo skin and this moisturizer can be a hit or miss. For me personally this moisturizer is strictly a night time moisturizer that almost acts as a sleeping mask. this is very thick and It felt a little too much for day time use for me. The container is absolutely beautiful but I would prefer something with a pump for sanitary reasons. this does work well as a night time moisturizer and my skin wakes up nice and bouncy. thick and nourishing.
