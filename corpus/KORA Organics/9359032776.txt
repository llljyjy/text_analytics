Honestly this is my first ever Kora product and I have some thoughts - this cleanser is VERY expensive, usually I prefer investing into treatments instead of dropping $40+ on a cleanser but I must say this is a very nice brightening cleanser … it almost pains me to say this but the quality is definitely there, you’re paying for the experience guys! Is this a necessity? No! Is this a super luxurious cleanser you can get to treat yourself? Absolutely! nan
