This cleanser was gifted by Kira organics in exchange of my honest opinion. The first thing that amazed me about this cleanser was its amazing fragrance. It like fresh peppermint that just energized you and makes me feel so refreshed and ready for the day. It is very gentle, lathers lightly and deep cleans the skin, removing all oils and dirt. Skin feels so clean, fresh and dewy after the wash. It doesnot strip the skin or make it feel dry, which I really loved.I actually feel so therapeutic after I use this cleanser, the fragrance kind of calms your senses and you feel relaxed. It has natural ingredients like turmeric, aloe Vera, rosemary and peppermint essential oil which really makes it so great for all skin types. Love it
