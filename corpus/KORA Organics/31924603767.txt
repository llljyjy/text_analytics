I do love a good gel cleanser that foams up quite nicely and washes away easily. It doesn’t leave my skin feeling stripped or dry and has been a great addition as a second cleanse in my routine. I find the scent light yet refreshing and not overpowering in any way. If you’re a gel cleanser fan, this is one I’d recommend checking out. Foamtastic
