I’ve used this for a couple of weeks and found it’s really helped rehydrate and moisturize my skin. I have combination skin so I need products with balance. I’ve always found turmeric to be beneficial to my skin because it gives it a really nice glow without my skin feeling or looking oily. The texture is delicate but blankets the skin with a nice nourishing thickness. I definitely plan to keep using this and update through out my journey. This is also refillable so that’s worth mentioning. Did I mention how gorgeous this packaging is?! Soooo stunning. Deep hydration and moisture
