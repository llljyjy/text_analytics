The texture of the face oil is lightweight and silky.  It is on the watery side, however it does not feel too sticky and absorbs well. I have combination skin. You can smell a vanilla yet clean smell, from the formula, but it is not overbearingâ€™. I am currently using this every morning after cleansing my face and wait about one minute so it fully absorbs.  A little product goes a long way so the dropper really helps with applying too much! I use two drops in the morning because I use them at night as well.  I follow it up in the morning with my SPF moisturizer and there has been no irritation. This product works really well with others. My makeup goes on flawlessly without any pilling. After a few days of using this, I have noticed my skin feels brighter, less dull, and improved skin tone, as well as dark spots. Overall, I am genuinely impressed and highly recommend it to others! Incredible Face Oil!
