First, the jar is absolutely stunning, my daughter wants to keep it for “stuff” when I’m done with it!! This rich, yellow cream is amazing!  The smell is more of a clean earthy smell, which I enjoy.  Not too fruity or flowery.  It rubbed into my skin so nicely, and really did wonders for my skin.  It’s getting colder here, so my skin really needed this, as it’s getting dry!  Would definitely recommend! Amazing!
