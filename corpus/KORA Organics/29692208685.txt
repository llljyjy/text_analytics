I have really dry skin, which can also be combined with eczema patches on my face, so a heavy duty moisturizer is what I need. This product is amazing. The formula feels thick at first but once it is massaged into the skin it almost feels weightless to me and that may just be me because my skin demands heavy duty moisturizers. It doesnt feel oily on my skin after i have massaged it in, which i have found other moisturizers to leave behind. The smell is pretty strong and is obviously turmeric. Itâ€™s almost to strong for me, but I just avoid using it directly under my nose and will use like Vaseline that I also put on my lips. I also love the refillable pods! Less harm for the environment, when ypu first purchase the product ypu get a very fancy glass container, AND the refill pod is cheaper to purchase than the first purchase option. Amazing for dry skin.
