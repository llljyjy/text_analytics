Under Hyped but Great Performer. This moisturizer is so great for daytime use and plays beautifully under makeup. I like that it is buildable. In other words you can layer more product on where you need it and it is not thick, shiny, or greasy. I also love that it has a slight green tone and does a wonderful job of slightly neutralizing and redness. Also, doesnâ€™t trigger my overly temperamental skin to break out. pleasantly surprised
