What a fantastic cleanser! My favorite start to each day. The first thing I noticed is the light peppermint scent that wakes me up and has a refreshing cooling sensation when I wash my face. The formula starts off gel-like like and when it’s mixed with water and I start washing my face it begins to lightly lather on the skin. I love that after using this cleanser my skin never feels tight or dry. It feels very refreshing and invigorating and I’m ready to start my day! Best part of my mornings!
