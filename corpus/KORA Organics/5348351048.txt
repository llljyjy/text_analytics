Love this eye cream! I was drawn in by the natural ingredients, but I also love that I can purchase a refill for a cheaper price and be more eco-friendly while doing so. This eye cream has a really nice consistency and seems to soak into the skin instead of just sitting on top of it, like so many other eye creams do. My eye area is visibly brightened after using it. It’s nice to use morning or night because it also acts as a primer for your makeup. Love, love, love. I’m in my late 20s so I’m trying to start all of my preventative skincare now, and this is one of my new staples! I also have sensitive skin and this product has not made me break out or given me milia. Awesome natural eye cream
