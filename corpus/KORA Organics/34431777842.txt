I was pretty surprised by this. The packaging is cute but arrived with a damaged pump. I was able to fix it myself. It lathers quite well and effectively cleans my skin. It is very very minty and my whole face went instantly red. This subsided quickly and my skin did feel soft and supple, but I just wanted expecting some much mint initially. If you do not have sensitivities; this is a good cleanser. nan
