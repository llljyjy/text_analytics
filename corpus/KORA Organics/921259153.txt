I think we can all agree on how INCREDIBLE the packaging is. This had a lightweight gel-like texture but performed like a cream. There was a slight herbal scent but went away after I applied it on. I loved how well it melted into my skin, gave me great hydration, and didn’t leave my face greasy or shiny. I have dry skin and thought it wasn’t going to moisturize me enough. However, it worked!! I didn’t break out, my face felt soft and smooth, and it’s a moisturizer that I can wear under makeup without a problem. I only needed just a small amount to help calm, soothe, and improve my skin. I totally recommend it. Great Hydration!!!
