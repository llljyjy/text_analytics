I love the idea of ​​it being refillable and this jar is very beautiful and luxurious.I have oily skin and this green gel is great for me, it’s not greasy at all.  It is an aqueous gel that is very easy to absorb. I’ve been using it during the day and it doesn’t make my skin oily, also I have noticed that the appearance of my pores has improved.  At the moment I am happy. Good for my oily skin
