Firstly, the packaging is absolutely gorgeous and I really appreciate the eco friendly refill pod aspect. It absorbs quickly and the ingredients in this moisturizer definitely have left my skin brighter and more even but it doesn’t quite give my skin the hydration it needs. This may work better for my very dry skin in the summer months when there’s more humidity, but in these cooler months I need more. It does have a fragrance but after a minute or so it becomes unnoticeable. nan
