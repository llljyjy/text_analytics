This cleanser has been a great second cleanse for me in my evening routine. It suds up to a nice foam and is easy to rinse off. My skin never feels dry or stripped after using which is always a plus. However, there’s not enough focus on the fact that this product is minty, which I wasn’t really expecting. It has a peppermint scent and makes your face feel really cold after drying off because of the mint. It feels nice for summer, but I don’t think I’d like using this in the winter.  Overall, it’s a really great product though and I will definitely be getting this for my summer routine! Note: Minty!
