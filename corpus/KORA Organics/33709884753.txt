If you have combination or oily skin, this will most likely be your new favorite product ever. The smell, the sustainability of the packaging, and texture are all honestly phenomenal. However, I have severely dry skin, so this product was not as hydrating that I would like it to be as it was on the thinner consistency side. Great for combination or oily skin
