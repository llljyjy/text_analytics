My skin loves algae products and this new Kora moisturizer is no exception! This lightweight and creamy gel moisturizer not only makes my skin feel hydrated all day - it has been helping to keep my skin clear. Because this feels so cool and refreshing going on, I think it would be a good one to keep in a skincare fridge for a nice cooldown during the summer months! Very refreshing!
