This packaging!!! It’s stunning! This is a nice, clean moisturizer that offers a good hydration to my skin. It’s more of a gel consistency which I find is better for my dry skin in the summertime when I get slightly less dry and need less moisture. It isn’t fragranced which is great. Lightweight and clean
