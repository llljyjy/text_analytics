I received this product in exchange for review. All thoughts and opinions expressed are my own. $42 for a cleanser is goofy. Claiming that “citrine infused” face wash helps being “joy and confidence” is goofy. Pepperminting a product to the point that it feels and smells like washing your face with toothpaste spit is goofy. The only thing I like about this is that it doesn’t strip the skin leaving it feeling tight TOO much. There are better, less expensive options. Face wash shouldn’t tingle
