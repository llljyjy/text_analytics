Kora Organics became part of my morning routine & makeup routine and I absolutely love it!! It gives me a beautiful natural glow and when I wear makeup it doesn’t look oily and I’m here for it. The consistency is amazing, such a soft feeling when applying it my face, I like the thickness of it and it smells so nice. I usually have oily skin but lately I’ve been having really dry skin and by using Kora Organics Turmeric glow moisturizer and their  Noni Glow Face Oil  I’ve noticed a big change on my skin. The dryness is going away and my skin looks so smooth now. A must have in my routine!
