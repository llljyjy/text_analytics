This is a very interesting moisturizer! It has a super lightweight texture, where itâ€™s almost a liquid. It moves around in the jar almost like liquid but it spreads on your skin super smoothly! It takes a second for it to go into your skin, but once it does, it leaves a healthy glow (not overly wet or oily). This plays well with other serums and layers as well. Very spreadable moisturizer
