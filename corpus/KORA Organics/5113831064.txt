Creamy thick texture but not heavy on the skin! I found it to absorb quickly into the skin without leaving it feeling sticky, just hydrated and a small glow. Minimal scent to it almost minty with a touch of citrusy smell. Overall very nice moisturizer, gave it 4 starts cause I havenâ€™t yet seen a difference in skin nan
