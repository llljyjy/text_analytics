I’m really enjoying this cleanser. First of all, the packaging is very solid and high quality and I love the fact that it comes in a pump since that is my favorite format for a cleanser.This cleanser goes from a gel to a foamy consistency that does not dry out my skin. I use this as a second cleanser in my double cleansing routine or even by itself and it does a good job of removing makeup, sunscreen and other impurities.I love the ingredient list as aloe vera is one of my favorite ingredient because of how soothing it is. It also contains turmeric, which has great anti inflammatory and antioxidant properties.It has a minty scent that does not irritate my skin and feels very energizing.Overall I’m really enjoying this product and has already become a staple in my daily cleansing routine! Good cleanser for dry skin! Beautiful bottle too
