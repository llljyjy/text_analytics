Turmeric has always been used for skincare in my household. I love the formula of this moisturizer and it has improved my skin texture over use. It has a slight fragrance of turmeric which I donâ€™t like but it goes away in just a few minutes. Overall very happy with the product. Turmeric is always gold for skin.
