I really like this product but you need to experiment with it. When I first received the product I was using it every day in the morning and before i went to sleep. I started noticing that I was breaking out more than usual so I decided using it less because I really liked how my skin looked and felt after I used it. After some trial and error, I now use it every 2-3 days only at night. This was it doesnâ€™t make me break out and I wake up to glowy skin. nan
