I love how lightweight and bouncy this moisturizer is! Itâ€™s the perfect day time moisturizer for me because it hydrates while also removing excess oil and leaving no shine. My face feels softer and looks more even toned whenever I use it too! My pores are smoothed as well! It instantly calms and soothes which I love because I have dry skin. The texture is perfect for quick absorption so it wears well under makeup. Perfect lightweight moisturizer!
