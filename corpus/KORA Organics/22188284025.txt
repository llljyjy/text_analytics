I am usually buying products because of ingredients and my personal needs. I am not usually swayed to buy a product because of pretty packaging alone. Week ago I received new Kora Moisturizer for review and oh my God I fell in love. The Moisturizer jar looked like it had crystal on it and it glowed. My skin is sensitive and I always worry about moisturizers. I notice that my skin is smoother than before, but itâ€™s only been a week. I love that is A clean, certified organic. nan
