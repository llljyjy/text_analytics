This moisturizer is perfect for my dry skin! I apply it every night after cleansing my face and my skin is glowing! It feels hydrated and fresh and I love the light/slightly grainy texture. I also like that the turmeric smell isnâ€™t too strong, especially when using the Kora Noni Glow face oil after! Perfect for dry skin!
