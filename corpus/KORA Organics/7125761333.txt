I have really enjoyed this Kora moisturizer. I use this in the morning and at night after cleansing my face. A small amount goes a long way. I donâ€™t absolutely love the scent of this, but it makes my skin feel so smooth. It has a lovely calming sensation. I can really feel a difference after a couple of uses in elasticity. I love the lightweight texture and the way this just melts into my skin. This moisturizer also sits well under foundation. 10/10 would recommend checking this out! My new favorite!
