Started off great but after 6 weeks of use I’m noticing my undereye skin has become dark red & flakey/uneven as if its being exfoliated?  Perhaps an ingredient is causing this but I can’t use it anymore because of the uneven texture its causing :( otherwise it was a great heavier moisturizer for my dry undereyes.  Not for me.  Unfortunately its past the return date so I’m stuck with a $70 eye cream that I cant use. Causing flakiness & redness
