I really loved this moisturizer. It’s thick and creamy but melts right into your skin. Not sticky at all. I was worried maybe the turmeric would give it a weird smell but it’s good. Kinda like a nice citrus minty smell. My skin looked and felt very hydrated and dewy after using this. I definitely love it and recommend Love it
