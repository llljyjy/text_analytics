First of all, I want to acknowledge that I am obsessed with the refillable jar that it comes in! The package is absolutely 10 out of 10. I love incorporating this moisturizer into my morning skincare routine. I typically prefer using gel moisturizer, and this one is just perfect; it is lightweight so it easily absorbs into the skin. Perfect & Lightweight!
