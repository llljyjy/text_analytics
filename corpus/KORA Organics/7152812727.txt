Love, love, love this moisturizer for my nightime routine! For context, I have oily skin. It is a little thick and has a strong turmeric smell, but the benefits are incredible. I wake up with such glowy, plump skin every morning. Even though it’s a thicker consistency, I don’t feel greasy whenever I use it. nan
