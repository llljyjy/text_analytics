For years now I’ve been following the Kora brand via Miranda Kerr’s Instagram page and have finally gotten around to getting my hands on this. Where do I start? It’s perfect at keeping my skin lightly hydrated - I just use 2 drops on an evening as it’s too rich for me to use during the day, and I wake up to supple, softer and more glowing skin, which to be fair I kind of half-expected as the ingredients in here are fantastic, as well as organic. Any acne scars are cleared up in half the usual time when using this and somehow it also seems to keep (monthly) acne on my chin from popping up as prominently as it normally would (although I wouldn’t use this if you have teenage acne, only the odd blemish). To boot it’s also non-perfumed - yet still manages to smell great, its vegan-friendly and the bottle looks so elegant and classy, yet simple. I’m a sucker for fancy packaging but not at the expense of good quality and natural ingredients, and this manages to combine the best of both worlds. Love it.
