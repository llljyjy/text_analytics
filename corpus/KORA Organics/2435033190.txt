I really liked how this moisturizer felt on my skin! Also can we talk about the packaging sooo pretty!! It’s not too thick it’s just perfect enough to keep you moisturized the whole day. I’ve been using it before applying my primer then followed with my foundation and it makes my makeup look so good! Overall I’m very impressed with this moisturizer and will def keep using. I love with this moisturizer
