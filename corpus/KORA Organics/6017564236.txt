Gifted by Kora Organics. This is a gel cleanser. It performs beautifully! I use it as a second cleanser, as I always double cleanse. It has peppermint and it does leave a cold feeling to the skin. It did not irritated my eyes, but I am not sensitive to that. I am not sure how would someone more sensitive would feel using this. It also has a strong scent, but it did not bother me. nan
