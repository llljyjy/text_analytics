I always love the packaging of KORA products and this one is no different (though, the size of the tub to actual moisturizer ratio is a bit off and I wouldn’t mind the overall packaging to be a smaller size since I live in a small space). The texture of the moisturizer is light, but I am not a fan of the scent. In addition, I’ve noticed a slight stinging feel when I use it though it dissipates quickly and doesn’t seem to cause any other adverse effects. nan
