My mother always encouraged me to use facial oil but it was never my thing. I tired InKey and Drunken Elephant but I was never my cup of tea. After reading the ingredients in Kora facial oil, I thought I would give it a try. I applied the oil as part of my night routine and it really amazes me for my skin feels after waking up. I feels my skin is nourished and glowed. It was a pleasant surprise that I am able to find ficus look that fits my skin nan
