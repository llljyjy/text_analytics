Ok, this is the oil you have been waiting for. I hate when an oil is greasy but this one is lightweight and luxurious. I used 2 drops for my face and 3 drops for my neck and décolleté and it is just pure moisturize. The scent is a light lemony scent which I love. Plus it doesn’t cause breakout for my oily skin. It is a bit pricey but I love it. nan
