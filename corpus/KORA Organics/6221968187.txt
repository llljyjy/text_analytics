Moisturizers are quite personal, and I have found that a lot of times they can be interchanged easily. This is a great lightweight option if you need something that hydrates but isn’t super heavy for summer. I really like the scent and that the packaging is reusable and sustainable, but I don’t think you would need to replace your regular moisturizer to this one if you already have one you love. This product is very nice and I really like the brand in general. If you’re contemplating it, definitely give it a try! nan
