I didn’t see any improvement after two weeks so I returned this for a different brand. This is a cleans and vegan item so that was a great sign for me to purchase. It had a nice scent. Very light and not sticky. I applied it with my fingertips. Held up well under my makeup. I just expected to see even the smallest results but this wasn’t for me. Glad I did try this line though. nan
