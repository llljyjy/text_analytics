This is such a dreamy moisturizer that’s multi-beneficial. It’s nourishing, hydrating, and provides glow. It’s thick so best to warm it up first with fingers or rub it against palms first for a smoother application. It feels deeply hydrating but not heavy or greasy. I appreciate that it’s clean and certified organic and the ingredients are amazing - turmeric extract, licorice extract, marine micro algae, and rosehip & maracuja oil. I love using this with their noni oil for the ultimate spa-glow. This is an incredible combo to maintain hydration and glow during the colder months. A MUST MOISTURIZER YEAR-ROUND!!
