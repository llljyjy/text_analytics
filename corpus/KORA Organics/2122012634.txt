I’ve been loving the KORA Organic turmeric glow moisturizer for my morning and evening routine. I like the texture, consistency, and how it absorbs into my skin. I wash my face, apply toner and serum and then follow-up with the turmeric glow moisturizer. It doesn’t have much of a smell, but would describe it as “earthy” without the intense smell of turmeric; the color will fool you but it doesn’t stain. I’ve noticed improvements on how smooth my skin feels and hydrated. It has been working well under makeup. I have oily/combination skin and it doesn’t leave my skin greasy, just a nice healthy glow. Definitely recommend! Smooth skin!!
