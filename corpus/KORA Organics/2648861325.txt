The Noni Glow face oil is one of my favorite facial oils. I have combination and sensitive skin, and this product did not break me out or irritate my skin at all. I use it at night to seal in all my other skincare products before I go to bed. I definitely notice my skin more hydrated and dewy after I wake up. The oil has a lightweight consistency and pleasant smell. Overall, would recommend! Amazing facial oil for sensitive combination skin
