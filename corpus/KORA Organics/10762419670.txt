I like this! I knew it had turmeric in it but for some reason was still surprised that it had a slight turmeric scent. It’s still pleasant though. It has a slight tingle on the skin, but doesn’t burn the eyes. It leaves the skin feeling really clean, even taking away make up. My skin felt really hydrated after. I’m curious how my skin will feel after long term use but so far I do like it and will continue to use it as my main cleanser. nan
