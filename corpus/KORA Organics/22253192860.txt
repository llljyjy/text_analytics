I have never tried Kora skincare before. Can we talk about the packaging? Gorgeous. A treat to see on your counter. Grabs everyone’s attention, friends ask about it. And it’s easy to say the product is just as good as the packaging. It’s light, but potent. You don’t need alot and it blends in so easy. My sensitive skin loves it. Once you run out, you can just purchase a replace pod. I am loving this. nan
