The texture of the moisturizer is super buttery and smooth. SInce the cream seems extremely nourishing, I prefer to apply it right after cleansing in the evening. I have a combination skin type, I can handle this moisturizer in the evening as a nourishing and rich step in my routine. The finish is satin with a bit of oily residue, at least for my combination skin. So I wouldnâ€™t recommend it to oily or acne prone skin types. The scent of the moisturizer seems a bit spicy for me, there is a hint of turmeric obviously, but I also scented mint in it too. very buttery & nourishing $ for dry & combo skin
