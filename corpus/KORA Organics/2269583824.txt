Iâ€™ve been seeing this product all over IG and wanted to see if it lived up to all the hype! Firstly, the glass packaging is so luxurious and looks beautiful in my bathroom. I apply this product to damp skin after removing my makeup. I love how the pump dispenses the perfect amount of cleanser. The smell is fresh & minty and the cleanser foams up immediately. During and after application, it leaves skin feeling minty fresh with a relaxing cooling sensation. This product leaves my skin feeling amazing, all traces of makeup were successfully removed, and my skin felt rejuvenated. Afterwards, my skin felt firm yet moisturized. My skin did NOT feel tight, stripped, or dry after application. Refreshing Cooling Sensation
