I love this eye oil. Very nourishing and replenishing. I did not have any issue with the quartz application roller. I put mine in my skincare fridge for even more of a cooling sensation. I would recommend storing this in a fridge if possible. Other reviewers mentioned product spoiling, refrigerating natural oils greatly increases their shelf life, helps maintain potency, and protects from spoiling/ going rancid. It is normal for natural oils to turn after prolonged storage at room temperature. I have used this alone and on top of my eye gel at night for added moisture. It helps with my crepe-y under eyes (after retinol thinned out my under eye skin)love it! nan
