This is my first time trying the Kora brand and I’m hooked! I was so impressed by this moisturizer! It’s a thicker consistency, almost like a balm, and it blends beautifully into the skin! Super hydrating (great for dry skin!) and leaves the skin with a healthy glow. Makeup also layers nicely over this product. Extra points for the refillable packaging! Gorgeous Glow!
