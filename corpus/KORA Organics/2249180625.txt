I am a Noni Oil stan! Like, holy grail of facial oils and will dramatically change your skincare routine. I’ll be honest, this cleanser isn’t anything special. Used morning and night for 2 weeks, I saw no major changes in my skin. I wasn’t expecting to either. Changes in skin take a minimum of 4 weeks (or one skin cell turnover cycle). My skin wasn’t stripped and I didn’t notice any new breakouts, so there are some positives. Overall, it’s a nice-to-have and not necessarily a need-to-have for me. Still will forever use the oil ;) Middle of the Road
