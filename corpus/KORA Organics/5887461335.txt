I’m very impressed with this facial oil. It’s surprisingly lightweight and sinks beautifully into the skin. It leaves my face feeling moisturized and looking supple. I have oily skin and I did t feel like it was too much. I would recommend this for anyone who wants to lock in moisture. Not Too Heavy
