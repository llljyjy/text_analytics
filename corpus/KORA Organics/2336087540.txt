I love a good facial oil and this one has become one of my favorites! I’ve used Kora products in the past and have loved them all and couldn’t wait to try this product by them! It’s so refreshing, it moisturizes, hydrates and brightens! It has some amazing ingredients and is a total skin savior! Love this oil!
