This face oil feels incredible!! It’s super hydrating and doesn’t leave a greasy residue on the skin. I have very dry skin so I apply this morning and night and it soaks right into the skin nicely and keeps my skin feeling so soft all day! I let it sink in before I apply any makeup and it hasn’t been an issue so I love it!! I was given this product for free from Kora, my opinion is the same! nan
