This is going to be a great moisturizer for the Fall/Winter months. It is not super thick but has enough thickness to it to keep my face moisturized. It has been chilly and raining where I live and my face feels great. I usually am oily around mid day in the summer months. If you are familiar with products with Turmeric in them then you will recognize the fragrance immediately. I personally love Turmeric based skincare so the scent doesnâ€™t bother me. nan
