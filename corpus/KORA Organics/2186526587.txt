I typically use vitamin C oil as the last step in my evening skincare routine. However, when I wake up my skin feels dry. I’ve been using this facial oil instead and I’ve been waking up with such soft, smooth skin. It is an oil so when you apply over your moisturizer you are going to look a bit oily but it felt more like a dry oil, not on you touch and your hands get oily! Wake up with smooth, soft skin!
