This is such a gentle foaming cleanser that cleanses the skin while not making it feel stripped. I love the smell, itâ€™s not strong but light and refreshing. The cleanser starts off as a gel but turns into a foam which feels great on the skin. I love using this is the morning because it makes my skin feel awake and refreshed. nan
