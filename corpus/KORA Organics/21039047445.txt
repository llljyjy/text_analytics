First, love the packaging of Kora Organics, it comes in a beautiful glass bottle, it is big, so it lasts for a while even using it everyday.  It foams once in contact with the water, it has a cooling effect that was unexpected for me, but it feels nice and refreshing after a long day outdoors.  It leaves my skin clean, soft and not dry, it is good for removing makeup residue and daily use, great for dry skin. nan
