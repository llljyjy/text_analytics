I absolutely love this moisturizer,  a little goes a long way too.  The consistency is rich and velvety,  I love how easy it absorbs into skin.  The scent is lovely,  it’s such a treat to use.  I have combination skin and it works perfectly,  doesn’t clog my pores. I love to use it in my PM routine to lock in moisture. Game Changer
