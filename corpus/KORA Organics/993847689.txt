KORA Organics…you had me at “Turmeric Glow”! Facial cleansers are one of my favorite products to try because they can provide such a beautiful sensorial experience that really jumpstarts my routine. With a combination of peppermint, palo santo, and rosemary aromatherapy to wake up both your skin and your senses, this foaming cleanser does not disappoint and is such a refreshing start to the day, especially during these hot summer days! It starts as a gel cleanser and works into a nice lather that makes for an excellent 2nd cleanse to remove any remaining dirt, makeup, excess sebum, etc. without dying out your skin or leaving it feeling tight and itchy. As far as reducing pigmentation, this will not do it alone but will make a great addition to anyone’s routine that’s looking to achieve brighter, glowing skin! nan
