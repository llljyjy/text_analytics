I live in New England and this oil provides excellent protection from the elements by locking in moisture. I didn’t realize that oils should be applied as a final step in the skincare routine, and by following the instructions and warming a few drops before applying as my finishing step I have seen great glowy results. I tend to apply this on days I’m not wearing makeup and/or at night as I have semi oily skin and don’t want to appear “shiny“ when going out. I will say it doesn’t make my face overly oily, just a nice glow and dew to it. Winter Potion
