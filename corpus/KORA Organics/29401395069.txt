I’ve enjoyed using the KORA Organics Active Algae Lightweight Moisturizer! It’s a dreamy, creamy lightweight gel moisturizer that works well with my combination skin. It’s good for all skin types. I like that it hydrates my skin without adding excess shine. I like the scent. It’s pleasant. Green algae is a new to me skincare ingredient that I am excited about. I think it’s calming and hydrating at the same time. It’s gentle on my skin. I use this product morning and night and have noticed positive results and more moisturization. The Active Algae Lightweight Moisturizer is energized with aquamarine, a stone believed to help calm and soothe. The packaging and container are gorgeous. The top looks like a giant Aquamarine gemstone! So pretty! I’ve enjoyed using this and have noticed moisturizing results! I appreciate that this product is vegan, gluten-free, cruelty-free, and comes in recyclable packaging. I’ve enjoyed using it and would recommend this product! Gentle and moisturizing!
