Beautiful luxurious product! First off, the packaging is nice and heavy and is so well made. Easy pump, pretty liquid gold consistency. The scent is light and fresh, somewhat minty. It foams up little bit. Love the skin afterwards, it felt so clean and renewed. Skin did not dry out and felt nice and firm. On the days when I donâ€™t wear makeup this cleanser does an awesome job  to remove oil and SPF. Love this cleanser for summertime hot days. Luxe Gold Goodness
