I just purchased this product online and of course it has no lid. I just think if I am spending over $50 on one product it should be guaranteed I receive the whole product. Clearly the box was tampered with so whoever packed my shipment should have been more aware to make sure my products were correct and present. Just so there is no confusion I obviously did not buy the refill. I purchased the full product. No cap
