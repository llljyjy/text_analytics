Seriously can’t find anything not to love about this moisturizer. Right out of the box, the packaging is gorgeous, the faceted lid is beautiful and looks great displayed on my vanity. For my combination skin, this provides the perfect hydration, although it may be too much for more oily skin types. I appreciate the design of the refillable jar, it’s also super easy to lock the refill back into the jar. nan
