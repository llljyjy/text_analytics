I really do like this moisturizer. Itâ€™s perfectly light, which I do prefer during the summer in the morning and evening. It works fabulous under makeup. It does have a scent though. I personally do not mind it but can see other people not like that it is fragranced. Also, i love that you can just refill the moisturizer! Summer staple
