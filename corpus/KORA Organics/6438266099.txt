-Sensitive skin Didn’t work for my skin. My skin react very fast if the product isn’t for me! So I did try & did break me out. I don’t know why but I have to return. And I bought the serum to. Since they mask is not working for me I’m returning both. So I most say for those with acne or sensitive skin like me? I wouldn’t recommend. very sensitive skin
