I love it overall but the misting nozzle gets clogged or breaks pretty quickly so have ended up patting it into face as a toner (which is nice but defeats the purpose of buying a mist). Never had this issue w their rose mist bottles so not sure what changed. The aloe in it seemed really gentle and effective in helping along the healing of a sunburn and it’s refreshing. No acne and good for sensitive skin when it actually comes out If it weren’t for the nozzle…
