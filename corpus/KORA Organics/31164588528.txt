This moisturizer is thick and creamy. It leaves a bit of a greasy feel, which may be because I use too much product, but I don’t mind at all because my skin is so dry. I really like the hydration and glow that I get. I also like that jar is refillable, which is great because it’s so pretty. Great Moisture
