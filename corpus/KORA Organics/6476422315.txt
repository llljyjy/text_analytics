This is a winner for my skin overall. It has a gentle, nonstripping lather that leaves my skin soft rather than tight. I like the ingredients list and feel like they do make a difference imo. It does have a potent peppermint smell so if you’re sensitive to that, take note. It’s also not perfect at removing eye makeup on its own I’ve noticed, but I use it as part of my double cleanse routine and it’s great in that capacity. I also like that the formulation is vegan and cruelty-free, and that the packaging is recyclable glass, which is important to me. nan
