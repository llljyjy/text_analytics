The temperature dipped low enough for the rich creams to come out, and Iâ€™m starting with Kora Organics turmeric glow moisturizer. The first ingredient is aloe leaf juice, and richness comes from a custom liposome. Turmeric, licorice extract, rice, and rose hip oil bring brightness (and a natural herby-gingery scent). The outer jar is refillable with drop-in inserts to cut down on plastic waste. Love the natural ingredients + refillable package
