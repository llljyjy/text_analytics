This is a great, thin and gentle cleanser! I pump out 2-3 pumps of this product onto my hand and lather with water until it suds up. The suds are very light and the consistency of this face wash is thin, but the cleansing power on your skin is great. One thing to note is that it doesn’t remove eye make up so make sure to pre-cleanse. The scent is reminiscent of turmeric and peppermint, which is really invigorating on the face as it feels minty. (No you don’t smell like turmeric afterwards!). I got some of the face wash and my eyes and was scared it would burn but it actually didn’t. Also bonus that it comes in a glass bottle! Minty and fresh!
