I was gifted the KORA Organics Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser. I find this to be a gentle cleanser. It has a jelly like texture and non stripping barely there suds. My skin never feels stripped after using this. I love the glass packaging and that the product is Vegan. The minty smell is strong but I find it invigorating. I also like the cooling effect this cleanser provides. Cooling refreshing gentle cleanser!
