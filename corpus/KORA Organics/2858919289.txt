Iâ€™m an average woman, not a blogger or an influencer. For a while I have been looking for a moisturizer with clean ingredients, follows through on its claim. Well, I found the gem of all gems for my 48 year old self. Wow wow wow! My skin feels and looks beautiful. Usually by late afternoon my face starts feeling dry, not with Turmeric Glow! I will be purchasing another to stock up! finally a moisturizer that works!
