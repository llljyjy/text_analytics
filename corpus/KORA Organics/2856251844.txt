This eye oil is amazing & so hydrating! I use it ALL over my eye area; upper eyelid, lower eyelid, crows feet area and even so far as my eyebrows. It has actually thickened my eyelashes and I noticed they are longer too. This doesn’t irritate my skin or cause any breakouts. It doesn’t pill under makeup or concealer either. My roller ball may have been a little stiff when I first opened but not a big deal. It rolls fine once it’s slicked with the oil. I love the concept of an oil just for the eye area too and enjoy the roller ball application since it’s sanitary and my hands never have to touch it. L❤️VE
