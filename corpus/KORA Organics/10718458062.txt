This cleanser is like no other I’ve ever used.  The peppermint ingredient made my lips and eyelids tingle and feel cold.  It was not necessarily a pleasant experience, but enough to not make  me reach for this although it’s a nice cleanser that did not strip my skin.  I used as step two in a double cleanse routine.  The scent is a bit off putting as well. nan
