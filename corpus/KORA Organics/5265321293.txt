This one of the very first products I’ve tried from Kora Organics and my skin has loved it. I have an oily skin type and I also large pores. So I don’t always like to add too much on my skin because I don’t want to clog my pores. However, with this turmeric glow moisturizer, it was so hydrating on my skin. I love applying it at night since it’s a thicker consistency and my skin loves it. Because it’s also a glowing moisturizer, I notice my skin having a bit of radiance. In the morning my skin feels super supple and hydrated. I personally love using it also on days when I go makeup-free. It gives me a healthy glowy complexion. I highly recommend.
