I really love this cleanser. It’s super refreshing with  a minty scent and leaves my skin with a refreshing tingle. I will say I can’t scrub my eye makeup off with this as the eucalyptus/mint can bother my  eyes a bit (hence the 4 stars instead of 5) but as long as I use eye make up remover first and then wash my face with this it’s great. I love how it foams up and it cleans really well without leaving my skin feeling dry. Overall I love it and recommend it. Love how it foams up
