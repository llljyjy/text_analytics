This face wash was gifted to me for my honest review, and so far I haven’t seen much of a difference in my overall skin. Nothing bad, nothing good, just the same. I do like how it feels on my skin. It smells like tea tree oil, which I love. I’ll be using this in the mornings because I feel like it gives me a burst of energy! nan
