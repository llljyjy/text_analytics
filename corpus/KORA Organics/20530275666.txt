Kora cleanser is so fresh and minty on the face, it feels amazing and rejuvenating. I use it once or twice a day, usually to remove my make up. I love the clean organic ingredients so much, my skin feels very clean every time. It is unlike any cleanser I’ve ever tried before, everyone should try it. I follow up with my moisturizer. I’d definitely recommend this cleanser to everyone. Fresh feeling
