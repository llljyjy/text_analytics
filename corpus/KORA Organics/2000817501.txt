My routine lately has been a bit different since I am a mom of 3 and sometimes find it difficult to fit in time for a full 7 step nightly ritual. I love Kora for what it stands for and how minimal and easy it is to incorporate this into a daily routine whether it be morning, night or both! I suffer from dullness and uneven texture from not always exfoliating or simply taking the time to care for my skin. I love how light and airy this moisturizer is almost has a whipped feeling to it. It immediately is absorbed into my skin. I only use a small pea size, a tiny bit goes a long way! My skin looks so radiant and has a beautiful almost golden glow to it! I top this off with the Nori oil which together they make such a great power duo! Beautiful moisturizer
