Don’t buy this. I bought because of the fancy container it comes in and I wanted a lightweight moisturizer for under the makeup this is the worst moisturizer I have ever purchased. It doesn’t sink in the skin so after applying to your face you have a white/green residue on your face same as you would after applying sunscreen. It does nothing for the skin as far as brightening/moisturizing ect. 2 star because the container is pretty but the product is bad. Pretty Container Bad Product
