I absolutely love the packaging on this product it’s so unique and cute. It catches the eye and it’s refillable.  At first I was worried this product would break me out I have sensitive acne prone skin but it didn’t. It does give an instance glow and leaves your skin feeling extremely hydrated. A little bit goes a long way. If you use too much it can feel heavy in the skin. Love the packaging
