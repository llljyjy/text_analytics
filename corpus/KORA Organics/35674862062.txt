This is the first time that I tried KORA. I love that the product is organic and made with natural ingredients. The lightweight moisturizer is made out of algae, rose water, green tea. It’s super light and not sticky at all. The texture sets well and doesn’t interfere with makeup application. It’s soothing and moisturizes the skin well. It’s especially great for the summer. Loveee the packaging and texture great for summer
