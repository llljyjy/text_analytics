I have fallen in love with this Noni glow oil from Kora organics. First of all, I am impressed with how well they were able to mask the scent of the Noni fruit. This product has a mild earthy and floral scent, which I love. The oil has some weight to it but itâ€™s still more on the lighter side when applied. It gives a wonderful glow to my skin and best of all locks all my products in. Sometimes I skip my night moisturizer and use this instead and I wake up with soft moisturized skin. I really enjoy and recommend this product. So good!
