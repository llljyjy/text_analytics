My 3rd jar. I absolutely love this rich, nourishing moisturizer. My dry skin cannot get enough of it, especially during the colder months. It gives a subtle glow along with hydration without making the skin greasy. It has also helped to reduce pigmentations, dark spots, and dullness making skin plump and smooth. It goes well under makeup too. I use it in both am and pm routines. A great moisturizer
