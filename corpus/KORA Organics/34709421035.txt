Just started exploring double-cleansing as part of my evening routine. Following my squalane cleanser with this product. WOW. So far, so good. My skin was so bright right away, on par with exfoliating (though I will continue to exfoliate, of course!). I would suggest only using 1-2 pumps, not the recommended 3-5, which was way too much for my face & neck & felt wasteful. Also, be careful with this product around your eyes. The mint is much stronger than I expected, so my eyes watered a bit. Using fewer pumps helped with this effect, too. Really lovely, high-quality product overall. Glad I took the plunge. "Glow" is in the name for a reason
