My dry and a little bit sensitive skin is loving this Turmeric Glow moisturizer by Kora Organics.. It is rich and thick.. It is like butter that will melt on your skin.. It glides on smoothly and absorbs easily.. It doesn’t feel heavy on my dry skin, it is not sticky or greasy.. A little goes a long way and this beautiful cream feels really good on skin.. It feels luxurious.. Skin feels so soft and silky smooth.. It makes my skin look & feels hydrated and moisturized instantly after application.. This cream gives a glowy looking skin.. It does have nice and relaxing smell.. No irritation while using this product and I absolutely love this beautiful glass jar, the packaging is really pretty and by the way it’s refillable.. Found my new favorite cream
