This cleanser leaves my skin with a cool, fresh feeling thanks to the peppermint.  I’ve never used a cleanser with mint before so I was surprised by just what a big impact it made on my skin.  It’s really nicely balanced because it feels delicate, but cleanses my skin completely without any drying or tightness even though I use it twice a day, and thanks to the anti-inflammatory benefits of turmeric my skin feels soothed.  The aromatherapeutic benefits are lovely in the morning, the scent is almost menthol-esque because of the combination of essential oils, so if you like that minty smell, you will love this. Leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed
