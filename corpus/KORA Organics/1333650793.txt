I have loved all of the Kora Organics products I have tried - moisturizer, oil, mask, etc. - but sadly this cleanser just isn’t for me.  It has lovely, hefty glass packaging.  I just worry it will slip and break.  The formula is foaming but not so foamy that I’m overwhelmed by bubbles.  It washes off easily.  It is meant to purify, cleanse, and nourish.  I can feel the purify and cleansing aspects.  I have dry skin so usually go for cream cleansers.  This is a little more stripping than a cream but not so much so that my skin feels tight or irritated.  My biggest issue is the menthol like fragrance and feel from ingredients like peppermint and rosemary oils.  Yes, it is “invigorating” but I can’t get it anywhere near my eyes. A nice cleanser, just not for me
