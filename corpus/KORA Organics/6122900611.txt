This facial oil has swiftly become one of my favorites. I typically use other oil on my face, but this oil has become the replacement. I love the way it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth after application. I use this oil in the evenings, and when I wake up in the morning, my skin feels smooth and dewy. There is a slight smell to it, but once it’s on your face, you don’t smell it anymore. The oil is not sticky at all either, which has been a concern of mine with previous products. I look forward to using it every night! New in my evening routine!
