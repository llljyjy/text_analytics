My first time trying this brand. The noni facial glow oil is  very light and applied smoothly on my skin. I use it before my moisturizer. It absorbs quite quickly giving my skin a nice glow and feeling extra smooth. It’s has a very light scent that’s pleasant. I live the results after 2 weeks of use. Skin more plump, less dry patches. I have already added this to my routine My skin has a nice glow
