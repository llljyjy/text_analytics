I love creams with turmeric in them, so I was excited to try this cream from KORA organics. The scent is interesting- I don’t think it would be everyone’s taste, but it doesn’t bother me too much. My dry skin is definitely a fan of the rich texture of the cream- it’s very hydrating. And as always, KORA’s packing is beautiful! nan
