This is such an interesting product. This cleanser’s scent reminds me of Ricola cough drops. It’s a gel texture and lathers easily. When I massage the cleanser onto my skin for a good cleanser, there’s a bit of a menthol like affect. Like when I wash off the cleanser with cold water, it doesn’t even feel cold? It’s a bit hard to explain to be honest! It’s a decent cleanser but I do feel like it’s quite expensive for what it is. nan
