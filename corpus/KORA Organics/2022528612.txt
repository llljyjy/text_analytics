I love how this oil makes my skin feel. I noticed a huge difference in softness and how hydrated my skin feels after using. I have dry skin and with the seasons changing this is going to be a game changer. A little is all you need and the scent is nice. It leaves your skin feeling hydrated but not greasy. I love this face oil
