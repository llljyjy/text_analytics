I have been using this moisturizer for over 6 months now, but I’m still on the fence on repurchasing.   The good:Not only is the jar gorgeous, you can buy refills at a reduced costThe turmeric gives your skin an instant brightnessIt is very moisturizing, and perfect for a night creamThe not so great:It is more of a balm than a cream, so it takes longer for your skin to absorbIt did not work well under makeup (for me) Not for oily skinOver all it is a good moisturizer.  On no makeup days, it gives the skin a nice healthy glow. For me, it’s more of a wintertime/nighttime moisturizer. It’s Good.
