Noni oil gives my skin a nice glow, and because my skin is extra dry, I like to use it on top of my moisturizer as the last step in my skincare routine. Itâ€™s not too thick of an oil, so it works great during the day and I can apply makeup on top of it, or mix a drop into my foundation for a dewy look. Note that it does contain fragrant oils for scent purposes. It smells lovely but my skin is fragrance sensitive so for this reason I try not to use it every day and may switch to using it on my body.
