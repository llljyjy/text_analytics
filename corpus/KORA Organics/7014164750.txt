The refillable packaging is great- I love that this moisturizer has a beautiful package because it makes me want to display it in my bathroom. The moisturizer itself is very lightweight and good for anyone who’s oily/combination. I will say the one thing that I dont love is the smell. it has a very earthy smell that is not my favorite but a good everyday moisturizer, just not the one i’d immediately reach for. decent lightweight moisturizer
