I love this moisturizer! It comes in a reusable case that you the moisturizer sits in a pod. You can just take out the pod and pop in a new one. The moisturizer itself is very rich. You can put it on and see a glow quite easily. I think my skin looked shinier right away. It does have a strong turmeric smell. Overall a nice moisturizer! nan
