I am so happy to try KORA Organics lightweight moisturizer. The jar is very beautiful and I like that itâ€™s refillable. I have combination skin and some moisturizer can make my skin oily or greasy. Not this one. It is lightweight yet moisturizing, ideally used for warmer weather during day time. nan
