I’ve been using this product for close to a month now. I like the refillable pod and effort made towards more sustainable packaging. The product is good consistency - thick but not heavy. If you like cute packaging, you’ll like the pink-vibe. But overall, the product itself was just okay. Nothing special, no dramatic changes/improvements. Did not help with brightening, at least not that I could see. I’ve noticed it will sometimes pill when other products are applied on top (might just be that I needed to give it more time to set in?). At the very least it is hydrating, and may be of help if you have puffy eyes. It sort of helped for me, but again, nothing dramatic. I also noticed tiny bumps around my orbital bone, since using this product (no other new face products were introduced during this time, but to be fair, it could also be good ol’ hormones at play). I had tried Josie Maran’s argan oil eye cream before this one and would say, between the two, Josie Maran’s eye cream was a better product for me (though I’m still on the hunt for a better eye cream overall). I’m glad I tried it, but it was just okay for me and I will not repurchase. Just okay
