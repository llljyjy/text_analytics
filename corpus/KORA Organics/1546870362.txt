This cleanser has a really nice heavy plastic bottle packaging. It feel luxurious but you can still store it in your shower without worrying about potentially breaking it. You don’t need much of the gel cleanser, only about a nickel sized amount. The first thing you will notice is its minty fragrance that also give your skin an instant cooling and tingly feeling. It’s very soothing and refreshing in the skin. It has a nice cushiony texture and lathers nicely. It really cleanses the skin without stripping it. It leave my skin feeling really hydrated and fresh. It helps remove makeup and stubborn residue. I highly recommend this cleanser! Refreshing and Cooling
