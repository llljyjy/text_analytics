I cannot stand the smell of it. I don’t know why but it’s kind of stinky. I feel like I can still smell it afterward after blending it into the skin. It doesn’t have a pleasant scent to it. I would so much rather it be unscented. I will keep trying it though to see if it had some effect on ny skin but overall eh strange scent
