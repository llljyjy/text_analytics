I am in love with the other Kora Organics moisturizer but it was slightly too heavy for summer, so this one is PERFECT! Itâ€™s lightweight, hydrating and has a super nice gel texture. I love the ingredients in it too! Makes my skin super hydrated and soft. A new absolute favorite! Hydrated summer skin
