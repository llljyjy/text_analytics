This moisturizer is just what I needed headed into fall and winter. It has such a nice, non greasy feel and blends into my skin so well. I use it twice a day now that the weather has cooled off and has gotten windy, so it keeps my skin moisturized all day and night. I love how the bottle has a refillable capsule so you only need to purchase the pod when it’s empty. This moisturizer leaves my skin feeling clean and healthy and it’s light weight so your skin doesn’t feel heavy, which I love because I have sensitive skin so I know it won’t clog my pores! nan
