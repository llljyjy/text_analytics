I am so happy I tried this brand for the first time. Not only is it certified clean at Sephora but the ingredients list is really nice and clean as well. The texture is really nice and smooth and I love how it turns into a foam. Iâ€™ve been using this every morning since I got it because I love how invigorating and awake the peppermint makes me and my skin feel. It smells incredible! After I cleanse my skin feels so smooth and not at all stripped. I have dry skin and this really left my skin feeling fresh, clean and hydrated. I am really impressed with this product and will absolutely look into more products from Kora. New Favorite
