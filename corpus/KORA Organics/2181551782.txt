I’ve been looking for something new to help with wrinkles under my eyes and crows feet for the last year or two. Well my search is over, this product is amazing in its results. I am literally watching my wrinkles disappear! I’m 57 with fair, sensitive skin just to give a frame of reference. I really hope Sephora keeps this product available for a very long time because it’s transformative for aging delicate skin under the eyes. Do note to keep it away from your lash line as this is an oil, and it can make things a wee bit blurry if you get it in your eyes. That advice is on the label so do follow it. I highly recommend this eye oil and plan on buying some for my Mom as well! (I didn’t receive this as a promotion nor do I work for Sephora.) I was previously using Elizabeth Arden’s eye serum for years and this surpasses it by far. Best eye product I’ve used in years!!! Recommend!
