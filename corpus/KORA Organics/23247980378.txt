I was wondering if the new cleanser is a better version of a previous one and it is. its gladly is. I do love everything foamy its the best formula for my skin and my face. I love when its gently cleanse all the dirt from my face no matter if its AM or PM. scent also not bad ( but not roses either). the great thing - its not drying my face and this is what I am trying to achieve. note - it will not remove makeup completely so pls use balm prior. great cleanser
