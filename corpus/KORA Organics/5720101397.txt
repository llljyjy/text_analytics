First off the packaging is so pretty, but it is bulky. I enjoy the fact that you can buy a refillable cartridge instead of buying the whole packaging again. It felt really great on my skin and as somebody with combo oily skin it hydrated without making me feel overly greasy. The only thing that was a downside about this product was the smell and fragrance, it just was not pleasant. Good but fragrance was not it.
