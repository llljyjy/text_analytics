I think this is a great sunscreen overall. It leaves no white cast on me which is fantastic considering a lot of mineral sunscreens do. I have a fair complexion so I’m not sure how this would perform on deeper skin tones but I think it would be fine. Sometimes I still get sunburnt even with sunscreen but not with this one! It also doesn’t pill under makeup which is a huge plus. The only issue which is why I took off a star is that it’s a little bit greasy so I wouldn’t recommend it for oily skin. Great mineral sunscreen option
