I like the glow this sunscreen gives me. Itâ€™s a little greasy for summer, so I apply powder very lightly afterward. My skin tone is lighter than this sunscreen, so after applying this, it gives me a slight tan, but it looks very natural with the glow. The only downside is that the oil gets separated from the colored, cream part, so it takes a while to blend them out. nan
