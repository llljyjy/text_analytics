I was an avid user of this sunscreen prior to it being reformulated and didn’t have a problem with the old formula but this new formula is lovely. It is absolutely stunning. It has a slight tint to it that the old formula didn’t have which I love, it also now has a pearl sheen to it that gives a gorgeous glow similar to the glow obtained with the Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood Flawless Filter, & lastly the product doesn’t break apart in the tube so it pumps out properly. It was definitely a great improvement to an already nice product. if you didn’t like the old formula I definitely suggest giving this new formula a chance. I have very acne-prone skin and this has not caused any breakouts & I have been using it for months now. Favorite Mineral Sunscreen
