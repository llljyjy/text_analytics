I’ve been using this moisturizer for a couple weeks now and though a little goes a long way, I hate hate hate the smell. It smells like moth balls with a tiny hint of honey and I’m not a fan. I also haven’t changed anything else in my skincare routine but I feel like my skin has been irritated beneath the skin lately - itchy almost. The top of my skin feels smooth like a baby though so I guess I need to put the cons aside for now and use up this whole jar because of the price. Oh and the lid being magnetic and sticking the metal scooper to it? Genius. nan
