I first received this product as a sample, so I was like why not try it.Immediately my makeup was coming off. Felt so soft and subtle. Smell wasnâ€™t bad either. Also a little goes a long way! I think the sample lasted a good week.After I ran out I Immediately ordered this product. So reference I have normal to dry skin. Even took off mascara quickly! Soft and subtle, zero scrubbing needed!
