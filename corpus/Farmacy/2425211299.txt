so... I have dry acne prone skin. (I am 32 years old not the age displayed here) and I enjoyed the way this cleansing balm lathers on my skin. It smells very good and I would say it removed about 70% of my makeup and sunscreen so I had to double cleanse to remove everything. This also sadly made my skin breakout in multiple pimples. Caudalie and Dermalogica offers a better makeup removing product in the same price range. Does not remove everything
