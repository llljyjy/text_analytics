Amazing product for dehydrated, dry and stressed winter skin. The cream applies very luxuriously and has a beautiful texture. It has a gorgeous dry down, and doesn’t feel overly heavy on my combination skin. I prefer to wear this only at night, but it’s light enough that I could wear it during the daytime, but I still prefer a gel cream for my oiliness. Helps keep my winter dermatitis from flaring up. Whoever came up with the magnetized cap idea deserves a huge raise. Dry winter skin? We don’t know her!
