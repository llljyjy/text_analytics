This product is good. It’s a good chemical exfoliating treatment and does give you a glow but i don’t think I’d repurchase because it’s not really worth the price. The packaging sucks i thought i had used all the product but when i opened the bottle only 3/4 was used. I couldn’t get anymore out through the pump so i emptied it into a glass jar and so much product was left. It’s a nice luxury product but there are more affordable options out there. good but not great
