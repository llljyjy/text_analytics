I bought this starter kit because I’ve wanted to try the green clean cleanser for a while now. I was going to buy the 1.7 oz container but I’ve also been curious about Farmacy’s honey halo moisturizer so I decided to buy this whole pack. First of all, 10/10 for the green clean. No other cleansing balm I’ve ever tried has worked so well. 7.5/10 for the honey halo. Not bad. A little goes a long way. I get that it’s a honey product but it also really smells like that too. Some might like it, I’m not a huge fan. Does its job though! 4.5/10 for the deep sweep. I don’t really see a difference in usage. 5.5/10 for the honeymoon glow. It’s okay but there are much better AHA serums out there. Wouldn’t repurchase the second two. Might repurchase honey halo if discounted and I’ve already repurchased the green clean! fun little kit
