I received this complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. I am a very big fan of Farmacy products and they have always left my skin feeling amazing so I was super excited about getting this one. I am fan of undereye products and I normally put it on when doing my skincare routine before bed. The texture felt soft on the skin and I wouldnâ€™t say it felt my undereye looking brighter but honestly less puffy and dry. I love this product and am so happy to add it to my routine. nan
