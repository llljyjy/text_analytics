This product was gifted by Farmacy Beauty and is really unique for a niacinamide product! Itâ€™s a interesting jelly texture that lays well over an entire skincare routine. I find it would be best for those with dry skin to help moisturize the skin overnight while also gaining the benefits of a niacinamide product which are usually geared towards oily skin. Unique night treatment!
