I first tried the Sulwhasoo cleansing oil which irritated my skin and made me break out.  After trying this cleansing balm, I was so happy. Helped my sensitive and dry skin so much. No breakouts. I can use over my eyes with no irritation. Really does help meltaway make up. I use with their deep clean toner afterwards. My skin has never felt better. I apply it all over my face at night and splash my face with water afterwards and gently pat dry before using the toner. In the morning I apply it again and wipe it away with a washcloth to help exfoliate. My face still feels moist afterwards. Highly recommend. nan
