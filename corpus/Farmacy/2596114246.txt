Lost count with how many times I’ve repurchased this. My skin loves it. As a Canadian I was tired of ordering across the border for the Paula’s Choice BHA toner and this is just as good - actually, it’s better. It’s obvious when I don’t use it - my skin stays so much clearer when using. I’d give it 10 stars if I could. Favourite Farmacy product. My ride or die toner
