This mask was gifted to me by Farmacy Beauty. I really enjoyed using this product. I’m a fan of night masks overall. It’s not a miracle product that will deliver results after only one time use, but over the course of few weeks it will help your skin look more supple and hydrated. My skin feels very silky when I wake up. This mask has a gel-like texture, it’s very light and it has a slight cooling effect. nan
