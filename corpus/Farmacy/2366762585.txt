I’m on my 3rd bottle now and this stuff saved my sensitive, dry, flakey, acne rosacea skin. The smell (honey) was definitely odd at first but after a few uses I grew to love it. It’s got this milky texture thats  different from all the other watery HA serums and so much more hydrating. I put it on slightly damp skin and massage/tap it into the skin and it literally feels and looks like it plumps your skin! Holy Grail!!
