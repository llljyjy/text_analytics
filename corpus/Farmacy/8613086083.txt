Got a tiny version of this from the rewards bazaar. It’s alright, takes a little bit to absorb but because it takes a little I can massage it in. It was not irritating at all! However my main complaint is that it smells really weird. Almost chemically mixed with a burnt tire for some reason It’s okay and non irritating but smells weird
