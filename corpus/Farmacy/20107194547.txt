Farmacy Beauty gifted me their newest 1% Vitamin A Retinol Serum.. and oh my gawsh, I’m in love! The formula is just sooooo good! It doesn’t irritate the skin whatsoever, and leaves skin looking and feeling visibly plumper, firmer, and just overall healthier-looking. My face feels so hydrated & nourished, and much brighter, with the prettiest dewy glow. It plays well with the other skincare products in my routine, and the quality and formula are incredible. Absolutely 10/10 recommend. You will love it! A new holy grail in my routine!!
