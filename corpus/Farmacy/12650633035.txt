Unfortunately, this product did not react well on my skin at all. It felt nice going on, but within 10 minutes my skin was burning and I had red splotches on my face and neck. My neck has proven to be sensitive in the past, but my face typically doesn’t have a reaction like this. I won’t be able to use this product anymore. Also, I did not actively apply the product to my eye area. The splotches by my eye are from the little bit on my hands when I added moisturizer. This product was gifted to me by Farmacy Beauty. Reacted poorly with my skin
