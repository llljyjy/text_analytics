I have semi-oily skin in my t-zone area and received this in my most recent FFF box. I typically only use primer in the morning before applying my makeup but decided to start using this, waiting about 5-10 minutes and then use primer. This stuff is amazing. I legit do not need to apply powder like I had to before I started using this. Some how the shine stays minimal. I love this stuff so much because it has brought balance to my skin. I have a healthy glow after using this. Healthy Glow
