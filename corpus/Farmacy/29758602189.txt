Now let me start off by saying I can handle bad smelling skincare & some of my staples in my routine don’t smell the greatest but, I frankly don’t know if I can handle the smell of this serum… It smells like BACON!  The texture is also an issue for me cause, it’s incredibly greasy (kinda like the grease you get after bacon comes out of the microwave). But, this serum doesn’t cause any irritation on my skin, it’s also waterless & contains ferulic acid and alpha-arbutin which are both amazing when paired with vitamin c so, that’s a plus!  Another good thing about this product is that fact that it comes in a airless pump which is really important cause vitamin c is a very unstable ingredient and when exposed to air can lose it’s stability & effectiveness!  Overall I will try my best to continue using this, mostly cause I love the active ingredients and if you can handle the smell and texture this could be a great choice for you but, for me personally I probably won’t purchase it once I’m out!  *This was gifted by Farmacy Beauty The Smell & Texture Isn’t My Favorite…
