I had really high hopes for this night mask as I have oily skin that sometimes breaks out. I excitedly put on for my first luxurious night mask…then it’s turned sticky. REALLY sticky. I waited a full 30 minutes while trying to rub it in, but nothing but stickiness. I had to wash it off and put on another moisturizer. I’m kinda shocked that this product has 5 stars, because I think I’m being generous with two. A sticky disaster. Don’t waste your $$
