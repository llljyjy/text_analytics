I was gifted by Farmacy Beauty this product & I am so happy I was. I am very impressed with this serum. When I initially applied the serum on clean skin my skin looked much firmer & tighter. Each morning after applying the serum at night my skin has a beautiful glow and radiance. I have noticed that the fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes are less visible.  This product is unique because many times retinol can be irritating to the skin, this product does not cause any irritation or burning.  It also leaves my skin looking hydrated and refreshed. The product does not contain a strong smell, which is also a plus for me. I am a huge fan and recommend this product to anyone. Glowing and Hydrated
