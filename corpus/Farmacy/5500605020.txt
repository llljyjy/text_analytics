I wish this product worked for me, I LOVE various of the other farmacy products. I’ve tried it multiple times with my everyday makeup and with heavier makeup and unfortunately it doesn’t get all of the makeup off of my face. I always double cleanse so after using the balm I went in with my cleanser and even then after going in with micellar water my skin had so much makeup. Usually I use a cleanser and micellar water and that does it. Wouldn’t add this product in my routine if I still have to use cleanser and micellar water to get everything out. nan
