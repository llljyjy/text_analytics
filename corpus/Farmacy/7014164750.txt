This product was complimentary from Farmacy Beauty but all opinions are my own.  this retinol serum does not dry out my skin at all. Itâ€™s very gentle and has a great consistency to the skin. I usually use a pump and a half 3x a week on my face and neck and have seen a reduction in pore size and an overall more even tone. great product
