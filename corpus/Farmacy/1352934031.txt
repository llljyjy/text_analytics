This is a really nice launch from the brand. The wake up eye cream is made with shea butter so it’s nice and hydrating on the skin: I’m a big fan of shea butter lately especially  on the face. I find high quality shea butter absorbs super quickly and nice without any greatness. It feels like a nice thick texture that blends up nicely. It’s especially nice since it’s close here right now so I love how hydrating it is. This also contains vitamin c so gives it a nice brightening effect.
