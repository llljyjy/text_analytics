I consistently use a product from this company so I had high expectations when I was waiting for this, and so far I have not been disappointed! I have fairly sensitive skin so I thought it wouldn’t go very well, but it feels great on my skin and doesn’t smell weird at all! Really happy to have this gifted by Farmacy Beauty Good for Sensitive Skin
