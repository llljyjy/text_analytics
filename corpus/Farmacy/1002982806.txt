I tried this product and I really like it, itâ€™s an oil like texture but not greasy. I use in during the day with my regular skincare and it feels great, my skin seems to like it too! No pilling or irritation mixed with my other products, the color is a light yellowish color and the packaging is nice a good pump I normally use 1.5 pumps for my face. Dried down fast.
