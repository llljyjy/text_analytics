This is different than any of the other Vitamin C serums I’ve tried. It feels like an oil going on, which I normally don’t love (as opposed to a watery gel serum) even though there’s no obvious oils in the ingredients list that I recognized. So that’s interesting. With that being said, my dry skin LOVES it. Once it fully absorbs, 5-10 minutes, my face feels so soft, plump & hydrated. Not greasy or sticky like other C serums. No breakouts! I haven’t noticed a brightening effect YET, but it’s only been a few uses. My only complaint is the smell. It’s unscented, but the natural scent of the ingredients is not pleasant. Kind of like dog food. lol The ilia skin tint also smells like this to me & I HATE it. But at least I can layer a fresher smelling moisturizer over this & not notice it after :)*gifted by Farmacy Beauty Hydrating & not sticky but smells bad
