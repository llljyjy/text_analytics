This stuff is excellent and does just what it says! I have been using it the past few days and have noticed my skin looks really smooth and poreless. I have also noticed less fine lines under my eyes which is saying a lot. Has a slight honey smell to it which I donâ€™t mind. I recommend using half a pump because the first time I used too much and it gave kind of a white film. Highly recommend!! Simply works!
