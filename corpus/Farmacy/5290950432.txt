I am currently trying this vitamin c serum. I love it my face has brightened over the last 30 days with day and night use. My skin is glowy after I do my skincare morning & night, but not oil or greasy.  I have dry skin so this gives me just enough hydration and plumps my skin. I love this product but probably won’t be repurchasing and will get the youth to the people one next, or stick with my drunk elephant. The down sides to this vitamin c: 1. It smells soooo bad I usually still smell it when I get up in the morning. Luckily when I use in the day because I use the serum, moisturize & use the supergoop unseen screen it mutes out the smell. 2. The bottle is extremely leaky and wasteful and not worth $50 when you’re constantly wasting product. I hope that farmacy gets this fixed because I really love this serum. I would give it a 5 but….
