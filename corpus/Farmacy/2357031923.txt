I recently ran out of my staple for under eyes and was super excited to try something new. My eyes are less puffy and look brighter. I am not sure if I could or should wear it under makeup but it is a great moisturizer and I loved putting a bit and adding concealer on top. I do love it. Gifted by Farmacy Beauty nan
