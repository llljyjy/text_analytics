This was gifted by Farmacy. I love Farmacy! All their launches are always amazing and this one doesn’t disappoint! I love a good vitamin c serum for my dark spots & unevennesss. This one has the power duo of ferulic acid and vitamin c, which makes me feel so good about using it. It’s not sticky and layers well in my routine. Can’t wait to see more results Impressed!
