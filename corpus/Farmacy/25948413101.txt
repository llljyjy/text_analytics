I was able to try the Farmacy Wake Up Honey Eye Cream complimentary from Skeepers and Farmacy Beauty in exchange of my honest opinion. I really liked this eye cream. I am always very hesitant on getting a new eye cream but this one did not let me down. The Wake Up Honey Eye Cream really helped with the dark circles under my eyes and it also helped with some puffiness I used to have when I wake up. I will definitely continue to use this Farmacy Wake Up Honey Eye Cream every morning when I do my daily routine. WAKE UP HONEY EYE CREAM
