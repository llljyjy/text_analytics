Gifted by farmacy beauty. Farmacy Honey Halo Ultra-Hydrating Ceramide Moisturizer is amazing! A little goes a long way. It absorbed so much better then I anticipated. It left my dry skin moisturized and feeling great. Really impressed with how well it performed. Scent is very very light. Smells reminiscent of honey. I love that it has a magnetic top that holds a little scooper so you donâ€™t contaminate the cream with the oils and such from your fingers. Very happy with this product! Must have
