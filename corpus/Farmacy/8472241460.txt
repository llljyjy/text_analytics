Farmacy Beauty gifted me their new vitamin c serum and I was very surprised with the texture. As it said it was a waterless formula I didn’t know what to expect. It is definitely more of an oily serum but it is quickly absorbed by the skin so it doesn’t look shiny or oily which mean a oily girls like me can use it during the days. They only thing I am not a fan of is the scent. I kinda had a Smokey scent to it. nan
