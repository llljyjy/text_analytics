Offers wonderful hydration, sinks into the skin and leaves a nice glow. However, be warned that the honey scent is very strong. Like most Farmacy products, this serum has the classic honey scent. However, compared to the moisturizer, this scent is twice as strong. It dissipates once the product is fully absorbed, but straight out of the bottle is crazy intense. However, I would still recommend this product for hydration and plumping. nan
