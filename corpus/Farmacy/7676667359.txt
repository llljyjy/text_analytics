I really love this mask/moisturizer!! I bought the Indigo night mask from Tatcha and loved it but it’s so expensive so I switched to this one, and it’s sooo nice!!! I love how it goes on so smooth and easily and doesn’t feel too thick! My skins super sensitive and I didn’t break out which is awesome!!! nan
