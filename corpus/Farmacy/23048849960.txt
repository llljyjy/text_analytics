I bought a small sample size under the Sephora Favorites kit. I liked the feeling of the product on my skin- ceramides always help with dryness and I have super dry skin. It didn’t feel very lightweight though, it feels more like a Cerave as opposed to a light, ultra hydrating cream. I prefer the feel of Korean products like Laneige and Belif over this. but it does the job of locking in your natural moisture.But the smell is so bad- I hate putting it on my face. It has honey, so maybe the smell is understandable but it doesn’t exactly smell like honey- more like a weird honey gone bad smell. I usually don’t mind fragrances in skincare- in fact I love gentle fragrances, but this one is just a no for me. very rarely do I reject a product for its smell. Smells awful
