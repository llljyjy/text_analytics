Absolutely love this. Applies perfectly, washes off without a problem and left my skin smooth and ready for moisturizer. Gives a slightly warm sensation but did not burn or sting at all (Maybe because I’m not over-exfoliating?). Really contains honey and propolis and not just junk ingredients. I haven’t looked into it but I hope these things have a benefit for the skin. The spatula magnetically sticks to the lid, how cool is that?!My skin is dry and combo, and prone to acne. After using this my skin looks and feels smoother afterwards. I will repurchase. The perfect mask
