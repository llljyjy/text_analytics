I was worried to start a retinol product as I know sometimes they can be harsh for skin to get used to, and mine is sometimes sensitive. I used this every 4 to 5 days and it felt similarly to applying a Vitamin C serum but slightly thicker. I like that it sinks in quickly and provides a bit of a glow, comes in a sanitary pump format that feels safe for travel, and is virtually fragrance free.This product was gifted by Farmacy Beauty in exchange for my honest review. nan
