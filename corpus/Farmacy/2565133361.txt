I initially got a sample size of this product and fell in love immediately with the texture, and the smell. I have dry skin, and found this product left my skin glowing. Itâ€™s not explicitly a night cream, though that it when I used it (since I use sunscreen during the day), but wow, this paired with the Honeymoon Glow, will leave you with glowing, dewy, and bright moisturized skin. I bought this XL size and have no regrets! Definitely a new favorite to add to the arsenal. Best Cream Ever
