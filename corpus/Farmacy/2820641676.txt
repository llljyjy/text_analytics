Gifted by Farmacy.  This Farmacy Wake up honey eye cream, with brightening vitamin C is a great under eye moisturizer.  The formula is creamy, lightweight, and hydrating.  It really does hydrate to give my under eyes good moisturization.  It also does brighten that area, but that mainly what it does for me.  I still see my dark circles, and it slightly helps with under eye lines.  I don’t know if that will change with longer usage.  I do like using it under my makeup because my under eyes don’t look dry.  I like that it does have Vitamin C so I will continue using it for that reason too.  It is a bit pricey. Great under eye moisturizer!
