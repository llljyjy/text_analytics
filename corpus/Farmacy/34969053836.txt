I was gifted by Farmacy for my experienced & honest opinion. I’m a regular retinol user & have used all kinds, strengths, & brands, from the Ordinary to $120 Dennis Gross. This 1% Retinol scores big points with me because 1. It’s encapsulated Retinol so it’s super gentle & I don’t have to “work up to it“ in my routine (I like to be able to switch around depending on how my skin is feeling that day). I can drop it in whenever my barrier feels healthy & suffer no ill effects. 2. The airless pump is an absolute must to keep this type of product fresh, & Farmacy does it really well - no issues with leaking or little “explosions“ of air like some pumps I’ve used. 3. The formula is not full of filler ingredients to make it spread better or whatever - no oily propanediol, no sticky feeling, it sinks in well & doesn’t pill or anything, Also, the inclusion of retinal makes it feel like you’re getting instant results. All in all, great product for the price point & it will be appropriate for beginners to advanced users. Also, it has Ceramide & Vitamin E plus hydrating ingredients, so it can be a one-stop shop night serum. Excellent formula, all-in-one serum
