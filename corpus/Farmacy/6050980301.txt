I’ve always had issues with moisturizer either not giving me enough or giving too much and then breaking out but this moisturizer gives me ev-er-y-thing. I use is morning and night, at night I’ll sometimes add a little facial oil if i feel like i need it, otherwise this is my absolute go-to. I’m on my second jar I finally found "the one"
