So, I went to Sephora and talked with a lovely guy about this product to get someone’s honest opinion. He sold me on it, saying that he loved it and that it was perfect for smoothing out uneven texture without being too harsh. I have combo skin and have recently been having some of the worst acne of my adult life (thanks to wearing a mask all day at work for this whole darn pandemic). And to be honest, I was overdoing it with actives, hoping that I could blast all the acne away. I stopped doing that, thank god, and switched to gentle products. But this right here is my acne’s kryptonite. I used it for the first time, LAST NIGHT, and this morning I woke up to smoother, softer, clearer skin. My acne scars have all lightened, my current pimples have shrunk down. My blackheads and sebaceous filaments are smaller, AND the small, stubborn milia under my eyes are nearly gone. I never ever thought I could see so much progress in one night of sleep, but here we are. Pro tip: my Sephora Angel recommended that if you worry about this product drying you out, layer it with a calming oil, like Rose Hip. I bought the Ordinary Rose Hip oil for like $6 to layer with this, and my face is soft as a baby’s bottom. Also, he told me that you probably shouldn’t use this every night, especially if you have sensitive skin. So, do with that what you will. Run, don’t walk.
