I have such a difficult time finding a vitamin c serum that doesn’t break me out. I’m happy to report back this new and improved one from Farmacy is suitable for sensitive skin. It’s super light and has great slip. I’ve been using this for the past week and have already noticed my skin looking more bright. I have high hopes of it helping with my hyperpigmentation around my mouth.  (Gifted by Farmacy Beauty) Wonderful on  sensitive skin
