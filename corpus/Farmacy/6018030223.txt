I used to go through bottles and bottles of it. Now that they’ve changed their formulation, I probably might look for other alternatives. I’m not MAD about the new formulation, but the old one was a lot better. I enjoyed the light fragrance from it, and the texture was much more lightweight and a true gel consistency, where this was like a lightweight gel-y lotion. For the price, it’s not worth it for me to continue to buy since there are other alternatives on the market. Amazing.. but not so much now.
