I was shocked that I loved this so much. I have the most sensitive skin and eyes but this does not irritate at all. Takes off ALL traces of makeup. I still use eye makeup remover for my waterproof mascara but this takes everything else off. I even used a cotton pad/ toner afterward and no makeup is left on your skin at all (when I did this after using any other cleanser there was foundation left on the cotton disc). Also Smells fricken amazing! Very refreshing like a mojito. Try it. I hope you love it as much as I do. Obsessed!
