THIS STUFF IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST! I have been a rigid Lush user for almost a decade and I have used their cleansing balms like Ultrabland, Tea Totaler and so on and honestly they don’t even compare! This stuff melt almost into a coconut oil consistently, but more buttery. It is so silky smooth and melts everything away with ease, even rough mascara or eyeliner. It also leaves your face feeling hydrated without suffocated and super baby smooth. I like to use a domain for sudsey cleanser afterwards because i have acne prone skin and like a really deep clean, and the YTTP Superfood cleanser works great after this!!! Together your face feels like a cloud. I am obsessed and can’t recommend it enough!!!! AMAZING GAME CHANGER ADORE IT!!!!!
