I’ve been searching for a good moisturizer and damn this is it. I was shocked at how creamy and dense the cream is but how light it feels on the skin. I had a tried a sample of glow recipes new plum moisturizer but it felt sticky and tacky. This just sinks into the skin. I love the packaging and that you get a spoon to help. I the jar probably could be made more round to help get product out but damn this is niiiice. This is the one you’re looking for
