I think I’m on my fourth tub of this and it is my absolute favorite makeup remover I’ve ever used. It takes off every bit of makeup, but leaves your skin feeling comfortable and soft. It’s also not irritating to your eyes at all. I will never be without this. I used to be a Bobbi Brown Cleansing Oil stan, but this has converted me big time. Wonderful!!
