Just RIDICULOUSLY overpriced. It doesn’t really hydrate much or make my skin any softer after washing it off- or at least it doesn’t do so enough. The only thing I will say is that this mask is so so cool. It has the smell and consistency of literal honey, then turns white as you rub it in and you get a warm sensation on your face. Experience is 10/10 but results and benefits is 3/10 nan
