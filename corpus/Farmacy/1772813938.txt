I loved the light scent and found that this balm is gentler and removes makeup better than Drunk Elephant’s Slaai, but I also found it to be more drying whereas Slaai leaves you super hydrated (to the point of almost greasy). Green Clean is a lot easier on eye makeup and mascara, so I’m switching to this as my go-to cleansing balm :) Gentler and more effective than Drunk Elephant
