I’ve only used a free sample size so far, but I really enjoyed it. You only need to apply a thin layer before bed (thank god bc I cannot imagine using a thick mask for bedtime and getting it all over my pillow) and wake up with skin that’s pretty glowing. It’s even pleasant to wash it off gently in the AM. It doesn’t have an overwhelming scent if any at all (I can’t remember now because I finished my sample like weeks ago) and unlike TO 10% niacinimide, it didn’t seem to break me out! So that’s a huge plus. Four stars only as I would like to see what more regular use would do. Niacinimide that doesn’t break me out??
