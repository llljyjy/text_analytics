I dont typically write reviews but I had to on this product… all I can say is wow. I use this every night and I wake up with healthy, glowing, soft skin. It takes a few to sink in but it eventually does. I do not think I will ever go without this product. It is thee most important part of my skincare routine now. I start with my 1% retinol serum from Paula’s choice, a hyralunic acid serum and finish with this. Buy it now! You won’t regret it. nan
