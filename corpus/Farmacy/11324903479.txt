Im so amazed how light weight this serum feels.  Lets start off by this amazing texture, it feels extremely moisturizing.  If I could describe it, it would be a watery oil.  It doesnâ€™t irritate my sensitive face.  I noticed my skin looks so healthy and has a beautiful glow.  The scent is barely noticeable.  Its my favorite vitamin C serum! Complimentary from Farmacy Beauty, but the love is all mine. So hydrating!! Love it
