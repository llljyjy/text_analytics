I’m always skeptical of products containing oils, since all of my aestheticians always said it was a no-no for combo and oily skin types. What can I tell you?! I went from 2 samples of this to 50 ml to a 100ml, and who knows, maybe I’ll get to order a value pack one day!!Really love this product - luckily it didn’t leave me with any breakouts!How I use it: almost every day. Why I use it: I am a fan of waterproof mascara and brow pens & gels that are really hard to get out of my face, so it does wonders here. Also lately I had to use a lot of concealer (Tarte is great for staying on your face :see_no_evil:).On the days when I use only SPF (sometimes tinted), I don’t bother with the balm - regular face wash is enough. Great for combo skin
