Gifted by farmacy I have acne prone , dry leaning skin type and I love this serum. It’s really effective and I personally find that it absorbs really well and doesn’t have any kind of tacky feeling which is great when you are using a product at bed time because nobody wants to feel sticky. If you’re new to using retinols a great tip is start slow , maybe twice a week and You can add a light moisturizer over your retinol to help cut any dryness you might feel. Always follow up with moisturizer and spf in the morning . A great formula
