Farmacy gifted me the Honey Halo Ceramide Moisturizer for my review. This moisturizer comes in a nice thick glass container. It has a wooden lid that is magnetic so the spatula will stick to it. It is a nice creamy texture. It has a light scent. It absorbed quickly into my skin and left it feeling moisturized all day! Best Moisturizers
