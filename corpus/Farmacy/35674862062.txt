T his vitamin c serum is very interesting! It’s supposed to be waterless. The texture is this clear texture that feels like an oil. It absorbs well but does leave a shine on the face (feels like oil). Because of the texture, I apply it after I apply my moisturizer. I then add sunscreen. So far I’ve found my complexion to brighten and am happy with the product! My new fav vitamin c!
