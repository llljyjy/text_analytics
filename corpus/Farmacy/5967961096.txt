I have used all three of Farmacy, Clinique and IT Cosmetics cleansing balms. This one smells the best (in my opinion), BUT it sort of gets little clumps of hardness (hard to explain), whereas Clinique and IT Cosmetics balms stay really melty and smooth. This is enough to make this one way less better, the other two a cut above. I will buy Clinique or IT going forward as the two best, just depends on which I get a better deal on. Hope this helps you decide. Clinique and It Cosmetics have an edge above this
