I was weary about using this product because I worried it was overhyped. Itâ€™s definitely worth alllll the hype. I used to only use coconut oil to remove makeup, but that always left my skin still feeling oily. This product makes my skin feeling so clean and literally takes off all my makeup. I actually look forward to taking my makeup off now! Love! love it
