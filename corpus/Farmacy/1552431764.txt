Like most Farmacy beauty products I have tried I am really enjoying this Retinol. I use it every couple of days and haven’t noticed any irritation.  I can tell my skin cells are turning over faster when using this product. It’s definitely worth a try if you are looking for a gentle retinol product. Gifted by Farmacy Gentle Retinol Serum
