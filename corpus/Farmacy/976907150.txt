I received this complimentary from Farmacy. I am loving this serum!! It’s an oily serum, still absorbs well and doesn’t look greasy. It doesn’t make my skincare pill. My skin looks brighter immediately after using this, and because my skin loves ferulic acid, I’m using this twice a day and have no irritation at all. I’ve never been more excited about a serum before! My skin is loving this
