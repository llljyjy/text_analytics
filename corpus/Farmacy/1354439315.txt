I’m very particular with my Retinols and did enjoy Farmacy’s version. The formula is very lightweight which was great for my combination skin and for layering on additional skincare products. (Not tacky which I love!) The ingredients resulted in my skin feeling + looking hydrated and did not irritate my face. Gifted by Farmacy Beauty. Liked this for my combination skin!
