I was gifted this Farmacy Wake Up Honey Eye Cream complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. This is a brand new product from Farmacy and it doesn’t disappoint! Packed with Vitamin C and Honey, this eye cream brightens eyes, rapidly reduces the appearance of dark circles, visibly depuffs and smooths the look of fine lines. Wake Up Honey Eye Cream contains encapsulated caffeine and upcycled cranberry peptide smooth the look of crow’s feet and fight wrinkles over time. This eye cream is great for all skin types and is especially good to combat dryness and anti-aging. I am someone who suffers from horribly dry skin, with my eyes and t-zone being my driest areas. So when it comes to finding a great eye cream, moisturization and hydration is key. Farmacy Wake Up Honey Eye Cream had more than met my expectations! My eyes are no longer dry and peeling, they are perfectly moisturized and hydrated. My dark circles and fine lines are less visible and my under eyes are appearing brighter and awake. I love how this cream feels when applied to my eyes, it’s nice and cool and almost a cross between a cream and a gel. (It cools nicely like some eye gels do) This eye cream has made its way to my go to eye cream and I have been using it morning and night, while enjoying the benefits. Holy Grail Worthy!
