Got this too close to my lips (instructions say to not get near lips or eyes, so my fault) and had a small burn on my skin the next morning. It didn’t feel particularly hydrating on the rest of my face and I’m not sure why a hydrating mask can’t go near the driest part of my face. I didn’t really see any upside for this and am not willing to keep trying to see if I like it more given the price. Not worth it to me
