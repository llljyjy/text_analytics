I feel the need to write a review as glowing as my skin now that I’ve just purchased my second bottle of this (no incentives for me)! I’ve been using another brand of retinol for about a year now, and I had to work my way up to 1% as my skin is very easily irritated by retinol, so I was using a 1% serum on my forehead and a 0.3% serum on the rest of my face. I decided to try this one as I love Farmacy products, and the results are amazing! It’s a lot more gentle than other brands I’ve tried, so I can use it on my entire face, but I’ve seen a huge difference in my skin - softened lines, a smoother texture and all around more glowy. I highly recommend it! This retinol serum is a game changer
