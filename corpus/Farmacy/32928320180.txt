Vitamin C is a must for me in my day time routine, so I hace tried different vitamin C serums and I really liked this one. I use it specially to reduce the hyperpigmentation of my acne scars, I would have to test ir further to see how much this one helps! However what can I say for now is that I enjoy the texture, it absorbs really well on the soin, however I am not a big fan of the smell, this was complimentary from Farmacy Beauty Waiting to see results, enjoy it so far
