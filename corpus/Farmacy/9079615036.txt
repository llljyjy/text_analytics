I received this 10% Waterless Vitamin C Serum complimentary from Pharmacy to try and review.  I have long been a fan of vitamin C serums to give my skin a lovely glow, and this one is by far one of my favorites.  The serum is a lovely texture that is not too thick or too thin and spreads easily and absorbs quickly.  I love the refreshing natural orange scent, it gives my senses a little pick me up in the morning. This wears beautifully under makeup with no pilling like some other serums Iâ€™ve tried. Refreshing for my face & my senses
