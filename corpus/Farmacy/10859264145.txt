I was looking for a vitamin C product that would layer well with my retinol, and this one seems to be it! I use it after my toner and before my retinol cream and it works perfectly in that spot in my skincare routine. I love the feeling of it on my skin, as it sinks in well but seems to have a slippy-ness to it. My only complaint is it doesn’t smell great going on, but that’s fine because the smell goes away quickly as I rub it in. Overall, would recommend!
