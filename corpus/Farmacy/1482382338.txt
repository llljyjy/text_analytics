I got this complimentary from Farmacy, and have been really loving this recently! My skin can be fairly sensitive to retinol but this doesn’t irritate it at all, and so far it seems to make my skin a lot brighter and less textured. It also doesn’t have too strong of a smell which I appreciate. So far so good!
