As someone who has super dry skin especially towards the winter, a moisturizer is such a MUST for me. I apply it multiple times a day and thatâ€™s where the honey halo moisturizer comes in. I absolutely love it and my dry prone skin loves it too! I love the texture of it and the packaging is so cute!! love
