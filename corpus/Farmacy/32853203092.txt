I bought this a few months ago, it was my first cleaning balm. After I ran out I tried other brands. They just weren’t the same. I went to a Sephora and impulsively bought another Farmacy cleansing balm and I just know this is the perfect product. I don’t use makeup often so I just bought the mini and it should last me a few months. nan
