I was sent this complimentary from Farmacy Beauty, in exchange for my honest thoughts. I was previously using another retinol, so my skin is already adjusted to using retinol every night. I’ve now been using this one for about a week and I’m loving it so far. No weird smell, non greasy and non irritating. (I will note that I don’t have sensitive skin, so retinol is usually not an issue)I’m excited to see if there’s any major changes in my skin over the next 8-10 weeks compared to before! Love it so far!
