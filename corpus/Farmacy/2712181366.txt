This may be the best product that I have used in years besides Tatcha’s Silk Canvas Primer. I am someone who likes to switch up my skincare products every few months but I have consistently used this product every day for the past 2 years. I love the way that it feels moisturizing but it literally melts away every bit of makeup I have on. (Even waterproof mascara.) I never wake up with dark smudges under my eyes, which I did using my previous micellar water remover. I love Farmacy’s products and love that they are a clean company as well! I use this every night no matter what.
