It does take makeup off decently, but left a residue/layer that was stubborn to remove after. I usually use the Tatcha rice cleanser and I’ve never had a problem, but saw that this had such good reviews so I thought I would try it. I’ve never had problem skin before, always been lucky in that department, but this gave my skin some issues. My face is currently still recovering from a huge breakout after using this. Not super impressed. May work for some people, but I won’t be using this again unfortunately. Not really worth it...
