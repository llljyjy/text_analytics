I have been using this retinol as part of my nightly routine and introduced it in slowly and it has not irritated my skin and I am now using it 3x a week.  It has a milky lightweight texture that is really nice and absorbs quickly.  I use a small pea size amount to spread it and my skin looks hydrated and smooth.  Since retinol can make the skin more sensitive, I do apply sunscreen during the day.  Gifted by Farmacy Beauty. Lightweight and non-irritating
