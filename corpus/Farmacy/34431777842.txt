Gifted by Farmacy beauty. I’m new to retinol as I just had a baby and now it’s safe to use. I am starting with using this once per week and after two uses I have absolutely zero irritation which is super encouraging! Most Farmacy products have WAY too strong of a scent for me, but this is light and pleasant. It dodos see well and smoothed into the skin easily. I look forward to seeing results over the months, that’s when it can earn 5 stars Not irritating my sensitive skin!
