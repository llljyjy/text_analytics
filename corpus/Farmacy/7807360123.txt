This was the most expensive product I bought for skin care. It’s definitely worth the price. 3.4oz doesn’t seem like allot, but I’m sure this will last a good 3-5 months if you use it once a day. It has a thick consistency and yummy honey smell that disappears after about 10min. Super moisturizing, probably best for combo and dry skin. nan
