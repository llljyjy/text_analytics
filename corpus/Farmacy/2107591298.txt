The mask is easy to apply and quickly became creamy after massaging into my face however, it is not moisturizing at all. My face felt so tight and dry, I had to apply a moisturizer after. It doesn’t really feel like it did anything and it definitely is not a hydrating mask. I’ve heard so many good things about this but I’m so disappointed. Not Hydrating
