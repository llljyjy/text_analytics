This is a cleanser that does its job and nothing else more.  I double cleanse first with and oil, and then use this.  It doesnâ€™t leave my skin dry, and it does an ok job at cleansing. I prefer the Youth to the People Superfood Cleanser over this.  However, a little goes a long way and this bottle will last a very long time.  I use a pea size amount.  I bought this 3 months ago and I use it every night.  I still have over 2/3 of the bottle left. Nothing special, does its job.
