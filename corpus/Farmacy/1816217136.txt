Wanted to love this so badly but I don’t feel like it delivered. The size is perfect for travel, it smells nice and it’s hydrating but that’s as far as it goes. I don’t feel it takes off my sunscreen or tinted moisturizer 100% as it should. And I had to use more than I feel I should to be able to get it off. I can’t imagine someone who uses actual makeup like mascara, highlighter ect. don’t believe the hype
