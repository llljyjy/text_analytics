I have tried multiple different retinols since beginning my skincare journey about a year ago. I have combination sensitive skin, so I sometimes get apprehensive to try new products. I apply this product at night and it goes on smoothly and leaves my skin feeling plump and hydrated the next morning. It hasnâ€™t caused any irritation or peeling of my skin, which is a plus! I received this complimentary from Farmacy Beauty, but the opinions are my own and I will continue to purchase this product once it runs out ! nan
