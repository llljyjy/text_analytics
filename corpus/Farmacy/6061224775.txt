Honestly the best moisturizer I’ve ever used. I have normal/dry skin and this feels so amazing, especially in the winter. You only need a little, so each jar lasts a while. You can likely use less product in the summer vs winter. I’ve been using it for over a year now and I truly feel the price is worth it. My skin is definitely softer and more hydrated. nan
