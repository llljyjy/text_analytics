(For reference I have dry skin)This is the second cleansing balm I’ve tried (after Drunk Elephant’s), and I will continue to repurchase this one! The DE one had an odd scent and the oil began to separate (it looked super gross after a while) – whereas the Green Clean has a very pleasant scent, and doesn’t feel like I’m slathering coconut oil on my face (literally PTSD flashbacks to when the internet convinced everyone that coconut oil was great for your skin and didn’t clog your pores). And it also doesn’t irritate my eyes! (I have used the Glossier makeup remover and the oil would constantly get into my eyes and literally blur my vision).I personally love how much easier it is to remove my makeup with this product over wipes or micellar water, and how it actually makes my skin feel hydrated afterward instead of stripped. I even notice that my pores appear smaller after I use this. Love it! :-) The only cleansing balm I'll use
