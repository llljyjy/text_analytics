I received this Honey Halo Ceramide Moisturizer complimentary from Farmacy Beauty to try out in exchange for my honest review. I was disappointed at this face cream as it’s a bit thick and doesn’t absorb as well into my skin as I would like. It makes my skin feel sticky and greasy after using it, and the smell isn’t very nice, which is disappointing since I was expecting it to smell amazing according to all the positive reviews I had heard about this cream! I also don’t like that this cream pills on my skin even though I hadn’t applied any makeup or anything over this cream! What I do like about this cream is the packaging and the magnetic spatula though, but overall I had hoped for more from this cream. nan
