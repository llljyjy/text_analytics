The entire Honey Collection from Farmacy is rich and nourishing and incredibly soothing for the skin and the eye cream completely follows suit, fitting perfectly in the collection. I’ve found that the lightweight cream is extremely hydrating and super nourishing. Def helps to depuff in the am, like a little wake up call for the undereyes. While it is rich and plush in texture,  it’s not at all heavy or greasy, absorbs nicely into the skin and creates a super hydrated base for concealer. It’s perfect for dry under eyes or even mature skin. If you have dry skin you’ll absolutely love this in the AM to rejuvenate and brighten the under eyes. Oily skin gals, I recommend making this a PM staple, ensuring you’ll wake up with well rested and hydrated under eyes. This was gifted by Farmacy for my honest review. Everything you look for in an eye cream
