I bought a try me box of these products for gifts for xmas and one for myself. I have been a fan of the sunscreen for years. This is a great moisterizer for my age (62) during winter. I had oilier skin in my youth, but now I need this thicker protective layer in the cold. I love the smell. I love the hydration without greasiness.  I love the magnetic spatula and cap. I also love the youth to the people superberry mask (I use as a cream) and alternate between the 2. This is not my treatment. It is second to last step (before sunsceen) to trap in prior steps. My make up (no base only powder) goes on great. Love love love
