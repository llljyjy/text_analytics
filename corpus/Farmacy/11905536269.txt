I’m an advanced retinol user and found this very gentle! I was able to use this everyday for 10days without irritation. There’s a slight greasy feel. Texture in my skin felt improved and smoother, but my acne still is taking time to settle down with this vs other retinols. I’d recommend this for new retinol users! Also love the faint raspberry scent! It’s not strong at all. *Gifted by Farmacy Very Gentle for an Advanced Retinol User
