I love this facial cleanser. I use it daily after the cleansing balm & it’s amazing. At first it did sting my skin a little, but my skin always reacts that way with new products like this. I also love how long a single bottle will last me. I purchased this bottle last year & I still have enough to last me month. I use one pump daily which I put in my wet hand before applying to my face. I don’t find that it has a specific smell, but maybe that’s because I’m used to it. I will definitely be purchasing another bottle once I finish mine! Awesome product, really underrated in this line. underrated product
