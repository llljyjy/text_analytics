This product is amazing! I had gotten a sample and loved it so much I ordered the full size. I use it twice a week, I have very dry sensitive skin and it does tingle quite a bit and the next day I use it sometime I have small breakout patches, but the results are so good! I was starting to have strong lines on my forehead and they’re almost gone. I recommend, just beware it’s strong and might give you a burning sensation and small breakouts if you have sensitive skin. amazing but sensitive skin beware!
