I was gifted the Wake Up Honey Eye Cream complimentary from Farmacy Beauty and have been using it for about two weeks now. I really appreciate this eye cream, my eyes feels moisturized and I feel it is very hydrating. I noticed a decrease in puffiness right away and it is fast absorbing. The ingredients are great for me as well and I love Farmacyâ€™s packaging! Great eye cream!
