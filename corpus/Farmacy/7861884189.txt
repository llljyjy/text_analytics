My problems are congested pores, hyperpigmentation, too much sebum, and sensitive skin. I feel that this starter kit is a great way to decide if the Farmacy line works for you. I’m not going to say I saw a radical transformation in my skin, but it works with it and is gentle and effective. The balm removes makeup pretty well without being too thick and greasy (other brands seem like they leave a film on my eyeball and blur my vision). It still leaves some sparkles and mascara behind for the second cleanse though. I like the toner as it’s not drying or harsh but does keep the sebum and grease down and works well with a light moisturizer over it. For these increasingly dry cold months in the West, the honey halo is a godsend for bed and doesn’t clog my pores--though it’s likely too thick for a daytime moisturizer for me. AHAs rip my face up so I gave the honeymoon glow tester to a friend. Great daily routine set!
