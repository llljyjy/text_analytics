The original Green Clean is my holy grail cleansing balm and you can imagine how much I was looking forward to a fragrance-free version. I was so disappointed that this formula was so different. This doesn’t emulsify like Green Clean does and I NEED to use a second cleanser to get it off. The original would emulsify and I could rinse it off completely. With this, especially around my eyes, I need to scrub a lot with a second cleanser to get my makeup off and the residue from this.If you have extremely dry skin, this may be great for you but if you are trying to get makeup off gently, you’ll have to scrub way more than you should. Doesn't emulsify like the original Green Clean.
