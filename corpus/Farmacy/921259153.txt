I was gifted by Farmacy Beauty their 1% Vitamin A Retinol Serum in exchange for my honest review. I enjoyed how it was fragrance free and had a light texture that absorbed nicely into my skin. It did not leave my skin dry and gave me no irritation. I loved that I could see and feel the results just with the first application. It was so easy to add this to my skincare routine. I could see my face looking firmer and smoother. It gave me great hydration and left my skin feeling soft. I have dry/mature skin, and my experience with Farmacy Beauty products has always been amazing!! I can’t wait to see even more results with longer and consistent use. I’m adding this to my favorites list. No irritation and very hydrating
