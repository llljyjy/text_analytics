This serum gave me my first ever chemical burn after only 3 mins of wearing it. My skip was all red and hot to touch for quite a while after that. I do not have a sensitive skin though and I’m surprised that this product is marketed as leave-in serum. It should say to leave it on your skin for 10 mins at most. I received it as a free sample with the rest of my order so at least I didn’t have to spend money on it. I would definitely recommend doing a patch test before applying it on your face. Really bad experience Chemical burn after only 3 mins
