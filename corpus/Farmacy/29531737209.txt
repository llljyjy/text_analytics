I am in love with this retinol from Farmacy. I have used many different retinoid type products and this one really stands out. It did not cause any sort of irritation when I used it and there was no purging. It absorbed well into my skin and didnâ€™t leave it feeling tingly, red, or anything. I love that the packaging and product are all recyclable, too! I received this complimentary from Farmacy beauty. Amazing
