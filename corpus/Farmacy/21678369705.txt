First of all, I want to mention that this serum is formulated with Ascorbic Acid, a very effective form of Vitamin C. The biggest problem is that this form is not highly stable, it oxidizes quickly, that’s why I appreciate the airless pump and non transparent packaging. Alpha Arbutin 1% and Ferulic Acid are amazing ingredients too, supporting antioxidants for Vitamin C. It’s a waterless serum, so it feels oily. I’ve tried Vitamin C serums with the same consistency, and Farmacy serum is on the lightweight side. It feels like a dry oil, absorbs relatively quickly even on my oily skin. I give it 5 minutes and apply a moisturizer on top. I can skip moisturizer and apply a moisturizing sunscreen instead. I haven’t used it enough to say if it brightens spots, but I can definitely say that this serum seems very promising to me. Gifted by Farmacy Beauty Promising
