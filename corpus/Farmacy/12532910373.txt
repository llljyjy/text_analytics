I am really surprised by the negative reviews. I thought this took off my eye make up so easily. I rubbed a small amount into my hands to melt it, applied it all over and gently massaged it in circles, over my eyes especially. Let it sink in for a minute to break down everything and than gently massaged some more before rinsing off with warm water. I followed with my regular cleanser and there was no residue, no make up and my skin felt soft and clean. It has a light fresh scent and I didn’t need alot at all. My small tester should last me awhile. It’s a first step in a routine,  requires a second wash with your regular cleanser. Does it’s job nicely :) Nice stuff :)
