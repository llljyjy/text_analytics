This made me breakout in small bumps all over my chin and forehead and clogged my pores on my nose. It also dried my skin out. It didnâ€™t fully remove my makeup, I still had makeup on my cotton pad from my toner after double cleansing. This also gives me cloudy vision for a few minutes after using which really freaked me out. Smells nice though. Not for acne prone skin
