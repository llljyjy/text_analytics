Took one star bc it is a bit pricey for what it is, the ingredients really don’t have anything that justifies the cost BUT that said it’s worked wonders to plump up my cheeks and smile lines. I have combo skin and my cheeks and jawline get dry and patchy. My skin looked “deflated“. Serums and moisturizers and oils helped but didn’t revive my skin the way this does. It works much better than Vaseline too. So I guess I justify it that I’m paying for the formula that Farmacy created. It is very thick and takes a long long time for my skin to absorb but the first night I used it my skin looked amazing by the next morning. Immediate results. I don’t apply this to my chin, forehead or nose often but I will hit those areas once in awhile as I think this does strengthen skin barrier. Pricey but good
