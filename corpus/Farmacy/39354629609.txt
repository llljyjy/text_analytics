I’m a huge eye cream lover when it comes to makeup prep in the morning. I think they make a huge difference in how your makeup wears under your eyes. This one is such a balmy thick texture but doesn’t feel heavy under the eyes. My eyes instantly feel and look more hydrated and brighter. If the honey halo had a baby this eye cream would be it. It’s a very similar texture to me. Plus a little goes a long way so this will last you such a good time. This product was gifted by Farmacy Beauty but all opinions are my own. A must have in the morning!
