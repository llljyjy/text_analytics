I saw a difference in my skin after the first use, but nothing much afterwards. A little goes a longgggg way, but it feels very greasy and sits on top of the skin. Iâ€™m sure you could get good results with continued use, but the feel and experience just made me dislike it Wanted to love it more than I did
