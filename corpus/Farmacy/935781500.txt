I tried this after my regular moisturizer (It Secret Sauce) became unavailable, and I asked a chat representative for a recommendation. After asking some questions to figure out my needs, this is what she recommended. “It’s a cult favorite,“ she told me. So was my old moisturizer, so I was dubious.At first, I was a little put off by how thick it is. Then I got more comfortable using less. The difference in my skin is noticeable. This AARP-eligible woman has smoother, clearer, more youthful-looking skin, easily that of. someone in my 40s. I don’t think I’ll be going back to my old moisturizer when it is available. My two cautions: 1. A little goes a long way. Use small amounts. You can always dab on more if needed.2. This is fabulous if you have older skin, combination skin, and/or if you’re are concerned about a loss of elasticity. If you are under 30, if your skin is more oily than anything, or if you battle regular break-outs, this might not be for you. Highly effective
