I’m so in love with this this mask!! Even after the first use, when I woke up in the morning my redness was soo visibly reduced, there were no bright red spots and even some early acne blemishes disappeared! My skin just has such a healthy glow and looks a lot more even-tone. It’s working a little bit on my pores right away but every night they get better so I think after a bit more long-term use there will be big differences! Something that might bother other people is that I find that even though I sleep on a silk pillow case, my skin is super pill-y in the mornings but it comes off right easily when you wash your face or even just a rinse so it’s no bother to me, just something to note! A must-have for your night routine!!
