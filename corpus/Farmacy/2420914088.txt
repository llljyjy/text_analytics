I was a regular user of this balm for quite some time because it would remove every bit of makeup, including mascara, without much effort. Recently I tried another product and have come back to this one, only I don’t recall it leaving such an oily residue on my skin previously.  Unless I use a different cleanser after to remove the oily film I don’t feel clean. If I don’t cleanse a second time I have noticed clogged pores and blemishes. While the balm still melts away foundation, it doesn’t remove my mascara, either. Rather, my lashes look shiny and just as intact as though I’ve not made the effort to clean them. I don’t know what’s changed and I’m not sure I want to stay with it.On the plus, it’s still very gentle and I appreciate that it’s fragrance free. Not sure
