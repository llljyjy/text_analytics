It’s a meh. The cleanser doesn’t melt very easily, even with water, it still remains chucky. It cleans “too well“, so leaves my skin dry. After using it for 3 months now, I notice my skin is getting sensitive around the eye/cheek area, so i stopped using it. The tube is huge so I don’t know what I’m gonna do with the remaining half. makes skin sensitive
