I normally ADORE this product! I have bought this product over & over. I have adored the lime scent, & have purchased scents that were special offers for a short time ( like the Very Cherry, & the 3 scents they had this past Christmas. One was peach, can’t remember the other two fragrances, but I loved them.) I just purchased a Green Clean & this one has NO SMELL, & it’s white! Not sure if they have discontinued the pretty green color or the fragrance that I have loved. Very disappointing. It’s the pretty color & scent that did it for me. I wonder if maybe I got a defective one. I do adore this product, but I want one with that delicious smell & color. I would not recommend it without them. That’s what made this product so special. This has a weird smell. nan
