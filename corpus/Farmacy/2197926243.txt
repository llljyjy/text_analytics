The Farmacy Retinol serum is great. I have been using this product for over 2 weeks and I canâ€™t definitely see a difference in my skin. At first, I was a bit skeptical because I know how my skin can react to certain skin care products but after I tried out this product my skin did just fine. I noticed my fine lines are less visible. I will definitely continue to use this retinol serum. Gifted by Farmacy Beauty A really good Retinol
