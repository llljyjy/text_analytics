Iâ€™m on my second bottle but this time it pills heavily under physical sunscreen. I am so in love with the non-greasy hydration that this replaced my beloved Dior hyaluronic acid serum. The ingredient list contains so many good stuff. Even the honey smell is my cup of tea. Unlike many reviews complaining about the scent, I like this natural smell nonetheless. If it was not about the pilling, I would repurchase my third bottle. Pills Under Physical Sunscreen
