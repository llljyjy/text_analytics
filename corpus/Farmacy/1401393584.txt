I could be wrong, but the sample seems to be way more effective. I wonder if the brand does this to lure you in. Before finishing the sample, I ordered the full sized product and I found it wasnâ€™t as effective. When I went back to using the sample size, I noticed that there really was a difference. Perhaps the full sized product is a bit watered down... Sample More Effective Than Full-Size
