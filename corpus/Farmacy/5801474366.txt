Holy grail moisturizer , I was really struggling with painful and tight flaky dry patches all over my face and this product cleared it up after a couple of days. It’s worth every penny and lasts for ages. You only need the smallest amount to cover your face and neck. I don’t think I’ll ever buy any other moisturizer again. nan
