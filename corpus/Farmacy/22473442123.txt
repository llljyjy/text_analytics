I got a sample and didn’t realize how little you actually need, rubbed the entire sample on my face and my face was purple and had to remove the excess. But when I woke up the next morning my skin was very glowy. And made the assumption that it was due to this product. So I decided to purchase the full size and try it out. I was expecting to not like it enough to justify the price. And figured I would end up returning. But I wanted to give it an honest chance. At this time I purchased it I happened to go a little exfoliation crazy and exfoliated too much hoping I could get rid of my blackheads and ended up damaging my skin barrier. I spent the next week and a half or so just focusing on repair and locking in hydration. I figured this would be good for my night routine at this time because of how thick it is. And every morning I woke up after I used it my skin was glowy. It def helped with the hydration. And a big concern of mine when I realized I damaged my skin and solely needed to focus on hydration was that it would make my blackheads worse than they were before I exfoliated. And I think I can credit this night mask to preventing my blackheads from getting worse during the two weeks I couldn’t exfoliate. So that was a huge plus for me. Now that my skin is healed, I don’t feel like I need to use this every night anymore. I use a lot of different products to do a lot of different things and decide what I will use based on what I feel my skins needs for that moment. But this is definitely a solid night mask that I will keep in my rotation and I would definitely repurchase when it runs out. And with the warmer weather around the corner and the over production of oil, I look forward to seeing how this will effect my skin in the summer. didn’t want to like this but I do
