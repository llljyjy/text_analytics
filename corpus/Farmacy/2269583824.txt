My skin LOVES retinol, it’s the only ingredient that truly helps with my skin’s overall texture and appearance! When I saw that Farmacy came out with a retinol serum I knew that I had to try it. I love how this product utilizes high quality, clean ingredients. I apply this product to a cleansed face and neck. Then I follow up with a moisturizing oil and moisturizing cream to lock in moisture. It should be noted that it is very important to wear SPF when using this product, especially when using this product in the morning. The next day, my skin looks visibly smoother. This product helps to fade and eliminate my skin concerns which is hyperpigmentation and acne. Even though this product was gifted by Farmacy Beauty, it is easily one of my top 3 favorite Farmacy products of all time! Improved & Smoothed My Skin’s Texture
