I was pleasantly surprised by this. First, it did not irritate my extremely sensitive, redness-prone dry winter skin. Second, the consistency is a sticky gel serum that glides on beautifully over wet skin. (I always spray my face with water, then gently spread this on over the water in order to maximize moisture. Then I finally press it into my skin with my finger tips. I am left with a perfect glowâ€¦ no stickiness once dry.) Third - the smell is like gentle honey, in a natural way. Very nice product that has actually made my skin much more moisturized over this winter. Gentle Serum - Glowing
