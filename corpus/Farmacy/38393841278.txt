WOW - I did NOT expect this purple gel-creme to make such a HUGE IMPROVEMENT in my skin OVERNIGHT, but it really does (night after night)!!I wasn’t expecting much from this “sleep mask“ at first, but I liked the idea that it could moisturise my skin with Panthenol and beta-glucan, while also doing a gentle (but intense) deep-clean on my pores.The morning after I applied this (the first time), my PORES SEEMED ALMOST INVISIBLE (!!) while my skin felt really comfortable (not dry and not oily) and that is a MIRACLE for my oily-combo skin! Yay.I use prescription Tretinoin (Retin-A) or Retinal/Retinol products on days that I’m not using (pore-clearing) products like this one - for anti-aging and acne (pore-clearing) purposes - and when I stick to using a thin layer of this 10% Niacinamide Night Mask, it doesn’t irritate my skin at all. Tret can be irritating to the skin so to find a non-irritating pore-clearing companion like this one is FANTASTIC!My advice: stick to the instructions and USE ONLY A THIN LAYER (about a pea sized amount) or it may well be a bit harsh and quite exfoliating, rather than just “smoothing and refining pores”. :)P.S. I found this “purple wonder” to be a much BETTER companion to my Tret/Retinal/Retinol pore clearing routine than Tatcha The Water Cream, because it’s less irritating while still being VERY POTENT pore/acne-clearing. The Water Cream from Tatcha contains Lactic acid and unfortunately irritates my skin, when used in rotation with my anti-aging Tret/Retinal/Retinol products. WOW ! ! !
