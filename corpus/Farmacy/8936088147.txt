This skincare kit is everything you could ask for! The cleansing balm melts away makeup and smells amazing, the toner left my skin feeling refreshed, and the night serum made my skin glow! My favorite piece in this kit is definitely the Honey Halo moisturizer, itâ€™s thick without being heavy, a little bit goes a long way, and it leaves your face feeling soft and hydrated. I like to try new brands with sample sizes or a set first and this one is worth every penny! If you want clean products and enjoy the smell of honey, this is for you! Smells & feels amazing!
