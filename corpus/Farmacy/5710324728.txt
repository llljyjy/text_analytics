The texture is very thin with a glycerin/oil type feel. Using two pumps on my face rubbed in was too greasy feeling for me. I’ve discovered patting the serum in works best. It does take about 5 minutes to fully dry down leaving a slight tackiness. I’ve only been using for about 10 days but my skin looks amazing. The texture is a bit greasy for me but it so far seems to be an effective formula. Not my fave vitamin c I’ve tried. Normally I love all farmacy products, but this one I’m not quite sure about.
