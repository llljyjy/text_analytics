This used to be my holy grail sunscreen. Then they changed the formula and it is now HORRIBLE. The bee formula sits on top of your skin and never truly dries down. It also now feels oily and leaves a noticeable white cast. I have it a try on two bottles of the new formula. It just doesnâ€™t work. Bring back the old formula! This one is awful. nan
