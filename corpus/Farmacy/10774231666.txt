This is my favourite cleansing balm, and it is worth the hype. Although it is definitely on the pricier side (compared to, for example, Elf), I think itâ€™s worth the price. It removes makeup really well, including eye makeup... and without making my eyes too blurry. It offers quite a luxurious cleanse, and washes off easily. Non stripping! Totally recommend this.
