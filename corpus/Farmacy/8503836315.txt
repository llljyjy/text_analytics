I received this product complimentary from Farmacy, in exchange for my review. My review of this product is my honest opinion.The 10% Waterless - Vitamin C Serum was actually to my liking. Although the product states that it is oil-free, there is an oil presence. Albeit absorbs into the skin quickly. By this product being slightly waterless, it felt heavier then a normal serum, and this is what I like about this product. I felt like it was actually doing something. After using this for 12 days I do see a slight improvement to a small dark (pigmentation) area that I have of my cheek. Iâ€™m sure with additional use, it will lighten even more. I definitely am continuing with this serum, as again the feel and the results are what I have been looking for in a serum. I really like the feel and results
