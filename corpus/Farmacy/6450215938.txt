Let me preface this by saying I donâ€™t normally splurge on moisturizer!! Before I tried a point perk sample, I never would have thought to buy this. But today I bit the bullet and bought the smallest size! I layer lots of moisturizing and occlusive products, so I only use a tiny bit per application, maybe an 1/8 of a teaspoon. My skin loves the honey/bee ingredients in this, and I wake up with smooth plump skin. Totally worth it!! Frugal Gal Reviews Luxury Cream
