Retinol is a product that we are going to see the true results in the long term, we must be very constant and apply it in the correct way for incidents to occur.  What I can say as a first impression in my personal use is that it felt light, I did not feel any tingling on my skin or redness, it should be noted that my skin is already used to prescription retinol.  But if you are starting to add retinol to your skin care routine this would be an excellent product, try to wait between 10 minutes before and after applying the product so that in this way there is no contact between products and irritation can occur. nan
