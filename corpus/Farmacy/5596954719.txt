I received the Farmacy Wake Up Honey Creame Yeux complimentary from Farmacy Beauty for my honest review. The cream feels nice on my undereyes. I can tell from my undereye area that it is brighter and refreshed looking.  The cream is not thick but also not thin either. I like that it moisturizes my undereyes and keep it smooth and hydrated. I like the ingredients like Vitamin C, Honey, Cranberry peptides and caffeine to  help smooth fine lines and reduce the look of puffy eyes. I only have to use a little and tap it gently onto my skin. Helps with Puffiness and Dark Circles
