This is a unique waterless Vitamin C serum that comes in an airless pump bottle. It has a strong chemical scent due to the ferulic acid. If you’ve ever used the Drunk Elephant Vitamin C serum, this has the same scent. The serum is a clear, medium-consistency liquid that is easy to spread. 1-2 pumps is enough for my entire face. There is a slight burning sensation when I first apply this, but it fades quickly. The product dries down with no sticky residue. I haven’t noticed any significant brightening effects yet, but overall it’s a good Vitamin C serum. nan
