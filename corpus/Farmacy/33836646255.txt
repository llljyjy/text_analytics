I’m obsessed. I’ve been on a never ending hunt to find the perfect moisturizer since starting tretinoin. This is it!! It has a very light scent but not enough to bother me or irritate my skin. It’s extremely soothing, makes my skin feel silky and absorbs very quickly. It feels like luxury putting it on at night! I bought this in a Farmacy kit and I will run to purchase the full size once the small one is used up. 100% worth the hype!
