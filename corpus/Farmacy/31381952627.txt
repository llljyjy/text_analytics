I received this set complimentary from Farmacy in exchange for my honest review. I’ve never tried their products before so this was a great way to try them out! I do not wear makeup so I can’t speak to how the Green Clean works on that, but I have started using it to double cleanse to get off my SPF. I have sensitive skin but didn’t have any issues with the serum or toner. I am a huge fan of honey so was so pleased to find out the moisturizer smells like it! I have enjoyed using it and it’s been great for my skin during the winter months. This set is perfect for anyone wanting to try these products out before investing in the full size versions. nan
