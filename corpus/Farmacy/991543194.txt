This product feels so good on the skin! This product was gifted by Farmacy Beauty and I love the texture and consistency (and the color). After a few nights you can see the difference in the plumpness of your skin. Iâ€™ve been trying a bunch of new products at once including a retinol and this has kept my skin calm and smooth throughout. Would recommend if you need a solid product to protect your moisture barrier! nan
