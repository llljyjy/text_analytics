I received this complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. This eye cream is great for the AM because it targets darkness, dryness, and puffiness all in one luxurious-feeling cream; I definitely see a subtle difference after use. There is a very subtle citrus scent and while the coloring is yellow-hued it blends sheer and sinks into the skin. This would work well for any skin type, even especially dry and sensitive under eyes like mine (no stinging here!). Itâ€™s a little pricey for such a small amount but a little goes a long way. Great for AM
