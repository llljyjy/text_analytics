I love this face wash! When i got this the first time was in a boxycharm and i have just repurchased this like a few months ago. I actually have normal to dry skin and this is perfect, especially with the green clean balm and the honey halo moisturizer! Honestly this lathers up so well, smells good, and i just cant say enough good things! my perfect face wash!
