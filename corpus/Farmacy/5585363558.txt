Gifted by Farmacy. I’ve tried a few retinol serums and usually my skin is pretty sensitive to them but this stuff is SO gentle that I can use it 3x a week without issue!! There’s no noticeable smell and it absorbs quickly. I wake up with smoother and more even looking skin on the nights that I use it. If you’ve had problems with retinols in the past, this may be for you. nan
