This hyaluronic acid based serum is one of the three best out there. I apply this daily after my morning face wash (with Farmacy’s fabulous honey-based gel face wash).  I follow up with my moisturizer and finally a spritz of my thyme hydrosol and my skin loves me for gifting it with these healthy gems. I cannot comprehend how any user of this takes any issue whatsoever with its (natural) “fragrance”.  The scent is as mild as can be and is most lovely and light - and just a faint wisp of honey and mildly oatmeal-like (read: “there” but ever so subtle about it).  I adore this product and will use it forever and as well I would never advise Farmacy to change or otherwise omit the “fragrance” of this serum.  It is A+ perfect just as it is. Thanks Farmacy! SUPERB
