This is the best makeup remover ever! This product gets me excited to wash my face every night. It’s the first thing I use before I proceed to using the Youth to the People Cleanser. I keep the little spoon it came with to scoop up the balm, place it onto my palm, rub my hands together before I lather it onto my face. It smells amazing!! Make sure to wash your face with warm water to remove the cleansing balm. It’s going to turn into a milky liquid when you add water (super satisfying!). Considering how I am on tretinoin, my face would burn from just cleanser and moisturizer. However, when I added the cleansing balm into my night routine, adding moisturizer suddenly doesn’t sting anymore!! Best thing about this is product is that it’s also non-comedogenic. YOU NEED THIS IN YOUR NIGHT ROUTINE!
