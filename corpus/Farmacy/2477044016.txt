I was recently got this product complimentary from Farmacy Beauty but regardless I really like this vitamin c syrum. It made my face feel so smooth! I will say that if you apply it around your lips, it does have an odd taste but otherwise I was very happy with it. My skin felt well hydrated without being oily. I have combination skin and it helped to keep things balanced. Loved this strum!
