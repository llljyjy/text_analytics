I really like Farmacy’s products, so I was surprised at how much I didn’t like this one. I’m sure the formula is fabulous for long-term use, but the texture of this is so off-putting I can’t see myself using this again. Farmacy claims this serum is easily absorbed and oil-free, so I am left flummoxed as to how this serum feels so oily in texture that I hated the experience of applying it to my skin.
