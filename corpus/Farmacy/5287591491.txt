This product smells soo good! Like honey! I am unsure why some of the reviews say it smells bad. I do not have sensitive skin and this does tingle a little, but it is not overbearing at all. In fact, it kind of feels refreshing. As for the results, my skin has a much more even texture the next day after I use it. Love!!
