Gifted by Farmacy Beauty. This vitamin C serum has a dry oil finish that sinks into the skin quickly and layers well under both gel and cream moisturizers. I do notice a difference in my skin clarity after regularly using this. I have a lot of acne scars that tend to be quite stubborn and this serum has helped brighten those hyperpigmentation marks. Like other vitamin C serums, this does have a noticeable scent so I tend to use this more at night. Effective Vitamin C Serum
