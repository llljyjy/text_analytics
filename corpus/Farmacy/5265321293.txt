Gifted by Farmacy Beauty in exchange for an honest review. I’ve been wanting to try a retinol to add to my skincare routine and I think I may have found one that is gentle enough on my skin. The first couple of times, I personally didn’t notice any difference. But it did feel really nice on the skin. Because it is so gentle on the skin, I have been using it 3 times a week. And I have not noticed any irritation. I look forward to seeing the benefits now and long term. Gentle on the Skin
