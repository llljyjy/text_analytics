First off I just love the texture of this product it’s gel like and spreads well. It doesn’t have that sting to it as some vitamin C do. One thing I have noticed while using it is it makes my skin hydrated and plump. I haven’t used it for long to notice fading of my dark spots which I’m looking forward to see gone. So this is way I removed a star. So far so good
