The Wake Up Honey Eye Cream has a great texture and absorbs nicely. Not too sticky. I used this before makeup and it really helped moisturize my under eye area. I have eye sensitivities and it didnâ€™t irritate my skin around my eyes. I get puffy and red under my eyes due to allergies and it calmed down the inflammation. Great product! Great Product!
