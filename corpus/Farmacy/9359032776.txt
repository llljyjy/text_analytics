Complimentary from Farmacy Beauty! So, here’s a deal, it is definitely a pretty solid product, I do enjoy the fact that the consistency is extremely lightweight, and it’s not necessarily the most expensive product in the same category out there! However, as an influencer I must say this brand has been in a lot of hot water lately because their marketing department has not necessarily been treating people who come from my industry fairly which is something I hope is going to change later! Which is why I’m giving it three stars, purely because of the marketing department and their failure to treat people like me with respect and dignity :( nan
