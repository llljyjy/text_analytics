My husband and I both love this for our normal/dry skin! The texture is so lovely and melts into the skin like butter. This leaves my skin feeling very plump and glowy. I prefer to use this at night and on days I don’t wear makeup. My husband likes to use it a few times a week when he wants something richer than his usual moisturizer. I would definitely recommend trying this out if you have normal to dry skin and want something super thick and buttery that also blends in easily and isn’t greasy. Thick, buttery goodness
