I received this product gifted by Farmacy Beauty. Farmacy can do no wrong and this is no exception! The texture is actually serum like unlike a few other vitamin products I love which are more watery or lotion-like. Waterless describes the texture the best way to me. It’s not oily but that’s the closest other word I can think of to describe it. It makes my skin feel hydrated and glowy upon application. I’ve used every morning with no irritation (although it says you can use it day & night). I really do feel that my skin is brighter and texture is improved - my skin is so smooth! I find that the product has no scent unlike other reviews I read. nan
