This serum feels very nice on the skin. It comes out pretty watery, but it has more of an oil-like feeling rather than a serum. I found that it sunk into my skin very quickly and left my skin glowing. As I’ve experienced with other vitamin c products, this serum did leave my skin a bit red, but not uncomfortable feeling. I don’t have any dark spots or discoloration, but the glow was amazing!Gifted by Farmacy Great vitamin c option!
