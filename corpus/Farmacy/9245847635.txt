performance | full star | love love love!! This is now one of three vitamin c serums that doesn’t break me out nor cause rosacea flare up! & the glowwww omg *insert you can see me from the mooooontexture | full star | love how it’s more of an oily texture than sticky serum, but still soaks into the skinscent | full star | there isn’t really a smell to it packaging | full star | the pop of orange is super cute & packing is clean and not filled with a bunch of verbiage ingredients | full star | this ingredients list is straight fire!! Short list, no industrial citrus just good ol extracts! & no added fragrance value | .9 star | $50 can be on the higher price point for some, but good value for comparable brands Total 5.9 out of 6 stars New fave alert!!
