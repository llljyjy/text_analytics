I got a sample with my order and it has been a month and I still have a good amount left! I’ve been using it every single night and I like it but don’t love it. I have acne prone skin, a little oily but mostly normal so I thought this might be too greasy for me but it sits nicely and absorbs rather quickly. I only use a thin layer for the my face (except my forehead because that’s where I breakout) and like a little goes a long way so I can certainly see the full size being worth it if you love the product. The reason why I wouldn’t buy the full size is because I haven’t seen any results. I think it makes the skin look super plump and glowy while you use it but those results don’t actually last. I’ve been using it for over a month, I would expect to wake up with glowy skin or extra moisturized skin but it doesn’t make a huge difference, just something nice to have I guess. It’s Alright
