Wake Up Honey has a light, pleasant scent. The cream is hydrating, absorbs easily, and it is not greasy once applied. I am able to layer makeup and skincare with no issue. My under eye area is a brighter, but I havenâ€™t noticed a big difference in my (currently) severe puffiness yet.  For the brightening properties, this is a great eye cream. nan
