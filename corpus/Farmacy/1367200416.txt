This actually works! I have fairly sensitive skin so this does burn a little for the first five minutes. I leave it on overnight and rinse in the morning and apply my moisturizer and SPF***. (Please use spf when using any resurfacing products.) My skin looks brand new and glowing! Even in the winter months my skin looks radiant. I will use this 1-3 times a week as a night treatment only. I am leaving this review as I restock this miracle serum.Ps only wearing eye makeup in my photo. No cc creams, concealers, or foundation. Itâ€™s also January. Worth the burn!
