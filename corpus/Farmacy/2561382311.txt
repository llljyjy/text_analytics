I was gifted by Farmacy Beauty the “10% Niacinamide Night Mask“ in exchange for a review. Thank you at Farmacy for giving me a chance to try this item.  This is a leave-on night mask with 10% niacinamide that is tested to improve skin texture, tone, refine pores, and help strengthen skin barrier. The mask contains 10% niacinamide (Vitamin B3) which helps smooth and even skin texture and refine pores, 3% Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5) + Beta-glucan which help hydrate and strengthen the skin barrier, and blueberry seed oil is antioxidant rich for the skin.  I add a thin layer as the last step in my evening routine. It does help my skin feel moisturized, however I’ve noticed that I cannot use it every night since it can cause some peeling around the dryer areas of my face. I’ve been using it about 3 times per week and this has been working great for me. A little goes a long way, so this mask should last for a good while. I love using niacinamide to deal with hyperpigmentation since it doesn’t cause at much irritation on my skin. Great Niacinamide Mask
