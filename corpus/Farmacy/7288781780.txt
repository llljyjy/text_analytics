Yes I’m giving FIVE stars! This product has given me more results in 3 months than I’ve had over the last 10 years of trying so many other things. I had texture issues, large pores, redness, itchy skin. My skin has transformed so much that I opt to go without foundation more than I wear it now, which I’d never leave the house without it in the past. My suggestion would be less is more…put a thin layer. I came on to order another so I don’t run out. Life Changing For Me!
