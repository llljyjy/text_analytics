I had been looking forward to trying this for several months and finally did. It works very well, but I keep waking up the next morning with my eyes matted shut. It makes my eyes water after using it and they continue to water through the night. It also blurs my vision and makes it seem like I’m looking through a thin film of something. It doesn’t make them swell or anything, but it’s definitely irritating them to a degree. But it really does work great. Good, but maybe not great for the eyes
