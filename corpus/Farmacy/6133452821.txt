I’m kicking myself for trying this version. I’ve used the original with no problems at all, but thought I’d give this version a try since I liked the idea of it being fragrance free. While it removes my makeup just as well as the original, it leaves behind a film that I then have to wash again with a second cleanser, which is something I never had to do with the original. (I know that double cleansing is a very common way to wash your face but the original worked in such a way that I only needed a swipe of micellar water for stubborn waterproof eyeliner.) stick to the original
