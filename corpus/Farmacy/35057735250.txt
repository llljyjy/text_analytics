feels and blends like butter on post-cleansed skin. it feels like a cloud is sitting on your face. when i wake up in the morning after using the mask, my face is glowing and soft like never before. it has no scent (to me at least) and does not have a sticky feeling after application. for me, it is best on top of a serum or light layer of normal moisturizer to help layer more moisture if your skin is really dehydrated and needs the additional support. this sleeping mask really is a game-changer to my nighttime routine, resetting my skin after a long day. 10/10. already recommended this products to a few friends! nan
