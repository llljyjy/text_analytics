I have very dry, sensitive, and acne prone skin. Tried this for the first time and it was amazing! I admit I was hesitant due to the “warming” sensation but it was actually very nice. I read “warming” and thought they meant like a ‘burn’ - it’s not. It lasts for a minute and is very pleasing. Kept on for 20 min and rinsed off in the shower- followed up with the Honey Halo moisturizer and my skin was fresh and new. No breakouts or anything bad. It is so nice to have a face mask that is safe for sensitive skin, I have a bad sensitivity to fragrance and other junk companies like to put in their skincare but Farmacy has NEVER done that to me. Very Nice Face Mask for Sensitive-Dry Skin
