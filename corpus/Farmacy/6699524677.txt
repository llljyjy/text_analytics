gifted by Farmacy Beauty - I’ve been using this new serum for a few days and I’ve been enjoying it. The packaging is very nice and cute. The product it self is more of a vitamin c oil than a serum because it’s quite oily but I don’t mind because I have dry skin and it soaks in well. It also smells a little weird but everyone has different preferences! nan
