I really like the texture of the Vitamin C serum, I have a lot of dark spots from being in the sun and I hope with continued use it will help to reduce hyperpigmentation. It doesnâ€™t irritate my skin and absorbs nicely. There is no discernible fragrance which is a plus and it goes nicely under moisturizer. Gifted by Farmacy Beauty nan
