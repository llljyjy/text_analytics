I first tried this balm after a wedding from one of my friends. I immediately loved it! it melted off my eye makeup so easily no extra tugging or hard rubbing to get all the waterproof mascara off. It didn’t burn my eyes, had a light sent and my felt so nice and smooth afterwards. This balm has become a staple in my nightly routine. Some might think it’s a little pricey but I definitely think it’s worth the price, it has definitely lasted me a while! Love. Love. Love
