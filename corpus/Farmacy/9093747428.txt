I have tried many makeup removing balms and this is simply the best! I have sensitive skin and this did not cause any irritation or break me out. I have been using this for a couple of years now and have tried others but they just didn’t work as well. The Drunk elephant one burned my skin and left it feeling tight and dry. This one helps remove all my makeup, no matter what I’m wearing! I use this first and then my cleanser and it has helped keep my skin clean and acne free! THE BEST
