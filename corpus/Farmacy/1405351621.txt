I decided to give this a try during a sale and I’m SO glad I made the purchase. This serum is incredibly gentle yet one of the most effective vitamin c serums I’ve ever used. The texture is unlike most serums I’ve used. It is like a lightweight gel, but when applied it feels like an oil despite being oil free. It completely absorbs within minutes and leaves behind a smooth silky feel. (I especially appreciate this since it is silicone free!). I apply it at night and by morning my skin is softer, smoother, more even toned and surprisingly less oily than usual. It has helped enormously with the amount of acne I typically have. It has kept breakouts at bay. I’m looking forward to continuing this to see if it helps with dark spots and scars. I’m so pleased with the overall appearance of my skin! nan
