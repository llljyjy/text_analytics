This product was gifted by Farmacy Beauty but thoughts are my own. This new mask from Farmacy Beauty is such a nourishing and moisturizing mask for my skin. I am a fan! I apply it overnight and really am impressed at how soft and glowy it leaves my skin the next morning. The texture is thick and is dewy so I would recommend using a thin layer. Because I use this at night, I do not mind the dewy finish. Really enjoying this mask
