Received a sample and got a few uses out of it. Works great! Make up and sunscreen come right off, I don’t experience a waxy residue, it feels moisturizing. I rinse this off, pat dry then wash with Youth to the People’s Superfood Cleanser and my skin feels hydrated. clean, and isn’t stripped at all. I don’t get the feeling this is intended to be used for a single cleanse,  you should double cleanse with it. well be buying a full size! Great for dry skin!!
