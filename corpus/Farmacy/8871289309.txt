this is my second jar of this moisturizer, I love it so much. The consistency is what continues to bring me to it because it’s not too thick but it’s also just enough in the winter time, especially. Overall, it does a really good job at moisturizing for my combination skin while also not clogging my pores for my acne prone skin. gifted by Farmacy Beauty nan
