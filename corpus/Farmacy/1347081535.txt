I have been using this product for 2 weeks now and I really like it BUT there’s a couple things I don’t like - The smell is odd and not pleasant. It doesn’t linger so that’s good but it doesn’t smell good. I am not sure if others have this issue or not but mine will not pump properly. I have to try a few times to get a pump of product out. Usually I feel like it’s not enough and continue to try to pump more out and nothing comes out. I might go back to Sephora and try to exchange, it’s too expensive to not pump out correctly. Overall if you can get over the scent and don’t have issues with the pump (or leaking as others have mentioned) then definitely worth a shot. It does have a “greasy” feel but it absorbs quickly and within a couple minutes of apply this + sunscreen I am able to do my foundation. nan
