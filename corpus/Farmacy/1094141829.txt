I’m not into “clean” brands as that is just a BS marketing term. I do however love skincare, and this is a great light weight moisturizer. I have combo skin that is acne prone, and use RX Vit A, acid exfoliation, and Vit C on my skin daily. It has nice glass packaging, and the lid is easy to get off. It smells really good as it does have some added fragrance (Limonene), so be aware of that if fragrance bothers your skin. I find that I really love this gel like moisturizer during the hot summer months as it doesn’t make my skin feel heavy with moisture, and I do find it moisturizing enough during the winter especially when it’s layered with other products like Dr Jardt ceramides. However, I usually keep this in use for the summer. It’s light weight feeling with enough moisture to make my skin feel supple and not laden down.  It’s one of my “go-tos” that I’ve been using for a few years now. 10/10
