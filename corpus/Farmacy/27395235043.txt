I am so impressed with this retinol serum! It includes both retinal and encapsulated retinol to be effective, but also gentle on skin. I love that Farmacy included ingredients like ceramides to protect the skin barrier and upcycled Kalahari melon and raspberry seed oils to nourish and restore moisture to the skin and to minimize any irritation that the retinoids may cause. I havenâ€™t experienced any dryness or irritation from this! The texture is light weight and liquidy; this serum works into my skin very nicely, no complaints! I wake up to refreshed and smooth skin. Complimentary from Farmacy Beauty.* nan
