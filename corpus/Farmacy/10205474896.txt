This 10% Niacinamide Night Mask is gifted to me by Farmacy beauty. i like the  gel cream texture of this mask and i love that it’s fragrance-free. The texture is nice on my skin and it’s lightweight. In my opinion, this mask is a little thicker and slightly tackier than the other night masks I tried but it is still comfortable. My skin felt smooth after and when I wake up and wash my face, it feels so smooth and moisturized. Great to try night mask
