I can only use gentle cleansers because of my sensitive rosacea skin. I had been using the Fresh Soy cleanser for the past 2 years, but I noticed recently that it left my forehead feeling tight. So, I wanted to try something else, and my research led me to the Farmacy Clean Bee!Positives: not only is this labeled a gentle cleanser, but it is also targeted for dry skin types, like myself! While i still feel like I definitely need to follow up with moisturizer, it does leave my skin feeling refreshed and clean. Added bonus, this cleanser comes with a pump! I prefer to cleanse in the shower, so this makes it so easy. The ONLY slight negative i have noticed, is that i sometimes feel like i have to really rinse it off well. The lather is nice, don’t get me wrong. It doesn’t foam up super crazy, just enough. But one time when i rinsed my face and went to dry it, i still had some lather under my chin and on my neck. No one else has mentioned this though, so this could be an error i am making, because i did use more product that one time. While this isn’t a negative for me personally, it is worth noting that if you are sensitive to smells, I would stop at Sephora and smell a tester in person before you buy. It isn’t added fragrance, it is natural, but it can be quite strong. Personally i think this smells better than the Fresh Soy cleanser. Overall, this is a nice cleanser, and will definitely be part of my cleansing rotation. I have had this less than a week, so unless this starts to break me out, i will definitely repurchase this! So far so good!
