This makeup remover is AMAZING. Gives me the best clean and has helped my acne tremendously. Its so easy to use, especially when I’m tired and don’t want to get messy. BUT the price is too much for how little you get. Also, it makes my eyes very blurry after use which is a bit annoying. I have to use an eye wash afterwards. perfect product, wish it lasted longer for price
