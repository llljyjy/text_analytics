*Gifted by Farmacy Beauty* This serum is very nice! I love using vitamin c products to help brighten scarring and dark spots. It has a very light texture, and soaks into the skin pretty fast. The texture is actually one of my favorites for any serum, it felt really good on the skin. It didn’t feel too heavy or greasy. It has nice practical packaging too! There’s a very light natural scent, not very noticeable which I liked. It really helps brighten and even out your skin, will definitely continue using! So good!
