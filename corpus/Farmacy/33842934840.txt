I recieved this complimentary from Farmacy. I really love the feel of this texture as it is very creamy and not overly thick. I can easily apply this to my face and immediately see how it seeps so well into my skin and does not leave me feeling greasy or like I put too much.  I simply just feel moisturized and my skin looks radiant and well taken care of.  I enjoy this a lot and do like how this has apple extract and honey in it making it a perfect combo. I have dry skin during the cold months so I need all the moisture I can get and I can say this is it to combat against my dry issues. Creamy and delightful
