I religiously used this product for 5 years and this will be the last time I ever use it. I’m someone with dry and oily skin, and just regular cream based moisturizer never quite hydrated my skin enough. The original formula of this moisturizer was perfect; it worked well and felt lightweight without it getting overly oily or feeling my skin left dry. I know people had mixed opinions about the scent, but as an Asian-American, the scent was nostalgic and reminded me of those creamy juice ice bars that would come in a plastic tube from the Asian market or Ranch 99. So, I loved, LOVED the scent. I recently was running low on this product and purchased a new one before I went on a trip because I would be out of my current one by the time I returned home. Today, I opened it since finishing my jar of the old formula and I was heartbroken and disappointed when I opened the box and saw the “new“ packaging and even more disappointed by the formula. I’m not a fan of this change, the new formula doesn’t feel or hydrate like it used to, I hate opening the lid on new formula and getting even a whiff of that “new“ non-scented smell from the product. I’m disappointed in Farmacy for whatever corners they cut to “revamp“ or change this moisturizer that didn’t need ANY tweaking in the first place.And to prove how heartbroken and how much I hate this product now, this is my first ever review for anything I’ve purchased from Sephora. I guess I’ll have to find a different brand because Farmacy isn’t going to get any more of my money because of this. I will never forgive them unless they reverse these “improvements“ because they ruined one of their best products. You should be ashamed Farmacy.Rest in peace original Daily Greens moisturizer, fly high and know that you will never be forgotten :( </3 I'm breaking up with my favorite moisturizer :[
