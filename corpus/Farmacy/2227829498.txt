So sad about the new formula! Why did they change it?? I’ve used this moisturizer for almost 2 years and loved it, and now it’s totally different. I saw other recent reviews complaining about the change but I thought I’d give it a try, hoping it wouldn’t be much different. But it DOES NOT moisturize. I’ll be returning it. And now to find a new moisturizer - so annoying when I’ve bought this one consistently for so long and been so happy with it. Why do they try to fix what isn’t broken??! New Formula — WHY?! So bad!!
