After using this product for over a month I can officially say I am disappointed. The bottle leaks, the product stings when applies and the texture and smell are unpleasant (to me). I have not seen any positive changes in my skin from using this product, this one is a real miss ! There are way better Vitamin C products out there. Not worth it
