I was gifted by Farmacy Beauty new Wake Up Honey Eye Cream and after using it for a week or so I really like the results. I’ve noticed that the dark circles under my eyes have me looking a little less like a raccoon 🦝 before I put on my makeup. The under eye area is also looking smoother. I would definitely recommend giving it a shot. Great for dark circles
