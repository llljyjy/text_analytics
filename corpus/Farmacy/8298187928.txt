I bought this after receiving a sample - its so creamy but also cleansing. Rubbing it on your face actively dissolves the makeup from the day, but it also feels hydrating and makes your skin feel amazing during and after. I sometimes use a specific eye-makeup remover wipe prior, just because I don’t enjoy rubbing cream into eyelashes (it feels like I’m constantly at risk of rubbing into my eyeballs) but this has been such a great product, and one I use consistently! Balmy Cleanser - a lovely nighttime ritual
