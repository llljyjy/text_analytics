Let me start off by saying that I purchased this product in store, with my own hard earned money - not received for free. Okay so, I have THE most sensitive skin ever. Have struggled with hormonal and cystic acne for over 10 years. Some days clearer than others and some days the condition of my face is wreaking havoc on my entire mental and physical well-being lol. I have tried every Vitmain C serum under the sun, it is my GO TO ingredient and I love vitamin C. I’ve tried perricone, ole henricksen (spelling error, sorry!), drunk elephant, murad, etc. I am sure there is more. This is by far the best. It does not make me breakout, does not sting (too bad) upon application if I have an “open“ wound/breakout, and my skin looks so much brighter and more even. I will also mention that is has not dried out my skin or made it feel too “tight“ after application. All of this being said, I completely changed my entire skincare routine so it is also probably the combination of products I am using. But this is here to stay in my skincare routine, FOR SURE.For reference I am 24 with combo skin. Very sensitive, as mentioned and I live in OK - very hot and humid summers, dry and cold winters. My skin is always great during the summer time so this could be another factor contributing to how awesome I think this particular serum is working - will see how it stands up when it gets cold!!
