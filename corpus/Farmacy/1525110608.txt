Sometimes my skin freaks out from Niacinamide but this new launch from Farmacy hasn’t broken me out yet!My skin actually seems to be responding well so far. When I wake up, I see less dullness and my skin appears smoother. As someone with large pores, I don’t really notice any difference in my pores yet but I seem to wake up less oily which is a plus! I do need more time to test this out, but I think even those with sensitive skin can use this. Item received complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. Less oily + helps with dullness
