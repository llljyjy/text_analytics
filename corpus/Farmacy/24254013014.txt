I recieved this complimentary from Farmacy in exchange for my honest opinion. Firstly I love the packaging and the container that holds the eye cream, it feels very luxurious. There is also so much more product in the container then it looks like which is a plus. I was hoping that it had scent but it’s not a worry. This eye cream goes a long way and you don’t need much. When I apply my eyes appear brighter and hydrated. I have not seen any long term effects yet, but I am hopeful at how well it has been working so far. Lovely eye cream
