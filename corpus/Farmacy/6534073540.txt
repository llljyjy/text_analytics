Love this product, absorbs fast, works well. Just take your time to get used to it. Using this, I’ve seen my skin plumper, I’ve had less breakouts and it just looks and feels better overall. The rest of my routine is mostly focused on hydration and barrier care, and sunscreen obviously. I would absolutely recommend this retinol to others. Gifted by Farmacy Beauty. nan
