I really like it I have sensitive acne prone skin and it didn’t break me out it helped with my acne a lot. The Paula’s choice broke me out but this one didn’t. It didn’t really help with pores but it did help with acne as well as acne scarring. Skin didn’t feel too stripped or dry after usage. Overall really recommend GREAT TONER
