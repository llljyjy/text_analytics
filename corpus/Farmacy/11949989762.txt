I’ve been using green clean for four years now, after working at Sephora and asking my boss what makeup remover I should buy. This is by far my favorite makeup remover I’ve ever used. It melts off even the most stuck on waterproof mascara with minimal rubbing, and honestly has maintained the integrity of my lashes because they don’t get so much friction as with regular makeup wipes or remover. I wear bright, heavy eye makeup most days, and the 3.4 oz size will last me between 10 months and a year because I don’t have to use that much each night. favorite product as a former Sephora employee
