This moisturizer is the one I’ve been searching for! My acne medication makes my skin extremely dry and flaky, so I needed something that could keep it hydrated. I normally have combination skin. This product is packaged beautifully and I love that the spatula connects to the lid. I’ve only had it for a couple days but have noticed a difference. After using my acne medication, the next day my skin becomes dry and my makeup flakes. I used this before my makeup and my skin was not dry at all and actually a little oily. I wouldn’t recommend this if you wear makeup or have oily skin unless you wear powder or blot throughout the day. It does provide a beautiful glow and would be great to wear alone during the day or at night. I am so happy I finally found a moisturizer that can keep up with my skin and highly recommend this!!! in love!!!!
