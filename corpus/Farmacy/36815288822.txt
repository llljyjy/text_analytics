I’m generally sceptical of Vitamin C serums but this has been such a nice addition to my daytime routine since it was gifted to me. It’s lightweight and non irritating and I’m excited to keep using it. It does have a distinct smell but it dissipated pretty quickly so I’m not too hung up on that part. I do have dry skin so the oil like texture worked fine for me All in all, definitely worth a try if you can spring for it. Pretty decent product
