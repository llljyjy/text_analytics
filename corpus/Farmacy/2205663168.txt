I have normal skin. My face is not dry or oily, and this really works for me. I did not know that this was a formula change when I purchased it. I have not used the old formula, so I cannot compare the two. I was looking for a moisturizer that is hydrating and oil free. This is it! This moisturizer is everything! The fact that it is also fragrance-free is an added bonus! I honestly don’t want my facial moisturizer to be scented. This delivers the oil free hydration that I wanted, and I love the consistency. It’s not a cream but more like a gel-like serum. I really love it! I bought another jar for my teenaged son. He has sensitive, acne-prone skin. This works really great for his face, too. I hope that they don’t change the formula back to however it was before with the fragrance. The market is already saturated with those types of facial products. This is something refreshing and special. I will definitely repurchase. Review of Fragrance Free Formula
