Farmacy Beauty gifted me their waterless vitamin C serum in exchange for my honest review.  Farmacy is always clever with their formulas, and this elevated vitamin C serum is no exception.  Vitamin C is a daily must-have in my routine- it is antiaging, with powerful antioxidants, it brightens hyperpigmentation, and it strengthens sunscreen for added protection.  My skin is dry, so this formulations light oil texture feels so nice and hydrating and strengthens my skin acid mantle, but also absorbs quickly, leaving a pretty dewy finish. nan
