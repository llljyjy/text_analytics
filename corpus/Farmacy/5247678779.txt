After using this toner for many years now, I truly believe this toner has single handedly improved my skin. Growing up I always had pretty large pores around my nose especially, and breakouts often in my t-zone. Using this toner has decreased the amount of breakouts I have on my skin significantly and its helped with absorption of other products so well. Now I wouldn’t really consider my skin oily anymore, its gone to become more of a normal leaning dry, but I don’t mind that now since my skincare routine is more geared towards nourishing my skin rather than trying to strip it all of it oils. Can't live without
