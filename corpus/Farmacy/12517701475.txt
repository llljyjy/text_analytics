Vitamin C is a must for me! I use it every single morning. I was super excited that Farmacy released this powerful bottle of antioxidants. It came at the perfect time because I was in need of a new Vitamin C serum!It’s a waterless formula (which allows for maximum stability/penetration) that not only contains 10% L-Ascorbic acid, but also has Alpha Arbutin  and Ferulic Acid!! Yes.. Ferulic Acid!! This is seriously a powerhouse combo and I am IMPRESSED!! Clear, no added fragrance, and it absorbs like a dream leaving ZERO tacky/ greasy film. My moisturizer and SPF layer over this easily with no pilling. No irritation. I LOVE IT!! Keep in mind is does have the typical LAscorbic acid smell to it.. but it fades quickly. Vitamin C isn’t meant to smell GOOD!!! It’s meant to work and this one does. It’s packaged in an opaque airless pump to ensure freshness. If you’re not using a Vitamin C in your routine, what on earth are you waiting for? This is THE product to help reduce hyperpigmentation, brighten, firm, and fight off free radicals. My new fave!
