This Honey Halo moisturizer is a delightful, much needed treat for my maturing skin. This ceremide packed moisturizer has a tantalizing texture that’s got my skin feeling and looking replenished and smooth. I’ve been using this moisturizer consistently for a short time now and I already see my fine lines diminishing and my skin looking more plump. I received this Honey Halo moisturizer complimentary from Farmacy in exchange for my honest opinion, and I must say it’s definitely a note worthy moisturizer that has helped me tremendously. I love this moisturizer!
