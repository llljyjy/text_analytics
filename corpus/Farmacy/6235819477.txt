This product was gifted by Farmacy Beauty in exchange for my honest opinion. I adore Farmacy products but their vitamin Cs are just not for me. This felt kind of heavy on my oily skin and after the brand recommended it to use 1/2 pump on oily skins even that felt like it just sat on top of my skin. I experienced some pilling as well when using a full pump, and after trying it for almost 2 weeks I think it was the culprit of some acne spots. I gave it to my mom to try since she has more normal skin and she loved it. She noticed immediate radiance and glow. Therefore, I think this would be amazing for dry-normal skins but may be too much for oily skin gals like me. Great for dry-normal skins but not for oily skins
