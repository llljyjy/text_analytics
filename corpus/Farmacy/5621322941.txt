I really wanted to like this vitamin C serum since I own & love several other Farmacy products. There are several things I disliked about this product: it’s greasy and doesn’t absorb well, the smell is horrible, and it led to multiple breakouts. I will stick to the Ole Henrikson Banana Bright Vitamin C Serum - although I was hoping this could be a slightly more affordable alternative :( Not a fan...
