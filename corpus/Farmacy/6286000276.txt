Farmacy vit A retinol serum has become a staple in my collection. I have been using it twice a week in the nights. This has helped my skin so much. I feel my skin has a glow in the mornings. I love how smooth my skin feels after this. It’s gentle to skin so if you are sensitive skin and worried about retinol, don’t be. This is a good one to start with. nan
