I received this gifted by Farmacy in exchange for my honest review. I love my Honey Halo moisturizer,so was very excited to try this. It definitely didn’t disappoint! The texture is amazing, and it has a very lovely, light honey scent. I love that this is safe to use not only under eyes,but on eyelids as well. It didn’t irritate my eyes at all,most products I have tried have. I love using this when I wake up,it definitely takes away some of the puffiness and dark circles. I can’t wait to see longterm results, so far I am loving this! My new fav!
