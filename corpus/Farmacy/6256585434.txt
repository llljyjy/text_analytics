I don’t think I’m the biggest fan of this eye cream. I did not notice any difference with using it. My under eye didn’t look any brighter nor did I see a difference in puffiness.  Maybe this just isn’t the right product for my skin. I like the texture of the eye cream and that it absorbed nicely on my skin but I wasn’t a fan of the scent. I received this product complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. nan
