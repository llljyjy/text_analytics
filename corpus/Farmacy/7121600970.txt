I have been using this overnight mask a couple nights a week and have seen visible results! It comes with an applicator which is a nice touch but itâ€™s easy to accidentally use too much. Even so, it absorbs into the skin over time and leaves my face feeling plump and moisturized the next morning. Does have a strange smell though. Gifted by farmacy beauty. nan
