This product was gifted by farmacy beauty in exchange of my honest review. I’ve been using this moisturizer for a week now. And I must say, it’s one of the nicest moisturizers I’ve used in a while. My skin feels more fresh and glowing. It keeps my makeup from cracking as well. I use it under my makeup as well. Love everything about it. The texture is for sure soft and puffy and it absorbs in my skin easily. It’s not running and has a consistency. I recommend thud product. A must have for winters !
