I haven’t tried a lot of balms yet but knew I needed to stop using Micelle and wipes bc my skin was getting so dry. Oddly enough the first time I used this my skin felt really dry after but maybe it just adjusted after a couple more uses. Similarly my eyes were kind of bothered the first time but I just make sure to consciously keep them tightly shut and I haven’t had an issue since. I use not waterproof mascara so I haven’t tried it with waterproof. Love the mild scent and spatula. Little goes a long way. First time balm user
