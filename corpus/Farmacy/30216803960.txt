I received this complimentary from Farmacy. I should have known that a waterless serum would be mostly propanediol and I hate how that feels on my skin. I bet that this is a great serum for anyone who doesn’t mind that texture but to me it feels oily and greasy and slippery in a bad way. I tried layering it under different stuff and if I’m light on the rest of my routine then it’s tolerable but it’s still not my favorite. I’d just say avoid it if you don’t like the feel of propanediol...otherwise it might be great for you! Heavy on the propanediol (and feels greasy)
