Probably a “holy grail“ product for me. I love cleansing balms! Previously I used oil cleansers, but I find these (balms) a bit less messy. Very nice texture that can be easily applied to face (not too thick/doesn’t require too much “working in“). Essential for helping to cleanse skin of makeup (including mascara), but I also use this on non-makeup days because it helps breakdown sunscreen better than a foaming cleanser alone (which I use afterwards). Barely notice a fragrance. Doesn’t break me out/clog pores. I am on my 3rd or 4th tub, so I think that’s proof enough how I feel about it? Awesome
