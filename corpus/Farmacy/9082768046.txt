This moisturizer is incredible. I never take the time to write reviews, but I decided I would with this product since I was on the fence about it due to low review numbers. COSTS: First off, it may seem pricey but if you look at it by cost per mL, its not. This size is .89 per mL. I used to use Superfood Air-Whip Moisturizer by Youth to the People which costs 1.07 per mL - FAR MORE EXPENSIVE.EFFECT: This moisturizer is a holy grail. I was worried about it clogging pors etc. but it does not. It is very hydrating and gives you an incredible glow. I think because it has honey it has some antibacterial effects because the few zits I would get, I rarely get anymore. It does smell like honey; Nothing strong but its there. I was worried based on some peoples reviews but it is not that bad and it goes away pretty quick. Overall, i think the bit of smell is definitely worth the glow.PACKAGING: Awesome packaging. It comes with a metal spatula like thing to pick up and apply the moisturizer on your face. I really like this because it keeps dirty hands out. I also find the moisturizer is difficult to scoop with your fingers because it melts a bit (hard to explain). My only concern it being able to get all the product since the mouth if narrow and the body goes wide. I can update once i know. Buy it. You won't regret it.
