Bought this a couple of weeks ago and so far I like it! It’s a thicker balm, scent free, glides on the face very silky and removes all of my eye makeup and sunscreen. I use it as a first step, so I do follow up with a cleanser. Also comes with a little spatula to remove the product from the jar without sticking your fingers in there. I’d buy again and recommend as a 1st step in a double cleanse. nan
