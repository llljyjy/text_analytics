I love all of the Farmacy products I’ve tried including this one.  The Wake Up Honey Eye Cream is a new favorite.  I’ve been using this AM & PM an have noticed a slight reduction in dark circles and puffiness.  I’m sure I will notice more of a difference with continued use.This contains caffeine, peptides and Vitamin C which make it great for my skin.  It leaves my eye area moisturized and provides a smooth base for my makeup.This was gifted to me by Farmacy Beauty for my honest review. New Favorite
