I have been using the new waterless vitamin C that Farmacy gifted me and here is my thoughts. First, my skin is normal, sensitive and acne prone and I found this to work well. This is strong at 10% L-ascorbic with alpha arbutin and ferulic acid. This does have 2 citrus extracts but these haven’t caused any irritation or sensitivity. This can be a bit drying on my skin but when paired with a hydrating serum and moisturizer you will be fine. I haven’t used this long enough to see any changed in hyperpigmentation but that will take time to fade. Overall, I think this is a good formula and a good price. Sensitive skin
