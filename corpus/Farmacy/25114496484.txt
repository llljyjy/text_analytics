I’m using a combination of other anti aging products, so it’s not clear exactly if this product specifically is the reason my skin feels soft, hydrated and smooth. But I’ve had no issues using this product and I’m almost done the bottle. I did not have any redness or irritation, but I also have normal skin type. I started off using it twice a week as instructed by a Sephora employee. Then slowly to every night as tolerated and have had no issues. Ever since I started using it, I’ve noticed I’m getting significantly less breakouts and my skin doesn’t get oily during the day anymore. I used to break out easily but now I’ve fully developed normal skin for the first time in my life! I’m in my late 20s for reference. The scent is not strong so I was surprised when I saw some reviews saying the smell is horrible. It also has a “clean green” stamp which is very important to me. Perhaps it has that scent some people seem to hate because they do not add synthetic fragrances? Anyway, 5 stars for me! Will purchase again. nan
