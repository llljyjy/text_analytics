This cream has a very nice lightweight texture that doesnâ€™t feel runny, it glides onto the skin beautifully and absorbs quickly leaving the under-eye area looking brighter and smoother. I also like the heavy glass jar it comes in, so elegant and unique. The Wake Up Honey Eye Cream was gifted by Farmacy Beauty. Like it!
