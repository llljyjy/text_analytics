I skeptical when it comes to trying new cleansing balms. The Clinique cleansing balm is my tried and true. I grabbed this one before I went to swim in the lake with a friend and needed something fast and small. I was pleased with the results. Emulsified really well if you’re sensitive to fragrance although this one is light it’s noticeable and smells kinda like a candy or lime and I liked it. Does kinda leave a film on the eyeballs but wasn’t irritating. Nice cleansing balm
