I received the 10% Niacinamide Night Mask complimentary from Farmacy Beauty and I’m obsessed! Farmacy NAILED this formula! It is so hydrating and seals in moisture, but the way my skin feels the morning after is incredible! It feels bouncy, smooth and bump free! I don’t have a ton of breakouts, but I do notice a remarkable difference in how smooth my skin looks after a week of using nightly. Overall, pores look less noticeable on my cheeks and the little milia along my lower cheeks aren’t popping up at all. So happy to have this in my life! This is an instant fave!
