This is my holy grail moisturizer. Many moisturizers cause me some sort of breakout but I’m on my third jar(the big size) and have not had one single issue. I swear my skin sighs with relief when I apply this. Normally I stay away from products with any fragrance but it’s a very light honey smell and doesn’t irritate my skin or my nose. Was quite confused by some of the reviews stating that it’s heavily fragranced as I don’t find that to be true. Another review claimed it was gritty and unless they got a bad batch there is absolutely nothing gritty about this moisturizer. It’s very creamy and absorbs beautifully into the skin and never had a pilling problem when I apply my SPF which happens quite often with other moisturizers (Skinfix looking at you!). Yes, it’s pricey but it’s worth every single penny imo. Holy Grail!!!
