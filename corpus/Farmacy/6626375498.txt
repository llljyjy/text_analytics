This product was complimentary from Farmacy! I always start very gently with retinols because you never know if your skin will peel/have a reaction. I use this retinol three times a week and it’s been incredibly gentle. I love to moisturizing ingredients and do feel as though my skin is plumper/more bright! I love the addition of retinal as it has been proven to offer quick results! It’s only been about a month for me, so I don’t want to speak prematurely. But I love this product and have seen enough to believe it works! I’m the photo I’ve included I’m wearing light makeup but you can still see some texture, but it’s improved! And I’m excited to see my results after about three months. Lovely Retinol for beginners and experts!
