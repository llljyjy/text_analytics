I was very hopeful for this product, I loved the daily greens moisturizer from pharmacy, and I wanted to try a thicker cream for the colder season. This product made my skin super dry and flaky within the second week of using and I’ve tried to stick it out and hope my skin acclimates or adjusts to this, but it just hasn’t. I am very upset because of the price point and my high expectations. Not worth the money!
