Complimentary from Farmacy. This 1% Vitamin A Retinol serum is known to firm and fight wrinkles. I have used it for nearly 2 weeks and I have noticed fine lines disappeared . The directions stated to use 2-3 times a week so i placed it on my clean dry skin. It says to increase as needed. I was able to increase it to 4 days a week and my face is renews and my fine lines around my eyes. It has a beautiful creamy texture that absorbs easily in to my skin. I noticed a very light scent. Smells clean but that goes away. Farmacy is a clean brand and every particular the packaging is recycled materials and recyclable. Highly recommended for maturing skin. Itâ€™s very important to wear your SPF over this Maturing Skin a Plus
