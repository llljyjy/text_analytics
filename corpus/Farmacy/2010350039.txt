I wanted to love this product but it just isn’t for me. It is terrible under makeup… I mean terrible. I would give it more of a chance if I used it at night but I have other products I use then. If you’re someone who doesn’t need to wear makeup then maybe this would work for you! It seems to just sit on top of the skin and not penetrate the top layer.  need to wear Not a keeper
