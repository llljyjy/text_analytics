Farmacy products never failed to impress me. After trying out their cleansing balm and night mask as a night skin care routine. This 10% Waterless Vitamin C Serum works wondeful, does not have any stickiness and very lightweight. I have sensitive skin and I have been loving this serum so much. The smell is great as well.
