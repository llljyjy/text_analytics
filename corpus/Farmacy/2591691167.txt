Okay, i truly truly love this product. It takes off my makeup (which is already an annoying task) so easily and then leaves my skin feeling super hydrated and soft, even after i use my cleanser - which is amazing since a lot of make up removing products have dried out my super sensitive skin. Love! Prob the best cleansing balm
