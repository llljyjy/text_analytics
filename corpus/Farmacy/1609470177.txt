I love using this cleansing balm as the first step in my nightly double-cleanse routine. It effectively removes all makeup and SPF from my face without stripping my skin at all. A little goes a long way too - I can get away with using just one spatula-scoop of the balm to clean my whole face. This is definitely going to be a mainstay in my skincare routine for a long time.
