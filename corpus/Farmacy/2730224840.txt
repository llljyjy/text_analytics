Pros: pleasant smell, nice texture, doesn’t pill, works well with the rest of my skincare routine, did not bother my sensitive eyes, did not cause me to break out, and a little goes a long way.Cons: it’s very sticky, even greasy at times. I’m not sure if this is because of my skin type (oily) or due to the formula. I would not repurchase for this reason alone. I could tolerate the sticky/greasy feeling if it eventually absorbed into my skin, but it does not. I’m rating it 3/5 because I can see why it gets positive reviews. In my opinion, this wouldn’t work well for someone with oily skin and pore concerns. nan
