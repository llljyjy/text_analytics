raspberries are my favorite berries and my favorite smell, so I was curious to try new Farmacy serum with raspberries. It feels nice on my face, doesn’t irritate skin, doesn’t really smell like raspberries tho, because it’s fragrance free, I wish it had some raspberry smell to it :) gifted by Farmacy Beauty Very good!
