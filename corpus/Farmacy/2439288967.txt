This mask was gifted by Farmacy Beauty for reviewing purposed and really love it. The texture is unique, gel-like and very lightweight. While it is too early to see any long-term results my skin feels smooth and nourished in the morning. It almost has a similar effect on my skin as a facial oil applied at night but without the stickiness and heaviness. The ingredients are amazing and I also love that it is fragrance free and cruelty free. amazing texture that delivers smoothness
