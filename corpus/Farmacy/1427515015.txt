Daily sunscreen is a must for me because Iâ€™m ultra fair, but I struggle to find products that work. I have very oily, acne-prone skin with major sensitivity/allergy issues. I end up looking like an oil slick, get breakouts, or have an allergic reaction with most widely available sunscreens. I tried this Farmacy sunscreen after waiting a month for my favorite boutique sunscreen to be restocked. This product is life-changing if you have skin like mine. I know a lot of people are upset about the reformulation, but I will definitely be repurchasing this sunscreen. It offers a surprising level of oil control and works beautifully as a primer. Cannot recommend strongly enough for oily folks with ingredient concerns. Perfect for oily sensitive skin
