This product was gifted by Farmacy Beauty and my search for the best vitamin C serum is over!! First of all I saw a difference within two days of use, i not only woke up with brighter skin but also the texture felt like a brand new baby soft skin. My makeup goes on better and my acne spots look less red. Hoping with continuous use my spots fade away but I’m loving my brighter skin tone. It also has a beautiful texture and a little goes a long way. The serum I was using earlier was sticky and made my skin stick to my pillow but this one absorbs quick and isn’t sticky at all. Such a great addition to my nighttime routine. Finally a Vit C serum that works
