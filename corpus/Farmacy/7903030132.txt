Wake Up Honey Eye Cream is a literal delight to use. The texture is slightly balmy which is exactly what my under eyes need these days. A little bit goes a long way and I love how it preps skin before concealer. It keeps my under eyes super hydrated without being obnoxiously heavy or greasy.It’s a little soon to determine if it’s lightening under eyes or not, but I’m happy with how it performs and preps the delicate area.I prefer to use this in the day time since I need something more occlusive in the evenings, but it’s been a great option to reach for on the daily!gifted by Farmacy Beauty Favorite Day Time Eye Cream
