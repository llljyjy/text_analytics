This vitamin c is meant to help brighten the skin, target dark spots and even tone. It’s “waterless” and has an oily texture. I do like the formulation and how it feels on my skin however I cannot get past the smell. It’s too strong for me and it lingers. I think that the L-ascorbic acid that gives that Smokey scent. If you can get past the smell, you will enjoy this product! This product was gifted to me by Farmacy Beauty nan
