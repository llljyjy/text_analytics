The wake up honey eye cream by Farmacy is a very nice eye cream. It has excellent ingredients and does help brighten the under eye area. I also liked the texture. Itâ€™s nice and creamy, very easy to spread and absorbs nicely. Overall I would recommend and will continue to use. *Gifted by Farmacy Beauty* Nice eye cream
