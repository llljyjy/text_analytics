Complimentary from Farmacy Beauty in exchange for my honest review. This has been very gentle with my skin and I haven’t experienced any discomfort whatsoever which is really important when using Retinol. I’ve been using it twice a week. My skin feels smooth and bright but this product definitely needs more time in order to show more visible results Nice!
