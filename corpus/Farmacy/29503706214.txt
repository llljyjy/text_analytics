I have dry skin and my concerns are uneven skin tone. I was excited when this product came out and it didn’t disappoint me! The texture is different than other Vit C products I’ve tried before but not in a negative way. It takes a few minutes to absorb and doesn’t leave any film on your skin. I use it in the mornings and it works well with the sunscreen I’m following up with. I haven’t notice any noticeable changes to my skin but really love the experience so far! Product is kindly gifted by Farmacy beauty. Lovely product!
