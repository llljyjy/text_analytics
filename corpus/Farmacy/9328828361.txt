I have been looking for a more hydrating moisturizer and this was recommended in store. It’s okay. The scent isn’t too strong and disappears quickly. It does hydrate but not as much as I was hoping for. My skin feels dry by the end of the day.  If you have dry skin already, probably not the product for you. Hydrates okay but not best for dry skin
