It’s almost unreal how easily this cleansing balm cuts through sunscreen and waterproof mascara (my daily wears) with ease! I love that I don’t have to scrub and pull on my eyes to get make-up off anymore, or do multiple cleanses just to get everything off of my face. I also love that it can strip waterproof make-up this well, yet never leaves my skin feeling stripped or dried out. nan
