I purchased on Sephora online recently and this is my new miracle cream. I have Combination skin with rosacea. PROS:NO IRRITATION: I can’t tolerate most moisturizers or skincare products that are supposed to be “sensitive skin friendly“ because of the rosacea. Yet this cream I can put on without any stinging or burning at all.INCREDIBLE EFFECT ON MY PORES: Whenever I don’t use an oil-free moisturizer even if non-comedogenic, my pores in the T-Zone look terrible. Yet this cream has oils but because of the 10% niacinamide, not only do I not wake up with my pores looking terrible, but they actually look much better even after just one application.HELPS A LOT WITH ROSACEA: The Niacinamide and the panthenol are definitely helping rebuild my skin barrier and I can tell by how my skin is not as “reactive“ as it used to be.CON: Expensive but I don’t use it every night and with the instant effect it has on my pores, it’s more than worth it!Small Warning: If part of your skin is very oily, I don’t recommend using it every night, but every 2-3 nightHope this can help,Alex New Miracle Cream
