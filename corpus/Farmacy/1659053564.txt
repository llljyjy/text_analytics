I will preface this review by saying that I have not tried the original formula, as I have sensitive skin and did it want to risk it, so I cannot compare the two. This balm works well for me! I have not had any skin reactions or irritation from this product. It removes all my makeup and is the first part of my cleansing routine. That being said, I don’t wear heavy makeup nor do I wear waterproof mascara, but it works well for what I do wear. I haven’t had any issues with my eyes burning/stinging when rubbing off my mascara. I have used the Tatcha Camellia oil cleanser but didn’t like the feel of the oil on my skin. I was recommended this balm by a Sephora employee. I would definitely repurchase this! nan
