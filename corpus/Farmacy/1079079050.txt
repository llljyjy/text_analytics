I was kindly gifted by Farmacy Beauty and I am so excited to finally be able to use a retinol that doesn’t irritate my skin. I love that they incorporated retinal and encapsulated retinol for an innovative blend to help treat immediately and overnight. The inclusion of antioxidant rich oils like kalahari melon and raspberry seed oil make this a very soothing, elegant formula. I’m excited to see my long-term results! Perfect formula for sensitive skin!
