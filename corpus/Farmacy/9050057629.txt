I love this retinol.  It doesn’t irritate my skin and it doesn’t leave it greasy either.  I only use it at night since I feel that is when it works best and a lot of sunscreen during the day.  I have seen improvements, my spots look clearer but I will continue using it to see how it goes over time. Gifted by Farmacy nan
