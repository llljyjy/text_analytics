I got the smaller size of this mask and very glad I did as a little goes a long way. The metal applicator it comes with helps you apply a nice, smooth, even layer so you don’t use too much and don’t have to put your fingers in the actual product which we all know adds germs!I found it to be a very gentle warming and as they say in the instructions the product goes from a yellow translucent honey like texture to a white mask. I actually fell asleep with it on as I was sitting on my bed so I probably left it on for 30 mins before I work up. No averse reaction. Washed it off to have smooth, soft skin. I did my nighttime routine of moisturizer and eye cream- went to bed and woke up to my skin still very soft and smooth, definitely feel like this really penetrated my skin and was more than just a surface treatment where the results are not long term. Glad I tried it! Will use whenever my skin is feeling dehydrated ans blah. Very good rehab mask for tired, blah skin
