Got a tester for this from a friend who couldnt use it, and fell in love with it. Bought it to use as a night cream, as I have dry , sensitive skin that wakes up feeling extra parched. I partnered it with The Ordinary rose hip oil and I wake up looking hydrated, supple, and ready for the day. 10/10 LOVE IT
