Got this moisturizer in a sample kit, overall a really nice moisturizer. It’s a little bit too heavy for my combination skin so I got a few oily breakouts after daily use. The smell doesn’t bother me at all (other reviews I read complained about it). I would recommend it for dry skin types or even as an occasional moisturizer for cold seasons when my skin is a bit dryer. Good moisturizer but heavy for combination skin
