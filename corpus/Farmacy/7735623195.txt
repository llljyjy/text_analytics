I really really wanted to like this product and give it a month before leaving a review - especially since I love almost everything else i’ve tried from Farmacy but for $50 i’m very disappointed. Like i’ve seen other reviews say - my packaging has started leaking and i was going to call sephora and exchange it but it really seems like this is just a defective product at this point and farmacy needs to do some more testing or reformulating. I’ll keep using it until it’s gone, i’ve decided to place both this and the retinoid they came out with in the fridge just in case but i won’t be repurchasing until i hear they fixed the leaking pump issue for this one. DO NOT BUY NOW - LEAKY PUMP AND DEFECTIVE PRODUCT
