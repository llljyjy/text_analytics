This was gifted by Farmacy Beauty.  “Wake Up Honey Eye Cream” brightening cream is super light, creamy, rich, smooth, extremely moisturizing and hydrating!! It feels amazing on my under eye skin! Within only a few days I’ve noticed that my dark under eye circles have just about disappeared! It also has a pleasant, lovely light fragrance to it which is extremely delightful.. Wake up Honey Eye Cream comes in a beautiful glass jar that can be used for anything once you’ve finished it!! Also, a little goes a long way!  Be sure you only use a tiny dab if applying makeup afterwards.. If using it before bed you can use a few dabs.. This is definitely my new go-to under eye cream! I absolutely love it!!!
