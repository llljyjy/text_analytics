This is my second bottle, and I bought a backup to go with it!  Have had super-oily skin for more than 40 years and I have used everything from drugstore to high-end French formulas.  Hands-down, this is the BEST!  Has enough astringency that Iâ€™m not swiping my face every hour, but it does not strip the skin either.  Amazing value at half the price point of my previous go-to toner. Life-Saver for Oily Skin
