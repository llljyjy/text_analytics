I love this moisturizer and have probably bought 5 or so in this size. It is thick, but doesnâ€™t feel heavy to me, and it moisturizes my dry skin very well. I use it year-round, but sometimes notice it works better on skin that has been prepped with a thinner moisturizer beforehand. It has a light fragrance that I personally really like, and I love that the bottles are recyclable. Must have for dry skin
