The new formula is awful and it’s so upsetting. This used to be the only moisturizer that hydrated, balanced the skin, and didn’t irritate my sensitive, acne-prone skin. I was able to use this going through retinol and it’d never sting or burn. The new formula isn’t hydrating enough, thicker, and tacky. Just horrible. Bring back the old formula, Farmacy! Reformulating was a big mistake. new formula is awful
