This is the best for dry skin. Good ingredients. It’s thick and creamy but sinks in beautifully. Works great under makeup because it has a smooth texture and slight smoothing effect on my skin. I have ridiculously dry skin, but this moisturizer works. I’m on my third value size hat, and I hope they never get rid of it! Holy grail moisturizer
