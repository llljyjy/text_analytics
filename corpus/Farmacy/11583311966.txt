I really like this balm - it comes with a good amount of product, doesn’t have a scent, and gets my eye makeup off so quickly and easily. The little spatula thing isn’t great in my opinion, i lost it almost immediately. I do feel like I need to use a cloth with it to get my face makeup off A good buy
