I received this product as a sample and after using it for a couple of days in combination with my normal routine I broke out in a few uncommon places, after ceasing use the breakouts have stopped. Iâ€™ve used other hyaluronic acid serums and had no issue, I just think this one may be a little too rich and fragranced for sensitive or acne prone skin types! Too much for sensitive skin!
