I recently received this retinol serum complimentary from Farmacy Beauty, have been using it for a few days and I have enjoyed it so far, I have normal skin for the most, and I don’t feel that has irritated my skin or made it sensitive, I’ve seen difference in the overall appearance, dullness and the texture I have on my face and I’m very excited to keep using it and see a bigger impact on my skin Overall I’m satisfied with this product and would recommend it if you’ve been curious about it My new go to retinol serum
