This is a lightweight moisturizer that worked well for my sensitive, dry skin. For the sensitive peeps out there, this is a good one. It just doesn’t give as much moisture as my stressed and parched skin needed. Works well for acne prone skin. I’m at the end of my jar, and it has become a pain in the butt to scoop out so just keep that in mind. Otherwise, definitely give it a try! Decent for acne prone skin
