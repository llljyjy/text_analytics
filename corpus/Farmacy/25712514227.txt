Purchased this after sharing my concerns with a Sephora rep about vitamin c sensitivity. I was told this is the most stable vitamin c formula and was warned that it smells like ’hot dog water’. Everything was true. This is absolutely the most stable of the vitamin c serums I’ve tried. When I apply it, I can feel a slight warming and tingly sensation but my skin hasn’t reacted to it which is good. The texture is definitely odd. It’s not oil but it kind of feels like it. I’ve been using it for a few weeks now and I don’t see a noticeable difference in my skin. The other thing I dislike about this serum is that the texture is so odd that the product does not absorb into the skin. It literally just sits on top of your skin and doesn’t do much. So given the price point, definitely not worth it. nan
