Disclaimer: I recieved this producr complimentary from Farmacy Beauty in exchange for my honest review. I haven’t used this serum for long enough to see results yet, but far it has given me a great first impression! I like how it’s quite gentle with 10% vit C, but still strong enough to be effective. I also like the texture, it’s thicker and more hydrating that your average Vitamin C serum. So far I have no complaints! Hydrating and Gentle Vit C
