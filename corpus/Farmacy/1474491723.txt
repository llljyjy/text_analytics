I ended up exchanging it for another vitamin c serum after a few weeks of trying with this one. They make a point of mentioning that’s it’s waterless but I’m not sure why. The alternative they have come up with is something that feels extremely greasy and oily. Such an unpleasant texture and I wondered if this was the product responsible for some clogged pores I’ve been dealing with. Glad I moved on from it finally. nan
