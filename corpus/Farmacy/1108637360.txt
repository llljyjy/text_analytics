Hey Beauties!! #FarmacyBeautyGiftedMe their 10% Waterless Vitamin C Serum! A 10% Vitamin C serum that visibly brightens, targets dark spots and reduces hyperpigmentation. A first-of-its-kind, this waterless L-Ascorbic Acid formula is gentle on skin and delivers maximum stability and potency. 1% Alpha-arbutin and Ferulic acid even skin tone and reduce hyperpigmentation, while upcycled tangerine peel hydrates and boosts moisture without irritation. This product feels so light and gentle on your skin. It applies beautifully and is easily-absorbed, plus it’s oil-free and fragrance-free. I had no tacky or greasy residue left behind, just happy brightened skin. I can already see some reduction of some of my dark spots. I love the fact that @FarmacyBeauty doesn’t use parabens, sulfates, SLS and SLES, phthalates, mineral oils, formaldehyde, and other bad ingredients in their products! Plus they’re Leaping Bunny Certified Cruelty-Free!  Products Shown:@FarmacyBeauty~ 10% Waterless Vitamin C Serum nan
