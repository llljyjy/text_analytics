I’ve been looking everywhere for a vitamin c serum that’s strong enough for my acne prone skin but won’t irritate my sensitive skin and I’m so excited to say that I’ve found it!! This serum sinks right into my skin, doesn’t irritate or dry me out and has helped brighten and tone my skin! Gentle enough for sensitive, dry skin!!
