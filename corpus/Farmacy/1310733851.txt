I was so excited to finally try this product, and while it does the job and doesn’t strip the skin afterwards/make it feel tight, I had an allergic reaction. I tried it a few times to make sure it was this product and not another one I was using, but it gave me dry patches on my eyes. I love how sanitary they keep it with the spatula and the holder for it though. The smell is amazing and my skin did look brighter after using. Just be careful when using. I wouldn’t say my skin is particularly sensitive or that I have sensitive eyes, but the product just didn’t agree with my eye skin. The rest of the face I was ok, but it definitely affected my eye skin. I didn’t want to give the product 1 star because I would’ve loved it if I didn’t react, but for this price tag I was really hoping it would work out. On to try something else! Really wanted to love it, but I got an allergic rx
