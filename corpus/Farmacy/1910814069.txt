The texture of this vitamin c is a mix between a watery and gel texture. It’s clear and lightweight, and is a little tacky on the skin but dries quickly. There is that infamous hot dog water smell, but it’s not as bad as some other vitamin c’s I’ve tried and it doesn’t bother me! I wish the packaging was glass, but that’s just personal preference, but I’m happy it’s cheaper than other ones on the market. Overall I think it’s a great formula and I like that it’s unscented! This was gifted by Farmacy Beauty. Nice formula!
