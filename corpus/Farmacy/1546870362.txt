This vitamin c serum is incased in a lightweight oil and is very potent! You can actually feel the difference in this formula from typical vitamins serums because it actually feels a bit warm when you apply it; however, it isn’t irritating to the skin. It’s formula is very nourishing and hydrating due to the oils the vitamin c is suspended in. You can use it day or night but I prefer to use it in the evenings. It makes my skin feel so hydrated and in the mornings, my skin is glowing! Over time, I’ve noticed a huge improvement in my dark spots, pigmentation, and the overall brightness of my skin! It works well with my other skincare products and it’s great for preventing signs of aging! My ski. Looks healthier and more youthful since I started using this serum. I can’t recommend it enough!
