I am 54 and started using this at night about 10 days ago.my skin is so dry in the winter but I noticed today how soft and supple my skin feels. not greasy and absorbs well. I use it before bed. I canâ€™t say it removed any wrinkles yet, and it may not, but definitely improved the look and feel of my skin during a very drying time of year for me in ohio winters. I think this is reasonably priced and appears to require minimal product so will last for at least 3 months for me. this is amazing
