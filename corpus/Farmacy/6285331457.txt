Super rich and luxe feeling, with a lovely subtle smell. I generally have dry skin and with a new baby and not a ton of sleep, Iâ€™m chasing a glow to make me look less tired and dull, which this delivers. Will definitely repurchase.- a little goes a long way- medium absorption over serums- feels beautiful on the skin Beautiful Moisturizer
