This vitamin c serum is so lightweight but packs a punch in effectiveness! I noticed that it significantly helped my hyper pigmentation and made my skin look so much brighter. I used to be so insecure about not wearing a foundation everyday because of my uneven skin tone but without all my hyperpigmentation and blotchiness I love my skin. Iâ€™m going to make this a staple in my everyday routine because it is a miracle in a bottle! I use it daily once in the morning with spf and once at night with my favorite moisturizer and aquaphor to lock it all in. nan
