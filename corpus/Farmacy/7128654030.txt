I am really happy with this mask so far. I have been using it for a few weeks now and I love it! The texture is heavenly. It feels soothing, so moisturizing/hydrating and my post acne marks have been fading quicker. The texture of my skin has  also improved. Iâ€™m glad I got to try this as I had been looking for a good winter time mask that will leave me plump in the morning. Great product and definitely worth trying! Love this product!
