Got this free jar from a beauty package. This winter has been harsh on my combination skin with extremely worsen dry cheeks. So i decided to try it. I started only wearing it at night but then i loved the feel so much I’m wearing it in the daytime also. It sinks into the skin so it doesn’t feel greasy. A light hint of honey fragrance. I literally got compliments about my face glowing even with my mask on at work. The moisture definitely has helped with my dryness. i would buy another jar after this one is done. glowing skin
