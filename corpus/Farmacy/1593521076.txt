I bought this on a whim. I forget about this brand but since I was purchasing the oil I picked this up too. It’s been only one week but I can see a difference on my skin. I have combo skin. Dryer on the side of my face and oily on the tzone. My skin looks plump, the next morning it has this healthy glow. It says on here that it’s meant for dry skin but my skin is loving it. I’m repurchasing again.
