First of all , I love Farmacy products in general so I was super excited to try this new Retinol serum! Retinol is a must in my routine and I’m absolutely in love with this one! Not only is it not irritating at all , after a few weeks of use I’m already seeing improvements with my skins elasticity , brightness and some recent post breakout marks have faded! I love the texture of this and would definitely recommend it! Gifted by Farmacy Beauty. Opinions my own! LOVE IT!
