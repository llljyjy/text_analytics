I like that this isn’t fragranced. It going on feeling like a dry oil but after a massaging it into the skin it doesn’t feel oily at all. It did instantly make my skin look glowy and dewy. I did have one acne spot and it did sting a little bit going over it with this product. Other people mentioned that this has a smell but I really can’t smell anything unpleasant. I like the packaging and the fact that it’s dark because it helps to stabilize the vitamin c which shouldn’t be stored in the light. A good find
