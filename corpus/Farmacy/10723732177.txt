I’m really enjoying this eye cream from Farmacy. It has a very light texture and it blends in easily without rubbing the skin. It’s very moisturizing & has no tack to it. It melts into the skin and is seamless under makeup. A little goes a long way so this cute little jar will last a long while! Great lightweight eye cream
