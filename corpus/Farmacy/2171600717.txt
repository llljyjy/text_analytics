I have always loved the idea of using retinol but have previously found that it can be very irritating/harsh for my skin. I have found that I see the benefits of using a retinol serum minus the irritation and redness! I still apply overnight as irritation is exacerbated by sun exposure, but I canâ€™t wait to keep using this product!! *Product complimentary from Farmacy Beauty LOVE!
