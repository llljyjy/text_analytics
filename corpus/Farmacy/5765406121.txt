Finally, a stable vitamin c that doesn’t smell awful! I have such a hard time finding a vitamin c that doesn’t break me out, and also smells good. This has pretty decent slip upon application, but dries a bit sticky. I always use moisturizer after, so it mitigates the tackiness. I like this one more that Farmacy’s last vitamin c. (Complimentary from Farmacy). A definite improvement over their last vit C!
