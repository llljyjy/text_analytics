*gifted by Farmacy Beauty for my honest review* This gentle eye cream feels very lightweight on and absorbs instantly to give intense hydration (while slowly brightening, de-puffing and combatting fine lines around the entire eye area over time)! It’s safe to use around the entire eye area (including eyelids) which is a major plus in my book cause I’ve tried many eye creams before that can only be used on the undereye area or else they end up stinging if I put it all over my eyes!! The ‘Wake Up Honey Eye Cream’ is also a “Clean at Sephora” product which means it’s got cleaner, safer ingredients that isn’t harsh! I’m in love with Farmacy products!! So gentle yet effective!!
