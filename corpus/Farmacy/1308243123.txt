I was interested in trying this after venturing into cleansing balms with Inkey. Theirs isn’t bad but didn’t quite do it for me, very thick and the bottle opened on the crimped side. When I picked up an order from Sephora this was inside, it was something I’ve already been eyeing so I was super excited to try it. Omg I love how it feels when I’m using it, so smooth and soothing and it smells like limes. I absolutely love it and, unlike Inkey, it takes off everything! Highly recommend. Its More than a Balm, it’s an Experience
