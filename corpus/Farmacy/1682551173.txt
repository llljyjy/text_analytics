This is such a wonderful introductory set to try out Farmacy’s awesome line of products that I received complimentary from Farmacy Beauty in exchange for my honest review! I have used Farmacy’s Green Clean (and Clearly Clean) in the past and it’s become a MUST have for makeup removal. It is really amazing! The Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Cleaning Toner didn’t irritate my sensitive skin whatsoever and felt great! The Honeymoon Glow AHA Resurfacing Night serum left my skin feeling so soft and smooth the next day. And to top it all off, the Honey Halo Moisturizer not only smells amazing (really like honey!) but it feels so calming after using actives. This is such a perfect set to gift or to buy and try some different products! nan
