So when I heard “niacinimide mask” I first thought this would be a rinse off treatment but I was so happy to find it’s similar to like a sleeping mask - you apply like a moisturizer and leave on. First off, the texture is super comfortable on the skin, doesn’t feel heavy or sticky and dries down quiet nice. Farmacy always kills it with formula, I absolutely love the honey glow and BHA toner from them as well! Another Farmacy Love!
