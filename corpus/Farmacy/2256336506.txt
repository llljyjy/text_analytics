I got the mini version as I only really wanted to test it so I could see if it made my skin any smoother and completely removed everything.  The product does get everything off and you don’t need to use too much.  I do have to keep my eyes shut hard so it doesn’t go in them and leave this weird film that makes me feel like I can’t see for a while though.Compared to drunk elephants cleansing balm I’d say this one is good but doesn’t leave my skin as soft as I’d like, I always follow up with my regular cleanser afterwards. good product but be careful around your eyes
