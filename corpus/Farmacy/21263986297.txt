I got this in a subscription, it smells amazing and is so creamy and easy to apply. My skin felt so soft but then about 15 minutes later my chin and a couple other areas broke out!!! I’m so disappointed. This mask is worth so much money… I can’t imagine if I had paid full price for this. I won’t use it again. Broke me out almost instantly :(
