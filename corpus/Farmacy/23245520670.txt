I absolutely love this product and the results that I get when I use it. The consistency is thick, plush, and creamy which is something I love in a moisturizer because I struggle with dry skin and the scent is pleasant if you like honey. When I use this moisturizer, I genuinely never have to worry about waking up with dry skin or needed to apply anything throughout the day which I appreciate considering the cost. The ONLY reason I do not give this 5 stars is because of the packaging. Although I love the container it comes in because it’s cute/aesthetic and not cheap plastic it is so difficult to store/travel with. The lid features a magnet that holds the included spatula and I love that so much I just wish this was packaged differently; maybe in more of a cylindrical container with a dispenser nozzle at the top? If the packaging were changed it’d be perfect for the cost Favorite Moisturizer but Difficult to Travel With
