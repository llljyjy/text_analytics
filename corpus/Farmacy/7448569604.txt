I received this as a sample from my Sephora Rewards and was a tad hesitant since Iâ€™ve been using Garnier Micellar Water for a whileeee and like how easy it is. But holy moly, this stuff is AMAZING. A little goes a long way, this removes my mascara + concealer so easily and leaves my skin soft and ready to hydrate. I would recommend a x1000000 times over. YAS GIRL
