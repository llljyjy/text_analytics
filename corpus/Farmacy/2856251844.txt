I love this toner. Clears of nose blackheads & sebum almost overnight. I’ve tried Tarte’s 10% salicylic acid toner in my nose and it works really well too but it so strong I end up getting cuts at the tip of my nose or peeling so it’s just too strong for my skin. This 2% solution doesn’t give me those problems yet still clears up blackheads. nan
