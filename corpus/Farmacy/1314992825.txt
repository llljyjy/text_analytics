I was so excited to try the new gifted by Farmacy Beauty 1% Vitamin A Retinol Serum and was not disappointed! I first off love this retinol because it has a stronger formula of 1% Vitamin A so it’s heavy duty and strong. This serum targets fine lines and wrinkles plus improving skin texture too all while being gentle and nourishing. I find this retinol to be gentle it doesn’t feel harsh on my skin and it does feel like it nourishes my skin which is important when using stronger retinols. I’ve been apply at night every 2 days because it is strong although nourishing I feel best to skip a day but it says to use 1-3 times a week at first to see if your skin can tolerate and so far my skin has tolerated. I feel this retinol will help diminish my fine lines and even out my texture with continued use. I just have to say it has a really good fast absorbing formula too. I definitely recommend Strong yet gentle retinol
