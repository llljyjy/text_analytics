I really like this retinol serum. It feels very lightweight and hydrating. It didnâ€™t irritate my skin or caused dryness. But I use very hydrating barrier restoring moisturizer with cerimides twice a day and good hydrating mask once a week. I use this serum 2-3 times a week and I noticed how much firmer and more youthful my skin looks. It works great! This serum also have hydrating ingredients such as ceramides, Upcycled Kalahari Melon and raspberry seed oil. It willlast for a very long time using only 1-3 times a week.
