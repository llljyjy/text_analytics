I never write reviews-I know; it’s a cliché statement! but it’s my truth as a Sephora Rouge. This Serum is it! The first time I used it I saw a big difference. My skin is dry and prone to hyperpigmentation if  I use anything insensitive. Because this is a Retinol, there’s an automatic scare that it would be harsh, but not with this. I highly recommend- Game charger. Game changer!
