This product was gifted by Farmacy Beauty for my honest review. I love Farmacy products and was so excited to hear about the launch of their new vitamin c serum. My skin is extremely picky with vit c, so I’m always cautious when testing new ones. So far I’ve been enjoying it! It doesn’t leave my skin sticky or feeling incredibly sensitive like many do. This sinks into the skin without any residue or pilling when I apply my moisturizer. I’ve yet to see any improvement in my dark spots but it’s only been two weeks. Overall leaves my skin supple and glowy! Glowy Skin Ahead!
