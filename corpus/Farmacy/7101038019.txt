I first tried this as a sample and was amazed that it got rid of the redness that I always have and didnâ€™t even think it was something I could get rid of. I bought the full size and have been using it ever since. This balm is good at removing makeup but also good for skin! Sometimes I massage it in a few extra minutes just to get all the skin-loving benefits. Helps with redness!
