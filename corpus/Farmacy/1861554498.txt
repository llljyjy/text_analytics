I love using this as a night cream or during the day when my face is extremely dry.I was deciding between this or the Tatcha dewy skin cream. The Tatcha one also comes in a cute container, it smells nice, and it feels silly smooth when you first apply. However by the end of the day my skin felt sticky and oily. It did not sit well or absorb at all!The Farmacy honey halo moisturizer also comes in a cute container, I love how the lid is magnetic so holds on to the metal scoop, it smells nice like honey, but it actually absorbs into my skin!I found the Farmacy moisturizer much better! Farmacy over Tatcha in my opinion
