Farmacy has good products so I was excited to try this when it came in my Boxycharm this month. Unfortunately I really couldn’t get past the scent. It’s awful. I understand it’s likely the natural smell of the honey but I wish it could somehow be offset or lessened. None of their other products that I’ve used have had a scent and this one is just a doozy. I’m sure it works nicely but I look forward to doing my skincare routine and bad smelling products just detract from that. For anyone who has a weakened sense of smell, maybe it could work wonders. Can’t get past the smell…
