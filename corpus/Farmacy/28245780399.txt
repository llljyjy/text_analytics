This was an interesting vitamin c to try given that is used L-ascorbic acid without water in the formula. I’m an oily skin type, but I did not find the serum to be overly greasy to use. It layered just fine with my routine and didn’t pill with my moisturizer or sunscreen, which was great! I think 10% l-ascorbic is a great percentage, wasn’t irritated. This was gifted by Farmacy Beauty for review. Surprisingly simple and pleasant vitC serum
