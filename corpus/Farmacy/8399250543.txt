So I never really leave reviews (unless it’s bad ones) so I figured I’d finally write a good one. I have always had pretty good skin, a breakout here and there up until august of this month when I started to break out pretty bad. I have used honey halo in the past and ran out and just never repurchased, it obviously wasn’t ground breaking at the time for me as I had great skin. Since breaking out terribly this past month and using moisturizers from every brand known to man (and it either making my skin greasy looking or just clogging my pores. I decided to repurchase honey halo on a whim and BOY I do not regret it. I have been using it for 3 days and my skin not only feels and stays moisturized it has even made my skin look better and has improved my texture in this short amount of time. This stuff is a holy grail and It looks me trying so many different brands to realize it. Do not hesitate, buy it!! Also the smell is amazing Run DONT walk!!
