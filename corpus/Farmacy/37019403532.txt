I’ve only had a few encounters with retinol but I genuinely love this product! The packaging is simple, beautiful, and doesn’t take away the shine of the actual product. The product itself works great and makes my skin look amazing!!! It really helps my skin texture and fine lines. It’s rare I will indulge in skin-care products but THIS IS WORTH EVERY PENNY! Thanks to being gifted by Farmacy Beauty, I’m able to experience such an awesome product. Worth the money!
