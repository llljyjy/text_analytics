My skin is so dry in the winter time and this leave-on night mask is just what I needed. The product itself is kind of thick but it goes on smoothly. I love how my face looks and feels in the morning. Packaging is nice and product amount is good for the price. I received this product complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. Love it
