This has been my go to first cleanse for a long time. I like the way it emulsifies with water and doesn’t leave my skin completely stripped. It fully removes makeup and sunscreen, but can cause blurry eyes. I don’t use it on my eye area. I have sensitive, dry, rosacea skin and it normally doesn’t irritate my skin. However, there have been times where it’s a little aggressive for my super sensitive skin. I sometimes have to be aware if my skin is sensitized. nan
