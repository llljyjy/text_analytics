this is the first hyaluronic acid serum that didn’t dry my skin out. I find it to be light and hydrating and subtly plumps my skin. I apply it on damp skin after toner, and it plays well with my other serum, moisturizer, and sunscreen. it doesn’t pill with my other products. I also actually really like the scent. it’s a raw honey fragrance that I find to be lovely. it’s a bit pricey but worth it to me, especially when the farmacy website has a sale. best hyaluronic acid
