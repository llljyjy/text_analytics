I received this complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. I have been LOVING this eye cream! I’m a big fan of the Honey Halo moisturizer, and this is very similar in style and texture. It’s a bit thinner, but super hydrating. I love how smoothly it applies and how well it keeps my under eyes moisturized. I have very dry skin, so this works really well for me. But I don’t find it to be too heavy either.  Overall, I think this is a really great eye cream and I will continue using it! Great Eye Cream!
