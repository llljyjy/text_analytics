My skin tends to look very dull, so I use a vitamin c serum daily to keep my glow. Some vitamin c serums irritate my skin with daily use, but I have been loving this one from Farmacy! My skin has been looking fantastic. The new formula is extremely potent but it doesnâ€™t irritate my skin. I think I found my new holy grail vitamin c serum! Farmacy gifted me this serum, all opinions are my own. Glowing skin without irritation
