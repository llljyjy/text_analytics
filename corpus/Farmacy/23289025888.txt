I am new to retinol but love this brand. Excited to receive this complimentary from Farmacy Beauty! I have sensitive skin and have been using this 1% retinol serum for almost 2 weeks now in my nighttime routine. And so far so I really like it! Absorbs nicely and is very gentle. It seems to be helping with my skin texture. And I like using it so I definitely plan on continuing to use it and see what the results can be with long term use! nan
