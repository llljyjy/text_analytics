Ugh… I reeeeally love Farmacy but this balm isn’t it. I wear a primer, light foundation (Dior Backstage) and either Pat McGrath or Stilla waterproof eyeliner, ilia waterproof mascara, and that’s it. The balm moves my makeup around on my face a bit but doesn’t do much for taking it off. If you like to double cleanse, this might be for you?? Idk. It leaves a film on my face and eyelashes and it makes my eyes feel oily. To me, it doesn’t deliver what it promises. nan
