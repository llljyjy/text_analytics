This serum is lightweight and absorbs easily. I have been using this 2 night on and 2 off and so far no irritation or bumps on my sensitive skin. My skin feels smooth and overall breakouts are under control. The serum feels gentle and hasnâ€™t caused dryness. I am an experienced Retinol user and find this to be a nice solid gentle option if your looking to start using Retinol. Gifted by Farmacy. Nice Retinol even for sensitive skin!
