Apparently there has been a formula change- I was wondering what happened. This is NOT the sunscreen I fell in love with. It used to be so moisturizing and made my skin nice and dewy. Now it dries down quickly and makes my skin look so dry- and it looks horrible under makeup. Donâ€™t recommend this if you have normal/dry skin. It may work better for oily skin. New formula is horrible
