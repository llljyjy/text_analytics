I love this night mask! I put this on every other night after my toner and serum. The consistency is a thick gel/balm and a little goes a long way. The morning after using this mask my face feels so soft,  moisturized and plump. I also noticed that my skin looks brighter and acne scars have faded a little. Great addition to my nighttime skincare routine. Lovely leave-on night mask
