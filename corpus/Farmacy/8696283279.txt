This product has an easy to use application and absorbs into the skin quickly. I only use it at night and I’ve noticed my skin has more glow and even tones in just a week. It doesn’t have a fragrance but it has a slight odor and can leave the skin a little sticky / greasy until you’ve used it more frequently. This was gifted by Farmacy Beauty. nan
