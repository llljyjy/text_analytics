This stuff is so good. I’ve never been able to use a cleansing balm or micellar water without my face breaking out. I had to use wipes but knowing how bad they are for your skin and the environment really made me want to try again to find something better. I grabbed the mini on a whim and this stuff is so good. It melts away my makeup and is so easy to wash off.  Always double cleanse so I don’t break out but this stuff is amazing! so good
