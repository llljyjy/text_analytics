I just love this product! I was alittle skeptical but I  love the velvety texture of this gel mask. It’s moisturizing, not heavy, and even though it’s a gel mask it’s not very sticky like you’d imagine. It does linger on your skin a bit but it’s for it’s lasting overnight effect and leaves your skin moisturized and dewy in the morning. I absolutely LOVE this product. Luxury
