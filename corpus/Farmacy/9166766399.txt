Love this hydrating night mask that leaves my skin looking refreshed and plump. I am a year away from 40 and have been steadily upping my skincare routine and this has been a great find. I have used drug store brands before and while there are a lot of those that do the job, this is one that was worth the splurge. Treat Yoâ€™self
