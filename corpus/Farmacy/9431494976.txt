I just didn’t want to like this because the whole rubbing with a little balm seemed weird to me and I like my cleanser but WOW. My skin is squeaky clean and it takes even stubborn mascara off. Smells great, doesn’t burn my eyes, all around great product. I’m a definite convert. Didn't wanna like it but I love it
