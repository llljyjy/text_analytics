The Farmacy Wake Up Honey Eye Cream comes in a really cute jar. The cream is lightweight and applies easily. The formula is not greasy nor does it feel heavy under the eyes. There is no noticeable scent which is nice because it doesnâ€™t clash with my other skin care products. My undereyes felt hydrated and were not as tired looking. Overall a very good eye cream. nan
