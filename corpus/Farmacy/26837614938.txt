I love this cleansing balm! I have sensitive skin so I asked a Sephora employee for something that wouldnâ€™t irritate my skin, but could remove all makeup effectively, and she pointed me to this. Bless her!! The smell is minty and feels a bit cooling on the skin, but my eyes and skin do not feel dry, stripped, or irritated after washing this off. nan
