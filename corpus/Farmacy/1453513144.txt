This was my first experience with a balm and I didn’t know what to expect, I knew I didn’t like the results. After reading the reviews I realize it’s because this doesn’t emulsify, rinse well, and I had to go behind and wash my face good because the residue is greasy. I have heard good reviews of the Farmacy balm which led me to purchase although I am also realizing I didn’t buy the original/right product . May try that next time but will not repurchase this. 1st Balm Experience
