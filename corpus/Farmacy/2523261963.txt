This item was gifted by Farmacy Beauty. I appreciate that the waterless formula means more stability and potency, but the texture feels very oily/greasy and itâ€™s just not for me. Also, because there is no added fragrance, the product itself has a particular scent that smells really bad and lingers for a long time. Really wanted to love this new launch but sadly was not impressed nan
