I’ve been enjoying this serum, I always believe prevention is better than cure even with skincare & aging, and I like a noninvasive organic way of ensuring that I’m handling all my little wrinkles & creases on my face in a safe organic cruelty free way. My skin does tend to be sensitive to certain things, however with this serum I didn’t breakout or have any excessive redness, I did feel a little tingle which is expected for me with retinol especially in places where I had picked or scabbed myself but other than that I’ve noticed a good improvement in my skin, the texture and the firmness as well as the overall evening of my skin tone because I do have hyperpigmentation. I’d definitely recommend. Complimentary from Farmacy Beauty Visible Difference-Must Have!!
