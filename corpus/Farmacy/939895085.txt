I am a lip balm fanatic and have many tubes in different places like my makeup cart, purse, nightstand, etc. I usually use Clarins right before bedtime but this feels very clean and doesnâ€™t have any weird taste that some natural balms have. I know I really like it compared to the other brands bc this one ran out first. Outstanding
