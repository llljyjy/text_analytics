I received the 10% Waterless Vitamin C Serum complimentary from Farmacy Beauty in exchange for my honest review. I found the serum very easy to use. It wasn’t sticky, blended into the skin well and didn’t cause any irritation. I was thrilled it wasn’t scented. With continued use I hope the L-ascorbic acid will lighten my dark spots and brighten my skin. So far my skin looks more clear. nan
