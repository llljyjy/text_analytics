I love the Green Clean Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm and wanted to try some more products from the Farmacy brand. So far, my favorite from this set (other than the cleansing balm) is the Honey Halo Ultra-Hydrating Ceramide Moisturizer. The texture of the moisturizer feels luxurious and leaves my skin feeling pampered. I find the resurfacing products a bit too much for my sensitive skin. This product was complimentary from Farmacy Beauty in exchange for my honest review. nan
