The moisturizer is complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. The scent was light and pleasant. The cream was absorbed quickly and easily into my skin which tends to be dry. Call me silly but I love a jar of cream that comes with a tiny spatula, it just makes me feel like the product will stay germ-free longer than if I were sticking my germy fingers in it all the time. Itâ€™s hydrating my skin for all day long, calming the redness on my face with soft textured cream, i love this product. New favorite moisturizer
