It took me a little while to warm up to the oil-based consistency of this Vitamin C, but after a few uses the results are undeniable. I for once wish I took before and after pictures because I can tell a huge difference in the tone and clarity of my skin. This product does take a minute to fully soak in and I only like to use it at night because of how thick it is, but I’m super impressed with the results I’ve seen only using it once a day for a little over two weeks!! So happy this was gifted by farmacy beauty! nan
