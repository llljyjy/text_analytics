I absolutely have loved any Farmacy products I’ve tried. And this is no exception! Thick, creamy and luxurious moisturizer. Doesn’t have a strong smell and left my skin soft and moisturized without that greasy feel. I think this would be a perfect moisturizer for winter months to keep the skin hydrated.This was gifted by Farmacy beauty and I love it! Not to mention the luxe packaging So moisturizing!
