I love Farmacy products and this was no exception! This undereye cream feels so smooth and light compared to others I’ve tried. No greasiness or heaviness at all for me. It doesn’t really have a scent - just smooth and moisturizing right away. I’ve been using it as a day cream since I prefer a heavier cream at night, and the vitamin C is nice for AM. It’s worked well with my undereye concealers and I do think that it’s reduced some of the darkness in that area (though some of it is hereditary for me). It’s one of my favorite undereye creams I’ve tried. Gifted by Farmacy Beauty Amazing texture
