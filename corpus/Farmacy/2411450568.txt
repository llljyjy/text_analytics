This serum is on the thicker side and has an oil like consistency, but soaks into the skin nicely without any peeling. I’m pretty sensitive to scents, so even though I’m not in love with the smell, it’s not offensive to me. I used this morning and evening and experienced some slight irritation and redness after application the first several days. I have pretty sensitive skin too so this would normally be a serum I would ease myself into. My skin is looking a little brighter and it definitely feels a little smoother when I wake up in the morning. I was gifted this product by Farmacy for my review. Noticeable improvement to complexion
