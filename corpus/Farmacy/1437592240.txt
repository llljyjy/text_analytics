This product was gifted to me in exchange for my honest review. I am a little cautious with eye creams in general because many eye creams I’ve tried in the past irritate my eyes. I often wake up with puffy, swollen eyes from eye cream irritation. This one has NOT irritated my eyes at all! The texture is so lovely. Thick, but not too thick. It’s very glowy, so I notice a brightness to my under eyes after application. It also helps reduce morning puffiness. I have very dark circles under my eyes (genetic) and it doesn’t really help with those. But it is a great under eye prep for concealer. I don’t like using it on my eyelids before makeup, however. I find that it makes my eyeshadow crease so I only use it under my eyes in the morning. The packaging is super cute too. Great eye cream!
