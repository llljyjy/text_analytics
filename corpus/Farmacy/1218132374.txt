I went to Sephora to get a sample of this before committing to buying the full size. Yes, this has a very light, silky, and oily texture- which is quite nice for those with dry skin concerns. I thought my face looked a little brighter after a couple usesâ€¦ What really shook me was how this had such a strong odor- like hot dog water! This was such a bummer because I think this is a very innovative product. The smell is just too much for me and it take several minutes for it to go away. If you are sensitive to smells, I suggest getting a sample before hand to see for yourself. I will not be buying this product. Smells Like Hot Dog Water :(
