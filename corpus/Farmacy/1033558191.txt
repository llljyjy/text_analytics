I received this product complimentary from Faramcy before its launch. Since I’m a huge fan of the Very Cherry Bright serum (and Honeymoon Glow for that matter), I was excited about the waterless formula coming out. Sadly, this one is a miss for me. My combination skin does great with Vitamin C under sunscreen during the day (I go in with retinoids in the PM) but the oily and slippery texture of this serum makes it impossible to use in the AM. It’s heavy. It feels heavy. It does have that Ferulic Acid smell (I’m totally fine with that). It’s technically oil-free but with Propanediol leading the ingredient deck, it feels as like a dry oil or a makeup primer. If you want to try a waterless Vitamin C serum, the PCA Skin formulas are superb. Sadly, a miss for me...
