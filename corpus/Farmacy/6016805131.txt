I accidentally bought this product thinking it was the amazing Green Clean balm. I noticed right away that the product is white (as opposed to green) and crumbles much more easily when you scoop out product than Green Clean. None of these were dealbreakers for me until I actually tried the product for its intended purpose. While it does remove stubborn makeup (including waterproof eyeliner, eyeshadow primer, and lash glue), it took two tries to get it all off as opposed to one when I used Green Clean. Additionally, it did not emulsify nearly as well as the Green Clean. I felt like it was moving makeup around on my face than actually lifting it off effectively. I’ve had to use the balm, rinse with water, pat my face dry, use the balm again, rinse with water again, and then follow up with a water-based cleanser to get the balm/makeup gunk off my face. This resulted in a longer and more tedious makeup removal process. After I finish this I won’t repurchase and will probably go back to the Green Clean balm. Inferior product compared to Green Clean
