I bought this because I was in need of a moisturizer that would get me through the really drying months of the winter. And after all my spending for Christmas, I needed to pull back on my Estee Lauder moisturizer ($$$$) spending. Mistake #1. If it works, I should have sucked it up and spent the money. The thing with the Estee Lauder Renutriv is that it is a really luxurious cream that goes on heavy, but it deeply moisturizers for the winter months. It’s not to take away from the benefits of this Farmacy moisturizer though. I like the creaminess of it and could see using it in the Summer maybe. It goes on my skin nicely, but it just doesn’t hydrate enough in the winter to keep my skin moisturized enough. Within an hour, I could tell my skin was like DRRRRRYYYY again. One thing I did like about this is that the lid is magnetic or something so that the spoon thing that comes with it actually stays with it. That’s innovation. I don’t have to go digging through my drawers to find the spoon to get the moisturizer out every day. It just stays attached to the lid. Not enough moisturizer for the tough winter months
