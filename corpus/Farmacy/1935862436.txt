Farmacy Beauty gifted me this product in exchange for a review. The texture of this serum was interesting. The texture felt very moisturizing to the touch. It applied thick on my face and I really didnâ€™t love how it made my face feel. My skin felt a bit overwhelmed by the product. I have very dry skin so thought it might be a nice moisturizer but it made my skin feel heavy. I typically love products from Farmacy Beauty but this one is a no for me. nan
