Brought life back into my skin! Pores & clogged up bumps are near to gone.. though I do get my lashes lifted so trying to clean mascara off with the balm isn’t ideal for me because it does get in my eyes lol so i go in with a liquid cleanser i’ve had for a little afterwards to get everything & end with a moisturizer at night & i’ve never woken up with more perfect skin.
