I think this is a fine product, for someone that needs retinol. Most new to retinol start off with a much lower percentage. 1% is a lot. I have extremely sensitive skin, and this dried my skin out completely. I know about the “retinization,” but was eager to try to get rid of some wrinkles. I am completely dried out that lotion can barely help me now. It hurts. Again, I think this comes with knowing your skin, and this is probably not the best product for sensitive skin. There is no smell and it’s a good consistency, just not for me. I was gifted by Farmacy beauty. Not for sensitive skin
