Gifted by Farmacy. Used this three days in a row with no negative side-effects! For my oily skin, I can use this on its own without moisturizer at night and my skin still feels balanced in the morning. Thereâ€™s a bit of a scent (not sure what it is), but dissipates quickly. Too early to tell if it helps with fine lines, but my skin does look fresh and bright in the morning after using this! Gentle retinol!
