I love the green clean cleanser and I bought this in store on accident.  I thought I’d give it a go!  Personally, it isn’t as good.  I feel like my makeup doesn’t come off as well.  I usually don’t double cleanse but you need to with this product.  I’ve worked really hard to get my skin clear and in only a couple weeks this product has broken me out like crazy! I’m wondering if I can still return it… nan
