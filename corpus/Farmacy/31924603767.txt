This is a great vitamin c option I was gifted by Farmacy beauty in exchange for my honest review. It’s to early to tell on long term results but I will say this has a very lightweight, thinner consistency that absorbs quickly into the skin. It plays well with my other skincare products and did leave my skin looking glowy and hydrated. I didn’t experience any irritation and think this is a great addition to their line. Definitely recommend if you’re in the market for a new vitamin c serum. nan
