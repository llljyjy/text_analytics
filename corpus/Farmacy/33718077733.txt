I really love Farmacy products, so I have high expectations for their products. This retinol serum is so far is really nice to use. I love their new recyclable packaging with the pump, easy to dispense. The serum did not have a fragrance, was smooth as it glided to the skin and sunk it nicely. I have been using it for a few days with no adverse effects with use on my skin, and I do think it seems to be firming and plumping that soon to reduce fine lines. I’ll keep using it to see long term results, but just with the fire uses I’m excited for the continued use! Loving this retinol serum!
