Wow! I’m so impressed by this one. I have good experiences with Vitamin C typically so I know that this ingredient works wonders for my skin, but this formulation is so potent that I am seeing results so much more quickly than usual. My hyperpigmentation along my jawline is almost completely gone now. Plus, it’s gentle enough for me to use with other actives in my routine—no irritation (although I am used to using quite a few actives generally so I’m not sure if that’s why). I feel like whenever I put this on my skin immediately looks more glowy and plump. This might be my favorite Vitamin C formulation out there! I’m stocking up.Gifted by Farmacy Beauty. nan
