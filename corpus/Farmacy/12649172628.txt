It is an alright balm. I’ve been using it for a week after trying the original version at the store for the first time, and then going with the fragrance-free option due to sensitive skin. I like the size bc it will go a long way for me for a cheaper price, good for trying out. It includes a helpful spatula. I’ve experienced no adverse effects so far. It takes the makeup and mascara off pretty well, thought I do need to wash the eyes out especially after. There is residue left on the skin after using. At first I hated it, but saw that after patting my face dry I don’t feel it anymore. Thought perhaps it’s be hydrating, but saw no effects, positive or negative; I still have to moisturize after. I use it to get make-up off after work and go bare-faced at home for the rest of the evening, then use a different cleanser to get everything off and feel fresh before bed. I’ll finish this batch but likely not reorder again and try the original or something else fragrance-free. Works great for makeup but hard to wash off
