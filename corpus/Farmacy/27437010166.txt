I was gifted by Farmacy beauty there honey halo ceramide moisturizer. This is thick like butter. Smells semi sweet and absorbs beautifully in my skin. This beautiful jar with a wood top comes with a magnetic spatula that sits perfectly ontop. Amazing ingredients leave my skin glowing and so moisturized. I use this morning and night along with my normal skin care products. This has improved the life of my skin so much already! Defiantly recommend. Smooth like butter
