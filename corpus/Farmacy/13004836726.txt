i have a honeybee tattoo so it only felt right that i buy this cleanser, just to see if it was meant to be! and truly, it was. this one lathers a bit, don’t let the advertising fool you. it’s soap! but it doesn’t strip my skin and leaves it feeling as if i’ve just exfoliated. it’s very gentle and easy to work with. the packaging is cute too! love a little yellow cleanser :) a yes from this bee!
