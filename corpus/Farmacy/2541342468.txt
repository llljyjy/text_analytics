I got the trial size of this a few days ago and have now used it for 4 nights and love it! It feels so nice and smooth on my face and absorbs slowly which is exactly what I want in a night mask.My skin feels amazingly smooth in the mornings. I usually apply this on top of my hyaluronic acid serum. Only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because I have been using it for such a short period! I have a regular size on the way and canâ€™t wait! Loving this so far!
