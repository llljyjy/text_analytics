This mask is so sticky - I definitely canâ€™t use it before I go to bed because I will attract all the dust and other stuff floating in the air! It also broke me out. It does a really good job at moisturizing dry patches. I only use it if I am feeling extra dry and will keep it on for 5-10 minutes max...not sure if it is helping with anything though since I am using it incorrectly Struggling to finish this
