This is just a *nice* lip balm. I am extremely picky about chapstick (I ONLY regularly use this one I’ve been buying since I was 15 that’s meant for outdoor sports) but I find myself looking for this one when I reach for chapstick. I now have one I keep in my desk and one for travel. It doesn’t have SPF, so I still use my sport stick religiously when I’m out and about, but I really love how gentle, moisturizing, and long lasting this is. Highly recommended for those in need of a “normal“ lip balm to keep your lips from drying out! Pleasant, moisturizing, gentle
