I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion, as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador.  I love that it includes a spatula for sanitary reasons.  After using this product several times, I didn’t find it as effective as my cleansing oil or other balms I have used.  It didn’t really get my eye makeup off after multiple cleanses.  I had to triple cleanse with this product.  Sadly, this product is not a repurchsse for me as I have found other cleansing oils and balms to be better andmore effective. nan
