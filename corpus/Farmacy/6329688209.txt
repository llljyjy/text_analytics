this is a nice cleanser but tbh, i don’t know if it’s worth the money because i haven’t noticed any huge improvement in my skin due to it. the formula is nice and foams up really really well but i feel like it’s effects are v basic - it cleans my skin and removes my makeup. there are def other cleansers you can get at similar a price point that offer more imo. solid but maybe not worth it :o
