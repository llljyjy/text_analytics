I love Farmacy products and was so excited to see this added to the lineup. I received it complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. It feels smooth on the skin and is super lightweight. I haven’t been using it long enough to notice a big difference, but I do feel like it’s a great addition to my skincare routine. I’ve added it twice a week at night and I do feel like I am already seeing a small difference in my skin. Smooth and silky!
