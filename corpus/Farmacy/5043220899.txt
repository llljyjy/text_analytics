This stuff is the bomb! It takes off all my makeup, has the perfect amount of froth and leaves my skin feeling sooooo soft. I’ve seen a reduction in acne congestion on my cheeks which I couldn’t be happier about. And it definitely does not strip the skin, it has more of a moisturizing effect. I seem to go through it faster than other face washed but I just can’t stop using it. In love! clear, soft skin!
