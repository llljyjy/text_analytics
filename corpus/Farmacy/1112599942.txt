I loved everything about this at first. I even bought a full sized based on my experience with a sample. But it definitely clogs my pores. I tried taking it out of my routine and re-introducing it, because I want to love it so much. Unfortunately, it clogged my pores again. And it takes me so long to fix my skin once this happens. I’ll finish it up as a hand/foot cream but won’t repurchase. I wanted to love it
