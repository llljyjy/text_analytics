I love the silky, oily, smooth texture of this at the end of the day. It feels like such a luxurious product. This easily wipes off makeup allowing you to gently rub this in. I use a warm muslin cloth to remove it from my face and my skin feels both fresh and clean and moisturized. Highly recommend! So Luxe
