I wasn’t sure how I was going to feel about this product and to be honest I feel like it’s very in the middle. For me vitamin C isn’t particularly something I would choose to use on my skin however I do like the idea of this innovative formula. I used it on my forehead area and I feel like the next day I was pretty dry. I think this will be really great for someone who needs brightening in their skin because it feels really light weight it’s more of an oil type formula I just don’t think I was the skin type for this type of product. Complimentary from Farmacy Beauty Very innovative
