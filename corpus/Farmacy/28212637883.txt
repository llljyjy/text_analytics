I’ve been using retinol for years and am very picky when it comes to retinol - this has quickly become a favorite! It has 1% retinol, which is the perfect potency for retinol,  and  has visibly shown improvement in my skin texture, and fine lines! I love that it’s very lightweight, yet provides a moisturizing softness to the skin. It’s also gentle enough to use in my neck, and doesn’t irritate the sensitive skin! Just a WONDERFUL retinol serum! Complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. one of the best retinol products ever!
