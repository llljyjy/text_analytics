I loved it for straight 2 years. It was perfect for my dry acne prone skin - the only cream that felt good, did not cause irritation or rush, sit well under make-up, etc. Just perfect overall. And then one day I got this formula - I wake up with dry patches on my skin, make up doesn’t stay on and after four day of use I got acne (first time since I switched to Farmacy 2 years ago). It’s just straightforward sad Be aware, might cause you acne New formula ruined everything
