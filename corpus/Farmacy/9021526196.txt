Um where has this been my whole life?! I have tried sooo many different moisturizers and none can top this. I’ve been using it a couple days now, and the instant change in my skin is amazing. I woke up this morning with my skin feeling baby smooth and refreshed. Not to mention my redness almost gone. I have combo skin, that has a tendency to get stressed with exfoliation and masks throughout the week. And this has actually worked from the start! There’s not really a scent which is nice. It goes on smooth, with a consistency between a regular moisturizer and a cream. It melts into your skin without leaving behind product in top of your skin. It’s works well under makeup too. I will definitely be repurchasing this when this bottle is out. So wonderful! nan
