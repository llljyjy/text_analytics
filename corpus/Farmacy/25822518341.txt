This cleansing balm was a blind purchase and I am so glad I gave it a try! I am often experimenting with new skincare items and I rarely find a facial cleanser that really differentiates from others. This balm, however, easily became a new staple in my routine. I regularly wear a decent amount of makeup and this balm is very effective in removing what’s left on my skin at the end of the day. I begin with washing my face with a gentle cleanser, lightly exfoliating with a facial cloth and then applying the balm. I am a firm believer in double cleansing and I prefer to end with this product as it targets the stubborn, leftover makeup, dirt and debris. Additionally, it helps replenish moisture to the skin after the initial cleanse. I love that a fragrance free option is available to those with sensitive skin. Although I personally don’t have adverse reactions to fragrances, I prefer a product that is formulated without unnecessary additives. In short, my skin is feeling clean, hydrated and smooth. I would certainly recommend this product! Melt the Day Away!
