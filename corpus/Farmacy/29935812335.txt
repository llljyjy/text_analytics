I received this complimentary from Farmacy Beauty for my honest review. I am very picky with my retinols after having bad experiences in the past. This one is very gentle on my skin. I had no irritation or dryness with it.  It absorbed into my skin well. It has a nice texture. I didn’t really notice much of a scent which is nice. I’m excited to see some long term results. My only complaint is I think it’s a bit expensive for the amount of product you get. Nice retinol
