This product was gifted by Farmacy Beauty, and I knew this one would be good.  A waterless formula, it sinks into the skin right away which I love.  It layers nicely with other skincare products like my moisturizer and SPF without any pilling.  It’s nice and thin and soaks in quickly to the skin.  It does have that classic vitamin C smell, but it’s not distracting and when layered with other products, you don’t smell it.  I would highly recommend this unique product! Weightless Vitamin C Product!
