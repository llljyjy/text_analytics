This stuff smells good and it does the job, but I’ve been washing my face for more years than I can count and I def know how to close my eyes tightly. This gets in them and leaves me with red stingy eyes when I’m done. I never have this problem with cleansers unless it is an oil based product such as this. I find other oils rather than balms work better and do not get into my eyes. The stinging eyes made it a no for me. Cuz, who wants to go to bed with red eyes and I’m not forgoing my eyes when that is the biggest reason we use oil cleansers to begin with. nan
