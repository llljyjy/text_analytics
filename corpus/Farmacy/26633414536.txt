I love that it smells like good quality honey, but if you are sensitive to scents then it might bother you. I dont notice it after its applied. Im very acne prone and this really nourishes my acne and dryness, it doesn’t make it worse which is a little rare for me. Definitely hydrating but not overly so, I can wear this night or day and I do. Its not greasy or thick its light and creamy but packs a hydrating punch. Its a really good versatile cream and I recommend it! I bought the largest size and Im so glad I did because i can tell it will last a while since you don’t need a lot! I think it helps my redness too and my angry acne is soothed. Smells really good!
