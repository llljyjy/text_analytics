I’ve seen a lot of reviews about the new formula not being that great compared to the previous one. I have not used the previous one before, so my review is non bias as I’ve only used their new formula. I am an oily skin girl with occasional dry spots. My first week using this product has been great, especially in the summer heat. This product is very light and a LITTLE goes a long way. It’s great for layering SPF over which is a huge plus for me. It spreads so easily and doesn’t feel tacky. My skin absorbs it very well and it doesn’t leave me feeling sticky/even more oily. I actually notice that I don’t get oily as fast after using it and I haven’t had any weird breakout from it. I like that there’s no scent to it either. It also doesn’t leave that weird film on top of my skin like other oil-free gel moisturizers do. Overall, it’s a great product. It probably isn’t the most hydrating for someone with dry skin. The ingredients are clean too, which is even better! non bias review of the new formula
