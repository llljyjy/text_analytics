Initially I really liked it and I loved the consistency but over time it really broke me out. I started getting tiny bumps on my forehead which I haven’t had in over a year and this was the only product that has been introduced into my routine. I was really excited but now I’m disappointed that I have to deal with this breakout when my skin was doing so much better before. nan
