I received this product complimentary from Farmacy Beauty and have been testing it out for the past few weeks. Upon initial application, I was very surprised at the consistency/texture of the product. it feels like a lightweight facial oil, unlike any other vitamin c i’ve ever tried. I wasn’t really a fan of the oily feel of it, honestly. however, it didn’t make my skin look greasy, which is a huge plus. I just don’t like The idea of applying an oily product in the morning time, compared to the night time (when I usually apply oils). other than that, it did make my skin look glowy and healthy. nan
