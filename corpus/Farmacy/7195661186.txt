I was gifted by Farmacy Beauty this retinol. Farmacy products are always amazing so I was super excited to try out this retinol. Let me tell you I was absolutely not disappointed!! First of all I love that it’s cruelty free. The serum’s texture is perfect. And there’s no crazy scent. I’ll definitely be buying more once it’s empty! Definite yes!
