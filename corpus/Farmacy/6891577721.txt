I got this in my boxycharm box. I don’t know that I would pay the full price for this face wash but it’s products like these that make my box worth it. So far it’s been really gentle but effective at cleansing my skin. I haven’t noticed any changes in my skin but I do like how it feels when I wash my face. It has an interesting texture that I enjoy very much and leaves my skin feeling smooth. Nice cleanser
