I use this cleanser in the shower with my electric face brush and have repurchased it time and time again.  I noticed that I was running out sooner than I should’ve and come to find out, my husband was using it too.  Now it’s a staple in our shower products and he panics when we’re running low! It’s gentle enough not to break my acne prone skin out, yet powerful enough to clear the blackheads my husband tends to get on his nose without stripping his skin. My husband and I both love it!
