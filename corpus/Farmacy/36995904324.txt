I love this product so much, it takes my mascara off so easily compared to a makeup remover. This cleansing balm makes my skin feel so smooth and takes most of the debris off my face. At first I was using a lot of the product but it ended up in my eyes and blurred my vision but I was able to wash it out and I did some research and you are supposed to use minimal amount and that solved my issue and my eyes weren’t getting blurry and my makeup was getting removed properly. I highly recommend this product and use it correctly instead of using too much product like I did at first. Other than that it’s a really good cleansing balm and I am very satisfied A must have cleansing balm
