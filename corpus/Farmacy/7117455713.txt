I got this in a FabFitFun because I didn’t like anything else in the category, but didn’t want it. I’m really glad none of my family or friends wanted it or I would have never decided to give it a shot. I have extremely sensitive skin, so I tried on just a tiny portion at first and was amazed when I woke up to no issues AND that part of my face was still moisturized! I have incredibly dry, flaky skin. This as a last step seals in all my serums and creates a protective layer for my face (I refuse to not sleep on my side). As far as anything to dupe, I don’t know anything comparable. I’d say maybe Dime Beauty’s night ceramide cream is similar, but this is just the best heavy moisturizer I’ve ever used.The magnetic spatula is genius and the glass container is pretty, but also truly recyclable! Is it pricey? Yes. Is it worth it? Also yes. Sensitive/Dry Skin Approved
