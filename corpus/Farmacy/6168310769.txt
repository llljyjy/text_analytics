This is an amazing bha toner. It has a water-like texture and dries down on the skin without an oily finish. It does dry down with a subtle glow but not overly shiny. It does not burn but is very effective because my nose has cleared up and blemishes are gone by morning when I apply at night. I have tried every bha toner on the market from all of Paula’s choice toners to Biossance and this is the best I’ve tried. Look no further
