I love Vitamin C products and Farmacy Beauty gifted me to test and provide my honest review. This eye cream is adorable and tiny. It has no scent. The texture of the cream is thick but once I apply it to my eyes, it absorbs very well. I love that it doesn’t give me miller, it’s very hydrating and it provides the eye with a renewal feeling. However, I don’t see a visible difference in dark circles, and the product sometimes stings my eyes which is a minus point. Overall, it’s an eye cream I would apply in daily use for hydration. cute
