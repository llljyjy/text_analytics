Was looking forward to this launch from Farmacy.Loved that this vitamin c is waterless and oil free. Texture is light and doesnâ€™t feel sticky upon application. It leaves a radiant finish.There is no irritation or breaking outs which is cool.Loved that it has Ferulic acid and alpha arbutin great combo for brightening dark spots.No added fragrance. Packaging is cute and eco friendly. Looking forward to seeing the results. Waterless formula
