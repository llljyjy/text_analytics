Noticed a difference after first use. Using it nightly for a few weeks now and just WOW. I’ve never had such fabulous results from a night cream before. As others have says a little goes a long way. First night I think I used too much because it felt too slick. Second night I used less and it felt great. The smoothness in my skin and visibly smaller pores makes the price worth it! Definitely the most amazing thing I’ve purchased in a long time! Literally AMAZING
