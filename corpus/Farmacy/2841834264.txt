#farmacybeautygiftedme #prsample I was given a free sample of Farmacy Wake Up Honey Brightening Eye Cream in exchange for my honest evaluation. This cream boasts honey, vitamin C, and caffeine among other ingredients meant to hydrate, de-puff, and brighten the eye area.  It’s got a creamy texture that I enjoy - not too greasy or too watery. It spreads easily and without tugging. Happily, despite the honey, I experience no unpleasant tackiness. The plumping effect was my first and most noticeable improvement. I noticed fewer fine lines within less than a week. It took a little longer, but there is some brightening of my (very) dark circles. My outer eyes seem a bit more resistant, but I see a definite improvement nearer to the tear ducts. I’m really digging this eye cream, and find it effective and pleasurable to use both on my oily upper lids and dry undereye area. I like it for everyday use and find it a safe bet with any of my other products. The humectant properties of honey without the sticky feel is a win, for me. Effective, with a pleasant texture…
