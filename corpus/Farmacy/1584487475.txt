What an interesting vitamin c product! For starters, this Farmacy 10% Waterless Vitamin C Serum hasn’t caused any sort of irritation or flaking on my skin, which is amazing! I have sensitive skin, which gets irritated easily. Now for a oil-free product, this sure feels oily on my skin! I don’t mind that, since my skin is on the drier side, I guess I am just confused by the description. I feel like the serum does brighten my skin and I am very happy with the results so far.  I can’t wait to see more results as a keep using the serum.This serum was gifted to me by Farmacy, but my opinions are my own. Brightening serum!
