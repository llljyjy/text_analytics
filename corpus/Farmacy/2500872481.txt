I recently finished my first jar of this moisturizer and I am in loooove! I have tricky combination acne prone skin and I don’t think I had a single breakout while using this for the several months the jar lasted. I tried a different lotion recently as I hadn’t ordered another jar when I ran out of this one and immediately broke out. I am so amazed at what a difference this makes. Amazing for combination skin!
