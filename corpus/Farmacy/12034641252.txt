I normally use the DE cleansing balm but wanted to try this out. They’re equally as good as each other. The main difference with this balm is a slight scent (wasn’t irritating to me but some folks don’t like it) and the little scoop doesn’t attach to it. I lost the scoop traveling which was sad bc the DE balm has a built in magnet to attach it. Wish they would do something similar. Pretty decent
