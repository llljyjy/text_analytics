I was using it in the mornings and I see improvement. It complimentary from Farmacy Beauty.It warms up when put on the skin. Skin looks better and smoother after a few minutes. Something that did worry me was the fact that my skin was irritated during the first few minutes. I felt burning and had redness mostly in the cheek area. I was keeping an eye on the reasons and realized that it happened mostly when I put on a retinol cream. I am still testing the improvements it provides but for now I have seen that after the irritation goes away, my skin looks healthy and moisturized. nan
