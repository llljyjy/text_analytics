This product used to be my go to, one of the only two products I use on my face, I have pretty sensitive skin so I try to stick to the same stuff. I’m disappointed with this product now that they’ve redesigned the packaging, instead of a metal tube and wood cap it’s now all plastic, other than the fact that it looks tacky, it doesn’t last half as long as it used to. I use the exact same amount everyday as I always have, I bought a new tube less than 2 months ago and it’s already almost finished, whereas with the old packaging I was still able to squeeze some product out of the tube almost a year after initial purchase. I find it ridiculous how they’re charging the same price for a product that is technically the same size as the old packaging but clearly doesn’t contain half as much product. I can’t afford to spend $40 on this every 2 1/2 months, so I don’t know what I’ll do now:(((( Bad Packaging Redesign
