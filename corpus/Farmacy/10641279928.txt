This is the first cleansing balm I have ever used, and I absolutely LOVE it. It was recommended to me by a Sephora associate. I have very  dry, sensitive skin that is extremely reactive, so I need fragrance free. Iâ€™m so glad they had a fragrance free version of this. It works like a dream! I will continue to repurchase this. Very Impressed
