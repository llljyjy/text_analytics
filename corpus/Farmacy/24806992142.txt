I received those products complimentary from Farmacy Beauty in exchange for my honest review. Delicate and effective eye skin care!My skin around the eyes is thin, there are some wrinkles, but not critical for 34, but the main problem is dark circlesâ€¦This cream copes well with its tasks, it is very gentle, it is pleasant to apply, there is no smell, it is not greasy and not thick, it is absorbed quickly, while you feel skin hydration, and most importantly - a real REDUCTION of DARK CIRCLES!I will definitely buy more when I run out! Awesome!
