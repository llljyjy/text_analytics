I use this vitamin C serum in the morning after I rinse my face with water. I allow it to dry and then apply moisturizer. I like the consistency a lot. I like that it’s waterless; it’s seems more potent this way. It almost feels and spreads smoothly like an oil, but sinks into the skin quickly and leaves a nice glow. I have gotten compliments from my husband right after I wake up - he asks why I’ve gotten ready so early in the morning (thinking I’ve put makeup on). I can’t speak to the skin benefits like evening skin tone and reducing hyperpigmentation, but fingers crossed those happen too! I’ve heard great things about the brand and it was so kind this was gifted by Farmacy Beauty. Also, if you have any cuts on your hands, the serum definitely stings a bit - kind of like citrus acid would. Makes my skin glow!
