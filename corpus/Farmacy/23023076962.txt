Being a clean skincare fan I was really excited to incorporate this Retinol serum into my routine! It has beautiful lightweight texture that doesn’t leave any stickiness. My skin absorbs it immediately and is left hydrated and plump. I’m glad this formula is gentle enough to to not cause any irritation to my sensitive skin. I’m overall happy with how it feels and can’t wait to see the results of prolonged use! nan
