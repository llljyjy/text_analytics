I received this product complimentary from Farmacy!!! I’m a huge fan of retinol already,  so I was super excited to try this serum. After using it for awhile I can honestly say I love it and I’ve seen results. The serum is lightweight and great for sensitive skin. I haven’t had any irritation at all. It absorbs nicely into my skin without leaving it feeling greasy or also drying out my skin. My face looks refreshed and brighter. It makes it feel super smooth and soft. I’ve also noticed that my milia around my eyes has reduced which is huge for me. So far I’m loving this product. Another amazing skincare product from Farmacy. Love this serum!!!
