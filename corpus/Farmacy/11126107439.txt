I love this product I use it on my face dry to get all the make up off and depending how much make up I use if I use less I use water to get it off if I’m wearing a lot I use just a towel to wipe it off I have oily skin and it doesn’t make my skin more oily the only thing I don’t like is it says it’s safe for your eyes but it burns if you try and use it to take off your eye makeup nan
