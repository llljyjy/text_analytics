I really like this product. To be honest, Farmacy hasn’t made a product I don’t love and this is no exception. A little goes a long way, and yes there is the hot dog water smell thanks to ferulic acid…but it’s not intolerable and fades quickly.  It spreads on smoothly and didn’t irritate my skin at all. Two thumbs up!Complimentary from Farmacy Beauty Yes please
