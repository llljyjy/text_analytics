This face wash is incredible. I recently switched from cetaphil after I suspected it was the culprit of my whiteheads after subbing out literally every other product I use. I had already tried the farmacy toner and had incredible results, so I decided to try this wash. It’s a thick paste that squirts out and easily lathers into a foam. It smells very light and fresh and leaves your skin feeling unbelievably soft and clean without feeling stripped or too tight. I feel like every ounce of the day is washed off my face effortlessly. I have sensitive acne prone combo skin and this face wash is soothing and hasn’t irritated or broken me out at all. It actually has helped contribute to my acne clearing up and stop reoccurring!! I love this face wash and this is now my staple, morning and night. My new favourite!!
