I used this for a bit during the day, in the winter because my skin was really struggling with wrinkles. I looooooved it, it is very rich, and it will take some time for your skin to absorb it. Definitely helped my skin smooth out during the winter months, now that the weather is warming up, it makes my skin oily so i use it exclusively at night. I used it for a month consistently to see results, its not gonna work from one week to the other. Great product, worth the price for me.
