Been using this for about a week or so now. This product AT FIRST broke me out and created little red bumps on my forehead. It wasn’t a massive deal but it was annoying. Now I feel like this is finally working for me. All my texture on my skin is slowly starting to disappear, my skin is more glowy, more bright, and soft to the touch. Right now I’m loving it. This might be a contender for my new favourite night cream nan
