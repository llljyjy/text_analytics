The “waterless“ factor fascinated me though I’m not sure it differs in texture compared to their vitamin C products, but it is eye catching and curiosity peaking! It contains 10% L-ascorbic acid and 1% alpha arbutin, which is a skin fave! Diminishing of dark spots takes time, that of which I cannot say much to, but what I do enjoy is it doesn’t burn like other vitamin C products I’ve tried and it absorbs well with no pilling when topped with other products.  Looking to forward to more results. Gifted by Farmacy. nan
