Love this stuff! I received it as a deluxe sample in as soon as I ran out of that, I immediately purchased the full-size! A small scoop goes a long way. I take a little scoop, and rub it in circular motions on my whole face when I’m ready to remove my make up. It literally melts away! I then wipe with a damp warm cloth. Quick and Easy which I like. It’s a great first cleanse in your routine love it!
