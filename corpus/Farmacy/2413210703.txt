This mask always leaves my skin glowing and hydrated in the morning. I see reviews that wear moisturizers underneath first but although my skin is on the dryer side, wearing it on top of a good hyaluronic acid serum works perfect for me. I love this product. It feels so luxurious on my skin. Itâ€™s a tad bit sticky so I like to wear it atleast 30 minutes before bed. A little definitely goes a long way! Glowing Skin
