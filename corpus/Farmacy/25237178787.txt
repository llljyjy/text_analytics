Pros: very moisturizing and the texture is almost buttery. I love the magnetic lid and metal spatula for scooping out the product.Cons: for a clean product it’s disappointing that it’s scented. It took me some adjusting to the honey scent, no matter how light it is. I have also heard concerns there is an ingredient in it that could be harmful to dogs if they kick your face? I have made sure to not wear it around my parents and in-laws dogs.Over all good thick facial moisturizer. I won’t be wearing it much in the summer because my combo skin won’t be able to handle it but great for colder months or at night. nan
