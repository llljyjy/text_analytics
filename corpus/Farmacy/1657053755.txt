This serum is definitely different than any other vitamin C serums I’ve used in the past. It feels a little heavier and takes longer to absorb into the skin, but it’s very effective. I have noticed my dark spots going away and my fine lines look less noticeable. I can also tell my skin looks alot brighter. I would highly recommend this product! The product was gifted by Farmacy Beauty but opinions are my own. Love this serum!
