I LOVE this product. I have been searching for a good makeup remover that doesn’t inflame my skin (I have very, very sensitive skin); and this product is now like a holy grail product for me. A little of this goes a long way as well, so this product will last you awhile. It feels super nice on your skin and completely took off all of my makeup, including my eye makeup. I also have acne prone skin and this product did not make me get any extra pimples which is super nice. One tip: when putting it on your eyelid/lashes, keep your eyes closed the entire time. While it doesn’t hurt or sting to open your eyes, your vision is super blurry and some of the balm will go into your eyes and make your vision not so great for a couple of hours.
