I usually use youth to the people night masks, but since I got this product as a sample I decided to use it. I am not one to complain of a little stinging, so when I note the stinging that honeymoon glow gave me, please know it wasnâ€™t subtle. I left it on for an hour until I finally gave in and washed it off and my face still stings. definitely sticking to youth to the people from now on! it stings!
