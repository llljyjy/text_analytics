Gifted by Pharmacy Beauty I was so exited when I was given the chance to try Pharmacy Beauty Waterless Vitamin C Serum. I simply adore products that contain vitamin C, as it is so beneficial for our skin!This product has a very nice light texture, spreads and absorbs easily. It is very gentle on the skin and has a very pleasant scent without being overly fragant. My skin looks and feels more radiant, youthful, supple, moisturized and refreshed after each application. It truly is a “must have“ gem for every skincare routine!! I highly recommend it to those who want to improve the quality of their skin.  There is no Pharmacy Beauty product that I don’t love and this is not the exception! My skin looks healthy and radiant!!
