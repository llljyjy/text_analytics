Love for my dry skin! Feels like butter which I love- but that means it is thick, so good for night time moisturizer. At first it made my face a little sensitive and almost burned, but that only happened first few days using it, I think my skin is used to it now and it works just fine. I apply it to my dry areas of concern. good!
