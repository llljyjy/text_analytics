I am so pleasantly surprised at how much I love this cleanser! I thought it might too harsh and too drying but I was wrong about that part. It’s perfect for my congested skin during the summer in the south. It deep cleans my pores but doesn’t strip, dry, or irritate my skin. My skin is brighter, softer, clearer, cleaner, and happier. Fantastic job again Farmacy
