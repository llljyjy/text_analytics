I have super sensitive skin and I can’t use anything harsh on my skin. I was hoping this would work for me and it did! I had no adverse reaction at all and that in itself was a win. It’s too soon to tell how it will do with my fine lines but I am happy because I haven’t had a bad reaction to it. Its creamy and my skin soaks it right up. No sticky feel. I am happy with it so far. Product gifted to me by Farmacy Beauty for my honest review. Super happy!
