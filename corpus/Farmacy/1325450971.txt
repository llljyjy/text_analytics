I’m working through some samples of this one now. it’s a somewhat whipped texture, and somewhat slightly heavier than all the other new zinc formulations on the market currently, and with a pleasant zero scent/ zinc scent that smells exactly like what you’d expect a clean sunscreen to smell like - I find it refreshing that there’s zero fragrance (EOs) added too. This is also a good formula for people who don’t want oils in their sunscreens as there might be some evidence that those oils oxidize in heat/ sunshine. I have light skin, and this doesn’t leave a white cast on me.  It’s a good summer/ humidity formula...no oils to make your skin oily in the humidity, and no chance of oil oxidation in the summer heat/ sunshine. I like it. Good formula that has it's own place in the market
