This was gifted to me by Farmacy in exchange for my honest thoughts.  My skin is very sensitive when it comes to Vitamin C so I tend to avoid it. This vitamin C serum is okay.  I havenâ€™t noticed much of a difference yet and I think I actually prefer their original cherry Vitamin C serum. The scent for this new Vitamin C is overwhelming as well. nan
