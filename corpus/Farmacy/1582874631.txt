The only moisturizer that has replenished my dry skin! After having my daughter and breastfeeding my skin became very dry. This moisturizer has been a game changer. My skin feels plump and moisturized in the morning and I feel my makeup doesn’t settle on dry patches. (I do use a lighter moisturizer for day) I’ve just started to get my husband to use it as well since he is currently on Accutane and his skin has been very dry. His skin looks so hydrated now, barely any dry, flaky skin. Helped moisturize my postpartum skin!
