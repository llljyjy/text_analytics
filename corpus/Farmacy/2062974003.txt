I’ve tried a LOT of vitamin c serums and nearly all of them irritate my skin. Today is the first day I’ve used this one and I immediately could tell it is different. It feels different. It smells different. It looks different. It didn’t irritate my skin or leave behind any weird feeling. I hope that long term my skin still reacts well to  it! Really loving everything about it so far. Gifted by Farmacy Beauty for review purposes. nan
