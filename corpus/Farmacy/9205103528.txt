I don’t like this as much as their cherry vitamin c which I think they discontinued in favor of this one. This product stung my skin at first, but overall my skin barrier was struggling so I definitely don’t think this is good for sensitive skin folks. I’ve worked my way up to using it to every three days right now, and my skin does look brighter and is touchably softer! Just need to go slow! I feel very medium about this unfortunately.
