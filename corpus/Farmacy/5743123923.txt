This didn’t rinde off completely and felt like there was residue left behind. It just seemed like expensive jar of coconut oil. Literally the same feeling I got from using coconut oil as a makeup remover. And not sure what ingredient would’ve made my skin burn but my skin was already feeling sensitive and after using this it felt extremely prickly and warm. Pass! overpriced coconut oil
