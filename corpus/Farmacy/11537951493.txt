This serum is magic. Have only been using it a few days and already notice my skin is more plump, hydrated, and my fine lines are softening. It also calms all potential acne or redness for me. The smell is weird at first, but it fades. I have also had no pilling. Works great with cerave cream overtop. This stuff has saved my poor dry winter skin. magical
