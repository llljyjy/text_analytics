I received the Wake Up Honey Eye Cream complimentary from Farmacy to try. This eye cream comes in a very nice glass container. I wish it had a scoop or applicator to get the product out but that isn’t a deal breaker. It applies very nicely and left my under eye area feeling and looking hydrated. You do need to let it absorb and dry completely before putting your makeup on. A little cream goes a long way as well. I’m really like the effects so far from it! Nice Eye Cream
