This product was my first cleansing balm and when I finally ran out I thought about trying a new cleansing balm but I couldn’t convince myself to do it. This cleansing balm is perfect! It takes all my make up off and leaves my face feeling so clean! It doesn’t strip my skin and dry it out. It keeps it feeling soft and healthy. It is also so convenient and quick to use. I really can’t see myself trying anything else! Must have!
