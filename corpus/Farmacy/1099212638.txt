I received complimentary from Farmacy Beauty! This is a Wake Up Honey Eye Cream! I love their packing in a glass jar, so cute! It is formulated with potent vitamin C and hydrating honey! This lightweight eye cream is clinically-proven to combat dark circles, brighten, and depuff eyes. It encapsulated caffeine and upcycled cranberry peptide to help smooth crow’s feet and fight wrinkles over time. This gentle eye cream is safe to use around the entire eye area including eyelids. It is a yellow color creamy texture! I gently pat on the eye area, it is so glowing! Soft touching! Won’t irritate my eyes! Not greasy! Just like a wake up call for the tired eyes when used in the morning! So energizing! It can apply under makeup for the perfect radiant base too! For brighten I believe that it will be better if I continue to use it for a long term! Recommended! Wakeup eye cream
