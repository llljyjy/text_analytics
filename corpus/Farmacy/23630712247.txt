This moisturizer first of all is very rich and sinks into the skin. Definitely repaired my dry skin and provided much needed hydration caused by the colder weather.  It is cruelty free, and free of basically all chemicals.  The packaging is very cute and the jar resembles that of a honey pot.  Complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. nan
