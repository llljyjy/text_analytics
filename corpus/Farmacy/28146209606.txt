As soon as I pumped this serum into my clean hands to apply on my skin, I knew the light creamy texture was going to absorb nicely into my skin. It has a very mild fruity scent that I think iâ€™m in love with.  I use this right after I cleanse in the PM, use an eye cream, and moisturize. It goes on gently and does not feel greasy. It is very gentle on my skin. I use it on my neck as well. The two Retinal (Vitamin A) in this product helps visibly reduce fine lines and wrinkles. I previously used an anti-aging serum and switched it out with this. Within days, my skin felt healthier and smoother than ever before. I can feel the improvement of my skin barrier with a visibly brighter, hydrating, even skin tone. I am enthusiastic about continuing to use this to see ongoing results. I will continue to purchase this product and highly recommend you give it a try! Incredible Retinol Serum Mixture
