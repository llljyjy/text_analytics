This serum is incredible! It noticeably changed the look/texture of my skin. It could be drying for those - for those with dry skin, I would use every other morning. I haven’t had too much trouble with leaking, but the pump top did fly off upon immediately opening it. Still, I won’t be purchasing any other Vit C serum. nan
