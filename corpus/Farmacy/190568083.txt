I was excited to see a vitamin A from this brand. It seems a combo of retinal with encapsulated retinol. The texture is creamy and light. It also has ceramide NP plus fatty acids from upcycled oils. There’s no discernible scent. I’m unsure what the actual 1% is. Is that just the retinol or is it both. Not sure. So it says 1-3x a week. I started once the first week and tried 2x the second week. For some reason I seem to be irritated the next morning after using. I typically only use retinal and not retinol anymore. I did buffer it before and after. I definitely need more than two weeks to play with this and see. I normally like 12 weeks with a new retinoid product before a full review, but due to time constraints when testing this as it was gifted by Farmacy then this is my thoughts after two weeks. Sometimes there’s a month long adjustment in the beginning and the irritation I got is likely just that. Results for me are always about 6-8 weeks in. I have dry skin and mild rosacea, I use retinoids regularly if that helps nan
