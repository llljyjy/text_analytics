Ugh I wanted to love this b/c I love other Farmacy products (Honeymoon Glow and the Green Clean, in particular). This was hydrating, but beware of break outs!! After 2 nights of use, I developed a huge zit on my left cheek (and Iâ€™ve never had one before on a cheek). After 3 nights, another huge zit popped up on the other cheek. I stopped using immediately and the break out stopped. Nothing else in my skincare routine changed, so this was definitely the culprit. Returned. Beware of break outs
