I received this product gifted by Farmacy Beauty, and I have really been enjoying it! It has an oil consistency, but doesn’t feel sticky, more hydrating than anything. It makes a great base for makeup and I will continue using it over time. I’m not crazy about the smell, but it almost indicates to me that there is nothing artificial in it which I appreciate. Overall, great product! Would give it 5 stars if not for the smell
