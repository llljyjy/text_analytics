This is a fantastic product. I first tried it in a deluxe sample and immediately loved it. This was the missing piece for my damaged moisturizer barrier. It’s great at night and but also works well under makeup. It really helps soften the skin! I personally think the scent is nice but unnecessary. I have dry, sensitive skin and my skin didn’t react to the scent. I think this is a must try for dry skin. Moisture Barriers Best Friend
