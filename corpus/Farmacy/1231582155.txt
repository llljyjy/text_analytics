This does not absorb into the skin, fails to moisturize in the slightest, then burns when applied to dry skin. I ordered it to use during winter months because of all the 5* reviews, tried it consistently for 3 weeks and had to return because my skinâ€™s reaction only got worse as it dried out more. Do not recommend. nan
