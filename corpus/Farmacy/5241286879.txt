I use this on dry skin as the first step of my double cleanse. I love knowing it’s “clean“ and it seems to really remove all my makeup and sunscreen while still being gentle and not breaking me out. I keep repurchasing over and over and would definitely consider this a staple in my routine. *TIP: if you are struggling to remove your eye makeup, after you apply dry and gently rub to “loosen“ everything up, add a little water to fingertips and gently rub in circles. Keep repurchasing! A staple in my routine.
