I never write reviews for skincare bc I feel like it’s never anything super noticeable, especially moisturizers, but I LOVE this stuff. The bottle is so heavy and luxurious,  and the product itself feels so rich and moisturizing. I have pretty oily skin so this is so nice to “slug” (iykyk) my face with and sometimes skip the extra vaseline/cerave step for how moisturizing it is. Anyways yes get it! Ultimate Night Moisturizer
