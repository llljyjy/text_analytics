Gifted by Farmacy Beauty in exchange for my honest opinion. I like how hydrating this is! It’s nourishing but not too thick. It’s also very slightly honey scented. I love the cute packaging and color of the cream. It definitely reduces dehydration lines and makes my under eyes appear less scaley. I think with long term use I will see plumped not puffy under eyes because this is very nourishing. There isn’t a heavy, greasy, or sticky feeling after use, which is an essential for me when picking out an eye cream. You can see in the picture the texture. A little goes a long way ! Nourishing and vitamin c is brightening!
