I previously used a very inexpensive Elf cleansing balm as my first step, but I felt it did leave some oily residue on my skin. It did a great job getting my makeup off but I felt it left a film and battled oily skin and inbalances. When I used that up and did my homework on what to replace it with, this seemed like the HG for so many people. It is for me! I got the standard size and I predict this will last 9 months to one year, a pea size is all I typically need. Afterward my skin feels extremely soft but balanced. I usually do a second step cleanser, but sometimes i skip my second step and it does not seem to bother my skin. I remove with a wet microfiber cloth if I am extemely lazy and all is well. The smell is lovely. I may try a different scent or variation of this cleansing balm in the future, but I will not stray from this brand and similar formulas and I am now tempted to try other skincare items from them! I cringed at the price point, but its worth it,HG!
