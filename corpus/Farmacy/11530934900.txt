I have tried more moisturizers that I can count and I’ve never been this impressed. I have combination, acne prone skin. This is extremely moisturizing and a bit heavy, so it’s perfect for nighttime use. I like to mix it with hyarulonic acid to make it a bit runnier. It keeps me hydrated and glowing throughout the night, minimizes my pores and doesn’t break me out. A little goes a long way, I got the sample size and it has lasted me a month. It’s truly a holy grail and I’ll recommend this product to all my friends! BEST moisturizer I have ever tried
