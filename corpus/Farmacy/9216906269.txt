I received this product complimentary from Farmacy Beauty, but my these are my honest thoughts on it. This vitamin c serum has been a good addition to my routine! I like that it comes in a pump packaging to control the amount dispensed. Its consistency isn’t watery-thin like an oil, but it isn’t thick/lotion-like either. It’s a good balance between being thin enough to spread easily but not thin enough that it slides around in your palm. It has a traditional vitamin c scent and doesn’t leave my face looking super greasy or irritated. The ingredient list itself is impressive, especially with the addition of ferulic acid. A good & gentle vitamin c option
