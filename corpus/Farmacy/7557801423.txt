I thought I would never love a moisturizer as much as my tatcha dewy skin cream, but this is just as great. I decided I was tired of spending $65+ on my tatcha for a tiny pot, and decided to purchase this on my NYC trip. I love it. I suffer with EXTREMELY dry skin, it flakes off no matter what. And this and the tatcha both ensure that never happens and keeps me so moisturized. I would rather spend the money on the jumbo size of this one (itâ€™s also clean which is a plus), therefore this is my new fav! Love
