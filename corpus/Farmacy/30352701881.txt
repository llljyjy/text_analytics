I received this product gifted by Farmacy Beauty to give my honest opinion.  I really like the texture of this moisturizing cream, it is light and easy to apply, it has a honey smell that I love, I applied it and it takes a while to absorb, but when abdorver the skin feels ready to go to sleep without feeling so greasy, I like this cream to apply it for my facial routine at night, I have felt my skin softer and it looks more hydrated and radiant.  I am happy with this moisturizer I recommend it nan
