Got a sample of it from bazaar reward. My second HA, likes it much better than the first from ordinary. This one still has the slimy texture but it absorbs much better and quicker than ordinary HA. I also really like the honey smell, BUT if you don’t like honey smell, you prolly won’t like this product. love it better than ordinary HA
