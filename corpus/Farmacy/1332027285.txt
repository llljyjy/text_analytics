I bought the mini size and used it for about 6 weeks, I love other Farmacy products and had high hopes. Ultimately, though, I didn’t like this one. It never felt like it fully absorbed into my skin and always left a tacky, greasy residue. I didn’t see any improvement in my pores or texture, but did see an uptick in monthly hormonal zits. Before this I was using Glow Recipe’s watermelon toner religiously for over a year, but I wanted to try something new. I’ve since switched back to the GR and my skin already looks and feels better.Also, the smell is horrific. At first I barely noticed it and it didn’t bother me, but it got to the point where I dreaded putting this on my face. I’m super sensitive to scents though. nan
