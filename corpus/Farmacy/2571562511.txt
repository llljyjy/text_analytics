This was gifted to me by the brand I put my opinions are my own - I love that we now have access to good retinol over the counter! I love everything from Farmacy and this product is no different! I didn’t irritate my skin in anyway shape or form! No breakouts or dry patches which can sometimes happen with Retinol. If you don’t have retinol in your routine I highly recommend checking this one out! I love this!
