This serum has a thin liquid consistency and subtle earthy scent. I have been using it 2-3 times per week for the past few weeks and I feel like skin is definitely looking more smooth and my fine lines and wrinkles are less noticeable. It hasnâ€™t irritated my skin at all either. Overall, this is a great Vitamin A Retinol serum that I would recommend! I received this product complimentary from Farmacy Beauty in exchange for my honest review. Farmacy Beauty
