Gifted by Farmacy Beauty. First off, this packaging is so luxurious! It comes with a glass bottle with a magnetic lid, so you’ll never lose the spatula. It has a rich creamy texture that helps a lot with moisturization. It didn’t feel heavy or sticky at all. The one thing was that I found it would pill with some of my sunscreens and make up primers, so I would mostly only use this at night. nan
