I have super sensitive skin so I can’t use retinol a lot, but this serum has been great for me. I use it 1/2 times a week and it’s not sticky or fragranced and blends into the skin well. Farmacy always has great ingredients and I feel good putting them on my skin. I was gifted by Farmacy and am so glad I got to try this product. Great retinol
