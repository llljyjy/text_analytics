I received it as a sample from Sephora. It hydrates and gives your skin a glow immediately. The smell is not bad if you like nature/plants. Itâ€™s similar to honey and ginger smell. After you apply the smell goes away in few seconds. It smells like natural honey. Better than having chemical to make it smell better. Smell like organic honey. I like it.
