I was excited to try out this Vitamin C serum; however as soon as I used it, I noticed that the serum smelled like barbecue sauce. I also didn’t really like the consistency of the serum itself, so I returned it immediately and bought another Vitamin C serum instead. Overall, nice packaging but I couldn’t get past the smell and consistency. Smells Like Barbecue Sauce
