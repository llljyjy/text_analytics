I wanted to get away from micellar and cotton pads because the skin around my eyes was irritated, and this is perfect! It smells nice and it feels nice. It gets of waterproof mascara well. I knocked it a star because sometimes the balm doesnâ€™t spread as well and kind of stays in little clumps, but I think that might get better as I get further in the pot. nan
