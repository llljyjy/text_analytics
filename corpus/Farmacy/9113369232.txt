I decided to try this out because I do have sensitive skin. The ingredients are pretty good and I haven’t experienced any irritation or stinging on my hyper-sensitive areas. It does remove makeup and sunscreen really well but the reviews are true… it does leave a waxy film on the skin after rinsing. I use this as the first step to double cleanse, so my second cleanser gets rid of that residue anyway. For reference, I’m currently double cleansing with the dr. Jart+ tiger grass enzyme foam cleanser made for sensitive skin. On the days when my skin is extra sensitive and I want to use an extra gentle milky cleanser, such as the cerave or cetaphil hydrating cleanser consistency, it’s not enough to get rid of the waxy residue. I previously used the Tatcha oil makeup remover and I love that one but I wanted to try something new. I recommend this if you have sensitive skin AND double cleanse, just keep in mind it might not get rid of the residue if you use a really gentle cleanser, if you don’t, you should be fine to be honest. Overall, I think it’s good but I’m not crazy about it. I do want to try other cleanser balms and oils before I consider repurchasing this one. It’s good
