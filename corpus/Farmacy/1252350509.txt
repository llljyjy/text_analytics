I am really enjoying this Vit C serum from Farmacy. It has a thin oily consistency, but is thicker than most other Vit C serums that I have tried. It absorbs fairly quickly and feels moisturizing on the skin. Really great ingredients! *Product gifted by Farmacy Beauty in exchange for my honest review. nan
