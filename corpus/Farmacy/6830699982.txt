Bought this cream thinking it would be a great moisturizer cream because if all the great reviews on Sephora and some You Tube Influensters but sadly this was a really bad purchase. I have dry dehydrated skin and thought with all the great ingredients it would work for me but it didn’t and I returned it after 3 weeks of using this my skin felt parched and more dehydrated. When I went to return it 2 ppl recommended FAB collagen firming cream and it has truly rescued my dry skin. My daughter even said to get it because she saw a lot of ppl raving about it on Social Media. Farmacy has to do better it’s $45 and FAB is $42 and much better quality and results for the price. This cream is nourishing and soothing my dry skin. Farmacy Honey Halo is a fail for me. It’s missing that special feeling that a good cream needs look elsewhere not this one!!! Hope this honest review helps someone. Wanted to love it but just had to return it
