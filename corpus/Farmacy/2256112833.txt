This is how good it is! All gone lol so I used MAC products for years and liked them but they closed the store by me and call me old fashion but sometimes I like to go to the stores even tho I have packages delivered daily to my house. So I went online and found this halo honey moisturizer and the reviews were great. First I got the small jar from Amazon and then I got the large one and just order another from Sephora. I was worried the shape would make it hard to get to all of the moisturizer but the little metal spatula reaches every corner and it’s magnetized (so is the wood lid) so it sticks to the top. It’s all very logistic and cute aesthetically. The best part is I don’t have any dry skin any more like none. I use it every morning and night. I liked it so much I have bought many of the other Farmacy products and am a cult member for their products… sold! Highly recommend them. A MUST have!
