This is a really good release from farmacy. The frosted glass packaging and color are gorgeous, and it comes with a little spatula. This night mask has a bouncy, gel-cream kind of texture and no fragrance. It feels light, but also noticeably emollient as you apply it. It spreads well, so you don’t need a lot to cover your face. I have dry skin and love niacinamide for it’s efficacy against texture. Though niacinamide can be astringent on its own, creating a night mask is a clever way to deliver results without furthering dryness. I apply this as a last step in my night routine 2-3x a week. When I wake up, my skin is moisturized and supple, like it did a great job of “sealing in“ my moisturizer, and nice and smooth. I have tried a few times without moisturizer based on how others’ have used it, and that didn’t work for me. The mask was still on when I wok up, but my skin felt a little tight and dehydrated underneath.It is somewhat pricey compared other niacinamide products on the market, which is why I see this being a repurchase, but not a mainstay in my routine--I’ll definitely rotate this with less expensive options that also deliver the smoothing I’ll looking for. But I ultimately think it’s worth the price and see myself coming back to it over and over again. nan
