I love the texture of this! It feels very silky and soothing! It’s not overwhelmingly greasy, but does feel slightly tacky initially. I wouldn’t say it absorbs in completely since it’s a mask, but I like to wear this at least an hour before bedtime so it has a chance to dry down a bit. It instantly gives my face a glowy, glazed looked! My skin looks so smooth, calm, and had a healthier appearance the morning after using this. Product gifted by Farmacy Beauty. Awesome night mask!
