I’ve used this off and on for years and am a huge fan. I wish the price wasn’t so high. Also, I’m NOT a fan of the new super plastic body container. It used to be more of the medicinal type of tube where you could roll it up to get more of it out. Now it’s more of a cheap plastic. But the product is phenomenal for the skin. I use it mostly on my hand but have also used it on my face, lips. It just about works everywhere and makes the skin nice and smooth. Love this stuff!
