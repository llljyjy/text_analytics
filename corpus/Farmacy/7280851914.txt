This moisturizer is so amazing!! I was skeptical about purchasing this because I have acne prone/combination skin but my T-zone gets super oily. I’ve been using tretinoin and it has dried my skin out so much and I needed something to hydrate it and bring life back to my skin. Let me just say it’s amazing!!!! A little goes a long way and even though it’s expensive it’s absolutely worth the hype and money!! nan
