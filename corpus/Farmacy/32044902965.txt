This is one of those products that gives you that vitamin C results in less than a week. Itâ€™s really nourishing on the skin, and i love such products because i can skip the extra hydration products i use because most Vitamin c serums have a very dry sticky and tacky formula. It feels oily the moment you disperse but then settles down so well once you apply and just follow up with a sunscreen in the day time and you are good to goA really potent vitamin c serum, absolutely loved it and would recommend to everyone and all skin types!Gifted by farmacy beauty Love
