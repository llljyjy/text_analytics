I seriously love this moisturizer! I recently started tretinoin for acne and my skin has been incredibly dry. Not only that, but because of my acne in the past, I have struggled to find a moisturizer that works for me. This stuff is gold!! I love the formula. It is definitley a good winter moisturizer for the dryer months - I have not used it during the warmer months. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I find that I run out of products that come in a jar much faster than a tube. This 50ML moisturizer last me a little over a month using it morning and night. nan
