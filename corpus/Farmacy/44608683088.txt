Farmacy Beauty  gifted me  Wake Up Honey eye cream in exchange for my opinion. My skin is combination to preface this.  The eye cream is very hydrating it lasts all day.  I recommend this for someone with drier skin in the eye area.  My skin looked hydrated but for me I feel I wouldn’t use this everyday maybe twice a week.  I didn’t notice  any change in my dark circles but my eyes did seem less puffy Great for winter
