I have fair, sensitive, skin with milia (tiny white bumps) around my eyes, forehead, and cheeks. I was cleansing, exfoliating, and they were NOT going away. After using this product 3 times a week, the milia are finally going away after two years! I was so thrilled because they’ve always bothered me. I’m incredibly grateful for this product. Milia be gone!
