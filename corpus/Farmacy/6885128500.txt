I’ve gone through about 3 containers of the original Green Farmacy cleansing balm and wanted to try this as I suffer from dermitis and sensitive skin. I find it doesn’t work as well as my skin doesn’t feel very clean, leaves a film on your skin, and has a “clinical” type of smell. The original is much better!
