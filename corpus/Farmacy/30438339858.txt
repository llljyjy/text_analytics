This is my first time using a retinol in my skin routine so I was a bit nervous about using it. I find that using it once a week is best for my sensitive skin. This is such a simple anti-aging product if you’re a beginner to retinols since it’s such a low percentage. You can work your way up if or when your tolerance becomes higher.  - Gifted by Farmacy Beauty Great Retinol for First-time Retinol Users
