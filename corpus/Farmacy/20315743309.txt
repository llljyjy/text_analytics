I have been looking for a vitamin C with no added fragrance or other harsh ingredients so I was really excited to try this one! So far, I am enjoying it. My only complaint is that it does take a few minutes to sink into the skin so you have to wait in between skin care steps. Gifted by Farmacy Beauty. nan
