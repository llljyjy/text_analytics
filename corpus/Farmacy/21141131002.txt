I love love love this moisturizer. I was using gel based moisturizers because I have really oily skin, but it seemed too oily still. I was recommended this, and I get a very nice glow but it’s not an oily feel and my skin is so much more hydrated. Just don’t use too much, as you can do with any product out there! I will be buying this again also for the fact it’s lasted me a lot longer than my other favorite moisturizers. nan
