I used this wake up honey eye cream on my dry and clean under eye skin. It has no scent, the texture is creamy thick. It is easy to apply and a little bit goes a long way. It hydrates and brightens my under eyes. It also reduces my dark circles.  It’s non-sticky and doesn’t tingle. I love this product for it’s effectiveness and ease of use. I received it complimentary from Farmacy Beauty, all opinions are my own. nan
