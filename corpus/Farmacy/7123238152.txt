I used the CEO Sunday Riley serum before this, and the only thing I liked about that product more is the consistency. This Farmacy serum is a very heavy oil feel, whereas the CEO serum is light and creamy. However - my skin is looking amazing with this serum and i cannot complain with these results! I use it morning and night and will never NOT use a vitamin c serum now! My missing skincare puzzle piece!
