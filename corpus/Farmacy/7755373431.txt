Farmacy never disappoints!  Their honey line is a perfect match for my skin’s dryness, and this new addition is no exception.  This eye cream has a pleasant, subtle honey scent and a rich and nourishing consistency, but it is not too thick or heavy for daytime use.  In the morning, I apply a thin layer under both eyes.  The yellow color is sheer yet immediately brightens my under eye area.  This eye cream also provides a smoothing and hydrating base for concealer, keeping it from creasing.  At night, I apply a thicker layer all around my eyes and across my eyelids.  It makes me feel like I’m wearing eye masks and I wake up with eyes that are less puffy and have less noticeable dark circles.  Gifted by Farmacy Beauty. Honey heaven for my eyes!
