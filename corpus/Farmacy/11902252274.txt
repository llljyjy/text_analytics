This is a really great retinol. The consistency is great, application is really smooth, and the smell is… well it’s a retinol. It feels like this would be good for beginners and retinol pros alike. The first night I woke up with a few small white bumps, but after that it was smooth sailing. My skin looked pretty good and took to the serum nicely. Of course it takes a while to see the results of be skincare item, but I’m really enjoying this so far! I’m so grateful this was gifted by Farmacy Beauty. Easy, skin loving retinol!
