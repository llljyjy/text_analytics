I can’t rave enough about this moisturizer! In the winter I have the driest skin, and no other moisturizer works for me. They either aren’t hydrating enough or they sting my sensitive skin. This moisturizer is EVERYTHING! I love the subtle honey scent, and while it is more expensive than I usually spend, I just buy the jumbo size and it’s worth it! The ONLY cream hydrating enough!
