I don’t like this product. I gave mature dry skin and I thought this would really help add some moisture. It doesn’t. It goes on like real honey and is so sticky that it gets on everything your fingers or face touch. I can only use this in the shower or tub. It’s that messy. Afterwards my face doesn’t really feel much different. Alit of mess for very little pay off. No thank you. way to messy
