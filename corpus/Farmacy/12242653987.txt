I’m not a fan of this. There are way better vitamin Cs out there for way cheaper than this. It feels like cooking oil on your face. It is not very hydrating and even caused some tightness around my nose. Tru skin vitamin c is so much better and cost $20.. you don’t have to spend this kind of money on skincare for good skin. This is the perfect example of something over priced that is hyped by influencers who are getting paid for good reviews. NOPE
