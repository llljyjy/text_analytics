I was very undecided on purchasing this product.  I was pretty happy with my nighttime routine and had previously tried niacinamide in the past without much success or skin improvement. But boy am I glad I gave this a shot!  My skin has never had this level of clarity and bounce.  It just feels better and more healthy.A little of this product goes a long way.  A small amount provides good coating on my face and as long as I do not use too much, the stickiness is very minimal.  I do use a Farmacy moisturizer (Honey Halo) under this and they pair well together but I have also used with facial oils as well without issue.  Not quite ready to label this product a holy grail but so far I havenâ€™t wanted to go a night without it!  Definitely recommend anyone on the fence to take the plunge. Another Fantastic Farmacy Product!!!
