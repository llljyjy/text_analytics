First of all, this isn’t my first retinol product I’ve tried/used; but I do have dry sensitive skin so sometimes I have to be careful. Even though this has some hydrating ingredients I did experience some sight dryness in spots which I easily combat with a thicker moisturizer. It did not irritate my skin. I do wish it was a 1.7 oz instead of just 1 oz because it does seem a little small for the type of product it is. I love that it helps my texture a little and to combat getting any acne. I haven’t seen a difference in fine lines yet because I haven’t had it that long.  #gifted by Farmacy nice, a litttttttle drying
