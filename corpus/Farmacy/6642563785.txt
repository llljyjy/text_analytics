This stuff is so lightweight! Love that it sinks in quickly, doesn’t have a gritty or oily feel like some other vitamin c serums, and that it comes in an opaque container! It didn’t pill under my other 10+ products that I wear daily (including my sunscreen!) and it was overall very comfortable. This was gifted by farmacy beauty in exchange for an honest review but I would definitely repurchase myself! Wears great with other products!
