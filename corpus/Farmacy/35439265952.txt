A rich but definitely not oily, hydrating mask that’s quite high in Glycerine - especially, also Niacinamide and honey/propolis. Very similar to the ’Antioxidant Hydration mask’ which I also used some time back, but I feel this is a more effective and slightly improved reformulation of the ’antioxidant’ mask. Used this twice now and both times it’s left my skin supple and glowing. I’ve even been able to skip the moisturizer afterwards! Love how the texture transforms from what looks likethick honey into a whiteish cream as you massage it into your skin. The heating action seems to help draw impurities out of my skin, rather my pores to be precise! I leave this on for 10 minutes which I feel is more than enough for me. No negative reaction so far, only good results. ~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~(My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)1.
