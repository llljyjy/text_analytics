Although I don’t wear makeup, I wanted to start double cleansing to better remove spf and sebum off my face. This was my first oil based cleansing balm I’ve tried, and I absolutely love it. Very VERY few products make an initial impressive on me ; I almost always have to wait at least a week before I can tell whether or not I like the product. However, this cleansing balm will leave your skin feeling insanelyyy soft. It really does an amazing job at removing the sebum and spf off my face and giving me a soft texture, something I’ve always struggled with! Perfect for double cleansing
