I got this Wake Up Honey Eye Cream gifted by Farmacy Beauty and I cannot thank enough.  The bottle is just perfect and so cute. It is just perfect to fit anywhere. The cream is so smooth and easy to apply. It is not heavy at all. It blends very well. I have been using it for weeks now and I can see the improvement. I apply under eye before make up and it gives a good radiant look. It has vitamin C that helps to reduce dark circle which is the best thing. It is definitely helping my puffy eyes. I recommend this to everyone. Awesome for eyes
