Oh so gentle! These types of serums can be hit or miss on my sensitive skin. I started with a little bit 3 times a week. I really make sure to moisturize with both a face cream and oil on days when I use this. It really makes my skin look plump! I love the pump dispenser and the way my skin has been looking since incorporating this serum in my routine. nan
