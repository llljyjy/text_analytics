Farmacy’s Honey Halo Veramide Moisterizer is a must for the upcoming winter months! I was gifted by Farmacy Beauty this moisturizer. Even just protecting your skin with ceramides from the environment on a daily basis is essential and I’m so glad they formulated this! No white cast after application. It soaks into my skin immediately. The scent isn’t overpowering and is subtle. This formula is so silky it glides on so silky. I would definitely recommend this product as my skin has improved within days! It works great for my skin!
