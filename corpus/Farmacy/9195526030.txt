I am such a fan of farmacy beauty in general, everything I have tried out from this brand has been amazing. This is a new launch from farmacy beauty and I am loving it a lot so far. 10% vitamin C is going to be so good for my hyperpigmentation and it feels so gentle on the skin, doesn’t feel sticky at all. Also, I absolutely love the fact that it’s fragrance free and oil free. I would re purchase for sure. Gifted by farmacy beauty btw. Another hit from Farmacy!!
