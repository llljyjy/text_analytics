It’s okay… wanted to like it as much as the “Green Clean”, since it’s suppose to be better for sensitive skin, but it just doesn’t seem to work as well. Doesn’t remove makeup or wash off as easily. Used all of the original Green Clean with no problems, so I’ll go back to that once this is through. GC also has a heavenly smell that I’m missing. I guess fragrance isn’t always bad .. lol Original Is Better
