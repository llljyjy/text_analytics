I have to say I didn’t think a cleansing balm would make or break my skin care routine but it does. I ran out awhile back and was stubborn about not ordering more, well everything else I have tried has not come close to removing my makeup as well as this has. I had to purchase a new tub as I was having breakouts from my makeup not being removed as well anymore. Can’t wait till my new tub comes in and I can know my makeup is coming off 100% of the time again Must have, great for sensitive skin
