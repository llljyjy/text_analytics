This mask came as a recommendation from a tiktoker and since I have no self control, I tried it. Well, I was not disappointed! I am big on hydration and moisturizing so trying this was a no brainer. I love the ritual of applying, rubbing it in and watching it turn white, letting it warm my face, and gently removing it. I think it gives my face a nice plumpness before I apply HA & moisturizer. Iâ€™ll be buying the full size next love the warming effects
