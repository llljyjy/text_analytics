I really had no expectations when I purchased this. I had used up my second bottle of Paula’s Choice Vitamin C and figured I’d try something new. Because this is less concentrated (15% vs 10%) I was just hoping it wouldn’t make my skin worse. Much to my surprise after one month of usage my skin looks more healthy. It’s nothing super dramatic but I do notice my skin feeling smoother and looking brighter. This has definitely earned a spot in my rotation. Surprisingly effective
