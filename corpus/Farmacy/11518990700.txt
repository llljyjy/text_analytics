i love this moisturizer. at first, i wasn’t the biggest fan but i think i just wasn’t applying enough. i use about a dime and a half sized amount and the moisturizing is so thick and my skin really just drinks it up. i wear this day and night and it looks great under makeup/absorbs into my skin really well! i love the packaging and the spatula as well and i will definitely be repurchasing! nan
