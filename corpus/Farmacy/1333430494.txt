Received this Honey Halo ceramide moisturizer as a 100 pt perk. Although it is rich, it is not heavy, felt cool on the skin and absorbed well.  I was surprised at how much I looked forward to using it again!  I already have a full arsenal of quality creams for the winter and spring for that matter but I plan to purchase a larger size of this! nan
