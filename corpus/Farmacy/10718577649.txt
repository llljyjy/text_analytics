I was gifted by Farmacy Beauty this Wake up Honey cream as a free gift in exchange for my honest opinion. It is a nice thick cream with easy gliding consistency. It is enriched with Vitamin C which has brightening effect. Peptides help in smoothening out wrinkles and fine lines. It does not have a strong fragrance and is super light in color. I used it for a week and it is too soon to notice a difference in dark circles but I like this cream already. Bee hive shaped eye cream
