Honestly I was a little bit skeptical because of the price but I definitely recommend it. I have really dry skin that gets very oily due to overproduction if I don’t have a really strong moisturizer. It absorbs right into your skin and doesn’t leave it thirsty at all. You’ll wake up super moisturized. I have struggled finding a moisturizer that was thick enough to penetrate my dry skin. I am so glad that I found this! I will be sticking with it and buying the larger version as it is really working with my skin. Dry skin no more!
