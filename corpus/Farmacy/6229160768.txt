Honey Halo is a rich moisturizer that’s thick, creamy with a delightful honeycomb scent. As a person who loves honey, this is a big bonus! It worked well for my dry skin and help manage the small flakes around my nose which lighter moisturizers don’t help with. Once I use up my collection of moisturizers, this will be a top contender for repurchase. Gifted by Farmacy Beauty. nan
