This was gifted by Farmacy beauty for my honest opinion.  I’ve been using Farmacy products for 3 years and have loved everything I’ve tried. Was excited to try this new eye cream. The ingredients are fantastic. The smell is very light and pleasant. The consistency is light. The texture is creamy. Since you only need a little bit this jar should last you a while. It absorbs nicely. Feels like it melts in to the skin. I’ve been using this product for two weeks now. It definitely helps with the puffiness around the eyes. And makes the skin much more radiant. I don’t have many wrinkles under my eyes but it notice it does plump the areas where I have a slight line. Which is nice. It’s also hydrating which is great this time of year when my skin is so dry. I’m excited to see what continued use does but so far I would definitely recommend. nan
