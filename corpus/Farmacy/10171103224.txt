After using this product, I will say it is non irritating and lightweight. I haven’t experienced breakouts or contact dermatitis. However the application did bother me. This serum does not soak in at all. It takes hours to soak in and even after that I’d still feel an oily/watery feel. I know most serums leave a hydrating feel, but by the time I apply my moisturizer on top of the vitamin c I feel like I’ve removed/or moved away the product. I like the idea of this vitamin C but not impressed. And yes the serum does smell like barbecue but it goes away after a while. Not for me
