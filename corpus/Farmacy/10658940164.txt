Farmacy never disappoints so I was so excited to try this serum!(gifted by Farmacy Beauty) I’m enjoying it so far, it has a light, pleasant smell and spreads easily on the face. Because of its waterless nature, it does feel a bit oily but this doesn’t bother me. It also layers quite well! lovely vit c serum
