I always love the products I’ve tried from far Macy and this one is no different. I received this complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. My skin this winter has been texure-y, dull, and somehow oily? Idk it’s been a bad mix and I don’t want to exfoliate everyday since my face tends to get really red so I started to try this at night and I’ve noticed a huge difference in my skins texture and feel! I just look smoother and not as shiny! I’ve really loved this so far, I can’t wait to keep using it this winter! Perfect for my dull skin
