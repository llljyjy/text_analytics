It was gifted to me by Farmacy Beauty. This leave on mask improves the texture of skin, refines pores and strengthens the skinâ€™s moisture barrier. It contains 10% Niacinamide, 3% Panthenol and upcycled blueberry seed oil. I just apply it onto my skin after cleaning it at night. I really like the silky texture. It did not dry out my skin. It left my skin feeling soft, hydrates and gives my skin a glow. Definitely recommend this night mask. nan
