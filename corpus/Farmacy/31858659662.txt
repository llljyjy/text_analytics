This was gifted to me by Farmacy Beauty. I use retinol regularly since a year ago and have tried a couple of different ones until i stick to one that i love. This is a very good one. Smells nice. About the strength, if youâ€™re a beginner, start by mixing it with moisturizer. It is very nice texture and non sticky. nan
