I really like this new retinol that was gifted by Farmacy Beauty to me. I use retinols regularly and used this one 3 times a week paired with the Honey Halo moisturizer. I saw a difference in the softening of lines and overall glow of my skin. Most importantly, I had 0 irritations from it. I definitely recommend. Gentle but effective
