Is this good? Yes. Is it anything special? Not really. I actually found this to sometimes leave my skin feeling a liiitle but stripped making me not want to double cleanse (I have really dry skin). Love the scent, reminds me of the green lifesaver candies. But I just think itâ€™s outrageously expensive for what it is. overpriced
