I absolutely LOVE the Farmacy line! But this was just okay for me. It feels great and doesnâ€™t have an offensive scent, but it feels like it strips my skin just a little too much. I have oily skin with some dryness and this cleanser was no friend to my face. I will say that the other products I have from Farmacy are straight fire. Not bad but not great either
