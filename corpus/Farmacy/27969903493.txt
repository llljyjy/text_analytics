I have dry dehydrated skin that is also sensitive and so dry due to tretinoin. I was recommended this by a friend and I really cannot believe I waited as long as I have to try this. I have tried Tatcha, FAB, Dr. Jart, and LRP. Moisturizers tend to sit well with me for a few months but will eventually break me out non stop after the 6 month mark. This cream hasn’t done that and for that I am floored. I am extremely sad this is a limited edition size, as this jumbo size is so convenient, and the Green Clean Balm comes in this size as the standard! The regular size is way too small for a moisturizer. I have bought two Jumbos so that I don’t run out for a while, but I hope they make this value size permanent or else I don’t know if I would keep repurchasing and finishing smaller jars so quick—all and all, great ingredients, pricy but the best on the market. Keep the jumbo permanently PLEASE! BOUGHT TWO JUMBOS
