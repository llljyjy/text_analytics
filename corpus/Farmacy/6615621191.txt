It works! I’ve had dry skin my whole life and once I started using Tretinoin my HG moisturizer just wasn’t enough. I’ve tried everything from drugstore brands to luxury brands and I feel like I wasted so much time and money before finding this. It reduces the tight feeling in my face, doesn’t break me out or cause rashes/redness, absorbs easily, and doesn’t pill under SPF or makeup. I bought the trial size and it has lasted longer than expected so I highly recommend purchasing it if you’ve been unsure about trying this moisturizer. nan
