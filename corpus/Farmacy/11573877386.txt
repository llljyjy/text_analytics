I recently tried this after using drunk elephant c-firma for the last 5 years and I did not care for it at all. It felt super heavy and oily and never really settled in to my skin at all. If I had a lot of down time in the AM I may could make it work but def not something I can rush through a morning routine and layer products over it because it just felt so icky heavy. The smell didn’t bother me..that’s just how quality vit c serums smell there are no added fake orange scents. Had to return
