I don’t like many moisturizers but this is definitely the best one I have tried! Its great for normal skin because it won’t leave your skin looking or feeling greasy after you use it. The only thing that is kind of off putting is the smell because it smells like raw honey and I don’t really like that smell but it doesn’t have a super strong aroma so it isn’t that hard to move past it. It smells EXACTLY like burts bees original. Even though the smell isn’t my favorite i still like the product so I will definitely be repurchasing! nan
