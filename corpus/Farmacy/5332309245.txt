I wanted to love it sooo bad. I was in need of a daily moisturizer for dry, sensitive skin. I grabbed this based off the claims in the package. Let me say I LOVE this moisturizer! It was so good for my skin, and to find something that doesnâ€™t irritate my skin is rare these days! However I COULD NOT keep using it as the fragrance was so strong. Like, SO strong! No dramatics, it smelled so much of honey I was near sick every time I put it on. This would be such an amazing moisturizer if the fragrance could be taken out :( I wanted to love it
