Love Farmacy products everything I have tried is effective. This serum is potent and I have noticed a difference in texture so far.  Not fond of the scent as I’m applying but it doesn’t linger. I’m sure this serum could be used during the day but I prefer to use it at night. If you have sensitive skin I suggest to try in a small area to test first as this serum could irritate skin due to its potency.Gifted by Farmacy in exchange for my honest opinion. nan
