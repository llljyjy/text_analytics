Oh my god when I tell you guys that this serum is AMAZING for oily/acne prone skin I mean it! It’s formula and ingredients help target dark spots and hyperpigmentation. I love how a little goes a long way and how quickly it absorbs into my skin. This serum also layered really well with the rest of my skincare which was a huge bonus for me. Definitely recommend if you’re looking for a hydrating serum that works! Gifted by Farmacy beauty but thoughts are my own nan
