This Vitamin A Retinol Serum by Farmacy is amazing for my skin! I love incorporating retinol in my skincare regimen and this is the perfect way to do this. The serum is light weight, absorbs easily, and contains clean ingredients. I am so passionate about sustainable and clean products that this product definitely marked every box when it came to selecting a great skincare product. This product is paraben free, formaldehyde free, synthetic fragrance free, phhalate free, mineral oil free, and cruelty free! A little goes a long way with this and with itâ€™s suggested use of 1-3 times per week the bottle will defintely be lasting me awhile! I will definitely be exploring what other products Farmacy has to offer. This product was gifted to me by Farmacy in exchange for my honest review. Great addition of Retinol to my PM skincare
