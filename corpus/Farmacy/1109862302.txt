I like the package and it doesn’t have fragrance which I appreciate for a product like this. It has a light lotion texture and I enjoyed the immediate feel of it on the skin. I’ve used this product for 2 weeks and my issue was that I went from zero breakouts(in almost a year) to 2 cyst like breakouts on my chin. I understand that retinol (I’ve used it in all its forms before) can cause breakouts at first, but this was very intense, so I am on the fence if I should continue to use this product or not. It cause mild dryness on the top layer of my skin, but that was to be expected and easy to work around by using every other day.This product was gifted by Farmacy Beauty. Broke me out
