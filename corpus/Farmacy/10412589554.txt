Farmacy is such a great brand so I was so excited for this eye cream! I was gifted this eye cream, complimentary from Farmacy. It comes in this super cute little honeycomb shaped jar and has a nice, not thick, not too thin consistency. Very little is need and it absorbs quickly and easily. After only a week of use I saw for sure evening/alleviating of dark circles. Itâ€™s a really great eye cream and I will forward continue to use! It's so good!
