Wanted to like this product, but it caused me to breakout all over my face. I went away for a few days and didnâ€™t bring this with me and my skin cleared up, but as soon as I came back and used this one time I was full of breakouts again. Also has a slightly unpleasant meat smell. I have friends who really like this so it can be hit or miss! nan
