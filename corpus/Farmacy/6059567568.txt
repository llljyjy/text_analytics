I didn’t believe the hype. I usually hate oil or oil based makeup remover because they either cause blurry vision and hard to remove completely, or they make my eyes sensitive or dry out my skin. For really stubborn eye makeup (like urban decay 24/7 eyeliner and Armani waterproof mascara)I’ve tried Lancôme eye biphase, channel eye makeup remover, bobbi brown’s, mary kay, Garnier micellar water, bioderma Michelle water, and tatcha makeup remover oil. Nothing worked as wonderfully as this one. No redness, no dryness, and makeup melts instantly so no too much rubbing. It goes away with water, or you can wipe it away. I will say make sure you really wash it off, which you can actually do that unlike cold cream… otherwise, you will have blurry vision. I only made that mistake the first time I used it. Now I only open my eyes if I feel complete clean when touching my eyelids. Trust me, this is The One. Look no further. Trust your friendly neighborhood perfectionist makeup maniac. P.S you don’t need double clean with this, but if you are ocd like me, double clean (follow up) with a regular face wash.Oh and I have combo acne prone fair skin. i was skeptical but now I am a believer
