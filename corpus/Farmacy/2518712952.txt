This Vitamin C Serum is unlike any I have ever tried before. It has a texture very similar to a dry oil and absorbs almost instantly onto the skin. It doesn’t leave a tacky or sticky feeling on the skin which is amazing. It has almost no scent and it has given my skin a radiance like no other. Possibly the BEST Vitamin C serum I’ve ever tried. Gifted by Farmacy Beauty but true love is all mine! Don’t sleep on this one!
