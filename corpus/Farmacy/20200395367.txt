Like all the Farmacy products I’ve tried, I loved this one. It acts like a cleansing balm more then a cleanser so I use this as my first cleanse to take makeup off. While it says it’s oil free, it is so gentle on the skin, and the scent is divine without being super strong. I will definitely repurchase after I’ve emptied this! It’s now a staple in my bathroom! Cleansing balm in a tube!
