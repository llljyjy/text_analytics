I enjoy a night mask and this one from farmacy beauty is no different. I like the small applicator included so you donâ€™t contaminate the formula and others can try it out as well. Apply sparingly as this does need to be a thin layer and feels gel like if applied too thick. I suggest rubbing in the excess after wearing for about 5 minutes.  I did wake up to soft skin and a healthy glow, evened skin tone too which was a plus! nan
