If I could give zero stars for the new formula I would. The previous formula was my holy grail of sunscreen. I would have continued using it forever, it was THAT GOOD. Now it’s a horrible, drying, white cast leaving typical zinc oxide sunscreen. I’m so disappointed that I have to find a new sunscreen. I cannot fathom why they changed from their amazing previous formula to this. nan
