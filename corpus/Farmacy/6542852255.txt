If you have sensitive skin avoid this at all costs.  I am no new two pharmacy products and have a few in my arsenal.  I was excited to try this product with my latest order. I put it on my face before bed last night and woke up to a red, swollen, itchy, pimply face. This is so upsetting. This is supposed to be from a clean brand. This should have never happened. What sucks is that I have guests and events that I need to dress up and now my face ruins it all.   Toss in the trash.   This make me reconsider going hundred percent clean and organic.  DONT BUY THIS! Swelling mask!
