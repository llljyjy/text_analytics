My first vit c serum, had better ones in mind but i read 10% is a good place to start. With vit e and other ingredients wanted to try this one. I had no side effects using this one. Just a bit of tingling which says the serum is working. Will layer it with moisturizer and sun screen and all is good. Will definitely repurchase it. For starters before going to expensive stuff try this one, nothing to loose. Good product for decent price to beginners
