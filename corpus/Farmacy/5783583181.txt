I received this product complimentary from Farmacy Beauty - I am sharing my honest experience after using this product. I have been using Retinol for quite some time now, I like to think I am heading towards the advanced level when it comes to this ingredient. I like the 1% VITAMIN A RETINOL SERUM - it has a lightweight formula and no particular smell. I have always used a “sandwich“ routine when it comes to my nightly Retinol products, so I start with a hydrating toner, following up my Filling Good Serum, then this Retinol Serum, then the Honey Halo moisturizer (all products from the same brand) and this routine has been working great for my sensitive combo skin. I have noticed that this a gentle Retinol which it would make it great for beginners and those with sensitive skin. I did not experience any signs of irritation, nor pilling afterwards and my skin smoother and brighter. Great Retinol Serum
