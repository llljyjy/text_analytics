I’m in my late 40’s and have sensitive skin. I’m also very active outdoors, so that means lots of sweat and sunscreen in the summer. I alternate using Farmacy’s Cleansing Balm and the Whipped Greens Oil-Free Foaming Cleanser. Sometimes I’ll combine them as a two-step routine when I’m especially grimy after a long run or bike ride. I love the scent, and its gentle foaming action is effective without stripping my skin. It removes the sunscreen, sweat and road dirt with ease but without causing dryness or irritation. Love it! One of my two go-to summer cleaners!
