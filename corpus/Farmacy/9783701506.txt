I have tried many different moisturizers for my dry skin and this is by far the best one. It hydrated my skin and smoothed out my forehead wrinkles, and it left my skin feeling buttery smooth after in a good way, which no other moisturizer has done for my dry sensitive skin before. I have also layered makeup on top of this and it causes no pilling or other issues. Itâ€™s truly absolutely amazing. I will repurchase till the end of time. My All Time Favorite!
