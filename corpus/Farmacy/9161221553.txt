I was really excited to try this as I had been using CeraVe previously for my retinol and decided to try a higher end one and decided on this one after reading the reviews. However I think as it’s new and the reviews are mostly incentivized so far, I sadly cannot recommend this product. I did not care for the stale smell (obviously don’t want anything with a strong fragrance at all) but my first impression was the stale smell it gave off. Also, the coverage is not a lot at all and I need to use twice as much from what I’m used to. After a week my bottle already feels close to empty. Given it’s price I’m giving it one star it’s a no from me :(
