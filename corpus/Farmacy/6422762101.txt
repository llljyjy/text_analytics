Absolutely I’m love with this moisturizer!It has a wonderful gel-cream texture where it feels luxurious and yet not too rich. I wear it at night and even after one application my skin feels so much plumper and softer, as if I did a very nourishing mask. Bonus point: even my melasma spots are not as rough and dry as they were after using it, so I definitely recommend it to anyone who’s looking for a staple moisturizer. It’s very good under makeup too, though I mainly only use it at night. Overall would definitely recommend! nan
