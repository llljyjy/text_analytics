Having oily to normal skin I usually prefer more lightweight moisturizers but love using more rich options like this one on colder months when my skin is in need of extra hydration. Honey Halo is deeply nourishing and smells exactly like honey - so delicious! It doesn’t feel heavy or greasy and doesn’t break me out. I received this cream complimentary from Farmacy Beauty and really enjoy using it. Winter must have!
