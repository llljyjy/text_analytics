So first off, some reviews are saying that this gave them a rash. 10% niacinamide is a high concentration and is just too much for some. It’s a great ingredient though so don’t let that dissuade you, just look for 5% or less.Now onto this specific item, it is incredible. I got a trial size and after three days I swear I’m seeing a reduction in fine lines and crows feet. I know that at minimal you should expect to use a product 2 months before you notice a difference but this was phenomenal. The texture is lovely and it absorbed quickly. holy grail
