I received this complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. So far when I used it I do notice my under eyes looking brighter. It hasn’t been a long term effect yet but only been using a couple of weeks.  It is brighter but haven’t noticed the dark circles disappearing yet.  So I would get this if you are looking more for a hydrating, brightening cream.  My mom has tried this as well and said it has been helping with her puffiness.  I do like applying it before putting color corrector on and feel it is a good combination to help with the dark circles. It is a very light cream. No scent. Very hydrating.
