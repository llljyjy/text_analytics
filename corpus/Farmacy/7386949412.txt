This product was gifted by Farmacy beauty! I am a huge fan of retinol serums but I really liked this one because it felt gentle and nourishing, unlike other retinols which can leave you feeling dry. I use retinol to combat hyperpigmentation and in the time I’ve used this I’ve noticed a post acne hyperpigmentation fading! I really like this and will continue to use to see more results!
