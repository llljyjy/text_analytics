I’ve used this for the last couple of years. It’s good for acne-prone skin as long as you follow up with a cleanser. It’s also dermatitis and eczema-friendly which is hard to find! Not sure why some people are complaining about the smell. It’s a very mild scent (smells almost natural). I think this is the only makeup balm that doesn’t break out my skin or worsen my eczema tbh. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Also, the 100ml will last me nearly 9 months:) A little goes a long way (yes, even with a full face) ECZEMA, DERMATITIS, AND ACNE FRIENDLY!
