This was a complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. When I first got this product I was very excited it was so thick and creamy and felt like it would be very nice. I didn’t really see this doing anything for my dry skin. I noticed the product flaked off a lot and didn’t fully absorb into my skin. I tried exfoliating before using it but it’s just not for my dry skin. nan
