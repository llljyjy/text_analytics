I received this product complimentary from Farmacy. This is really nice niacinamide mask! Even though the application isn’t the most pleasant (it feels a bit silicone-y), I woke up every morning with skin that looked and felt less textured. I’m actually a little amazed because not many products have had such visible overnight results before. A thin layer is enough, otherwise it may feel a bit uncomfortable. surprising overnight results!
