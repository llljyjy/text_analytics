I have combination skin (oily in the T zone & very dry on the outskirts) that is very acne prone. After struggling with acne since middle school, I am in my mid 20s and finally found a skin routine that keeps my skin clear. However, I have struggled to find a moisturizer that doesn’t break me out immediately. This is the first one that has accomplished that!
