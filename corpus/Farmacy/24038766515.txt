This vitamin C serum is gifted by Farmacy Beauty. I haven’t used other vitamin C serum product so this one is very different from other serum I used before. The texture is quite oily and feels greasy. You have to wait quite some time for it to fully absorb. I have used it for a few days and haven’t noticed much change so far. nan
