Like most, I’m so tired and lazy to take off my makeup at the end of the day but it must be done. My dermatologist sister has scolded me on using wipes since none are good for your face. This balm has actually made taking off makeup fun! It’s weird at first but now I love it and I always use it to take off my makeup and it takes everything off the first wash. There is no grease leftover either but I still use a cleanser after. nan
