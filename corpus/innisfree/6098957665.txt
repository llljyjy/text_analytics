Love this SPF!  I have oily-leaning, acne-prone skin and am in my early 30s.  I believe this is the best value SPF you can buy at Sephora!  K-beauty SPFs are my absolute favorite - I usually lean toward more lightweight, watery consistency SPFs, but this one is a bit different.  The texture is a bit thicker, more lotion-like, but donâ€™t let that scare you off!  It is not too heavy for my skin type, works very well under makeup, and has protected my skin even on very sunny SoCal days. I have never had any break out issues with this products either.  If you want to try an affordable K-beauty SPF that you can find in-store at Sephora, this is the perfect product to snag - I think this could work for all skin types! Love for my oily skin!
