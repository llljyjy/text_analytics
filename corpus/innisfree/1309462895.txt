I received this moisturizer through Topbox Circle for free to try out in exchange for my honest review. I love how hydrating this product is, especially with the dry cold winter weather here now. It absorbs nicely and keeps my skin well moisturized while leaving it soft, smooth and soothed. It has a light scent which is also quite pleasing. Definitely recommend it, and will purchase in future. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Provides excellent hydration!
