This serum is divine! At first I thought it was too light. HA serums I have used in the past have been more jelly or viscous so I assumed that is how they all should be. But after a few uses, I began to appreciate how light it was. It works perfectly with both of the moisturizers that I use (Laneige water bank cream and dr jart ceramidin). I apply the tower 28 sos spray before the serum and all products work like a charm. My skin looks and feels supple without and sticky or tackiness. TRY IT!
