This is just one of the many things I love by innisfree! My skin drinks this up leaving it hydrated, bouncy and supple without being greasy or heavy. I love the barrier relief and protection ingredients like ceramide, the squalane also I a favorite this ingredient always leaves the best hydration and moisture! Overall my skin is left feeling and looking itâ€™s best every time I use this. Hydrating with being oily!
