I received this as a #freeproduct with #trywithtopboxThe cream has a lovely, gentle and faint scent with a very light texture that soaks into the skin completely and doesnâ€™t leave any shine or residue. It makes my skin look dewey and glowing immediately after application. My skin was super dry around my nose and upper lip because I had been blowing my nose more often. This cream does not provide enough moisture for my skin, especially during the dry winter weather when I am not even leaving my home for the outdoors. Maybe due to the hyaluronic acid, it made my skin texture more dry and rough so I had to stop using it every day. This cream is probably better suited for me in the spring or summer but needs to be supplemented with heavier creams if I want moisture/hydration. The product comes in a heavy, glass-like container which makes it look like there should be more product inside. At least it has a flat circular top so you can stack something ontop of it. nan
