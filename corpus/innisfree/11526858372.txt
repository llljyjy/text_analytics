I struggle with acne and this is one of the few things that helps me clear my breakouts. I always use this two days before i have a gathering where I want my skin to look nice to help clean up my face. It is also really nice because it does not dry out like most mug masks and has a nice fresh feeling after you rinse it off. Refreshing to use- helps my acne
