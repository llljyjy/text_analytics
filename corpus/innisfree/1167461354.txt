I’ve purchased the clay masks from Glamglow, Youth to the People, Caudalie, FAB, PTR, Philosophy and Sephora Collection. I’ve found some good ones, but THIS IS IT. My holy grail! I like that it takes longer to dry and doesn’t leave your face feeling like a tight desert. However, it still successfully pulls out all my oil and impurities. I use it before showering (much easier to rinse off), then cleanse with the indie lee Brightening cleanser (also my holy grail) and my Foreo. I then usually follow with the Paula’s choice BHA solution, one of my various serums with some of the Ordinary Niacinamide powder, and then a moisturizer with 2-3 drops of the Ordinary Mandelic Acid mixed in. Dropping these products in here too because I also love them! Get this mask! I. love. this. mask.
