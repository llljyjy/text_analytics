Really like this moisturizer. My favourite part is the smell - very light, natural, not overpowering. The cream itself definitely hydrates my skin and keeps it feeling hydrated for hours. Iâ€™ve been using it morning and night, and really like how the cream feels on my skin and how it isnt greasy feeling. Also love the glass container it comes it and how it can be recycled. Thank you topbox  #freeproduct. love the smell!
