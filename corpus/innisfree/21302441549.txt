I find this product very good for my skin. I have a very dry sking and which is why i am very picky when it is about skincare and makeup. I’ve heard many good things about the Innesfree cherry blossom dewy glow facial Moisturizer especially good reviews for dry and sensitive skin like mine. I tried it for a week and so far I’m loving it. It doesn’t make my skin red and very moisturizing as well. It soaks into my skin very quicky and hydrates it as well. So far so good. love it
