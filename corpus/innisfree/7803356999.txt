I agree with the majority of their reviews here and that this cream is pretty basic and not very moisturizing. The dewiness isn’t different than with a regular moisturizer and it doesn’t really last once the water in this cream evaporates off your face. I think if you have oily skin this would be good but you definitely cannot use this on its own especially in the winter I would definitely put something on top of it. It’s fun to put on and actually I would use it as a makeup primer if anything. It doesn’t have too many other claims other than being hydrating and I agree it’s a pretty basic gel moisturizer. I would prefer if it was fragrance free. Really meh tbh...pass.
