I’m on my third bottle and loving it! I found it so hard to find an affordable sunscreen that doesn’t leave a white cast on my skin and doesn’t make me super oily. This is great. Checks all the boxes. Also, I’m not usually a fan of fragrances but this one has a subtle soothing green tea scent. A great find!
