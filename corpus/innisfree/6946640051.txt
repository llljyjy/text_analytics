I have combination skin, so I tend to use a gel type moisturizer when the weather starts to warm up. We have been having Spring weather the last two weeks, so I have been using this moisturizer a ton. I absolutely love it! It provides so much hydration, but it doesnâ€™t make my skin look greasy at all. I love how it looks under foundation, absolutely no pilling. My skin has been glowing since adding this to my AM routine, and I have been getting so many compliments! I 100% recommend this if you have combination or oily skin. Innisfree gifted me this moisturizer, all opinions are my own. Amazing hydration and glowing skin
