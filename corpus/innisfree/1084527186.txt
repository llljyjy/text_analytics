I got to try for my honest opinion. #trywithtopbox. I have been using it for a few weeks and my skin loves it. Especially in their dry cold air we have. Itâ€™s light and my skin just absorbs it. Scent it light. Feels light on skin. It will definitely be the moisturizer I use this winter. Great for dry skin.
