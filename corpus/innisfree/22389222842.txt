LOVE this sunscreen! It smells good and spreads so nicely over the face. It never pills with my other skincare & makeup, and doesn’t make my face greasy. I would say that there’s no white cast, as it blends nicely, but I do have fair skin so I’m not entirely sure. It doesn’t break me out like other sunscreens. The price is a plus too! My bestie
