Been using this mask for over a month now and overall it’s a good clay mask. It definitely minimizes the appearance of my pores. I also love the fact that you don’t need too much to apply on your face. So the jar will definitely last you a while. My only con with the mask is that  I experienced some very small breakouts the next day each time I use it. Nothing insane but it’s still annoying that it happens. I wouldn’t recommend this mask to anyone with acne prone skin or anyone currently experiencing high levels of breakouts. But overall it’s a good clay mask just not a must-have. nan
