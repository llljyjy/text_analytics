Best moisturizer I have used from Sephora! I have very sensitive skin and often lotions can create redness and irritation. Love that this one is light weight and clear. Thicker white creams clog my pores and I haven’t had that issue with this moisturizer. My skin feels soft and has a nice glow.After using this consistently for a month I’ve received many compliments on my skin. Great for sensitive skin and my redness is reduced and complexion is more even. Will be repurchasing! 10/10 recommend this moisturizer. buy this for glowing skin!
