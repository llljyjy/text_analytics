I adore this product. Did it change my life, no but does it feel great on my skin absolutely. I have sensitive skin and this doesn’t make me turn red, I don’t gag out from fragrance. It’s easy to wash off and leaves my skin feeling refreshed. You get multiple uses out of it. It’s a staple in my home. nan
