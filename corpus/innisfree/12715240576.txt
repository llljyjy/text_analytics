I truly cannot say enough good things about this sunscreen. First off- the price. That alone is enough to give it 5 stars. Itâ€™s hard to buy anything this good for $15 in Sephora, but this does the job. I have naturally oily skin and even i think this gives me a beautiful glows, dewy finish. Definitely always keep this in stock!! A staple!
