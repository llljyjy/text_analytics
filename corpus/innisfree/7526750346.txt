$Gifted by innisfree. Obviously, your mileage may vary with your individual skin, but I found this product to be very moisturizing and most importantly, not irritating to sensitive skin. The product is clear, very light like a gel, almost, with no discernible fragrance. It applies and melts into the skin easily, and since it has a gel-like consistency, it is especially good for delicate areas like the skin around the eye, it can be applied very lightly and gently and will still be absorbed with minimal manual application. nan
