I have tried many sunscreens looking specifically for the following: no white cast, no product residue, no skin irritation, healthy hydrated glow. Sunscreen use is a complicated issue for me as I pretty much break out with anything too strong and strong scented. I struggle with contact dermatitis and dry skin; this sunscreen has worked wonders for me. After my first application I expected the worst, however it was comforting as the there is little to no scent, no irritation, and a natural finish. I have been consistently applying this sunscreen and leftovers on my hands. Wonderful sunscreen &&â€™ I will definitely be purchasing again. Excellent Sunscreen
