new favorite everyday product !! its the perfect texture, creamy but not too heavy, easy to rub in and not too oily. last week i was outside all day and i had applied this to my face and i didnt put any sunscreen on my body (silly i know) and my arms were literally bright red sunburnt and my face was completely untouched thanks to this product ! also this did not make me break out and im acne-prone the best sunscreen !!
