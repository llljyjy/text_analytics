I got this product in the complete innisfree green tea set and enjoy it. It definitely helps plump and hydrate my combo skin so I like to include this in my AM routine. I will likely repurchase this once I finish, though I will be keeping an eye out for other hyaluronic acid serums. The problem I have with this one is the heavy fragrance which is standard for this line. It is a nice scent but it is very strong and once in a while I do smell a little alcohol; that being said, I donâ€™t know how well suited this would be for sensitive skin. The consistency of this serum is also very runny, not as viscous as other serums which makes it feel as if the product may not be absorbing well into the skin. Great serum with some qualms
