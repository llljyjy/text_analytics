For reference, my skin: combo/oily, some rosacea, some adult acne, little makeupI typically use “basic“ cleaners since I tend to wash my face frequently (I work out and sweat a lot...) and don’t wear much make up. This cleanser provides a nice, thorough clean without stripping. It does have a “jammy“ texture. It foams a bit, but has a unique way of sticking to your skin almost like jello (but not in a sticky way, I promise). I feel like this provides a deeper clean since it seems to stay on the skin a lot better than other basic gel cleansers. However, it does take a second to rinse off because of that (I like to use it in the shower for that reason). I haven’t noticed a “dewy“ glow after using it as the name suggests, but it certainly doesn’t strip the skin at all. I can’t attest to its ability to remove foundation since I don’t wear any, but it does a good job of removing mascara (and doesn’t irritate the eyes in doing so). Overall, I’ve enjoyed it. Good go-to!
