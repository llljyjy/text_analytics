This is my favorite sunscreen of the ones I’ve tried. I have dry skin, sensitive eyes, and skin that is sometimes reactive. This sunscreen doesn’t irritate any of my issues. It goes on nicely, is hydrating, and works well over my skincare and under my make-up. It doesn’t have a strong scent at all, and it really just glides nicely on the skin. It also completely sinks in once completely applied and doesn’t leave a white cast for me at all. I also think the price is fair for the size and amount that you get. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a sunscreen. Favorite sunscreen thus far!
