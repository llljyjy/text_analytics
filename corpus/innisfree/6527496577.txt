This sunscreen has a nice feel on the skin and layers well under makeup but it wasn’t strong  enough for me. I’m pretty pale and this product doesn’t have enough spf to keep my face from getting a little burned. I think if you are able to reapply more frequently it might work. Nice feeling, not great on pale skin
