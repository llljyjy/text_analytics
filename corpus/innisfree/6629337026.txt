Never going back. Just purchased my second one. You CANNOT beat this price. I switched from Super Goop, and like I said... I’m never going back! I would also like to note that I have extremely sensitive eyes. And everything usually burns them, resulting in me rubbing them raw. This doesn’t do that. Super gentle. From what I understand, this is also good ingredients. Hoping at least! I want that SPF protection lol. you won't regret it!
