I’ve used it for a couple of weeks. Cons 1. Good for acne prone and ok for sensitive skin 2. Doesn’t feel greasy and after it sets in, gives a non greasy “glow” that doesn’t look bad 3. Good cost and good hydration 4. No cast Cons 1.  smells like drugstore sunscreen (at first I wondered if it was just drugstore sunscreen with nice packaging  2. Could use some more nutrition for skin 3. Chemical sunscreen Pros and cons
