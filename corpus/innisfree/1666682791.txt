I had the opportunity to try innisfree Green Tea Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Moisturizer as a #freeproduct to review, through #trywithtopbox. Hands down, I’m in love with this moisturizer. For starters, the packaging looks great and is easy to read. Plus it’s recyclable. The moisturizer is super smooth and light, almost like a whipped consistency. A little bit goes a long way on my skin, which makes me happy, as this is my new go to. It really leaves my skin feeling hydrated, and though it’s light, it gives me a solid base. I also love the scent - the green tea seed is there, but subtle. And taking a deep breath of it in is super calming! Love It! I’m in LOVE with this moisturizer!
