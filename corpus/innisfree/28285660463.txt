I had gotten a sample in the latest Sephora Hello bag. I was blown away with how pleased I was. Usually sunscreen feels heavy on my face and makes me feel like my pores are clogged up but this stuff is light as air. When I looked it up on Sephora to buy , I couldn’t believe it was only $15. Also it has a very light smell so I think this would be okay for sensitive skin no white cast this is one of the best sunscreens I’ve tried. FYI I was looking on the back of the sample box that Sephora gave me and to my surprise Amorepacific makes this brand It’s Not Unusual that expensive brands make less expensive brands they just don’t advertise it same ingredients different price yay
