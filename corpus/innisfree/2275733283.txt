This was gifted to me by Innisfree and I was so excited to finally try out this product, the wait was well worth it. The texture is so cooling and light on my skin. I love how quickly it absorbs and doesnâ€™t leave any sticky residue. The scent is also so nice and not overwhelming at all. My skin definitely feels moisturized after using this. Love this
