Honestly I do like this mask after a long week of wearing masks and just general breakouts! My nose has gotten a lot more blackheads from wearing a mask and when I use this face mask you can see all the oils bubbling up on my nose, I don’t know if it’s that but it definitely shows where it’s pulling from! I really do like this for blackheads for sure! nan
