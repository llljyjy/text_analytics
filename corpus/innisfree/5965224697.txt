I bought this in early January after a brand representative recommended this for the dryness I was experiencing that winter. It made my skin feel a little drier and the fragrance was too much for me to bear. However, I thought it would be better in the summer.Skip to the middle of summer where my skin was super oily… I still was not a huge fan. It helped with the oilynessbut my skin didn’t feel hydrated or moisturizer. The gel created a film which created the illusion of hydration.If the perfume wasn’t so strong that it irritated my skin, I would consider using this as a primer OVER a moisturizer. If you’re not so sensitive to smells, this might be a good primer for a dewy effect. NOT for Dry, Sensitive Skin
