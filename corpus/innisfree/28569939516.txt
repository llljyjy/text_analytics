Affordable and effective clay mask. I use on my face but also on- wait for it- my armpits. I use natural deodorant and kept reading recommendations online to use a clay mask on your armpits if your body isn’t ummm adjusting to natural deodorant- so I used this one and I noticed improvement. Everyone’s body is so different but I was floored how it helped with my (okay, I’ll just say it) B.O. I do love using it for its intended use too- on the face. It applies very smoothly and drys relatively quick. nan
