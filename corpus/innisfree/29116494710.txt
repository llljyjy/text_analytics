I honestly doubted this sunscreen for the longest time because for the price, it can’t be that good. And then I saw plenty of videos where people are hyping this product, so I finally gave it a try. I have an oily acne-prone skin and most sunscreen pile, but this one doesn’t. It works and is cheaper than a lot of good sunscreen, so it’s definitely a must try! Great for Oily Acne-Prone Skin
