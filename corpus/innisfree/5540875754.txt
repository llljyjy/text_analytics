I received this product for complimentary from Innisfree in exchange for my honest review. I am fairly sensitive to smells, especially ones that linger. However, the scent wasn’t too overpowering and it didn’t give me a headache. I used this at night and LOVED how soft and glowy it made my skin feel. I will definitely continue to use and will start using in the morning to make my skin look glowy all day long nan
