I have never used this brand until now. This serum is such an amazing product. What a great serum that it is hydrating. The consistency is just right, it is not too thick nor too runny.  It absorbs very fast and there is no sticky feel. This is perfect serum for the winter season as the weather is cold and dry. Usually during this month my face is extremely dry and flakey. This serum is so nourishing as well as hydrating. It gives my skin much needed hydration and nourishment that it needs. It smells so good but it also disappears shortly after application. Most importantly it has antioxidants and usually it is hard to find good products that has antioxidants in skincare. I did not experience any kind of irritation at all.  After application my skin feels hydrated, soft and supple. I will stick this to amazing serum for a very long time. Highly recommend nan
