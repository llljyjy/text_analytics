I’ve tried so many different brands, including tinted, that I was half tempted to give up and just not wear any. Happy to no longer be on the hunt for a better one than this. I have sensitive skin and it hasn’t caused a single breakout, my face feels so smooth after applying it, it is great under makeup or alone, and it doesn’t leave a white cast. The BEST face sunscreen!
