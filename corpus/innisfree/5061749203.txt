I received this as a #freeproduct with #trywithtopbox in exchange for an honest review. I have very acne prone skin so I’m really careful with what I use, especially since starting a retinol and dealing with a lot of sensitivity and dryness. I found that if I layer this product in between my serum and usual heavy face cream, it provides a really nice dose of hydration and soothes my skin. So far, after two weeks of use, it hasn’t broken me out, and I think I’ll end up repurchasing! A needed dose of hydration!
