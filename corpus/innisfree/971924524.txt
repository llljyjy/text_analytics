I used this mask before years ago with combination skin. The consistency was thicker and a little more chunky but it worked well for me. Fast forward to now, having Rosacea that’s become worse since the pandemic, I needed some relief.  For the last week I’ve had a horrible flare up on my cheek. Everytime I simply touched my face it hurt. I remembered this mask and found it at my local Sephora, used it at night and what a relief! The redness and burning went away and most of the bumps have gone down by 70%. If you deal with hypersensitive skin like I do definitely give this mask a try. Helps calm Rosacea.
