I have been searching for a gel moisturizer that doesnâ€™t feel heavy or greasy. This goes on so nice, it feels like my skin is taking a long cold drink of water! It leaves a beautiful dewy finish that delivers the same satisfaction as the Glow Recipe Niacinamide Dew Drops. My favourite ingredient is niacinamide, so that is a major bonus that it not only delivers the same look as the Glow Recipe dew drops, but also gives my skin the same benefits (and maybe even more!) Love that it is more affordable as well! nan
