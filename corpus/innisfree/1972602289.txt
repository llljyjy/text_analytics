I highly recommend this clay mask. I use it twice a week after a hot steamy shower which helps opens my pores. I have combo skin and prone to sebums, since using this my skin as felt so smooth and clear. Usually, in the summer my skin is more clogged but not this summer! i also like how it is easy to apply and already concocted, unlike the Amazonian clay mask from amazon that you have to mix into a paste yourself. Great for sebums and pores!
