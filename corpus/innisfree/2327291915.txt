Bought this about two months ago hoping it would add some needed hydration to my winter skin. The consistency is thin so it does add some extra hydration but definitely not enough for my skin. I assume this would work great for people that have normal to oily skin. My skin leans towards dry, especially during the winter. Normal overall.Would not recommend this for people with dry skin-- simply does not do enough. If you have a sensitive nose or don’t prefer scented products, this isn’t for you either as it does have a scent. Fresh but scented nonetheless. Not Very Hydrating
