i love this so much. it’s a nice gentle lather without stripping the skin. it leaves me feeling a little dewy while still making my face feel clean. i don’t use this to remove makeup so i don’t know how it would fare at that, but as a morning cleanse? i love it. light gentle lather without stripping
