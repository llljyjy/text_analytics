THE BEST FACE MASK I’VE EVER USED! I can’t say enough good things about this mask. I have sensitive, red, dry/combination skin. It isn’t drying, leaves your face smooth and refreshed, and you can actually see the mask working on the pores. My mom and boyfriend use it as well, good for all skin types. BEST MASK EVER
