I absolutely love innisfree and have purchased a number of their products so was excited to try this serum.  However, this serum did nothing for me…I used the 100 point sample every night and didn’t notice any change except I started to have some reaction to it on my neck.  Even if I didn’t have the reaction though I wouldn’t purchase just because it really does nothing. disappointing
