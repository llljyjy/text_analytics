The product felt fine and didn’t leave a white cast or break me out. It felt a little thick on my face but it seemed like it was going to be fine, especially for the price. Unfortunately, the sunscreen smell was really strong on this and it never went away. Ultimately, the smell was way too overwhelming and unpleasant, a problem I’ve had with innisfree face products before. FAB’s SPF 30 works much better for me. Not for sensitive noses
