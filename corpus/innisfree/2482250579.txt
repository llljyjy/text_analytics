I’ve actually tried this serum a few years ago as a mini and really liked it! It’s very hydrating but does have a bit of fragrance. I think it also has a thinner consistency compared to what I remember but I’m also not sure if they changed the formula recently. Nevertheless I would still recommend this to everyone. The larger serum size is worth! nan
