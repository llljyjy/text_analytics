this sunscreen has been my #1 since high school and i’m 21 now . it leaves no white cast, doesn’t feel greasy, doesn’t clog pores, and layers well with makeup! for $15 this sunscreen is seriously amazing and definitely worth the hype/money. i would recommend this sunscreen to those with acne/combo skin because it’s very hydrating but also gentle on the skin :) my ride or die for years
