This product is pure heaven. I’m always super hesitant when it comes to cleansers that aren’t a gentle milk or foam. I’ve had far too many so called “gentle” ones that seem to strip my skin of any moisture and irritate the heck out of it. This jelly cleanser was a chance buy and boy was it worth it! It smells dreamy, but it’s not nauseatingly strong. It’s gentle and lightweight, yet still cleans effectively. It even does a great job of taking my eye makeup off at the end of the night. I have nothing bad to say about this product and will continue to purchase again and again. Finally a gentle cleanser that smells amazing!
