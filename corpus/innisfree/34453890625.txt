After using this product for more than 2 continuous weeks, it hasn’t broken me out like other SPFs, it doesn’t leave a white cast, and it does have a slight scent but nothing crazy, it left my skin slightly shiny, which I don’t mind, it works great under makeup and does not peel. I have sensitive and reactive/acne-prone skin, this is a great non-expensive SPF that didn’t react with my skin, but remember what works for me might not work for you, everyone has different skin. nan
