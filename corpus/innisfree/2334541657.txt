It was gifted by Innisfree. And this is not the first time I’m using a product from this brand. I’ve used a purifying mask from them as well as a serum. Normally, I like to wear a gel moisturizer during the warmer months and add an oil on top. When I say that this moisturizer leaves my skin feeling so soft and moisturized , it’s understatement. When I’m done with this one, I might need to buy another one later on. I. Love. This. Product.
