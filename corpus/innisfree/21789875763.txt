To my fellow combo skin gals! I can barely use this mask once a week. I used this twice in a week and it has given me such flaky dry skin, which I have never seen in my life, breakouts all over the face, and redness. I’m so scared to use this just once a week because my skin hasn’t even healed yet. I guess now I have transitioned over from combo skin to dry skin! nan
