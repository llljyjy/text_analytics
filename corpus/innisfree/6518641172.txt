gifted by innisfree. I have used so many of their products in the past and I actually have a few that are in my daily routine. I have been on the hunt for a product just like this! I have acne prone and really sensitive skin so thick moisturizers are terrible for my skin and often clog my pores. I love this so much because it’s extremely light wait and the gel consistency makes it so refreshing! I’m obsessed! Such a good staple for acne/sensitive skin
