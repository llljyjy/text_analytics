This gel moisturizer works really well under makeup and worked with my oily skin. It’s super dewy and glowy without being greasy. One con is that it stays sticky on the skin so I would only wear this under makeup as a primer or I would need to layer some other cream moisturizer on top of it for my night time routine. It has the lightest touch of fragrance that’s almost undetectable. This product was gifted by innisfree Nice consistency and great primer under makeup
