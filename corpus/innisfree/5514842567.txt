Great everyday sunscreen for my acne prone skin (so hard to find). It definitely thins out/ wipes off after a couple hours, so you MUST reapply especially if you’re in the sun. I use tretinoin, so I can really tell because my face gets easily burned/ red if I don’t with this one. My other sunscreen adheres a lot better so I don’t experience this at all even without reapplying, but its also 4x the price and besides the protection and that it also doesn’t break me out, I don’t enjoy wearing it at all. This one is WAY more comfortable, wearable, affordable, and easy to reapply. So, I’m still giving 5 stars because you’re supposed to reapply sunscreen every 2 hours, but just a little heads up for those who aren’t diligent towards reapplication. Wonderful. Here’s one caveat…
