I received this #freeproduct with #trywithtopbox and I pleased to say this a wonderful facial cream. The product is scented and it’s a fragrance I LOVE. Most hydrating cream feel heavy or thick on your face but this does not do that. It leaves my skin feeling very fresh and light while still being moisturized. It’s great for the winters especially when my face feels quite dry. It leaves a nice shininess and glow to your face after applying. I highly recommend!!! Best hydrating facial cream!
