I’m a fan of their og green tea seed serum so I’m happy to try this new hyaluronic version of the seed serum. The texture is a lightweight gel that Absorbs quick and does not leave a sticky or greasy finish. It Leaves my face feeling very hydrated. I use this at night right after a hydrating toner or essence. nan
