This is an amazing sunscreen! It’s lightweight but gives good protection. I was recommended this by an esthetician friend and I’m so glad I listened. I’m a dark skin Black woman and this is perfect for my skin tone, it rubs right it like a moisturizer and doesn’t leave a white caste or film. It has a very faint scent but nothing overpowering. It smells like a typical sunscreen. Will definitely continue to repurchase! So good!
