I love this. I used to use the Glamglow Mask but tried this and love it. It’s much cheaper and I found the Glamglow mask would sometimes dry out my skin. I actually use this as a spot treatment on blemishes and it works so well. I’ll put it on around the house or before bed with a q-tip after my skincare routine. If a blemish is really bad, I’ll put this on first and do skincare around. great mask and spot treatment
