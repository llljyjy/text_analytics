I really like the feel of Innisfree! Like others have said, it feels like another layer of moisturizer & easily rubs in. A little goes a long way, which is also nice. My main concern is the fact that I’m not sure it provides as much sun protection as other sunscreens I’ve tried. I used Innisfree for the first time this past week, and my face ended up burnt. I never got sunburn on my face with my previous sunscreen, so was a bit surprised and disappointed. Planning to give it another try, but not sure if I’ll order again. nan
