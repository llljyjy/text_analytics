Good sunscreen and very creamy. Works well under my makeup which is mainly waterbased. I do notice i get shiny with this product but there is no whitecast on days with no makeup. I did get one small breakout  on my first 2 days with this but that usually comes with putting new products on your face. No more breakouts once your skin adjusts. Good with my sensitive skin
