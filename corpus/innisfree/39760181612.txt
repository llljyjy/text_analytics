First off, It Smells absolutely AMAZING !!! I received a sample of this moisturizer with a purchase  at Sephora and literally fell in love and had to have the full size !!! The consistency is thin and lightweight but very hydrating with no stickiness whatsoever which I love because I sleep on a satin pillowcase so this one is perfect. Ive been using it at night and it Absorbs into my skin like a dream without clogging my pores or leaving any type of oily residue and my skin has been feeling very plump and moisturized since using it. Ive also noticed that my makeup application has been a lot smoother  too so Im Happy !! Definitely recommend this one !! nan
