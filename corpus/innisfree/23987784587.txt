I love this one!!! After cleansing, I put three pumps on my face, and I can see an instant glow. I follow up with a thick moisturizer and oil, so this gives my very dry skin a bit of a boost in the dry winters, especially at night. In the summer I could probably use this by itself in the AM. Holy grail serum for dry skin!
