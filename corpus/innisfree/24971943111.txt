THIS IS GETTING POPULAR ON INSTAGRAM FOR A REASON! I was wondering when I picked it up why it wasn’t talked about, but it is LITERALLY amazing. On darker skin it does leave a slight white cast, but for the price and size, it is a fantastic alternative to other more expensive sunscreens. It isn’t thick or too runny, but it does take time to blend in. It doesn’t leave you greasy or feels heavy on your face. I personally love the price point, but nearly everything from their line is decently priced and good for sensitive skin. bravo
