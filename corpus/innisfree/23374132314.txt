Complimentary from Innisfree: I’m a longtime fan of Innisfree’s products so I’m not at all surprised that the Dewy Glow Jelly Cream was another hit for me! It’s extremely hydrating and lightweight with it’s jelly texture, giving you that glowy “glass-skin” look that everyone covets these days. Definitely recommend! Another Innisfree Hit!!!
