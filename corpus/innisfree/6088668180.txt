This product leaves my skin clean, fresh, and bright looking.  No dryness/tight feeling.  I always do a double cleanse but one night (I’m a flight attendat) I forgot my makeup remover and had to only use this; it did an amazing job at removing mascara (not as good as a double cleanse) but I was really surprised.  It has a nice jelly texture and it will lather up nicely if you add enough water.  It has a light seet candy like scent but it’s very faint.  I don’t think this will help with acne or anything else, but if you just need a gentle cleanser to clean your face and leave you looking fresh and awake this one is it. Fresh and Bright
