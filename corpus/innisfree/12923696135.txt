I have a combination skin and I was skeptical of this sunscreen at first because it felt little greasy but I was amazed by how good it made my skin look. This is one of the best sunscreens I ever used. Not so pricey but gets the work done so well. Glides smoothly and doesnâ€™t leave a white cast. LOVE THIS SUNSCREEN!
