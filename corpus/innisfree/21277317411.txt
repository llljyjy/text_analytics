I had the absolute pleasure of testing innisfree Green Tea Seed Hyaluronic Acid Cream for free as part of Topbox Circleâ€™s Product Review Program.  As the package boasted benefits such as providing lasting hydration and soothing skin, I had hopes that the claims would be true. Not only did I see and feel the benefits, but I also loved the fact that my skin never felt sticky, heavy, or greasy while the product was on.  After following application directions, I found the luxurious, absorbing texture of the cream wins hands down! As the lightly scented product contains Green Tea Tri-Biotics, I found my face looked more moisturized and invigorated day to day, during my trial. I did use it in the morning and night, cold, and with time, the ingredients allowed me to experience softer, more moisturized skin. I would most definitely recommend it to my friends and family, as I have now been confirmed to be a innisfree user myself.#gotitfree #trywithtopbox #freeproduct Wowza!
