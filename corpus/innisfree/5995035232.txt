HOLD up! I was wondering why I bought two sunscreens; I thought maybe this was one of those 100 point samples.. anyway, I bought it to try it and it only cost $15.00.  Just my first day and maybe I should wait before I review it, but I am honestly impressed.  This sunscreen makes you look dewy and makes you feel like you donâ€™t need additional makeup LOL.  There is no white cast left on your skin unlike other sunscreens.  I want to purchase more for gifts!! THE Best Sunscreen You'll EVER Try
