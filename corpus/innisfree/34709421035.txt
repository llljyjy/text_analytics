Nice mask for occasional use & a little goes a long way, especially if you apply it with a brush. But maybe not the ideal mask for me, now that I’m middle aged. I wish I had this in my 20s, when my skin was more acne-prone and inflamed, since it’s very soothing and thorough. Would recommend to others, but I may be in the market for something else when this pot runs out. nan
