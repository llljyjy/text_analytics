I was skeptical to use this product considering the lower price point, but it does an incredible job hydrating my skin! Take in consideration that I started using retinol a month ago Which dries out my skin even more, and it is currently -10 in my city! Love the texture of the product and you can easily apply a small quantity. It is a light product, never fees too heavy on my skin. Amazing product for skin dryness
