I have such sensitive skin and this is the only sunscreen that doesn’t break me out. It’s light on my skin and wears great under makeup. It has a bit of a sunscreen smell upon first application but once I sinks in the smell goes away. This doesn’t burn or irritate my eyes at all, even after going in the pool/ocean or sweating.The only con for me is I wish the SPF was a little higher, but I just reapply a bit more often and it’s fine.
