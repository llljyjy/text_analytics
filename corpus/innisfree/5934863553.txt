I’m surprised at how highly rated this is - it broke me out horribly :( and I didn’t even know my skin was capable of breaking out like that again, it’s been over 2 years! Had to return, maybe it’s my fault because it says this is for normal skin, and I have oily/acne-prone. Sad about it. Once I stopped using it for a few days to test out if this was the source my breakouts stopped forming new acne. Still gave an extra star for price point and I loved the consistency of the sunscreen (very lotion-like), it didn’t leave a white cast. Not for oily/acne-prone
