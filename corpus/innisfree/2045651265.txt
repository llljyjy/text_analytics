I received a sample of the InnisfreeGreen Tea Seed Hyaluronic Acid Cream.  This cream applies on smoothly with no sticky or oily residue.  My skin feels hydrated all day.  I am not a fan of heavily perfumed products, and I found this product to be lightly and pleasantly scented.  I will consider purchasing this cream once Iâ€™ve finished my sample.  #trywithtopbox A great moisturizing cream, highly recommended!
