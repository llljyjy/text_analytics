I keep buying this SPF over and over and over. I literally cannot count how many times I have bought this, because if I meet someone who is looking for an SPF, I just give it to them. I ALWAYS have one of these somewhere handy, in my bag, in the saddle bag for my bike, at work in my desk drawers, everywhere. If you have an oily skin, keep reading:This sunscreen DOES NOT clog your pores. I have had a very hard time with acne when I was younger, and I realized it was because I wore very heavy sunscreens that I did not clean well at the end of the day with an oil-based cleansing ointment. Anyway, this sunscreen literally feels a little heavier than milk, but not much. It also washes off very nicely. If you wear a CC cream, like I do, this SPF works very well with it and does not make your CC cream run or anything. Best Sunscreen Texture and Perfect for Oily Skins
