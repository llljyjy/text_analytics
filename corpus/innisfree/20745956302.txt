I love K-skincare and i was dying to try this brand for very long and finally i got the chance to try this product. complimentary from innisfree. Dewy Glow Jelly Cream doesn’t feel bad on my skin and it doesn’t have an unpleasant smell. However, I’ve been using it for a couple weeks as part of my evening skin routine and every time it soaks into my skin quickly and doesn’t make your face look oily at all i love it
