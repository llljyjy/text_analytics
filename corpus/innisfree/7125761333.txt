I love the glow this moisturizer gives my skin! It’s extremely hydrating and not greasy. It absorbs quite fast into the skin and works well under my foundation. Perfect for my typically oily skin. Also the packaging is so cute and it has a lovely scent. 10/10 for me! I recommend this to anyone who has oily skin! Perfect if you’re oily!
