I have tried and reviewed my fair share of moisturizers, and I think this is now my favorite (it’s good but also more price friendly compared to my fav skin fix one). I have normally pretty dry skin and this locks in moisture like a dream and when I woke up my skin still felt sooooooo moisturized. It sinks in so nicely and makes me feel nice and plump. Would definitely recommend!!! innisfree you’ve done it again
