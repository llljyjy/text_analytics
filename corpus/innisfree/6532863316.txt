This mask is really luxurious. It applies very smooth and evenly. It dries down without cracking. I left on for 10 minutes and after rinsing with warm water my skin felt clean and not over dried. I think it is a great mask into a weekly routine. I followed up with a serum and moisturizer to keep skin from drying out. My skin reacted well to this mask. nan
