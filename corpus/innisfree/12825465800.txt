I’m a huge advocate for suncreen, I’ve tried so many different ones but this has got to be one of my all time favorites. It’s incredibly lightweight and gives a healthy glow without being super oily which for me is important as most times I end up wanting to dab off other alternatives that give waaay too much shine. Totally worth the money! One of my favorites!
