I got a sample of this and had to buy the big one! I was so surprised at how affordable it is!  It is lightweight but still works well for my dry skin.  It is great for under make up because itâ€™s not too greasy.  I definitely would recommend this if you want a light weight but still hydrating SPF! I love this light weight sunscreen!
