Thank you to Topbox Circle and innisfree for providing me with a full-sized jar of the Green Tea Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Moisturizer as a #freeproduct for review.  This cream is very light and absorbs & layers well with makeup and other skincare products (just stay away from actives when using this as the hyaluronic acid will help them penetrate more deeply into your skin and increase the likelihood of irritation).  My skin felt soft & refreshed after waking up in the morning and not greasy at all during the rest of the day.  The scent was nice & light and I liked the weight and feel of the glass jar.  Really enjoyed using this product and would recommend. My skin felt great!
