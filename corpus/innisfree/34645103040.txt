Haven’t had a problem with white cast or residue, it has a lightweight texture. Sorta just feels like a moisturizer. It does have an SPF smell to it, but it’s not that bad -- a little more citrus smell. I had no idea what to do for an SPF, as I’m rather new to skincare, but this checks all the basic boxes. Great for the price.
