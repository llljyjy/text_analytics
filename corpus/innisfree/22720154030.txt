This is my absolute favorite mask to use once a week for clarifying. It has a cooling feel to it when applied, and dries down in a way that doesnâ€™t completely dry out my skin. When rinsing off, the tiny volcanic particles gently exfoliate without being abrasive at all. When I rinse off the mask, my skin is softer and smoother, and my pores are visibly smaller. For reference, I have acne-prone, combination skin with some redness around my nose, as well as big pores on my upper cheek area. Holy grail weekly clarifying mask
