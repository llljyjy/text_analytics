The nicest part of this moisturizer is the application - the jelly like consistency is fun to apply to the skin and goes on smooth. The fragrance is pleasant as well, nothing too strong. I have been using for a week, can’t say I’ve noticed any difference in my skin because of it, but it’s not been too long so there is that. My least favorite thing about this - it dries on sticky. I like skin that feels moisturized but not sticky, and would not want a glossy look of it came with a sticky feel. I will use the container I have as I do not like to waste product, but will not reorder. jelly is fun to apply, dries sticky
