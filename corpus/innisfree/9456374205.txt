This moisturizer is great for days when you just need a light boost of hydration underneath your makeup.I have normal skin in the spring / summertime and this is just the right amount of hydration and moisture I need. It seeps in my skin so quickly so it’s perfect for rushing to put my makeup on! It’s not too thick but provides enough hydration and moisture for my thirsty skin. My foundation looks smooth and supple on top of this moisturizer. It does not have any strong fragrance which I’m usually sensitive of. Overall, this is a great lightweight moisturizer ideal for spring / summer for normal skin!I received this product complimentary from innisfree but all thoughts and opinions are my own. light boost of hydration for normal skin
