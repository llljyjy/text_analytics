I was sent this complimentary from innisfree. I’ve always enjoyed jelly texture moisturizers! It feels very lightweight on my skin, but hydrated so much. I don’t find it to have any particular scent to it, I don’t know maybe I just can’t smell it haha. But really my skin feels like it just drinks up this product. It gives me such a nice glow too. I love it so far! nan
