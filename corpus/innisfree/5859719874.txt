This product was gifted by innisfree . I am a huge fan of innisfree and this dewy glow cherry blossom cream was no exception. It is perfect for the summer. It is extremely moisturizing but not heavy AT ALL. It is a dream to put on. I think what makes it so light is the jelly like consistency, it is extremely refreshing! The price point is also very reasonable. Great summer moisturizer
