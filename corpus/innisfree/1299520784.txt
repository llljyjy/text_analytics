If you’re looking for a deeply hydrating, thick moisturizer, this isn’t it. However, if you’re needing a lightweight moisturizer for daytime use (maybe in humid weather), this is your thing. The texture literally feels like jelly, but turns into a lightweight watery consistency as you work it into your skin. I used it on top of my serums underneath a thicker moisturizer, and it provided a nice cushion of hydration. It made my skin feel soft and supple. This was gifted by Innisfree. Lightweight jelly
