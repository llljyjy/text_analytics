I have combination skin. This formula is moisturizing with a dewy finish and has no white cast. My skin is prone to sensitivity and this doesn’t make my skin feel irritated or sting my eyes. If you have oily skin and want to wear this without looking shiny you can top it with a thin layer of Makeup Forever’s Shine Control Primer. Best price point and formula I’ve tried so far at Sephora compared to Supergoop, Biossance, and Paula’s Choice. Best I've tried From Sephora Thus Far
