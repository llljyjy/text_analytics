I suffer from hormonal breakouts and I always feel like they take such a long time to clear up. I’ve tried many products aimed at treating acne and breakouts so I was super excited to be gifted Innisfree spot serum. It is different form any other spot treatment I have used before. Most products dry my skin out but this one is nourishing and feels like it’s healing the inflamed skin surrounding a breakout. I also love the faint scent of citrus and mint. I would definitely recommend to others. Nourishing spot treatment
