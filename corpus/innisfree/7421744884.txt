This is an excellent facial sunscreen that melts into the skin with no white cast and does not irritate the eyes. It has a slight floral scent, which is pleasant without being overwhelming. It gets 4 stars though because it causes my mascara to run underneath my eyes, which hasn’t been an issue in the past. I’ll keep using my Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen on days when I wear makeup but will keep this in rotation for makeup-free days! Great sunscreen, not compatible with makeup for me
