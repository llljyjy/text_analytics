Okay so this broke me out really bad and always left a sticky residue on my face. I don’t get all the 4 and 5 star reviews because this just feels like another cheap gel moisturizer that gets tacky after a few weeks. I rated it 2 stars (instead of 1) because it did have a slight glowy look but, that could of just been the oil from breaking out…. This might work for you if you use something suuuper strong against breakouts with it. nan
