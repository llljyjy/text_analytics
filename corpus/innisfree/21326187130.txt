I received this cream in exchange for my honest review. I have been using it for the past couple of weeks and it has become a staple in my skincare routine, especially now in the winter time. The cream is packed with great ingredients including hyaluronic acid and green tea seed oil. I have noticed that my skin feels hydrated and soothed after using the cream. I love that it comes in a glass jar, making it feel very luxurious. Overall, the cream will be exactly what my skin needs in the cold winter. Great Hydration!
