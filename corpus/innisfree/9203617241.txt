I love the texture of this jelly cleanser, it has a good lather and will clean the face well. It is very fragrant if that bothers you (so take that in mind). Overall I really like Innisfree products, so far Iâ€™ve also tried the Hydrating Cleansing Foam with Green Tea and its much more gentle. Fun Cleanser
