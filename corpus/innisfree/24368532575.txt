I can’t write enough positive things about this sunscreen... It has surpassed all others for me. Beautiful finish; very mild sunscreen scent; not greasy; feels like a moisturizer. Perhaps the biggest positive is that it doesn’t sting my verrrrry sensitive eyes. I even put the sunscreen all over my eyelids and no irritation whatsoever! The only thing I wish is that it had a little bit higher of an SPF— would love a 50! crying happy tears only!
