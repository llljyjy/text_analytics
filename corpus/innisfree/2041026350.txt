First impression: this smells STRONG like sunscreen but it dissipates quickly and I appreciate the minimal perfume added. I love the addition of antioxidants, and this is overall a great nontoxic chemical sunscreen. I wouldn’t say it leaves a super dewy finish as advertised, but it does absolutely moisturize my skin well. (I have combination skin— dry with an oily t zone). For the price point, this is a steal. nan
