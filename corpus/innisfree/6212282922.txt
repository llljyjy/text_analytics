I’m gonna be real, I went into trying this kinda expecting not to like it (I have a background of oily skin that is more normal now after starting tretinoin, and I usually need a full lotion or cream nowadays or else my skin feels so tight). I still wouldn’t use it as a stand alone moisturizer, and I would need a lotion around my eyes, but this is a solid lightweight moisturizer that is perfect for under sunscreen. It doesn’t leave my face feeling tight, but is still weightless. Bouncy!Complimentary from innisfree for review. P good
