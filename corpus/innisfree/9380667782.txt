This product have a great consistency. It would be enjoyable for those who have combo to oily skin. I gave it two stars because even when I enjoy its consistency it dried up my face and makes me break out (I have a combination skin). I donâ€™t recommend unless you have really really oily skin. Great consistency but not for me!
