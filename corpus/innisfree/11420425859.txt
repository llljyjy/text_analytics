I’m loving it so far! I’ve searched high and low for a sunscreen that would work with my oily-combination skin, and I think she’s the one. I love the lotion-like consistency, and it leaves no white cast. It does have a faint scent, but it’s not overwhelming. I’m only on day two, but so far so good! Love It
