As someone who gets very dry skin when using Salicylic acid and hydrocolloid patches, I was excited to try this! It smells great and application is really easy. I found applying it right after cleansing and toning worked best. However I did find that it was better at removing the redness and intensity of the acne I had, as opposed to getting rid of it completely. While that may be a dealbreaker for some, it was great for my hormonal/cystic acne. Overall a good product! Not an immediate difference, but definitely works
