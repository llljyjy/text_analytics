I have tried so many sunscreens that feel heavy and greasy on my skin. I’ve tried mineral and chemical, American and Korean, so many, but this is the best one by a LONG shot. I can use the recommended amount without feeling like I’m drowning in it. I can reapply even over makeup. It doesn’t have a typical sunscreen scent. It’s so good. I don’t have a white cast but I do have VERY fair skin, so I can’t know if everyone won’t have one BEST sunscreen
