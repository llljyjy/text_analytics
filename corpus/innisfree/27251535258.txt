I tried the full summer sunscreen sampler from Sephora and this was my favorite, even compared to $60 sunscreens. I’m on my second full bottle now and love it. It has a fruity scent if you don’t enjoy that, but truly no white cast-1 because sometimes it leaves a film-y feeling if I apply it too soon after moisturizer I love it
