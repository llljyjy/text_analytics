I have dry skin and it’s perfect!! It’s like another moisturizer, no white cast, super light, and doesn’t sting the eyes for me. It leaves my skin glowing and the stick blush I put on after it goes on so smooth!! I also think the price is great for how long it lasts you and compared to a lot of other sunscreens I’ve tried. My favorite sunscreen!!
