i’m starting to incorporate sunscreen into my daily routine and this was the perfect product to start with! other sunscreens burn my eyes and have a strong smell but this sunscreen doesn’t sting and I can barely smell any of that sunscreen smell from it. really lightweight and leaves a nice subtle glow without making me look oily. i can layer this one on after a few hours without pilling or it feeling heavy on my skin. wish it came in a bigger value size! nan
