i apply a thin layer, and rinse off when it’s completely dry. i use this mask around every monday as i work in a restaurant on the weekends so that is when my skin gets most oily. this isn’t a life changing product, but it does help to get rid of unwanted oils. it did not do much for my acne, although it helps slightly to prevent forehead acne from oil buildup. it seems to be able to absorb a fair amount of oil from my skin, although i do have dry skin to begin with. i find that when i rinse it off my skin feels refreshed, it has a slight cooling effect, and i would say feels about 10% smoother than before applying the mask. my skin looks slightly brighter after rinsing it off, and i don’t find this mask too stripping for my dry skin. this isn’t irritating at all which is great considering it is a clay mask. i would recommend this mask for people with dry, combination skin. for me personally i find this mask works best on my forehead and nose which is where i get the oiliest. it doesn’t do much for my cheeks or chin. overall definitely worth a try! great price point for the amount of product. i don’t think you can go wrong with this :o) it’s alrighty
