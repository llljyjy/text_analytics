I really wish I could say this was effective for my very stubborn skin, but I haven’t noticed it doing much of anything even with consistent use. I am giving it two stars because it is a nice texture that doesn’t dry out my skin or sting when I put it on inflamed spots. It has rave reviews so I think I’m in the minority, but I guess I just need something stronger. Not Effective on My Skin
