It took me a week to notice a difference in hydration. I have a very dry forehead and get dry patches on my cheeks. After using this as a step before my moisturizer I noticed my forehead is more hydrated and smooth. The dry patches on my cheeks are gone. For really dry days, or if I use a bit too much retinol, I would use this serum, my moisturizer and slug with a healing ointment. It does wonders. The only thing I wish they did not have was fragrance. It does not bother me but I could do without. It smells nice. This product is non sticky and absorbs well. Great serum to add in moisture to face
