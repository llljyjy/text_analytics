I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox to test out in exchange for an honest review. This is my first time trying a korean skincare product so I was super excited to see what all the hype is about. I apply this cream during the daytime. Aways right after my essence/serum and before my face oil. The texture of the product has a gel cream like consistency. It felt soothing on my skin and absorbed easily without it feeling heavy or sticky. It keep my skin feeling hydrated even during the harsh winter weather here in Canada. My skin felt plumper and softer thanks ingredients like squalane, ceramides, hyaluronic acid and green tea tri-biotics. Overall this is a great moisturizer to keep my skin hydrated. However I wonâ€™t be buying a new jar after I finish as it has ingredients like Dimethicone and Trimethicone. I find those ingredients tends to break me out and clog my pores went left on for long periods of time or over night. Hence is why I only apply it during the day time for shorter period of time. I would probally be interested in trying the serum instead as the serum doesnt have those two ingredients. Great basic moisturizer for hydration.
