My moisture barrier has been slightly compromised due to overuse of a BHA toner and so this product came into my life at the perfect time. After a few nights of consistent use, my skin irritation had completely subsided and my complexion was renewed. I think my only concern is the fragrance, but otherwise I love this product! So good and helpful!
