Sometimes you need to try something new to find out what youâ€™ve been missing. Received this #freeproduct and had never heard of it so I was game to try it. I was initially intrigued by the green tea seed (anything with green tea has to be good, right?). Then I saw hydrate + glow and I was curious to try. Not only is the hyaluronic acid cream smell divine, it is so supple and completely moisturized my Canadian winter skin- dry  and lacking that glow. I used only a very small amount, think the size of a dime on my forehead, cheeks and chin and then the used an extra dab for my neck. Absolutely loved the richness of this cream, not at all greasy. I instantly felt a difference in my skin in both feel and appearance. I used this after cleansing my face in the morning and I also tried it at night, again cleansing my face first. Loved this product, perfect for even sensitive skin (I have acne rosacea). No reaction whatsoever. And the true icing on the cake was this eco friendly packaging- the lid, the box, the container- all eco friendly. Not only is the container green, but it is made in an earth-friendly manner. Makes a great gift for someone in your life who you want to treat to something special, and yes, that can very well be YOU! Green and Gorgeous Too!
