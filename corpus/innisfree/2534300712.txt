I bought this product as I was looking for a lighter night moisturizer for the summer months as I do not like the feel of a heavy moisturizer during the warmer months. This moisturizer really locked in all of the other serums and essence that I use underneath. It does leave a slight ta tacky feeling on the skin but if yodo get use to it afterwards. Would highly recommend it for o those who have normal to oily skin or combination. essences/serrums nan
