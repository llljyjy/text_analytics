What I liked:1.  No white cast that I can tell.2. Doesn’t burn my eyes or irritate my skin.3.  Gives radiant/dewy finish 4.  Moisturizing.5. Price- not a deal breaker either way but have been disappointed by expensive/over-hyped sunscreens lately.Don’t like as much:1.  It’s “basic“- does what it says it will do for good price but not going to change my life.2.  In the summer it feels heavy. Have not tried it with make up but think it might provide a good oil slick to sweat it off, if I did.  IMO would be good for:People with dry and sensitive skin to wear during cool weather, and who want a good sun screen for a good price.IMO would not work for:People with oily skin or sweat a lot,  who want a more matte or blurred sun screen finish. Met All the Basic Criteria
