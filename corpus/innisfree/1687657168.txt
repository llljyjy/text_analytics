This sinks into the skin quickly leaving it smooth, supple and dewy without any stickiness. It has great ingredients for skin like hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, squalane and green tea. I’d only remove half a star because of the fragrance, as I prefer skincare without fragrance due to the potential for irritation or allergic reaction. However, this hasn’t irritated my skin at all. Recommend for glass like skin! Samples Made Me Buy It
