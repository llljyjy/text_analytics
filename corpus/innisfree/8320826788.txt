I will keep buying this sunscreen until they stop producing it or I die, whichever comes first. I really struggled with finding sunscreen that doesn’t make me too oily, give me a horrendous white cast, or make me break out, and this is it. I never get burnt wearing it, and it doesn’t pill or clog my pores. It is super smooth and plays well with whatever products you use over or under it. In the summer, I usually skip moisturizer and just use this as my base layer, and I think if you’re concerned about excess oiliness this is the way to go. As a disclaimer, I usually rock a somewhat dewy look (too much work to fight what nature gave me) but I don’t like outright oiliness and for me this hits that sweet spot. If you like a true matte look you could probably still make this work depending on what primer/foundation you’re putting over it. the perfect sunscreen
