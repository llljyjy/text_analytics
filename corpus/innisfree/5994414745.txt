A worker at sephora reccomended this to me when I went in to ask about something to help moisturize my skin along with my everday moisturizer. I originally looked at the watermellon drops but since I said I had sensitive skin she said this works well and the green tea is calming. I really do like this and does not irritate my skin and has helped with redness and dryness better than watermelon glow recipe
