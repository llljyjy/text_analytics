I’ve used this twice so far and it is a very nice mask and easy to apply (not clumpy). It doesn’t visibly draw oil out while it’s drying, which I don’t understand since it’s clay, but it does leave my skin brighter and cleaner and pores appear better. I think it performs just as well as Glam Glow, with a much more sensible price point! Would definitely buy again. Overall very good mask
