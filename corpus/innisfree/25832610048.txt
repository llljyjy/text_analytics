I really like this green tea moisturizer. It smells amazing and feels so good on the skin. It gives a dewy, glowy look after and my skin feels moisturized. It isnâ€™t heavy so I use it more in my morning routine. The packaging is also very pretty. I definitely recommend this moisturizer. Loving this moisturizer
