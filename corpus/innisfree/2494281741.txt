I really wanted to love this sunscreen. The first couple of times I wore it, it looked great. It gave me a nice glow and had great sun protection. However, within a few days I broke out ALL OVER MY FACE. I havenâ€™t had a breakout like this in years. It has been about two weeks and my face is still recovering. I will say that I do have sensitive skin. I would not recommend this product If you have any sensitivities. SENSITIVE SKIN BEWARE!
