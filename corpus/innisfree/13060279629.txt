Makes my skin Dewy and hydrated look. I have dry skin so I used a lot of hydrating skincare and this doesn’t pill over all my skincare. It works wonderfully with it. It’s a creamy texture with a dewy finish (I’ve been searching for this for a while now!) doesn’t really have a smell to it that made me notice it at all. Overall one of my top fave along with the fenty moisturizer with SPF. amazing!
