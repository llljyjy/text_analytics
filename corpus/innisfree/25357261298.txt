This is the best sunscreen I’ve used from Sephora. It applies flawlessly in seconds and leaves my skin luminous. Zero white cast, effective, pleasant light scent. It feels GOOD on and never greasy or filmy. Even the tube is mess free, which I’ve come to appreciate using sunscreen  multiple times daily. This is THE ONE. Stop looking, buy this!
