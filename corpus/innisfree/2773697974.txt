I received this cream in exchange for an honest review. I’m pleasantly surprised with this cream! The smell is reminiscent of a high-end product, and it has really lovely moisturizing ingredients. I like the texture, it’s not too heavy and not too lightweight so I can wear it during the daytime. It layers well with other products and I’m enjoying it! Really nice staple cream
