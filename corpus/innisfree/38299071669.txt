I really wanted to see this work on my skin but after using it I didn’t really see anything change except for the fact that it did remove the redness from my skin just a little bit but not much and there really wasn’t anything else but it felt rather nice on my skin and was really nice and easy to put on since it was so nice and creamy Was Okay
