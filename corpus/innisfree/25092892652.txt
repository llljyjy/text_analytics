My favorite sunscreen! I used to use La Roche Posays Anthelios and this one is now my go to. I do prefer La Roche’s kind of satin finish because I prefer a matte as possible without looking dry kind of gal, but I don’t mind the slight glow this sunscreen gives me. Easy to apply and blend and it smells just a litttttttttttttttttle bit like Diet Coke so I’m always smelling and dreaming of soda while applying my protection. I love the price of this one too. I use it daily and I still haven’t finished my first bottle. I’ve already purchased a backup! holy grail!
