This product was a great surprise. Iâ€™ve been using it in my morning routine. I love that the formula has green tea as an antioxidant, plus squalane and panthenol. The texture is great, it does not make my skin greasy and it helps a lot to keep it hydrated and feeling good all day long, specially during colder months. The scent is light in my opinion, it did not bother me. #freeproduct Great formula
