Innisfree gifted me this Jelly Cream and it is perfect for oily skin! I especially love how itâ€™s sensitive skin friendly with its lack of fragrance and easily blendable formula. The texture is very wet and easy to spread across the skin. The viscosity makes it sink into the skin very quickly. Oily Skin + Sensitive Skin Friendly!
