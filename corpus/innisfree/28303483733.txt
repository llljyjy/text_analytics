I was excited to try this moisterizer gifted by Innisfree because I have loved every product from this brand that I have tried! I do tend to stick with cream moisterizers because of my dry skin type, but am so impressed with this gel moisturizer as itâ€™s much creamier than I thought it would be. And the hydration lasts all day! Another Holy Grail from Innisfree! Full of Hydration!
