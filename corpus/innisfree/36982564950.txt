Before this product, I was using Supergoop unseen sunscreen. So glad I made the switch. Much better sunscreen and over 50% cheaper. No white cast and blends in beautifully. Leaves my skin looking great, and not greasy. The only problem is it was not filled all the way! I’ve seen many reviews saying theirs was not filled either, so it seems like it is not just a one-time mess up. Despite this, it’s an amazing sunscreen for a great price. Will definitely be repurchasing. Great sunscreen but not filled all the way!
