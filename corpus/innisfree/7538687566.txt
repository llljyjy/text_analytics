The Innisfree Green Tea Seed Hyaluronic Acid Cream is a great moisturizing product. It’s lightweight and non-greasy, making it perfect for daily use. It leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated, and I love the fresh, natural scent it gives me in the morning. Overall, I’m very happy with this product and would highly recommend it.#freeproduct Jelly light moisturizer
