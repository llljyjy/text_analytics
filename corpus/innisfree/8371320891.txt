Loved how it felt on my dry skin and how it looked under my makeup. It felt really moisturizing and had a nice consistency. Unfortunately I woke up with 3 huge angry whiteheads after one use. I really wanted to love this product but it just wasn’t for me. Might still be worth a shot if you don’t have sensitive skin and can tolerate fragrance. Breakouts
