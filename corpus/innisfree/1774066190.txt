I’m an esthetician and I LOVE this SPF! I’ve been using it for years now and constantly repurchase for myself and other people. I have combo skin and don’t need an additional moisturizer under it. I’ve never had this pill on me or anyone else. I will continue to repurchase this for a long time! I love it for day to day, though I do notice it can run into my eyes if I’ve been sweating. It’s mildly irritating but I love it regardless! I love how when applying it it feels cooling and moisturizing. I want to try the matte version for when it’s warmer outside, but I know even if I love that one I’ll continue to use this as my go too! (ALMOST) PERFECT BUT I LOVE IT
