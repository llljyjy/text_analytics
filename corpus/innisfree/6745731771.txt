I really love the original formula of the Green Tea Hydration Cream so I couldn’t wait to try this one. It has a creamy, but lightweight consistency and is deeply hydrating. I also like the new packaging. The glass jar makes it feel more elevated and luxurious. This is still one of my favorite moisturizers and I love this new formula.
