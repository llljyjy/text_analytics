Been using for 6 months. varying between 1-2x per week to none if I am busy. I bought this to get some control of the whiteheads on my T zone and cheek. Reviewers have both said theyâ€™re able to use this product and wash it off and nothing else but I find I fall into the bucket of having to still extract whiteheads afterwards which still makes my face bumpy. wish I could find something that really pulls the whiteheads out like the pore strips. still need pore extractor?
