When looking at the reviews, I only saw a bunch of incentivized ones and didn’t think that was fair. So here is an honest opinion.I love this product, but you should know what you’re getting. Despite “moisturizer” being in the name, it really doesn’t function as a stand alone moisturizer. I use it in combination with the green tea seed facial serum. If I try to use the serum without the jelly, it doesn’t seem to absorb as well. After applying these, then I use a moisturizer. I live in a dry climate, so the extra moisture is needed. I love the scent and jelly texture. Honest opinion
