This made me break out so badly! I purchased it for a week vacation in Disney and used it along with my normal skincare routine, so I know it was this because it’s the only new thing I’ve started using. My skin became so congested and full of acne, and I’m still dealing with the issue now that I’ve discontinued. The finish on this was dewy and really nice, and I definitely protected my skin from the Florida sun. Disappointed because I had high hopes and it’s very affordable! If you have acne prone skin then STAY AWAY. broke me out
