I received this as a free product to try and absolutely loved it! it’s really good for my skin getting extra dry in the Canadian winter and is perfect for either daytime or nighttime. Texture is lovely and it’s not too heavy so layers great with my other heavier and lighter products. Would definitely recommend! Great hydrating moisturizer!
