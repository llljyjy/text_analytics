I really love this moisturizer.  Even though I have oily skin, my skin still gets dehydrated.  I feel most moisturizers created for oily skin, overdry my skin making it produce even more oil.  I love how plump my skin feels after I use it yet it keeps it matte all day.  I love that it also includes salicylic acid to clear my skin and lactic/glycolic acid for my aging skin.  Such a good product! Great for oily acne prone skin!
