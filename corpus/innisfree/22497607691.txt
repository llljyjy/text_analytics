I recieved this gifted by innisfree and this stuff feels sooo amazing on my skin. Iâ€™ve never used a gel product like this before but it dries so nice, goes over any serum I want to use. I even use it as a night cream sometimes and put it under before I seal my Aquaphor. Has the best light moisturizing feel and really wakes up your face! Amazing light moisturizer!
