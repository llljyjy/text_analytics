Korres Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream is a creamy texture that absorbs wonderfully and has such a soft skin feel to it. Lightly and pleasantly scented, I really love this cream! It has helped to brighten my appearance and diminish large pores within one week of use. I recommend for all skin types and will repurchase. I love this brand! Compared to other I prefer Korres Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream for itâ€™s effectiveness and high quality. I also find the value to be reasonable and a great price point. I received a sample in exchange for my honest opinion and the above stated opinion is that of my own. A great skincare product
