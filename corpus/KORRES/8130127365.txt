I got a medium sized lotion for free to review, I used it for a good two weeks. This is after I went through a horrible dry retinol spell, my skin looks pretty dang amazing. No overbearing scent, not a single pimple for the past two weeks and nicely moisturized skin. It absorbs quickly into your skin, no stickiness, and works well. Yup buy it
