Let me start by saying I only have 3 stars because my skin broke out really bad while using this for two weeks.  However product is Feinstein moisturizing and definitely diminishes pores.  I also loved how well my makeup wore over this.  I don’t know if I’d recommend because I had a breakout and my skin is not acne prone. Moisturizes while diminishing pores.
