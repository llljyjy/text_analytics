I absolutely love this cleanser! It’s so gentle on my skin. I have sensitive and combination skin so it’s really hard finding a great one. It leaves my face super smooth and super clean. It also does a great job removing my makeup, even if it’s waterproof. It’s a creamy texture and barely has any scent. Definitely one of my holy grails. nan
