Influenster sent me a sample of this to try. My skin is primarily dry, so this isn’t really intended for my skin type. However, I do have enlarged pores and sensitive skin. I haven’t used this real long yet l, but it smells great and doesn’t irritate my skin when applied. I’m eager to see how it works with regular use. Smells great!
