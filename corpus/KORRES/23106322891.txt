This product did make my skin feel smoother after using for a week. I didnâ€™t have time to see a change in my pores, but would be interested in trying it for longer. I was a little uncomfortable with the gel texture at first, but it dries ok. I got mine for free for testing through Influenster. Good product but strange gel texture
