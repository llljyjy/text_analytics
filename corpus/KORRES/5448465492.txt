I received this sample size from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. I’ve been using it twice a day for two weeks and my honest thoughts are it’s fine. It definitely makes my skin feel smoother, but I have started seeing some red patches on my skin (not breakouts) so I will not be continuing use, because at my age I can’t take chances on harming my skin barrier.
