I received this item complimentary from Influenster for  in exchange of my honest review.  I liked the feeling of the Korres cream. I have huge pores so I never really see a difference with cream. But this cream has salicylic acid so I figure with time it reacts well to the skin. I like it so far and I been using it daily. I would purchase it again as I have sensitive skin and did not react to it. I have oily skin and although it did not totally keep my oils at bay i feel it did help. It feels nice on the skin and not greasy. Soothing Cream
