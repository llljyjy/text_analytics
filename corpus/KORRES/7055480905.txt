I received this product for free from Korres and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Goes on smooth and creamy then dries to matte. Not greasy. Blurs and smooth out the texture on my skin. I can see it helps brightens and even out my skin tone. My skin feels hydrated after using it. Doesnâ€™t really have a smell. Smooths and hydrates
