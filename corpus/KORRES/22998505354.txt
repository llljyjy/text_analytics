I received this product complimentary fromInfluenster in exchange of my honest review. I have tried other products from Korres that loved so when I was notified I will be receiving this cream I was super excited. I like the packaging, so minimalist and the color is very nice. I thought it smelled like green apple until I saw it was made of grapes and it definitely smells like it, really nice. About the cream, it was not heavy and my skin absorbed it easily and was hydrated but I did not notice much of a difference in my pores like I do with other products. I thought I will get better results like a primer or something like that. Besides that, it is a good moisturizer. Like but no love
