I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my unbiased review.I liked the texture of this cream. It does apply effortlessly without leaving residue. The scent is very natural, not overpowering. However, my dry skin did not feel hydrated at all. I can feel the smoothness after application, but it also feels very dry. I am willing to give this moisturizer another try when summer is here, but for now I would have to pass. Not for dry skin
