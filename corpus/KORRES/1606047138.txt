I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. I used this product as part of my nighttime skincare routine. After using the product my skin felt smoother and softer. It however did not provide enough hydration for my dry winter parched skin. I think this would be an excellent summertime cream as I donâ€™t typically need such a heavy cream that time of year. The scent is light and clean. Overall I liked this product but I am more looking forward to incorporating when we head into spring and summer. Summer Moisture
