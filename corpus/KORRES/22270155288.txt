I love the texture, my skin is normal to dry and I really like this moisturizer but only to use under makeup, if it had some sun protection it would be perfect! I can notice the effect that it leaves by hiding the pores a little, I hate when they are extremely moisturizing because they leave the face very greasy, the level of hydration that this cream has is perfect. Just for under makeup
