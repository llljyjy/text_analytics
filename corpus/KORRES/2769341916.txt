I received this product for free in return for my honest review. I really liked this cream and my skin felt hydrated especially in the dry weather. I felt the pores around my nose appeared to look smaller after just several uses. I have added this cream to my morning skin routine and am very happy. There is a light scent which doesnâ€™t bother me. I definitely recommend it. Good product
