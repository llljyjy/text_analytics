I received a sample of this product in exchange for my honest review. I liked trying this cream it smells nice and feels nice on my skin. I only gave it four stars because it was a sample size and I didn’t really see any results as far as making my pores smaller. But I’ll try and buy a full size one day as it’s a bit out my price range. Nice skin cream.
