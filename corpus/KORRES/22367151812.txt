I recieved a complimentary sample of this cream from Influenster and I really like it. It’s super light and has a very faint scent. I used this as a moisturizing cream/primer in my skincare routine and I noticed my pores were slightly less noticeable! I absolutely love a multi purpose product. This is the second product I’ve tried from Korres and I’m impressed! Love!
