I received this product to try through Influenster, my opinions are my own. For a background, I have combination skin and very large pores. Even though my skin some days feels so greasy I still have dehydrated skin. I love this product! It’s light weight and my skin drinks it right but making me feel moisturized but not weighed down and greasy. My skin feels hydrated all day and I do not get oily towards the end. I also feel like it blurs my pores. I’ll likely be purchasing this when I run out of my sample to use as my daily moisturizer! Love love love
