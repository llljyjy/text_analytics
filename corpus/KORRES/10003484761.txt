Received a sample size product of this to test from Influenster and Iâ€™m really impressed with this product. Have always been a huge fan of the Korres brand, and this skin cream is no exception. Love how lightweight it is and it sits on my skin really nicely. Not greasy and definitely minimizes my pores. Have other skin creams I prefer more, but was excited to try this. Lightweight formula
