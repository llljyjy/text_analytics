I received a sample in exchange for my honest review of this Poreless Skin Cream. Overall, I really liked this moisturizer. It has a nice natural scent and works for my oily, acne-prone skin. The most unique benefit of this product is that it truly minimizes the look of my pores, which is fantastic! The negative is that they add fragrance to the product, which is unnecessary for skincare. Otherwise, I really liked this product! Poreless Moisturizer
