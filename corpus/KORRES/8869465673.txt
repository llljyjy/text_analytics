I received a small sample tube in exchange for my honest review. I didn’t get to use my sample completely, as my dermatologist switched up my skincare routine. It has a light fragrance which I didn’t mind, and it seemed to work really well. My skin wasn’t as dry, and it felt great. I’m hoping to give this another try in the future! nan
