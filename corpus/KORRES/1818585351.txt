This moisturizer feels nice on my skin. It absorbs well and doesn’t have an overwhelming fragrance. I did notice my dryer patches (cheeks) didn’t feel as moisturized as I like so I added a little thinker product on top about an hour later. Overall I like the ingredient list and like the product. I have combination, acne prone skin. nan
