I got a sample of this and love it! Now I do use it with my belif hydro moisturizer as well because the air is so dry in my state, but I love it. Remember you need to hydrate before you moisturize. My belif is for hydration and this is to moisturize! Buying a full size Paired with a hydrate-r itâ€™s amazing!
