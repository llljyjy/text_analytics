I received this free from Influenster in exchange for my opinion. I normally avoid products with salicylic acid, but I gave this a shot. I like the smell and texture of the cream. I used it every other day just to be careful because I don’t want my skin to freak out, but so far, so good!! I plan to continue using it. I don’t know if it is shrinking my pores as I haven’t used it long enough. OH and it didn’t leave my skin greasy feeling which is AWESOME!!! Smooth, not greasy!!
