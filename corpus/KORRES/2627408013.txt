I received this product as a free sample. I was not expecting this product to work so well with my skin. I have oily combo skin and this actually did amazing things and kept my skin plump throughout the day. I would apply this after my toner and it really does keep the skin moisturized without feeling greasy. I wanted to show how much of this product I actually used even though I received it for review. Worth buying!
