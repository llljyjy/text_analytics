I was really impressed with this moisturizer. I have combination skin and I’m always looking for a moisturizer that’s hydrating without being greasy. This works beautifully with my other skin care products, And sat well underneath my makeup. This Moisturizer is formulated with hyaluronic acid salicylic acid, lactic acid, willow herb extract, olive fruit oil, Santorini Grape that smooths and balance the skin. I Really enjoyed Using this Moisturizer in my skincare routine and highly recommend it. Poreless
