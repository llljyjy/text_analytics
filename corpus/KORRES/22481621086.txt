This is my first time to try Korres poreless skin cream and I like that this product is easily absorbed by my skin. It’s not sticky at all and without any unpleasant scent and I love that my skin feels smooth after applying. My skin is really dry in winter and I apply moisturizing products more during this season and so far, I’ happy with this cream! The fact that it’s vegan, silicon free, and cruelty free is awesome, too! nan
