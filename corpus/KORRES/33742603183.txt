I like the fact it does moisture my face and it doesn’t feel heavy or like another layer of skin. It didn’t irritate or break out my skin either. Even though it says it’s a gel, it’s more creamy than slimy. It doesn’t have a strong or particular smell. It’s a pretty decent product. I would say the pores on my nose are less noticeable. Pretty Good
