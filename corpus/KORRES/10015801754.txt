I like how lightweight this cream is and the little fragrance it has. I use it as my moisturizer and put it after I toned my face. One star out because I donâ€™t feel like my skin is poreless after I put this cream. However! It does feel and look poreless after I put a thin layer of BB cream (I dont really use foundations) I think it works really well as a primer/ skin care<3 Helps with my makeup
