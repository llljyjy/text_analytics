I got to try a sample & I introduced this into my skincare routine. It compliments and I love how it feels. It goes on light yet moisturizing. I like the pleasant smell - not chemically or earthy at all. Iâ€™ll continue to use to see how my skin will improve. Thanks for letting me test it out! Lightweight, fresh & clean
