Thank you to Influenster and Korres for this complimentary product to try and review! The Korres Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream is very easy to apply. The gel like texture glides on smoothly and evenly. My skin feels slightly tacky , but only for a few minutes. This cream calmed down redness and made my pores look more refined. There is a slight scent-but nothing obnoxious. Pores?
