I received this product t for free in exchange for my honest review. I have really enjoyed using this moisturizer. I have an oily t-zone area and this moisturizer really helped with my oil not breaking through my makeup. It is formulated with salicylic acid. This is my first time trying a moisturizer with that in it and I think it helps. If you have oily skin or enlarged pores I would give this one a try. Great for oily combo skin.
