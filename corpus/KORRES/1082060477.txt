I received this as part of a voxbox from influenster. I was excited to try this product immediately. I am very big on self care products and have probably used every cream etc out there. I loved that it is by Korres. This is an amazing company with amazing products. The consistency is that of a cream. It’s light weight and not greasy. It absorbs into the skin quickly and instantly provides a high level of moisture. It didn’t dry my skin or make me break out. Although I didn’t see a reduction in my pores I would attribute that to already having great skin. I am a fan of this cream and would buy it. Great Moisturizer
