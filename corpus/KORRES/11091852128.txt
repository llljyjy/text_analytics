This cream is amazing. It has HA which is great for holding in moisturizer. It also has Salicylic acid which really helped me produce less oil when I paired this under makeup. I have a very oily complexion and I was able to wear a luminous foundation for over 10 hours. My skin feels smooth and overall hydrated. I would definitely recommend this to all skin types. Great ingredients. Amazing!
