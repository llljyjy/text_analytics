I received this product from Influenster in return for my review. This product was not my favorite, I don’t like the grape scent and it’s very thick. I actually had to wipe it off my face about after a half hour because it just felt like I had goop on my face. It did feel moisturizing but I will not be recommending this or repurchasing it.
