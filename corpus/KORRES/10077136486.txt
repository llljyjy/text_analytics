I received a sample from influenster to review and while it did make my skin feel smooth and hydrated I didn’t notice any difference in my pores. Maybe with prolonged use but for the few weeks I tried it I did enjoy it. It absorbed quickly and didn’t cause any pilling with my other Skincare products. Overall I’d still recommend. Good but not great
