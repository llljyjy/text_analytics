I like this moisturizer because it include salicylic acid which is good for my acne prone skin. This moisturized beautifully and kept my acne in check. But it didn’t even minimize my pores. Not at all.Bottom line: good moisturizer but doesn’t do what it says it does. I received a sample through Influenster; all opinions are my own. nan
