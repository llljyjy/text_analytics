I use a tinted moisturizer plus SPF everyday in lieu of foundation but it’s not enough hydration, especially in winter. I had been using a moisturizing serum but wasn’t thrilled with it so decided to try this. It’s amazing! My skin is so happy. The light smell is incredible. This is just the right amount of extra hydration and helps my color go on easier as well. nan
