This is a nice winter time day cream for acne-prone skin. It’s heavy enough to meet my skin’s winter needs at night, but won’t replace my favorite night creams, such as Korres White Pine Serum-In-Moisturizer. It’s a medium weight cream with a smooth texture and plays well with the rest of my skincare routine and makeup basics. No pilling at all.I don’t know if I actually observed any blurring of pores, but I like the gentle salicylic acid in it because my skin is prone to breakouts right before I get my period.It has a subtle earthy smell. I don’t love the smell, but also don’t find it especially off putting.I received a deluxe sample from Korres and Influenster in exchange for an honest review. Nice day cream
