I received this free from Influenster and Korres for testing purposes. I looooooove this cream. Definitely switching to this when I run out. My skin loves it, it feels SOOO soft I can’t stop touching my face lol. It doesn’t make me breakout and I really like the smell, it’s subtle and it really does hydrate my skin. I’m so happy I got this because I never would’ve purchased it otherwise and now I will. Definitely recommend! love it
