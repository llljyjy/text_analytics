First ingredient is water the price is $36 + shipping fee if I am going to buy online. As a consumer I like being smart and wise in all aspect of life. #RealTalk this is slightly expensive. 40 mL/1.35 oz standard size. This also contains Ammonia not good for me for my health honestly, Parfum/Fragrance I prefer no scent at all, Soybean oil it is a no no. Other ingredients are fine. Poreless Skin Cream thanks to Salicylic Acid a common  ingredient. I like that you added some natural seed oil here. Thatâ€™s it. Not bad but not too good either.
