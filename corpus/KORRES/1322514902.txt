I received a sample of this in exchange for my honest review. I was excited to try since I’ve never met a Korres product I didn’t love- this is no exception!  I applied this daily for a week after cleansing and applying serum. My skin has been dryer than usual lately, but I don’t like the feel of heavy moisturizers. This is light and silky and keeps my skin feeling moisturized all day long without that greasy feel. The product is lightly scented to almost unscented, which I like. I am not sure about minimized pores, as that isn’t a concern for me, but I can say it made my face feel and look very smooth and even, and created a perfect canvas for days I wore makeup. I do feel like my skin overall has improved in smoothness since I started using this. It’s definitely worth a try! Silky Smooth Skin!
