I received a small size from Influenster complimentary. I love the Korres brand so I was excited. It’s good overall but not for my skin type, which is on the dry side. I gave it to my niece who has combo skin and bigger pores and it’s perfect for her. She likes it a lot, helping her skin stay hydrated but also blurs any shine and pores on her nose. So if your skins similar to hers, it would be a great choice. good for combo and oily skin, not so much for dry
