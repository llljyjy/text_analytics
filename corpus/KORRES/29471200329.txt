I received this product free for my honest review. I tried this product for a couple weeks and I love the quality of it. It’s a nice cream that goes into your skin well. I just felt that it wasn’t hydrating enough, and often left me reaching for another moisturizer afterwards. It may be because of my dry winter skin, but that is the reason I probably wouldn’t purchase this again. The smell is fantastic and I think it could be a good product for someone who doesn’t have dry skin. nan
