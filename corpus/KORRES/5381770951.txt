So i liked the product but couldnt give it 5 stars because let’s be honest it’s not perfect.  It’s it a good product that u would use again? Sure, but i think there are other products available that are similar. My skin fid feel hydrated, but I have sensitive skin and there was a bit of a burning feeling the first time I used it which was concerning. The next time that feeling wasn’t there so it’s also possible my skin was just extra grumpy that first day. nan
