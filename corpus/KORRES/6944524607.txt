This was a very hydrating moisturizer. It didn’t leave me feeling extra oily, or my skin feeling heavy at all. I’m terribly inconsistent, but I did notice a slight change in my oil production from my pores which was nice. I have pretty sensitive skin and this didn’t cause any redness or irritation. It smells slightly more pleasant than other natural moisturizers. I’d add this to my skincare routine! nan
