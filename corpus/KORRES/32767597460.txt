I received this for my honest opinion from Influenster. I loved this cream. It left my skin feeling smooth and moisturized. I added it to my daily routine for a couple of weeks. I noticed my skin looking more youthful, and the splotchy redness of my skin toning down. I have extremely dry skin during the winter, and this cream helped so much. I wore it under my makeup, and my skin stayed moisturized all day. I would recommend this face cream if you are looking for a cream that will leave your skin feeling smooth, moisturized, and toned. The ingredients really do their job. Moisturized skin
