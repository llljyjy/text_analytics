I received this product free to test and review and I would highly recommend this moisturizer for people with normal to combination skin types. It doesn’t blur pores after the first use, but after about a week once the SA has had time to take effect I did start to notice a smoother appearance and smaller looking pores. It is not greasy but doesn’t fully absorb into the skin immediately in a way that I actually like. It seems to keep my face hydrated for longer throughout the day. Better with time
