This moisturizer is super hydrating. I have normal skin and experience minimal acne so I tend to use products with salicylic acid only when I experience acne. I did try this under my makeup and loved the way my skin looked and felt throughout the day. I was hydrated and had no adverse reactions from the products. I would definitely recommend especially to friends and family who are acne prone and looking for a good moisturizer. I received this product complimentary from influenster but all opinions are my own! Works well under makeup!
