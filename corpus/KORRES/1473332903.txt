I received the Korres Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream free in exchange for my honest review. This is a great moisturizer for people with oily skin. It absorbs quickly and does have a smoothing effect that made my skin look finished. Personally, I need a little more hydration, but this moisturizer is ideal for anyone with truly oily skin. Great moisturizer for oily skin!
