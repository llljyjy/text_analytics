So I usually don’t like “moisturizers/creams” because it can make my skin really oily and break out. As someone who used to work in the skincare field, seeing Salicylic acid was a sigh of relief that this might work. Turns out it works beautifully, and gives a nice and even complexion! Great for oily prone skin!
