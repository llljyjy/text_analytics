Nothing but a let down. My son’s acne prone skin is oily & with such big pores, its hard for him to feel confident about his skin, even when he isn’t breaking out. Sadly, this did nothing for his skin at all. It smells nice. It didn’t make him break out worse. But he saw no change. We received a trial size to review for free. Glad we didnt actually spend money on this! Nothing....
