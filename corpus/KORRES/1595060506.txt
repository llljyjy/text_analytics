This is a very hydrating moisturizer. I loved that it worked so well without making me more oily. After a few days my face felt really soft and smooth and moly pores looked improved. It had a pleasant light grape scent that did not linger. I would recommend this moisturizer to other women with oily skin. Wonderful Moisturizer
