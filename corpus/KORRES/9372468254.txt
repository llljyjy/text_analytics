I wanted to like this and gave it a fair two week trial to get a real feel for it. This product unfortunately is not very powerful in terms of adding moisture. I would still wake up to my face very dry and itchy after using this which is disappointing given the price and ingredients. It also smells like robitussin, which is never a desirable trait. I received this product free in exchange for my test and review. All opinions are my own. nan
