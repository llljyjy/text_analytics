This is a great daytime cream. It’s hydrating, but not oily. Looks great under makeup and I’ve seen a difference in only a few days use. I love the way it left my skin looking, it left a kind of dewy look, which i love. the smell is just like an unscented lotion to me, which isnt too bad. Definitely recommend ! really good
