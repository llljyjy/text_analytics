As with most korres products i have tried, this cream is a winner. I realize it is more for skin that is oily or with larger pores, however i find the to sit really nicely under makeup, and leaves my skin feeling moisturizer but not dewy. One point taken away for the packaging. Beige writing on light green background makes it hard to read the ingredient list and instructions. Go darker on the green and it should be more legible.  This was gifted to me in exchange for an honest review. Hydrating but sits nicely under makeup.
