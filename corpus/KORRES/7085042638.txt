Bought this during Winter sale for $15 (150mL tube). This might be my new favourite cleanser. It’s thickk, and a small pea size is enough to lather on your face. It smells like fruit loops to me. And, it has a nice after feel; my face doesn’t feel crinkly, it’s matte, non-drying and comfortable. I tried washing a lip stain with this, but wasn’t able to remove, so that’s why docked off a star. Otherwise, this is definitely a great cleanser. A good everyday face wash
