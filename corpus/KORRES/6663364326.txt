I received this product free for review. I can’t comment on the packaging as I received a sample size. The more I use this, the more I dislike the scent. It has an earthy fruity scent that I don’t prefer. I feel that it is a standard cream moisturizer, not gel like they claim. It generally absorbed quickly. However, I did find that it burned a little when my skin was already irritated with mask wearing. I liked the active ingredients of salicylic acid and hyaluronic acid. After 4 weeks of daily use, I dont see much of a difference. Salicylic acid just might not be strong enough for my skin type as I use differin. It claims to blur pores, control shine, and hydrate. I think it layered well under makeup. It only ever so sightly blurred and controlled shine. It was really minor and felt like a standard moisturizer. It’s overall nice, but not mind-blowing. While I will use this up, I don’t think I would purchase a full size. nan
