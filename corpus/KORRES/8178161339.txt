I like that it’s in recyclable packaging as I’m trying to be more sustainable these days. Goes on smooth, feels hydrating & lightweight, and my pores don’t get as clogged. I have oily combo skin. Not irritating or stinging either. I’ve used it for 5 days straight but not sure if I will repurchase yet to replace my current moisturizer. It’s worth a try! nan
