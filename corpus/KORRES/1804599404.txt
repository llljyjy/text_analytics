This lotion seems to be a little bit harsh for my skin. It is too early to say for sure, but the few times I have used the lotion, my skin has had a little bit of a rash/breakout the next day. I use a salicylic acid treatment daily, so Iâ€™m not sure what ingredient seems to be irritating my skin. nan
