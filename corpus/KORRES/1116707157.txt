I received this from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. This is a really nice moisturizer. It is very hydrating and absorbs nicely into my skin. I only got a sample size, so I was not able to see long term results. However, instant results were that my skin felt hydrated and smooth after using. This is not an amazing skin cream, but it isnâ€™t bad. Just in the middle for me, which is why I could not give it a 5. nan
