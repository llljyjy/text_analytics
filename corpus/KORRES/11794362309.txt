Received from influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have used Korres products many times before and love them. However, this product wasn’t my favorite. It did make my pores look less visible after a few uses and went on seamless and was gel-like. However, I’m disappointed that salicylic acid is one of the last ingredients because it’s an ingredient I find to be beneficial. nan
