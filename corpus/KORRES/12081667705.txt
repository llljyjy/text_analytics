This moisturizer is wonderful! It’s lightweight, not oily, absorbs quickly, light scent that doesn’t linger and doesn’t break my sensitive skin out! I have been using it on my face and neck in place of my regular moisturizer and will be switching to this. I’ve noticed my skin feels more supple, feels hydrated longer and my larger pores seem less noticeable. The price point is definitely manageable. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone. In Love
