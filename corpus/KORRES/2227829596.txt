If used as part of a nighttime skincare routine, it works well enough as a moisturizer. In the morning my skin is so soft. It has a pleasant but mild smell that I appreciate, and it hydrates nicely, does not leave any residue or film, and most of all, it is not greasy. This is a good option before applying your SPF. The hydration and glow are what I like most. I recommended it to my mom and friends. Great hydration
