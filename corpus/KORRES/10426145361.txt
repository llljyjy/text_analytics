I received this from Influenster for free in exchange for an honest review. I really enjoy this product. It smooths and evens out my skin tone. It cancels out a lot of the redness from my rosacea and doesnâ€™t irritate my sensitive skin. It creates a nice smooth poreless canvas as a base for my makeup. nan
