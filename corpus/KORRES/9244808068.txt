I received a sample of this cream as a complimentary gift for my honest review. This cream is wonderful. I love that it’s lightweight, clean and non-greasy. It absorbs quickly and feels soft on the skin. The glow it gives is divine.It has a subtle fragrance that I really like.  It also has great ingredients like salicylic acid, hyaluronic acid and willowherb extract, to name a few. The salicylic acid is helpful in treating breakouts , while still allowing me to wear moisturizer. I love that this cream doesn’t clog pores. It actually blurs them, which makes the application of primer and makeup much more smooth! It goes well under makeup, which is a major bonus. It smooths and preps my face nicely for primer, and layering makeup.I have sensitive, combination, acne-prone skin, and this cream didn’t break me out once.  A little bit goes a long way. I would definitely add it in my current skincare routine. It’s vegan and cruelty-free. I recommend it for any skin type. Amazing hydration!
