So far I really love this lightweight gel, it smells great and is very hydrating for my skin. My skin has been dry and irritated and this has been extremely helpful, it has evened out my skin tone and my skin is supple and firm looking. I absolutely recommend trying this, it has been working for me so far. Moisturizing!!
