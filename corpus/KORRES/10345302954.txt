I really liked how this product hydrated my skin without irritation. I noticed that it balanced out my dry and oily parts of my skin. I didnâ€™t see a huge difference with my pores, but I feel like it slow down some of the process. Also I noticed that my skin had this natural looking glow and soft feeling after use. Hydration and balance!
