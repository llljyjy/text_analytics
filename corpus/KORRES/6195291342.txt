No complaints. Can’t give a 5 star review with just testing out a sample size product, because I don’t feel that you have enough of it to use it long enough to see if it holds up to it’s claims. I really enjoy the smell... Not overpowering. A nice hydrating cream. I like that it has salicylic acid in it to combat my breakouts. I may purchase a full size. Like the smell!
