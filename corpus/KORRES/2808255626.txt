This poreless moisturizer by Korres is giving very much texture which I didn’t expect. While 1-2 tabs is all it takes, it goes on a bit thick, but gently smoothes out. It leaves your skin feeling a thin layer of protection, but not too heavy. It gives you a good moisturized glow while strinking your pores. The only downside is there isn’t much fragrance with this product which is neither a good or bad thing. It would just add another characteristic if it was fragranced. Texture
