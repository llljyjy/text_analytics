I received this deluxe sample from korres and Influenster for free in exchange for my honest review. I’d say my experience with this product is 95% positive. It is hydrating not greasy, it is not gel, just light weight cream. It is light scented, very subtle. It is not irritating at all, considering the acting ingredients is salicylic acid, I’m pressed how it is not irritating at all. The price seems very friendly too. I like the product very much. nan
