I received a complimentary sample of this product from Influenster. It provides decent hydration for my dry skin. It did take several uses for my skin to adjust. I have no real complaints but canâ€™t speak to its effect on acne and pores as my skin does not have those issues. The fragrance is nice and I like that it is a clean product. I will consider purchasing this product again. Decent Product
