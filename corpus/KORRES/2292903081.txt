I received this free to test from korres and Influenster. I like this moisturizer and thought it smelled clean and fresh. It absorbs pretty well into my skin although it felt slightly heavy to me (hence the 4 stars instead of 5) I will say, I didnâ€™t notice any difference in the appearance of my pores however, I did not use it exclusively for a prolonged period. My longest use was four days in a row in the mornings only. Good, not great.
