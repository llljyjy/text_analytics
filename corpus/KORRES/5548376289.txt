Love this stuff. Leaves my face so soft and smooth all over, and I live in a very dry climate, and do a lot of winter outdoor sports so my face gets quite dry. I also have fairly sensitive skin and this doesn’t bother me at all. I use this after serum as the last step (replacing moisturizer) in my routine. To me, it smells a bit like whiskey when first putting it on, but it doesn’t bother me! So silky!
