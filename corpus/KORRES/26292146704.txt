I’ve had a few go-to cleansers, but this definitely wins the favourite spot. Very soft and gentle, it’s actually not too foamy on me (which I like), and does not leave the skin feeling dry. I have combination skin and this product doesn’t cause any breakouts or irritation. Recommend! My favourite cleanser yet
