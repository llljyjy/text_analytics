I used this in combination with another moisturizer because my skin is very dry and sensitive during the winter. I have huge pores on my cheeks and it does the job of moisturizing blurring out my pores! I didnâ€™t love the fragrance, but I give it a 10/10 for effectiveness. This acts as my primer now and all I have to use with it is a little bit of concealers. nan
