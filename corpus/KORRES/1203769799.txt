I have been using the  Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream for a few weeks now as my daytime moisturizer. It’s been making my skin look smooth and glowy. I like that it’s not heavily fragranced and I like the consistency. It’s not overly thick but it’s als not thin or runny and it sinks in quickly. It made my skin feel soft. It didn’t irritate my skin or cause me to break out at all. I like the overall feel of this cream and like how it made my skin look and feel. nan
