I have combination skin with an oily t-zone and dryer cheeks. I have larger pores around my t-zone as well and often use poreless primers to deal with that issue, so I was intrigued by this product! I’m usually a pretty skeptical person when it comes to beauty products’ claims. I was please, though, to find that adding this into my routine did actually improve the look of my pores a bit. It wasn’t anything dramatic, but it was noticeable! I would definitely suggest trying it out if you’re self conscious about the size of your pores; just know it’s not a miracle cream. Good Addition to Routine
