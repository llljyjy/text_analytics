I was sent this for free by Influenster and Korres in exchange for my honest review. I would say that the cream does everything that it says it will do except for being hydrating. I have somewhat dry skin, especially right now during winter and living in California. The cream is lightweight and I didn’t detect any noticeable fragrance. It went on nicely and I did notice that the pores on my nose looked a bit smaller. However, this cream is not hydrating for dry skin. The first day I applied this by itself, meaning no serums before. Almost immediately after applying it, my skin felt uncomfortably tight. So much so that I had to take it off and apply a hydrating serum first. Once doing that, it was manageable to wear. My forehead will sometimes get oily and I did find that this cream controlled that. But I think that is because this cream is drying to the skin. The skin on my nose, right around it and above it, was becoming drier. It was to the point that my skin was becoming a bit red there and the skin on my nose started to flake a little bit. Once I noticed this, I stopped using this cream. Overall, I definitely would not recommend this for anyone who has dry skin. But I do think this is best suited for people with oily skin. I think it’d be perfect for them. Recommend for Oily Skin
