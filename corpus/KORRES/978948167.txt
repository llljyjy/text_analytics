I can see how this might be good for other people, but it’s not for me. The cream is not moisturizing enough and made me break out. In general, I don’t like having active ingredients in my face creams because it makes using serums very difficult. The wide mouth jar packaging is also a no for face creams for me, idk why brands keep using it. The size is small for the price nan
