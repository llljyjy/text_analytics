Unfortunately, this moisturizer definitely didn’t provide nearly enough moisture for my combo leaning dry skin. This isn’t a good product for my slightly sensitive and breakout prone skin either. My skin did feel smooth after applying it, and it did absorb pretty quickly. The makeup that I applied afterwards did apply well, so I’m going to give it thee stars for that. nan
