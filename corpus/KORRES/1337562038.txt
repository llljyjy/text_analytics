I was sent this (for free) to try out from Influenster and Korres. This is not my first Korres product, as I fell in love with the company when I went to Greece (and seriously miss buying them from TJMaxx here in the states). This product works quite well with my skin and even doubles as a nice primer in the morning. I wear a KN95 all day at work and this product has helped keep a nice moisture level in my skin and has helped keep my makeup from wearing off (which I donâ€™t this was an intended benefit). Highly recommend. A lovely choice
