I received this product to review through Influenster for my honest review. I really was pleasantly surprised with how much I loved this moisturizer!  It leaves my skin feeling baby soft every morning and plays very nicely under makeup. I do see some diminishing of pores but will have to try it longer to test that out. Would definitely repurchase! Great moisturizer under makeup and hydrating!
