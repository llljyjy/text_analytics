I received this product complimentary for testing purposes..Its active ingredient is Santorini Assyrtiko Grape Extract which Minimizes the appearance of pores. and Salicylic Acid which helps to unclog pores and aids in the reduction of visible blemishes. Besides Hyaluronic acid ( everybody knows about its benefits), So this gel sounds wonderful for people like me with large pores and sensitive skin but... After using it for two weeks only on one side of my face to compare results and I don’t see any differences. Yes, any differences at all (bad or good). Both sides look the same and no shine control either. At least this cream works well with other products of my skincare routine and with makeup. Maybe It needs more than 2 weeks to show results even if the brand claims that. As I don’t feel it gets my skin dry I’ll keep using it and post an update if there’s any changes. for now it is just a simple moisturizer, no game changing. Just a Moisturizer
