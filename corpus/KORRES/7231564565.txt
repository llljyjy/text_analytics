I wanted to love this product! I think it’s a good hydrating moisturizer but then there are so many others out there and I personally have some that I love. I was hoping that what would make this stand out was it’s claim to blur pores. I have large pores near my nose and cheek area and am looking for a product that can help minimize them. This skin cream did not do the trick. It did leave my skin feeling hydrated and it’s lightweight and non greasy. I liked the fragrance and the ingredients ! Would I purchase once my sample is done, probably not. nan
