I recieved this product from Influenster and Korres in exchange for an honest review.  I have been using it for several weeks.  At first, I didn’t think I was going to see a difference.  However, I do think it helped with acne.  My skin seemed to break out less while using it twice a day.  The only thing I would improve with this product is that I need it to be more moisturizing for my skin.  I did see some benefits with this, but it’s not the ideal moisturizer for me. Helpful with Acne
