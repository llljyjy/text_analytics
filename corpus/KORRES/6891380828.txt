The most important step in my skin care regimen is to keep texture off my face. I’ve been using Good Genes since it came out. Another permanent tool in my arsenal is FirmX by Peter Thomas zeroth. The Santorini Grape Velvet skin drink is out standing! Not only for the fantastic job unit does smoothing out my skin but also it truly feels like a liquid velvet. I use it as my last skin care step and it makes my skin glow. The filters blur my skin like an airbrush for real. My face is dewy and bright and incredibly soft. I’m a red head down to the freckles. At 53, they aren’t as “cute” as they used to be. The blur feature makes them blend if not disappear. There are so many features to love about this product! I highly recommend it!
