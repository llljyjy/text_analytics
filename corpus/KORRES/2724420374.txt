I’ve always heard such great things about Korres but never got around to trying any of their products. I was super excited when I received  their sample sized Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream because one of my goals for this year was to really focus on a good skincare routine. I had no idea what to expect from this moisturizer and after trying it out, it’s definitely a moisturizer I will be considering adding to my routine. For one, this moisturizer smells sooooo good! The fruity smell is subtle and  isn’t overpowering at all. I love that this moisturizer is lightweight but still gave my skin moisture. This gel moisturizer has a thicker texture than a water based cream so a little goes a long way. I also loved that despite it being tacky when first applied, it dried fast and I was able to move on with my routine.  Overall I really enjoyed using this moisturizer.The salicylic acid and hyaluronic acid is especially good if you have oily/acne prone skin like myself. I would definitely consider adding this moisturizer to your skincare routine this This Moisturizer is a Must-Try!!
