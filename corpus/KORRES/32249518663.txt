I have to start this review saying that I have a sensitive/combination skin type.This cream has a lightweight formula, the scent is very fresh and not too strong. However even having this lightweight formula my skin didn’t absorbed it fast as it usually does, instead the product was a little bit tacky for a good few minutes. After having absorbed it completely, my skin felt really moisturized and smooth, but it enhanced my redness and I didn’t notice the pores minimized. I think this is a good face cream to be used as a pre makeup. nan
