I received this product complimentary from Korres and Influenster in exchange for an honest review. I really enjoyed this product. The gel moisturizer is just as good as the cream I normally use. It works well for my combo skin type. It did “blur” my pours and felt like it got better the more I used it. Very fresh smell and my makeup went on smoothly after. Would buy in future and recommend to friend and family. Great Product!
