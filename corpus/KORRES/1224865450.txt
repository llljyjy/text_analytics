I have to admit that I may not have given this enough time.  But from first impression I can say that this is a nice moisturizer. It had a very pleasant scent and was lightweight, not overly greasy.  I cannot say if my pores were reduced, but itâ€™s worth exploring over a longer period of time. The ingredients are pretty impressive, so I have high hopes. Nice Moisturizer
