I am a big fan of this brand, and this cream didn’t disappoint. It’s very lightweight gel moisturizer (my fave) that provides hydration while blurring the look of pores and mattifying a bit. I have sensitive acne prone skin and it did not irritate or break me out. I like that it has Salicylic Acid and Hyaluronic Acid. I love that it is vegan, cruelty-free, and comes in recyclable packaging. I would purchase this myself. Lightweight moisturizer
