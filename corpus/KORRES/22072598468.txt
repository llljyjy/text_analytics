I’ve been using this cleanser for several months now, and it’s a solid choice. I have sensitive, rosacea-prone skin, and using this cleanser once a day did not irritate my skin or cause redness. You don’t need to use much, so the bottle lasts a while. It effectively removes sunscreen. However, it is a little pricey for a cleanser, and there are cheaper drugstore options that are just as gentle/effective. nan
