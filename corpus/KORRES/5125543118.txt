I’m always super impressed with Korres skincare and their ingredients. Many of their products are already incorporated in my daily skincare routine. I feel like their products cater towards sensitive skin and I can confidently buy and use without fear of irritation. This product was a great addition to my winter skincare because of how dry my skin has become due to the weather. It’s a thicker cream that melts into the skin immediately and I can feel my skin soaking it up. This products also contains salicylic acid which doesn’t irritate my problem areas with frequent or daily use. My skin is super soft upon touch and I feel like it makes my makeup apply better because I’m so moisturized. I’m very impressed and would recommend and repurchase myself. Holy Grail!
