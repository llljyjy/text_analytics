I love this product! I wish that I would have gotten a bigger size to sample how it would be on my skin for a long period of time. From what I have noticed it leaves my skin very hydrated but not oily. My pores are somewhat of an issue for me and I have noticed that this product does even out the texture. It also leaves it super soft! It also has a nice subtle smell. I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. nan
