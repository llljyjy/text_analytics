I was excited to try this out given the fact I have larger pores, dry skin and breakouts. I was beyond thrilled that after the first use my pores had shrunk considerably, my acne appeared to be drying out but the rest of my face was hydrated. This product left my face feeling soft, smooth and hydrated. It has a light earthy scent that is pleasant. Great product.
