I received the product complimentary for testing purposes. It isn’t greasy and it doesn’t have an overwhelming scent. I have dry skin and it made it instantly feel smoother. Plus side for me is that it’s cruelty free. I’m really happy with this product and recommend it for anyone wanting a light moisturizer Light scent is great
