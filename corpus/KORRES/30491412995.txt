Overall I really enjoyed this product. It helped with the pores on the tip of my nose and also reduced the amount of blemishes I get on my cheeks because of the salicylic acid. It had a smell but was not overwhelming or floral. Just a light pleasant scent. I would definitely recommend! Wonderful Experience
