I got this for free from Influenster for my honest review. I wanted to like the product but my skin did not. I replaced my usual moisterizer with it and my face felt more dry than before I used it. I dont normally use salasylic acid so I might just be sensitive. I will say it looked nice throughout the day and would probably wear well under makeup. I’ll keep it as backup but probably won’t use daily. nan
