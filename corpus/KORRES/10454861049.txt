This is a nice light moisturizer. It gives a nice base for makeup, as well. It has a nice texture and is creamy. I found it easy to spread and it slightly blurred my pores. For me and my dry, winter skin it is just not enough, but I look forward to trying it in the warmer months.I recieved a sample for review, but the opinion is my own. Good for oily or combination skin
