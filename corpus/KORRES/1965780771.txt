this is a nice moisturizer! it absorbs well into the skin and wears well under makeup. however, i have very dry skin and i didnâ€™t think that this was as moisturizing as i would have liked it to be. it also felt a little runny/cheap.i received this product for free from influenster in exchange for an honest review! nan
