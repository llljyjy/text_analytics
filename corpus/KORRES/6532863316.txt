I enjoy thid cleanser. It has a nice comforting clean smell to it. It leaves my skin feeling clean and hydrated. I will say it doesn’t really foam much compared to other foaming cleansers. It is more of a creamy lather. That doesn’t prevent me from enjoying the product. However it was not what I expected. I got this on sale but not sure if I would purchase again at full price. nan
