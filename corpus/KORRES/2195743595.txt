Korres Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream is a lightweight gel moisturizer, I’m grateful the times I’ve sweat after applying it, it wasn’t like the moisturizer was laying on top of my skin, it absorbed nicely. Though it did not make my pores look any smaller but it does control oil and shine while still feeling hydrated with Hyaluronic Acid, Salicylic Acid, Willowherb Extract, and Santorini Grape. Great for Oily/Conbo/Sensitive skin type. nan
