First thing’s first! This product was received as part of a promotion— While my review is genuine, I didn’t pay for this product :))This skin cream was such a pleasant surprise! It has a very gentle, clean scent, and absorbed beautifully into my skin. I’ve only been testing it for a couple days now, but I can already feel the texture of my skin evening out! I’m super excited to pursue continued use with this product, and I’m looking forward to more positive results. So far, I’ve included this cream as a moisturizer in my skin routine, and I’ve felt no need to switch it out again since trying it. I’m eager to see how all the lovely ingredients impact my skin moving forward! Wonderful moisturizer :))
