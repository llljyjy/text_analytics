I have oily skin and visible pores. So I am always in search for products to help in these areas, but that won’t dry out my skin. The Korres Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream so far seems to be that holy grail skin cream us, “oilies“, are always in search of. I love how my skin feels hydrated, yet not shiny. Blurs pores and kept my makeup looking flawless even after 10 hours. My eye makeup didn’t last, but the face did. Best of all, it’s formulated with hyaluronic acid, salicylic scid, willowherb Eextract, and the antioxidant-rich, Santorini Grape. Will be buying a full size. Highly recommend. Mattely in Love
