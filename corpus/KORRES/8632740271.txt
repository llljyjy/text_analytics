This moisturizer works well on my combination skin, but I might need one just a little heavier for this winter weather. I don’t really see a difference in my pores, so I wouldn’t say it blurs pores. It doesn’t make my face oily, and it has an interesting smell but I kind of like it. It’s worth trying out! nan
