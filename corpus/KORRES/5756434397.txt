I received this product free from Influenster. I really like how hydrating and moisturizing this skin cream is. It’s very nice and light, goes on evenly, and gives my skin a very dewy and fresh look. I haven’t noticed if it’s made my pore look smaller just yet, but I can say that I really like it as a moisturizer. The smell is also different. I wouldn’t say bad, just different. It may not be for everyone. I am very grateful for the product and I think a lot of people will really enjoy it! Really nice skin cream
