This is literally my new FAVORITE moisturizer! Idk how long it’s been selling for because i would have appreciated finding it sooner but i’m glad i FOUND it. It feels like it goes on thick and it’s very moisturizing but it’s lightweight! I LITERALLY cannot! Thank you KORRES for making this HOLY GRAIL product. MY SKIN THANKS YOU KORRES!!!  They also make my fav cleanser the Green Yoghurt cleanser that’s also amazinggg! My skin is combination but most moisturizers make me oily and i’ve literally only been able to find 2 that don’t do that one slightly does but it’s not too bad and now i found this one it’s perfect!! Sadly even moisturizers that are supposed to be lightweight like the Neutrogena water bomb and Belif aqua bomb make me so oily and alot of people like those but they don’t work for me most moisturizers don’t bc they make me oily. This one is here to stay <3 AMAZINGGG!!!
