I received this in my VoxBox from Influenster complimentary in return for my honest feedback. I really liked this moisturizer, didn’t help reduce the size of my pores and I’m sad I only got a small sample size because I might have been able to see more long term effects if I had gotten a larger sample size. Overall, pretty decent moisturizer, especially for those with combination skin since it doesn’t make your skin feel oily. Good moisturizer
