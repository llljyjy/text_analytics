I received this cream free to test and provide my honest opinion of, and I’m so glad I did! It’s fabulous as a light, yet nourishing everyday moisturizer. I loved how soft it left my skin, the non-artificial, very minimal smell. I’m a fan of Korres products and this is a lighter yet still very nourishing option than many of the other creams I’ve used from Korres in the past. It leaves my skin supple but the product is quickly and fully absorbed so it’s perfect for applying under spf and makeup. I highly recommend this especially with summer approaching. Light, nourishing and smoothing!
