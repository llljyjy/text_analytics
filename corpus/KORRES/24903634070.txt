This cream is lightweight and absorbs quickly. I love that it leaves the skin feeling soft and supple without feeling as if it sits on top of the skin. It’s great for under makeup moisture. Diminishing the appearance of prose and making the skin matte by absorbing oils. Absolutely recommended for all skin types as it’s fragrance free and sensitive on the skin. Yes!
