This is potentially made just for me!! It has everything I love and need in a moisturizer. The pros, acne treatment, pore treatment, gel, and oil free. The highlights that set it apart are the grapes are a great natural antioxidant and willow bark is great for skin. I also love that it does peel up or get those weird residue balls. That a lot of products have! I have already recommended and bought a second jar!! In Love! Acne friendly
