I received this Korres moisturizer for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Overall, it has a great texture and a little goes a long way when applying it. It has a subtle, sweet smell. I’ve been applying it 2x day for about two weeks per the instructions. I’ve noticed a subtle difference in the size of my pores. Perhaps it needs to be applied for a longer period of time to have a significant noticeable effect. My skin gets very dry in the winter and this really helped keep my skin bright, soft, and moisturized. I highly recommend! nan
