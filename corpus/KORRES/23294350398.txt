I really liked this. The scent is really nice and pleasant. In my makeup routine I like to use a nice moisturizer like this instead of a primer and it did not disappoint. Blurred my pores and left my skim hydrated and soft. It didnâ€™t leave my skin oily which I sometimes have an issue with and made a good starting point for my makeup. Good replacement for a Primer
