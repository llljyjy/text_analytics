I received this poreless moisturizer complimentary in exchange for my honest review. After concentrating it on my nose and areas where my pores are larger for a few weeks I do notice a difference in the smoothness of my skin. Makeup always goes on easier on top of this cream too. The scent is minimal which I also like for face products. Iâ€™ll likely buy the full sized of this to keep using it. nan
