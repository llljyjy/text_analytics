I received this complementary in exchange for my honest opinion. I really enjoyed this face cream. It has a really soothing, cooling feeling when you first apply it. It is hydrating and smooths out skin by mattifying and minimizing pore size. I incorporated it into my skincare routine and used it twice a day for two weeks. I did notice a change in my skin’s texture and it was a little brighter. Also this isn’t just good for people with acne, if you don’t have acne it’ll brighten your skin since, Salicylic Acid is Beta-Hydroxy Acid and often used it products that brighten like Peter Thomas Roth’s Alph Beta Universal Daily Peel facial pads. I highly recommend it if you want a moisturizer that kicks up the power when you’re looking for a good moisturizer that doubles as an acne fighter and brightener. Moisturizes and Brightens
