I will say as a girl with dry skin this moisturizer was not made for me, but I still decided to give it a try. Upon application it absorbed nicely into my skin. It did give my skin some moisture, but not enough to soothe my dry winter skin. Makeup applied nicely over it but I used a very dewy sunscreen and an hydrating primer prior to application. I do think I may have liked this product more in summer when my skin is less dry, but I think people with oily skin or even combination skin would love this. Must try for oily skin
