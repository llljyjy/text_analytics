I received this product from Influenster and Korres In exchange for my honest review. This Grape Poreless Skin cream smells so good and has a light coconut scent. This gel moisturizer helps blur my pores and mattifies my skin so my foundation looks flawless and smooth. I did notice a slight difference after using this product that it does minimize my pores. Itâ€™s also lightweight and keeps my skin hydrated. nan
