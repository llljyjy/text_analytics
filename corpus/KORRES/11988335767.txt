I liked this moisturizer but it did not reduce the size of my pores or hydrate my dry winter skin. In the winter my face gets pretty dry and I needed to add an extra moisturizer in addition to using this one. This moisturizer alone will be good in the spring and summer months. It did not make my skin break out, it was good for my sensitive skin. I would still recommend this to others. Good for oily/normal skin
