I received this from Influenster to use and then give my opinion. I loved it. It has a light scent, so it’s not overpowering, goes on so smooth and made my skin look and feel great. I’ve used it on its own and under my primer and loved both ways. So my opinion, I would absolutely buy this. Buy this right now!
