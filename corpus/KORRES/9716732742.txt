It’s a really great face cream. Probably one of the best I’ve used to be honest.  It is very moisturising and really appears to shrink my pores. It’s a nice medium/thin consistency and absorbs really well. Also love that it has salicylic acid to encourage healthy cell turnover. Def would recommend. I just have a 20ml sample but may purchase the full size to use on days when I wanna look extra glowy and flawless. Only complaint would be the price point for the size but the quality of this thing makes it worth it, just don’t use all the time. Lovely
