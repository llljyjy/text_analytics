I love the fact that this took a few steps out of my morning routine.  The cream spreads easily, but sometimes takes a bit longer to absorb than other creams.  The scent is almost like citrus with a hint of chemical. Not the best, but not the worst.  My skin is super smooth and soft when I use this cream! nan
