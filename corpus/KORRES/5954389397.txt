I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. This is a luxurious product that delivers on hydration and creating a smooth porelessbase. I like that it’s silicone and cruelty free but this cream is better for oily to combination skin, whereas I  have dry skin so it wasn’t exactly for me. For me with dry skin it was a little bit tight after applying, even though it contains hyaluronic acid. I just needed more hydration. I do recommend this to those with the other skin types. #ThatGreekGlow #complimentary @Influenster @Korres Luxurious
