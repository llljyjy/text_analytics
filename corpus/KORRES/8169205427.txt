Definitely a quality moisturizer. Scent was amazing. Not too strong but also not real weak either. One thing I don’t know about though is the poreless part. I saw absolutely zero change in my pores. It’s not like it’s silicone based like some are, that fill in pores. This is just a gel moisturizer and it didn’t do anything to soften them. I may still purchase in the future but only because I liked the moisturizer itself. Not for the ‘poreless’ attribute. nan
