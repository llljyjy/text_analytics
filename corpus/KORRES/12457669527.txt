This works really well! I have been using it for the past few weeks and I have noticed a change in the size of my pores, especially around my nose. It’s definitely something that takes a little bit of time to see the results but they are worth it. This has a subtle grape scent to it as well which I like. It’s definitely a good moisturizer that I can see myself reaching for again once I run out. Love it
