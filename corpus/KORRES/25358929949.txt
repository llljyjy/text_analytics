This threw me off on my first use. I was expecting a gel like consistency,  but it’s more like a thick moisturizer. I really liked this product. It didn’t leave my skin feeling oily or heavy with product. Not sure how great it works yet because I’ve only been using for a few days. But it hasn’t caused any breakouts which is great considering my skin is sensitive. Overall,  I’m really liking this so far. I also received this product complementary from influencer for my honest review. Good product
