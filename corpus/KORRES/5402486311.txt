I really enjoyed using this moisturizer. The gel like texture made applying it easy. I loved how it felt like it soaked right into my skin after application. I have some read that are more acne prone and I felt like this product helped to clear those areas up. This worked well under makeup as well. I also love that this brand is cruelty free and clean beauty. Iâ€™ve been slowly trying to move towards replacing my beauty products with clean products. It is definitely worth giving a try if you like gel like moisturizers and have acne and oil prone skin. Moisturizer for Oily & Acne Prone Skin
