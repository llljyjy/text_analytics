I received this free from Influenster. I was super excited to receive it because I had heard good things. My skin type is combination but mostly on the dry side. So I was super interested when I started to notice that my skin started looking hydrated. I tried it for about a week and it doesnâ€™t make my skin feel super greasy but instead it feels lightweight but also moisturizing at the same time.  The ingredients listed in this moistures are very good for your skin, I always try to find a moisture which has Hyaluronic Acid in it as this really helps to retain the moisture. was a good moisturizer. nan
