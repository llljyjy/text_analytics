I received a sample of the cream to try out in exchange for my honest opinion. The cream did seem to blur my pores a bit but not totally which is to be expected. I have acne and liked that the cream has salicylic acid in it. I used it more as a spot treatment as with the cold January weather it didn’t moisturize my skin very much, but as the spot treatment it worked very well. I have combination skin that in the winter gets dry, so for moisturizing I wouldn’t recommend if you live where it’s cold and snowy Not too moisturizing, but works for acne
