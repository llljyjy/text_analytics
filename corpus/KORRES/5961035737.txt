I have to say this is one of the most awesome feeling face creams I have ever used. The cream is a great texture and doesn’t run when using. On the face it has a very silky smooth feeling. It is like once you rub it in it is absorbed and your face is so soft and smooth. There is zero product feel while wearing. There is no oily residue, no weight, and no pasty feel. It just feels amazing and I am totally tempted to add it to my morning routine full time. It mixed well with my other routine items of day cream, wrinkle reducer and such. You can’t beat a great wearing product that so plays well with other products! I definitely would recommend this to others especially if you fight visible pores or a splotchy complexion. Barely there skin cream...yes please!
