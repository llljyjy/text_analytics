I was given this complimentary by Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. I have oily combination skin and totally visible pores. If but for anything else, I’m so happy to have this to blur those pores. A lot of other brands don’t do that for me. It smells so great and it doesn’t break out my sensitive skin. I’ll definitely be purchasing the bigger size & this is definitely apart of my skincare regimen. I’m so very pleased. Although this was given complimentary, these are true thoughts and I highly recommend this cream. Very Very Pleased!!
