I’ve used a lot of moisturizers and face creams. I have to say hands down this is in the top 3 that I alternate between. It’s smooth, you don’t need a lot, it makes my face feel so hydrated and smooth. I have no bad things to say about this. I use Korres face wash and was looking at their moisturizers so you can say I was excited when I Received this! I mixed it with my bronzer from Drunken elephant a few times and the results are what I’ve been looking for! Buy it you won’t be disappointed. I had my sister try it a few times while she was here. She has a skin condition and cannot use a lot of products. Had her try this she went and bought it. Loves it. Go buy it
