I was going to give this 2 stars, but honestly, I just took another off after leaving a 2 star review know the company’s website and realizing they don’t show it; they only show the 4 and 5 star reviews, so they go down a star in my book for not being honest about the reviews received. That said, this product claims to blur pores, but it absolutely did not. My skin looked exactly the same after putting it on... so if pore blurring is what you’re looking for, I’d suggest looking elsewhere. nan
