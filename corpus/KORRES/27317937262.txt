Initial thoughts - the product doesn’t have much of a scent at all, so it’s not overwhelmingly perfume-y which I like. I’ve used it for about a week and I can’t honestly say that it has made much of a difference in the appearance of my skin. It absorbs nicely and isn’t greasy at all so I love that! Makeup was easy to apply over it as well. I’d buy it again! nan
