I received a sample of this product free for review. Because it was only a sample I can’t speak to long term efficacy. This was a light weight thin cream with a mild pleasant scent. I have sensitive skin and this didn’t irritate me or cause me to break out. I did find my pores were clear while using this (however I do exfoliate so I’m not sure if this was due to my regular routine or this product). I really enjoyed this product and think it would be good for those prone to blackheads or white heads. Good for those prone to blackheads or white heads
