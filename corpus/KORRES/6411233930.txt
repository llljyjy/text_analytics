I received this product free from Influenster and Korres in exchange for my honest review.I had a couple of key issues with this product. The first is that it is billed as a moisturizer. I did not find this to be moisturizing at all. The other main issue that I had is the number of essential oils in this product, making it irritating to sensitive skin. Overall, I would use this as a serum and still apply moisturizer after. Good but not great
