I received a sample to try in return for my review. I use Korres body wash and was super excited to try this.  My skin has been super dry this winter. Within a week my skin was noticeably hydrated. My pores seemed to look better as well. I like the scent and itâ€™s lightweight so great under my makeup. Hydrated skin
