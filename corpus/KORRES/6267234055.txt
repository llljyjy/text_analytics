I got a free deluxe sample from Influenster and Korres in exchange of my honest review. I tried it in my morning and night time skincare routine and I loved how my skin stayed hydrated. It didn’t leave my skin with that greasy feeling and it is well absorbed by my skin. I also liked the pleasant and fresh smell. My face feels way smoother which makes makeup application perfect. It doesn’t have a strong scent which is also a plus and the texture is simply perfect and doesn’t leave my face feeling heavy. Perfect
