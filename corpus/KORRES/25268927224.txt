I received a sample of this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This product is thick and smells like baby lotion (not in a bad way). Due to its thickness, I only used this as part of my nighttime routine. I used about half of the recommended nickel size for application and it did the job. Face felt hydrated and sealed. No negative reaction or sensitivity. Very happy with this product. Great for nighttime use!
