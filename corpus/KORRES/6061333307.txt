I got a sample of this free for review. I thought this moisturizer was really nice. It has a gel cream texture that soaks into the skin quickly. It left my skin feeling velvety soft. I have been using it for about a week and have noticed my pores look a bit smaller. I was hoping it would help with my acne since it has salicylic acid in it. It didn’t, but it didn’t make it worse either which is a plus when using a moisturizer when you have oily skin! The scent is nice and not overwhelming, it kinda smells like grapes/wine, but very faintly. I really enjoyed this cream and would purchase in the future. Great moisturizer!
