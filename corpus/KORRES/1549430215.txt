I have very sensitive skin + am eczema prone. I tried this after researching products that may work for me in light of this, but it was a bit disappointing. I didn’t find that it fully removed oils and makeup residue, and I started to break out in blemishes after a few days - probably because it wasn’t fully cleaning my skin. So, it is gentle, but didn’t get the job done for me. Gentle… too gentle
