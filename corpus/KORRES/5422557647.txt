I like Korres products in generell because their ingredients are great and safe and they are soft to my skin. The Poreless skin cream is a great product but it did not shrink my pores. The creme is pretty light, I felt like it wasnâ€™t rich enough for my skin, my skin (very dry) needs more oil. this cream leaves you more with like a matte finish, it is absorbed very quickly and has a nice mild scent. Great product Clean and safe
