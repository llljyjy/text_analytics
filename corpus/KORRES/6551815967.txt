Received this as a sample and my oh my! It is absolutely amazing. The texture is very watery and has a slight scent to it but nothing too harsh. Once on the skin, it almost feels like a light oil and makes the skin so soft and airy in a way. My skin is on the dry side but felt so hydrated. This truly lives up to its name of being a skin drink! Would recommend. TRULY A SKIN DRINK!
