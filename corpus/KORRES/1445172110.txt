I have been using the product for over a week now. The product is very lightweight and does not feel heavy on the skin. There is salicylic acid to help the skins texture and combat breakouts. The hyaluronic acid helps to hydrate. I personally didn’t see a big difference in my skin within the week but my skin does not get irritated and usually I have very sensitive skin. I would recommend for women 25-50, someone younger might need more acne control and someone older would need a little bit more hydration, but it’s a good happy medium! Great for combination and sensitive skin!
