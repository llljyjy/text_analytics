This review is coming from 3 years of using Korresâ€™s Wild Rose Brightening Oil!!! I bought 4 gift sets for myself on Black Friday & was intrigued by this brand due to the wonderful ingredients they use. I also wanted to try out Greek Skincare & this seemed premium. Well this oil specifically stood out to me. Everytime I used it as my bedtime oil, I woke up to beautiful soft skin & noticed immediately the texture improvement. It was like liquid gold for me. I have tested different oils (higher brands too) and none gave me the effect this one did. I also love how lightweight it is, yet so moisturizing. I see people commenting about the scent but I didnâ€™t feel it smelled bad? It didnâ€™t smell like fresh petals or anything, but definitely no alcohol scent for me. It just smelled like old petals but I actually liked it lol. Also probably bias because it worked so good on my skin ðŸ˜Š I have Asian combo oily/normal/dry skin. I finally finished my 4th bottle so thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m writing this review. My 1/3 skincare product I can truly call my HOLYGRAIL. The second one would be Korresâ€™s wild rose foaming cleanser! Itâ€™s for all skin types & perfect in the morning. My third is La Rosay Posay. Hope this review helped ðŸ’• MY HOLYGRAIL Iâ€™ve tried other ones
