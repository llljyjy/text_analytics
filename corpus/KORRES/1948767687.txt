I’ve been wearing this cream in the morning for the past week and a half and it’s lovely. The texture is on the thin side, and dries to a non-sticky feel. It wears nicely under makeup, and keeps my face feeling hydrated and not oily. The “grape“ scent is noticeable at first, but goes away after a few minutes. I haven’t noticed any pore refining changes yet, but I imagine it would need more time. Light and Smooth
