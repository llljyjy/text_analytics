LOVELY light moisturizer. It has very light scent, and it leaves a beautiful glow behind without making the skin greasy or oily, while moisturizing at the same time. It also plays well with my foundations without pilling or adding bulk. Definitely recommend! Light, moisturizing, with beautiful glow!
