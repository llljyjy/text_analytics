I received this product as a sample to try and review from @influenster and @korres. I really liked the texture and the lightness of the product. I did not like that it had fragrance I prefer no fragrance in my skin care. I like that it had hyaluronic acid and salicylic acid. I used the product for 2 weeks two times a day and felt like my pores looked smaller and my skin did feel smoother. I think the product is nice however I think it is a product that would work better for younger oily skin. I have dry skin and felt like it was not quite heavy enough of a moisturizer. Overall if you are looking for a light moisturizer with hyaluronic acid and salicylic acid and possibly needed some retexturizing of your skin I would recommend. Great for oily acne prone skin
