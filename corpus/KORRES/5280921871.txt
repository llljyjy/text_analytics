I really enjoyed trying this moisturizer via Influenster. I love that it contains salicylic acid to help with any breakouts. It left my skin feeling hydrated but not greasy. I can only give 4 stars as this was a sample size and I could not fully test it as I normally would. First impressions are positive, but would want to fully test for 3 weeks for a more in-depth review. nan
