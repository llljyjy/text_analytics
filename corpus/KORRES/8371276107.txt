I love the product.  It moisturizes me enough for the day to day.  .and helped to.avoid breakouts.  It mattifies only about 3 hours and then the grease appears.  I feel that the pores are hidden a lot but it helps to control fat.  It is an excellent clean product for those who do not want to put more chemicals on their face.  I only received the sample presentation but I do recommend it.  They gave it to me for free from influencer for a review. Very fine. Bye grasita
