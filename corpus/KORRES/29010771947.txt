I used this cream instead of my usual moisturizer in my morning skincare routine, and had no issues using in combination with my other products. This cream definitely felt hydrating to my dry skin. I noticed a slight reduction in the appearance of my pores and a subtle glow to my skin. I appreciate the hydrating and antioxidant rich ingredients. nan
