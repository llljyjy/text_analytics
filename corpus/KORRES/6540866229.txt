I am very picky with my moisturizers and often times try them out for a couple of weeks and then give them away to somebody else due to under performance. I really wanted to give this moisturizer a real shot so I tried it out for three weeks. Upon first applying it I was not very impressed with its performance however after applying it for two weeks I began to see a serious difference in the appearance of my skin and the name pore-less truly reigned true. Worth a try
