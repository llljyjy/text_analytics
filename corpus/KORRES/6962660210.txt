I received a complementary sample of this product from Influenster and Korres for my honest review! I used the product for 2 weeks day and night in place of my regular moisturizer. The crème absorbed quickly and worked well under makeup! It had a nice fresh scent up front but followed but a plastic/chemical scent. That’s my only gripe! My skin looks soft, supple, well moisturized, and no breakouts!! Absorbs quickly, works well under make up
