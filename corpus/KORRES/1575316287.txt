I love this! I only use it at night due to the salicylic acid, but what a great product. Iâ€™ve been a fan of Korres since 2011 when my hotel in Greece had them in our room. This was a pleasant surprise in my Voxbox. I highly recommend it, it did not irritate my skin, but I do exfoliate regularly anyway. Not sticky or heavy. Give it a try! I love Korres!
