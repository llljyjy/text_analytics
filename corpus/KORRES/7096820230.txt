I received this from Influenster for free to test out in exchange for my honest review. I have combination skin that is very sensitive and tends to get dry and flaky patches. In the winter months it happens more often so when trying this type of moisturizer I kind of already knew that my skin would need more moisture. However this didnâ€™t dry me out. It actually felt good and it would actually be a good moisturizer for me to use in the summer time. nan
