I received a trial size of the product. It looks like it normally comes in a jar style. I like the product so far, after using for a couple of weeks. I’m not sure my pores are smaller, but it seems to moisturize and the salicylic acid doesn’t seem to cause any issues with my skin. I’m not a fan of the smell, but luckily it’s not so strong that I smell it after applying. So far, good
