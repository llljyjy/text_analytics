I received this product for free from Influenster and Korres in exchange for me honest review. This product was easy to add to my daily routine. My skin felt instantly hydrated. It has a great faint scent of grape. The only down side is that it leaves a tacky/sticky feeling. I do recommend it to those 30+ because we do need that extra moisture. Witte Approved
