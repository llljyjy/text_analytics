I really like this moisturizer. I have combination skin and a few large pores so I’m always looking for a way to minimize them. This feels really light on the skin and doesn’t become oily feeling throughout the day. I am able to use thus under my foundation without it making my foundation separate as well. I do think it does a really great job of reducing the look of pores and the price us fair. I would purchase this again. Love it!
