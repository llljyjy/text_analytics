I really love the scent of this product. It’s clean without being overpowering. And the cream once applied really makes my skin feel amazing but it doesn’t really make any difference in my visible pores in any way different to similar products at a lower price point. I think if you’re intending on paying this price for a pore minimizer, it’s a great one to choose but you’re not missing out on anything by buying a less expensive product. nan
