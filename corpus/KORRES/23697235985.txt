I really like the texture and faint scent of it. I can use this daily and won’t make my face greasy and keeps it well moisturized. I have been using it for a good 2 wks and haven’t noticed much change in my acne scars or pores. No repair but it is good in the sense that no wrinkles have appeared and can be use as preventive treatment. Good on Oily Skin
