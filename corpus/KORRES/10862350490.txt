I received this product free from Target in exchange of my honest opinion. This cream says that does 2 main things, makes pores look smaller and hydrate oily skin.The visible reduction of pores was a failed, I didn’t see any improvement even when using several times/days, my pores were looking the same day after day. But the cream was certainly pleasant to apply, it didn’t feel heavy on my skin and it was slightly tacky which is perfect to have it as a primer! My skin felt very soft and hydrated when I applied it; although with the hours I felt like I had oil in my T zone (i applied it there) so I think it if more for normal skin than for oily. Perfect for normal skin
