I received this as a free gift from Sephora and influenster for my honest review. I’ve been using this for the past two weeks and it does really hydrate my skin. I didn’t notice it helping with any of my problem areas other than the dryness. It leaves a bit of a tacky feeling after which I don’t prefer. After a while my face starts to absorb most of the product through the day and I need to reapply. I think it would be a great daily moisturizer for dry/ combo skin. The scent is okay not too overwhelming or annoying. nan
