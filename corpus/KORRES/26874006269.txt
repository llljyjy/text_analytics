I received a complimentary sample of poreless skin cream, and Iâ€™ve been using it a few nights a week ever since. It smells delicious, it goes on smooth and weightless, and you can feel it working. My skin feels smoother and looks brighter since using this product as part of my extensive skincare routine, which varies from night to night but generally includes a cleanser, a serum, eye cream, retinol cream, a moisturizer, and occasionally face oil. This product is the perfect addition for me, but you might want to skip it if you have particularly sensitive skin. Awesome Product
