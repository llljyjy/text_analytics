I received a sample of this complementary from Influenster and I have truly enjoyed using this moisturizer. It’s very lightweight and the scent is luxurious and clean! I use it morning and night and I really like the way my skin feels after applying.  I also appreciate that it’s vegan, cruelty free, and low ingredient list. Refreshing!
