I really like this face cream. It feels so nice on the skin not overly heavy. It feels light but also moisturizes so good. My skin looks so nice after a few days of using it. Itâ€™s really improved my skincare routine. It keeps my face moisturized which helps my makeup go on more smooth and evenly and it really does help with minimizing your pores which also helps with makeup application. I would recommend it to my friends and family :) Wonderful pore minimizing face cream
