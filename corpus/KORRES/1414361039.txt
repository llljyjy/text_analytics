This skin cream is incredibly light and glides over your skin quite easily. I’m not sure about how well it does with combo skin, as I don’t (yet) feel like it’s done much to subside any small pimples, but it does make my skin feel quite smooth. I like Korres as a brand, and this is good, but might not be my first choice. Still, I think people with more oily/combo will like this Decent light poreless skin cream
