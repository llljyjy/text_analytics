Honestly, I really liked this Korres Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream. It went on smooth and felt lightweight on my skin. It wore well under makeup and instantly hydrated my winter skin.  I love that it has hyaluronic acid in it and is antioxidant rich.  I would definitely recommend and would purchase again. Great product!
