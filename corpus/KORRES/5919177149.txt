I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. I like the smell and the benefits of this product. Smell is always a plus. The only thing is I get a film after a while, and applying makeup on top kind of gets it to clump some. Normally, without products on top though, itâ€™s fine. Love that it protects my skin and definitely softens my pores. Nice
