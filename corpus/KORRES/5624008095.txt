I never heard of this brand before and this is my first time using it. This light yellow thick lotion-like texture with a light pleasant scent smells like the fresh scent in baby’s product. This moisturizer smooths my skin well and my skin feels so soft after applying this cream. It’s lightweight, fast-absorbing, and doesn’t dry your skin even though it’s giving you the matte-clean-like face feel. I have combination skin that has an oily T-zone area, this cream helps control the oil shine on the T-zone area and makes my makeup look more even. A product that has control shine benefit, tends to dry your skin more and cause a breakout. This cream works wonders, it controls your shine, does not cause a breakout, and hydrates the skin at the same time. Recommended! And will purchase some more in the future. Work wonders on my combination skin
