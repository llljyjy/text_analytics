I have very large pores and was pleasantly surprised by this product this was given to me as a sample from influencer. I went out and bought the product since and it really does blare out the blemishes on your face and my pores look so much smaller the only thing I would say that I would change is I feel itâ€™s a little sticky with application overall this is a great product if you are looking to smooth and balance your skin Impressive
