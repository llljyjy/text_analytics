I received this for free from influenster and korres! I have oily and blackhead prone skin. I think this would be a perfect moisturizer for the summer! Right now it’s not as moisturizing as I’d like or need but it is more moisturizing than some other moisturizers with salicylic acid. I think it would be better paired with a moisturizing serum. My skin isn’t exactly sensitive but it does turn red easily and this did not cause any redness. Overall a good salicylic acid moisturizer! Perfect for t zone area!
