This is such a lovely moisturizer! I received it complimentary to test and review. My skin is so soft which is rare during the winter. I found that it left my face very shiny. I really liked the way it looked when I used it as a makeup primer. Perfect amount of moisture and shine for makeup. I also use it before going to bed and wake up with smooth skin. I didnâ€™t feel that it shrunk my pores. But it does help as a makeup base. excellent hydration!
