This moisturizer is definitely hydrating. I have normal skin with minimal acne and Iâ€™ve never used products with salicylic acid before. It smelled nice and went on nice and soft. I felt hydrated and had no adverse reactions from the moisturizer. I would recommend to those who are acne prone and looking for a good moisturizer. I received this product complimentary from influenster in exchange for my honest review. nan
