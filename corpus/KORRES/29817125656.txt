I am very excited to try this product again in the summer. I have large pores but am dry in the Wisconsin winters so it did not provide enough moisture for me now. You can feel the acid (at least I can now while I’m dry) so I am very confident it will work well for me in the summer when I’m oilier! Interesting Product
