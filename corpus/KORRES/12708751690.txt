I really enjoyed this moisturizer which kinda actually surprised me cause I usually am not too fond of gel moisturizers (don’t get me wrong their are some that just blow my mind but it’s rare) however this is probably one of the thickest gel moisturizers I have ever used and for my preference that is a good thing. It definitely gave great hydration however as far as blurring pores I didn’t really notice much of that… but I have abnormally large pores and honestly have yet to find a moisturizer that doesn’t contain dimethicone (which I like but a lot of people try to avoid) that does actually noticeably blur out my pores. Something I did however notice was my face feels very fresh and clean when using this moisturizer which I think is from the gentle exfoliation that was going on from the salicylic acid.  I also enjoyed the very light scent that this moisturizer has. Overall I think this is a great moisturizer and who knows maybe with more use I may actually see my pores look more diminished. Hydrating!
