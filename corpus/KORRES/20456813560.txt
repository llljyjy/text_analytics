I received a sample of this product free to try from Influenster for review. All opinions are honest and my own. I was very impressed by this skin cream. When I saw it had Salicylic Acid I was a little concerned because while I generally have combination skin, leaning more heavily toward oily, as I’ve started aging I definitely see my skin changinRead more about review stating A solid and surprisingly well balanced productg and this winter has been awful. It’s so dry in some parts that it’s flaking. And in my experience, Salicylic Acid is very drying, which is kind of the point for oily and acne prone skin. But they’ve done something really smart by combining it with Hyaluronic Acid. This allows it to really hydrate while giving you skin clearing benefits. And still I still deal with some adult acne, I appreciate this combination so much! It has a smooth texture going and feels great, almost like a primer, which I’m assuming is the reason why it helps with the pore blurring. Overall I was so impressed. I definitely think it will be a go to in summer. For now I need just a little more hydration so I pair it with an oil during my routine. But it’s a very solid product and it has worked wonderfully in keeping me feeling hydrated and clear. Well formulated for Combo Skin
