I received this product for free from Influenster and Korres in exchange for my honest review. This product was okay. I already use other products with salicylic acid so I used this product in place of one of my other products one time per week. My skin has been a little more moisturized but I have not noticed any reduction in the size of my pores. The smell is not overwhelming but there is definitely fragrance which can be sensitizing. The moisturizer is light and I can see this being an excellent product for summer. I wouldnâ€™t buy this product again currently but I may buy it in the summer when I need a lighter moisturizer. nan
