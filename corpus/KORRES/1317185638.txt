I received this product complimentary from Influenster. The cream has a very light scent. It is quite pleasant and not overwhelming. I find this to have a light lotion feel, it doesn’t really feel like a gel cream to me. Upon application it’s soaks into the skin pretty quickly. I find that it does help my skin feel soft and smooth and probably would also work as a make up primer for me. With that said, this product is probably more ideal for more oily skin types. I think I will enjoy this more during the warmer months as my skin tends to be drier in the winter time. smooth!
