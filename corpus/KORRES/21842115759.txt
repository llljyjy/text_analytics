This moisturizer just melted into my skin I tried it both at night which I do recommend if you have been dry during the winter months as for me I had a bad breakout recently so I’ve been dry trying to correct that but anyways this melted in left me a smooth finish to apply my foundation it didn’t separate my make up even hours later I would suggest that you make sure it’s fully absorbed before applying make but I would recommend wish I got a full sizeI have already added this to my basket for a full size Melted into my skin
