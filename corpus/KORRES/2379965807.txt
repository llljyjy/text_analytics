This is a pleasant, light gel cream with a very mild scent. Iâ€™d recommend using this as one of several moisturizers, because while the salicylic acid is great for brightening, it can be mildly irritating if you use it too often. I have noticed a brightening effect as I have used this, which has been great with winter skin dullness. nan
