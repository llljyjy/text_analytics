I received this product free in exchange for my honest opinion. I really wanted to love this, but after several days of use, I developed a pimple....deal breaker... itâ€™s light, has a sort of olive oil scent that fades. Very light, and it does leave your face feeling moisturized. Unfortunately, other than the pimple, I saw no other changes. nan
