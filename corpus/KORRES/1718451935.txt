I received a sample from Influenster. This moisturizer feels smooth on application and I like the subtle fragrance. It makes me feel like I’m in the Mediterranean!  i like that it has a small amount of salicylic acid for smoothing benefits. My only downside is that is shouldn’t be used around eyes and doesn’t have spf, therefore necessitating the use of extra products. nan
