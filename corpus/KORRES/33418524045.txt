I received this moisturizer from Influenster for my honest opinion.  I really liked this moisturizer.  It was great for my dry skin.  I wasnâ€™t too fond of the scent.  The scent did fade after application which is a plus, but the scent still was noticeable to me.  This moisturizer has a great texture and absorbed really well. Good
