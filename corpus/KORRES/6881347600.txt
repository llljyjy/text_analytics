I really enjoy this poreless skin cream. It blurred all of my pores and it made a perfect canvas for my foundation and concealer. I love that my face was also hydrated throughout the day. A little bit goes a long way and I got many use out of it. If you are looking for a hydrated pore filling products I definitely recommend this product. Great makeup base
