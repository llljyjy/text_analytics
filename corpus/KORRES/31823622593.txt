This was my first time using Korres Poreless Skin Cream and I have liked it! I’m fond of the color so that’s a plus right off the bat. I have used it consistently quite a bit and I still have some, a little goes a long way. There isn’t much of a smell to me, which I don’t mind. I like how it applies and I’ve liked how it feels on my face for the day. It seemed to me that the days I wore it I’ve thought my face looked more refreshed. I have enjoyed adding this to my face care regime and would recommend it! I’ve enjoyed this product being added to my regime
