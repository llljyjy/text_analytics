Received the product as complimentary from influenster. The cream has a slight grape scent and it glides on smoothly. Its light weight and doesn’t make your skin feel heavy. My skin does look a bit shiny while appling this gel cream but it goes away after a minute or two when the cream is absorbed. Definitely makes the skin soft and hydrated but it didn’t have any effect on my pores, may be didn’t apply for long enough to see the results. Good product
