I was sent a free sample of the Korres Santorini Grape Poreless Moisturizer from Influenster. I loved this product. It’s lightweight and worked great on my combination skin. It wasn’t oily or sticky and I did notice a difference in the appearance of my pores after using. It also set well under my makeup! Definitely worth the try! Love this.
