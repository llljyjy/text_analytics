I used a trial size of this and it made my skin feel very supple and soft the next day. It’s a very lightweight oil that won’t make a mess and a dab will do you well. I would compare it to Drunk Elephant’s Marula oil in terms of how my skin felt afterward. While this isn’t as heavy, it definitely made an impact and gave me a subtle glow. The smell is the only downside to this. It smells strong and smells EXACTLY like Robitussin. I don’t know if it’s worth it to buy the full sized product, and I might even be inclined to listen to the other reviews and try Rosehip oil instead. Decent “skin drink”
