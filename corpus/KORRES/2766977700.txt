I received this for free in exchange for my honest review!! This is a wonderful cream that does slightly blur the pores so if you have smaller pores you will love this!!!! For some of my larger pores it didn’t blur so much but still felt very nice and hydrating to my skin!! It applied well with makeup and didn’t feel heavy or irritate my skin whatsoever!! I would recommend this to anyone and feel that it would be a great moisturizer/primer for makeup!! Very Nice
