Received this from Influenster In exchange for my honest opinion.  I have been trying it for almost 3 weeks and I’m still unsure about it.  The moisturizer is okay but what doesn’t fully convince me is the smell and also that in a couple matters my face turns very oily.  I decided to apply a smaller amount but it’s still very shiny in a matter of a couple hours.  I do like the way it makes my skin feel initially but I’m not in love with it and will not purchase.  I do recommend however if your skin is dry and not combination or oily. It’s ok
