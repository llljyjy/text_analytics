This cream smells fantastic! I received a sample size Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. I love that it has salicylic acid to control my acne while keeping my face moisturized. It is not a heavy cream and absorbs rather quickly. My skin felt tighter and my pores didnâ€™t stand out as much. Smells amazing!
