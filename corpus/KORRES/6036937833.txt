I like it but I probably wouldn’t buy it for myself. I received a sample of it to test and I did notice significant improvements in my acne and overall skin health.  I’m just not a fan of the tacky texture it has when it sinks in to the skin. It’s perfect for under makeup but I just don’t like the feel of it. I highly recommend trying it out though! nan
