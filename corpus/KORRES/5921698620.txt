I received a sample of this product from Influenster and Korres in exchange for my honest review. I began using this product right away and I’ve been very pleased so far. This Grape Poreless Skin cream has a light coconut scent that is quite nice.  This gel moisturizer helps blur my pores and my foundation goes on smooth. I’ve battled dry skin on my face all winter and this product has really helped me to keep my skin hydrated. I recommend! Too good to pass up!
