This lightweight moisturizer is perfect for sensitive and oily or combo skin. The gel texture rubs down smoothly without any stickiness. It blurs pores while controlling the natural oils in your skin so it does a great job hydrating your skin without making it more oily and shiny. I like that it has hyaluronic acid and salicylic acid plus antioxidant-rich Santorini Grape. I like using this before I put makeup on because it doubles as a moisturizer and a primer to smooth and blur my pores. It doesnâ€™t irritate my sensitive skin at all + my face feels so much more refreshed & hydrated after using this! Hydrating & Doubles as a Primer!
