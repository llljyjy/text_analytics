I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review, but unfortunately my skin had a horrible reaction to it! I’m in my 40s, so I don’t really get breakouts anymore and this reaction shocked me. I had little red dots all over my face that took over a week to go away - this was after only one use. So while this product isn’t for me, that didn’t mean it’s not the perfect fit for your skin! I wanted to love it but . . .
