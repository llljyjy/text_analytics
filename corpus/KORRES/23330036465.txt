I was super excited to see that I was getting a sample of this new face cream complimentary of Influenster. Korres is one of my favorite brands. I was a little worried that it wasn’t going to be enough for my dry winter skin however, I was pleasantly surprised that not only did it keep my skin hydrated throughout the day but, perfectly balanced. It also smoothed out my skin made the perfect primer?! After seeing how it left my skin’s texture, it looked as though l didn’t need to use a primer, and my makeup applied flawlessly! I was amazed how smooth and poreless my skin looked because, this cream is not heavy and does not feel like silicone also I was not expecting those types of results. The salicylic acid that is in this combined with the other magical ingredients, are really making a difference to the appearance of my pores and texture and I will definitely be purchasing a full size! Great Makeup Primer!
