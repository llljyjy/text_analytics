I decided to use this product like it advertised. I did my research to see what the claims were in order to know what to look for. So I used it every day for 28 days and here’s what I found: It’s hydrating and soft, but it doesn’t leave your skin greasy. It sinks into your skin well. It did nothing for my pores. I have pretty noticeable pore around my nose, and after 28 days, they were still noticeable, which was the entire premise of this cream. Overall, it does make the skin look nice, hydrated, gives it a healthy glow, so it’s still a good cream to use for the face. 28 Days Later
