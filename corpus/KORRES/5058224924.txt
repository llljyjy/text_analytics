This product has a long list of natural extracts and oils. This moisturizing cream absorbed quickly and had a light, pleasant fragrance. I’ve only ever seen blurring products and moisturizers separately so this was a treat to have both in one! Although I didn’t notice a difference under my makeup immediately I’ll continue to use it even for the other benefits. I received this sample in exchange for my review. So many natural extracts and oils
