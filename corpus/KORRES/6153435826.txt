I’ve struggled with a lot of texture on my skin for many years now, and I bought this product recently on sale and I’m just blown away. This product is so efficient at improving the skin’s texture. It leaves my skin so soft when I wake up in the morning. I have very sensitive skin and it has not caused any irritation. I am so glad I found this product and I will buy other Korres products.
