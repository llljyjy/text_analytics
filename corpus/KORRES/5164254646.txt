This is the perfect moisturizer for younger or oilier skin types!! I read a suggestion to combine with a niacinamide serum. This combo is an absolute dream team. What i like about it is that when I wash my face at night I can feel the difference - hard to describe but it feels my moisture barrier is so much stronger and more intact!! And then of course this combo is doing great at keeping my skin from appearing oily. So this moisturizer is great for me in that it moisturizes but keeps grease at bay. Love it! lovely lightweight moisturizer
