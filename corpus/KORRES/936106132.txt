I was a bit nervous to try this cream because of the salicylic acid in it. I get dried out easily. The opposite happened with this product. It has a silky feeling and provides a lovely amount of moisture. My skin was glowing. I received this product to try complimentary in exchange for my honest review. Let it GLOW!
