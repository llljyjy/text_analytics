I recieved a sample of this free with compliments from Influester to review and give my honest opinion. I’m a 50 yr old woman, aging skin is a concern for me. Along with that are all the other things that become more problematic as our skin ages, pores are one of them. I tried this for about a week and noticed decent results, so feel that with continued use, the results would be stellar! I’ve always fought with my pores so this was a godsend to try out. I’d easily buy it. Not heavily perfu.ed, absorbs nicely and not greasy. All major pluses. Can be work under make or as a stand alone. A worthy try. Definitely worth a try
