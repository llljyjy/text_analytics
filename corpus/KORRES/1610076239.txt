I received a sample size of this product for free from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. I typically really like Korres products and I’ve used a handful of them, but I have to admit that this doesn’t strike me as anything special, and I am not sure it’s worth $36 for a full size. Granted, I’m not sure I’m the target audience, as I thankfully don’t have acne-prone skin anymore, and I’m not overly concerned about large pores. The formula is definitely light and has a pleasant, but not lingering scent, and it absorbs quickly. However, I usually also look for sun protection in a day cream, especially if I’m going to use an acne treating product like salicylic acid, and this does not have SPF Nothing special
