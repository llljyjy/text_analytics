Worth it. I received this for free and exchange for an honest review. I started to try it and loved it and then my oldest daughter decided she was going to try it and we both agreed that it was great it was light weight and good on our skin that just happens to be oily and dry and extra sensitive. So I ended up buying her and I our own after the sample was finished Not bad but great!
