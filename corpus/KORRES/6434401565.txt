I received this product as a complimentary for my honest review. I loved it. It is like a 5 in 1 lol. I tried the product for 4 days and I visibly saw a better appearance of less acne caused by the makeup. It hidrates your face but not that much but it still control shine. If you have combined face like me, try adding more hidration on the dry sides for better results. I loved how my face felt so soft, and a plus is the smell of it, i would definitly buy it from now on. Korres Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream
