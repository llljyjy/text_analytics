I received a 20ml sample to try from Influenster and Korres. I’ve used some Korres in the past and was excited to try this, even though my skin doesn’t love salicylic acid. But the scent is light and the texture thin and lightweight. My first few uses were during a hormonal point in my cycle and the moisturizer seemed to clear it it the next day! Yay!!! But then it stopped working and after a few days, the blemishes returned and kept recurring for the last 5 weeks. I think I’ll try a different moisturizer. Not for me
