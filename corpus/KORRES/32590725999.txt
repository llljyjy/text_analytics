I received a sample of Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream from vox box in exchange for my honest review. I have been using it for a couple weeks now. The cream itself feels smooth and lightweight. Goes on smooth and is hydrating. I cannot speak to the pore part as I do not have large pores,but either way I definitely recommend this cream! Lightweight, feels great!
