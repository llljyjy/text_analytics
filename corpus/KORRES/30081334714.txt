I received this product for free for me honest review. I liked this product. It went well under by makeup and did not leave an oily or sticky feel to my skin. I did not have enough product in the sample to use long enough to see the results as pictured, but the product was a good moisturizer for my skin and did not cause breakouts. Good Product
