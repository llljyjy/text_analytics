Loved it! I got this complimentary from Influenster to review with my honest opinion. I have dry skin and it gets worst in the winter. So adding this to my skin care routine was great. The consistency isnâ€™t too thick and heavy. And I personally felt like my skin felt much softer and hydrated after using it. nan
