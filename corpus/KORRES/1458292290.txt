I received this product free from Influenster for my honest review. I’m so glad I got this product as I’ve never bought Korres products before but I am a believer now. The smell is amazing but not overwhelming and although the cream is light it packs a hydrating punch! I’ve noticed that my pores seem smaller just after a week of using. I will definitely purchase this in the future. Great smell and super hydrating
