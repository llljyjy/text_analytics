I really enjoyed this moisturizer - itâ€™s light weight and provided gentle exfoliation. However, this is definitely not a moisturizing cream so may not work for dry skin types. I loved that it helped clear up some small pimples I had so I used it more like a serum. I also really like the scent (which I usually hate in skincare products) - reminds me of a sunny vineyard.
