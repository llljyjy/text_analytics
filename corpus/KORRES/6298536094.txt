Has a nice smell that is similar to other korres skincare products. Feels fairly light and sits on the skin well. I was hoping that the salicylic acid would help with acne but I didnâ€™t notice it do anything for my skin other than maybe help moisturize. I did receive a sample size for free to try in exchange for my honest review so if I had a full size and could try it for longer I may have noticed some effect. Decent
