(Reviewed comp of Influenster) This Santorini grape poreless moisturizer is PERFECT for my combination sensitive skin that’s prone to dehydration. It hydrates and smooths the appearance of pores and fine lines, gives radiance but is still lightweight that I can see myself using it during the summer too! Bonus is the scent is very very light, barely there in the container and once applied you don’t smell it at all and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin or sinuses. Perfection. Holy grail worthy?!!
