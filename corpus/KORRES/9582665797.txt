I received this product complimentary from Influenster to review. I really like how moisturizing it is. It doesnâ€™t leave a sticky residue on your skin and blends nicely with my makeup. I like that it has salicylic acid in it to help with my occasional acne. Overall this cream feels really nice and I recommend it to others. Moisturizing cream
