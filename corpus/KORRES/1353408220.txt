Ok, I really like this stuff. I also like Korres in general and have yet to get a bad product or product that I didn’t like, but this one is a LOVE! My skin is super picky and sensitive. Changing up my moisturizer or certain ingredients usually leads to bad breakouts or extra oil in my T-zone, but this did not happen with this at all.  I also like that it did not have a heavy scent to it, and it keeps my skin moisturized during this harsh New York winter.  The texture is amazing, smooths out so evenly and doesnt feel tacky at all.  It really did help to minimize my pores, too. It made a great canvas for makeup (in mornings) and wasnt too thick for nighttime use either. I’m keeping this one in my routine for sure. nan
