I enjoyed this product but I have very dry skin and it was quite drying for me. But my comedomes do heal faster if I use this over my spot treatment. Also I love the smell and feel of the cream. If they made this version for dry skin I wouldnâ€™t hesitate to get it. Lovely scent and texture but too drying for ME
