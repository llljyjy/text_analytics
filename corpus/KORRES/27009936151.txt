I recieved this product in exchange for my honest opinion from Influenster. I really enjoyed this moisturizer, it wasnâ€™t thick and absorbed into my skin quickly. It left my skin feeling smooth and hydrated, I also noticed that my pores looked a bit smaller after using this for a while. It also had a sweet flowery smell that I loved and it worked well with my sensitive skin. Lovely scent and texture
