I received these products for free from Influenster and brand in exchange for my honest review. As someone with acne prone skin, I’m always hesitant to use a cream on my skin. But, in the name of beauty, I was willing to try it out. My skin loves this! My gel moisturizer just wasn’t cutting it over the winter. I immediately noticed softer skin after one use. I continued to use for 2 weeks before reviewing to make sure it didn’t break me out. No break outs! None! My skin looks better and smoother than before. It remains balanced throughout the day. I love that it has salicylic acid in it. Perfect for me!
