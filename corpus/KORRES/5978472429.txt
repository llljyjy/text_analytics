This cream was smooth and lightly fragranced and I really enjoyed the way it left my skin feeling refreshed throughout the day. I have been using it in the morning in place of moisturizer and feel like my pores appear smaller and my skin is more clear. I received a sample of this product free in exchange for my review. nan
