I have super dry skin that’s sensitive so I was a bit worried about trying this but I shouldn’t have. I had a bit of hormonal breakout going on around my chin and this beautiful cream cleared that up within two days with ease. That’s salicylic acid for you. Texture is smooth and luxurious, there’s a faint scent to it but nothing over-the-top or artificial. I really enjoy this product despite it being advertised for oily/combination skin. I’ll keep this on my routine as it’s hard to find a good salicylic moisturizer that doesn’t dry out skin. This one is perfect. No more monthly breakouts
