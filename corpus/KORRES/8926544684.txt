This is a really nice day cream. I like to use it before applying makeup because of the poreless skin  claims. I can’t say it works magic but it definitely made my foundation apply nicely. I have dry skin so I wouldn’t use this as a night cream only because the texture isn’t as thick as I prefer. The scent is nice and minimal. nice day cream
