I received a free sample of this to try from Influenster and at first I was a little confused as to what the purpose of this product was. Is it a moisturizer?  Is it a primer?  The extremely limited description on the sample tube didnâ€™t really specify.  Compared to other moisturizers I have I found the texture of this to be a tad on the greasier side. The scent is pleasant.  The ingredients are definitely beneficial for many people.  Will I switch from what I use now to this?  Probably not, but will I continue to try it?  Sure. nan
