I have acne prone oily skin and I’ve battled with clogged pores my entire life. I have been using Poreless Skin Cream for over 2 weeks now. I’ve noticed a huge difference in my skin texture. My skin has cleared up and has been glowing thanks to the salicylic acid as an ingredient. It’s effective yet gentle! I received this product complimentary for testing purposes for my honest review. However, I would personally purchase this product because of its effectiveness and quality. nan
