This is a thicker cream but absorbs quickly and it is not greasy, I love thicker creams but cannot use them during the day because your makeup ends up melting off, BUT. somehow this cream magically nourishes my face and stays matte all day, my makeup doesn’t melt off or anything, I always try to find something like this and rotate many products because nothing works like this one. I got it complimentary from Influenster for my honest review. I will say this. I would never even knew this existed of if wasn’t for them. This cream is wonderful. For reference I have sensitive skin, combination skin and this cream did not make me break out, nothing and I have been using it daily for over a week now. Also I just seen the price. Wow, I will definitely be repurchasing. I expected this cream to be way more expensive. It is sooooo good!!!! Love this!!!
