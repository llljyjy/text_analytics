I love that this cream uses grapes as an ingredient as well as other natural ingredients. I believe the best and most effective products are those where science meets nature. The gentle smell is just right, not overpowering, but totally delicious.  It made my skin skin, my pores look less noticeable and my somewhat sensitive skin did not have any reactions to it.  It is not heavy feeling but my skin felt hydrated all day, even in the dry winter air. Cream smells like a dream!
