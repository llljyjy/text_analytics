Wouldn’t recommend with the experience I had. I will say that I have sensitive skin and have been pretty clear skin for awhile now. I felt I needed a new face wash because I started to see it wasn’t working as well. This seemed good review wise but this is by far the worst experience I’ve had with a cleanser. Made me break out like I was going through puberty. nan
