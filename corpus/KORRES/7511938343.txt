I got this #korres product from #influencer. It’s Korres Poreless SkinCream Badge and I really like it. I have tried other pore minimized products and they usually have that one ingredient that tends to bead up on my skin. I’ve always been a fan of this skin care. Probably 10 years or so, since I worked for Sephora. This product feels light and leaves my skin feeling smooth and not caked. I don’t know if it really did much for my pores, but it did help a tiny bit and felt better than other products I’ve tried, so I’d stick to using this one. @korres @influenster #ThatGreekGlow #complimentary @Influenster @Korres Love the feel
