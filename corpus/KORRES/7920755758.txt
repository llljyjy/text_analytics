This would be my holy grail were it not for the fragrance. Does wonders in terms of hydration and plumping. Unfortunately the fragrance is strong enough to trigger a headache for me. Some scents don’t bother me but this one did. If you’re unbothered by scent I would recommend highly. If they come out with a fragrance free version I’ll be all over it, but until then the search continues. nan
