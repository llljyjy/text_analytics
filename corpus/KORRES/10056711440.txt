I received this completely free from Influenster for my honest review. I have combination skin and have a hard time finding products to use on my face that won’t overly hydrate some parts of my face and I didn’t have that issue with this poreless facial moisturizer. I actually really enjoyed this product. Easy to rub into your skin, it’s not tacky/sticky feeling. It’s more soft and leaves your face looking amazing. I don’t use foundation much anymore and I really think it’s perfect for me it blurs out my imperfections just fine. Perfect
