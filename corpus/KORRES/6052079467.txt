I first got this as a sample about a year ago and wasn’t a fan. Don’t really know what drew me back in, but I’m really, really glad I gave this cleanser another chance. It’s helped reduced redness (in conjunction with a retinoid) to the point where I don’t feel the need for foundation. I truly hope they never change this formula! Gave It a Second Chance
