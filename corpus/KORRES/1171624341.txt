I was really excited to receive a sample of this Santoroni grape Poreless skin cream from Korres. It actually has a fairly lightweight and almost silky like texture. It absorbs very quickly, and doesn’t feel sticky. It’s nice underneath makeup, because it doesn’t ball up. I didn’t find this to necessarily be very pore refining, but it certainly can help with the texture. This was sent to me as a gift for testing purposes. silky smooth texture
