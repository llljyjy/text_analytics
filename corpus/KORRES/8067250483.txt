First off, I received a sample compliments of Influenster. I was so excited to try the pure ingredients from an ancient land. The story of how these santorini grapes are grown and harvested is so interesting! And the results left me very satisfied. After a weeks use, my skin was smoother, more primed for makeup application, and hydrated. My skin feels softer and my pores are much less noticeable than before. I recommend this product! Texture is nice and smooth I love the story behind the ingredients
