I received this complimentary sample from influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have been using this cream is conjunction with the santorini grape velvet skin drink and I am impressed. My skin became dry during pregnancy and has stayed that way with these winter months making it drier. The combination of the two products have left my skin hydrated but not oily which I was scared of since this cream comes out thick at first. The only reason I gave it 4 stars vs 5 is because I didnâ€™t notice much of a change in my pores even though it is called the poreless skin cream. nan
