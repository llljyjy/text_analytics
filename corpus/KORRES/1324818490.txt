Truly enjoy this product. I use it in the morning and it doesn’t strip away my skin leaving it dry. My 9 y/o daughter started using it as well when she started developing acne and it cleared it right up. No irritation or sensitivity at all. I’ve used this cleanser with my Mia2 cleansing brush as well as with a microfiber cleansing cloth and it works great with both. nan
