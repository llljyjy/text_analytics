I did receive this complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review but I did like this moisturizer. I probably would not have bought it on my own but it is a good product. If you have issues with acne the salicylic acid is definitely a plus! I have occasional breakouts but did not have any while using this. I have very dry skin and this was surprisingly moisturizing. There was a slight smell that reminded me of sun tan lotion but nothing overwhelming or unpleasant. It goes on smooth and leaves a silky feeling which I really loved. I kept it in my beauty fridge so the coolness felt nice after a long day. I did not notice any change in my pores though so I did take a star for that. I did like this product and if I wanted salicylic acid in my routine I would repurchase but otherwise I have better moisturizers more targeted to my skin concerns. Refreshing and moisturizing!
