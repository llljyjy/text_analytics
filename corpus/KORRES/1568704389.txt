I absolutely love this moisturizer! It has an amazing scent that smells like fermented grapes. Sooo good! It hydrates your skin and dries down very well so you can easily use it before makeup.  It has a nice texture and consistency. It pumps your skin and feels very refreshing! It doesnâ€™t make you oily which i like and appreciate.  I highly recommend this! Absolutely Amazing
