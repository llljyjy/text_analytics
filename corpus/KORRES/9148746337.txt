I received this product to try  from Influenster. I have combination skin that tends to run dry in the Midwest winters. Overall I felt this product did a good job at moisturizing. I couldn’t tell a difference in pore size appearance or anything. I have to admit I was confused as to what this product was when I got it. I didn’t know if it should be used as a moisturizer or a primer-type cream. Overall it was good..would be really good for oily skin nan
