While I did receive Korres Poreless Skin Cream complimentary, my opinions are honest and my own!As the years and stress stack up, I find it’s more and more it’s important to take the time to make an effort self care.However if I can keep quite a bit of that care to a minimum that never hurts! I try my best to keep a routine in the morning and evening, but generally once nighttime hits, I’m pretty done in. So sometimes five minutes seems a stretch. Korres makes it easy and gives me peace of mind in my time.The Korres Poreless Skin Cream feels so creamy and soaks right into my skin, just a small bit (about a quarter size) goes right onto my face and neck. It also doesn’t leave any kind of greasy or heavy feel, but it feels refreshing and like I’ve done my skin a real service.   It doesn’t have a heavy scent or perfume for those sensitive to either. Just clean and  if I had to put a scent to it, similar to classic sun screen (but only a bit).It also is close to my heart that they are cruelty free!I very much enjoyed my experience trying this skin cream and have a feeling my skin will thank me for continuing its use!! Excellent for you and your Pores!
