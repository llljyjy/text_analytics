I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. I’ve been enjoying the Korres Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream. It’s creamy yet lightweight and goes on smooth. It absorbs quickly feels and feels instantly hydrating. The moisture and hydration levels work well for daytime. I need a little extra moisture for nighttime though. As for results, I’ve noticed smoother, more balanced, and more refined skin. I also enjoyed the fresh white grape scent. nan
