This product did smell good and it made my skin feel soft. I’m not so sure how “poreless“ it actually made my skin. I did not use this 2xs a day, but I used it in my morning routine. I feel that there are others on the market, that claim to do the same things, that are better.. This is just MY honest review in exchange for a free sample of this product. It's OK.
