I received this product complimentary from Influenster and KORRES for my honest review! I have huge pores that are so embarrassing and it’s either put on heavy make-up to hide them or they just stick out like a sore thumb.  I had my doubts at 1st since I’ve had such a hard time finding a product that meets my expectations.  It was unbelievable when I noticed results after just one application. This poorless skin cream by KORRES brings multiple benefits beyond diminishing pores. At almost 91% natural it also has Salicylic Acid which brings  preventative measures of a break out from acne while smoothly balances the size of  your pores. If it hasn’t done enough as it is this product is hydrating without leaving residue or stickiness like so many other facial products.  Myself personally don’t have sensitivities but I know plenty of women that can’t use a product because the scent is overwhelming. If that’s you then look no further because the scent is hardly noticeable and not overbearing. I thought the price point would be off putting for those of us living with a budget. It was important for me to mention that the price point is actually unbelievably low compared to quality and quantity. A little bit goes a long, long way. I’m tired of spending money on cheaper items up front but using 10x’s the product per application which leads to needing to purchase the cheaper products more frequently. So don’t allow this price point to question your purchase because you get your bang for your buck times over. This is my newest secret weapon against my larger than life pores. Amazing Results
