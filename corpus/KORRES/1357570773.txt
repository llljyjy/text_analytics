This was surprisingly heavy for a gel moisturizer. The first few times I tried it I couldn’t figure out why my face felt all cakey by mid day like I was wearing makeup. I finally figured out it was this. I switched back to my normal moisturizer and the feeling was gone. When it went on it felt ok but by the end of the day I felt like I needed to wash my face desperately.I attempted to try this with and without makeup and didn’t like the finish either way. It def didnt matte out my face like it said it would.The grape scent was like couch medicine - not fresh grapes which was disappointing.For reference, I have combination skin and live in a hot and humid state. Felt like makeup
