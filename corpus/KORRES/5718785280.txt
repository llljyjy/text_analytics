Let me start by saying that my skin is very dry and sensitive with texture. I have contact dermatitis with a large number of ingredients I can react to. While I have a solid list of things to avoid, there are still a lot of things that are really just trial and error. I’m happy to say that I had no reactions to this moisturizer. .When you look up this moisturizer it is described as “A lightweight gel moisturizer that blurs pores, controls shine, and hydrates skin all-day“. First it is very lightweight feeling. But is it a gel moisturizer? It’s called a skin cream, it looks like a cream,  and it feels like a cream. I don’t think this is a gel. Does it blur pores? Maybe slightly, but probably not as much as some of the other pore blurring moisturizers I have tried. Does it control shine? I don’t know, I’m not oily so there is no shine to control. Does it hydrate all day? No, not for me, not on it’s own. It says can be used both day and night, but it’s just not moisturizing enough for me, especially at night. It makes a better day cream for me. .Additional thoughts. This is very smoothing to the skin. It made my skin feel smoother than it had in a long time. It also was really great under makeup applications. Not all moisturizers work well under makeup, but this was great. Makes a good day cream
