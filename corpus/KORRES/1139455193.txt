I’ve been using this twice a day for a few days and my skin looks good. I wasn’t sure if I was going to like this as the scent it a little off-putting but my redness and pores seem to be diminished. It absorbs into my skin well and dries down so it doesn’t feel tacky. My skin doesn’t feel as hydrated as it usually does, but it could be due to the cold weather. I haven’t had any breakouts or irritation on my highly reactive skin. I would recommend this for someone who doesn’t have dry skin like me. nan
