My skin is oily, but I mix this in with my moisturizer, (I use the BIOSSANCE squalane + probiotic gel moisturizer), and I hardly have oil at all anymore! This leaves my skin soft and smooth without drying out my skin. Oil production and the amount and frequency of acne I get is controlled now and I am loving it! The best mix in!
