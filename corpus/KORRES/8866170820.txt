I love this cream! It’s pretty thick in texture,and just smooths over my face effortlessly. I’venoticed it does blur my pores, and does keepme from becoming too oily throughout theday. It also smells like a dream. I knocked onestar off because it’s not as hydrating as l’dprefer for my moisturizers, but still like itnonetheless. nan
