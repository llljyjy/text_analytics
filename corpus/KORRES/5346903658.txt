I got a sample size of this product complimentary from Influenster for my honest review and I really love it! I have combo skin with an oily t-zone that gets occasional breakouts. This moisturizer was very lightweight and has a nice but light grape scent. It really helped to control the oiliness in my t-zone but still felt hydrating on my skin. I didn’t notice any reaction to it but I will be curious to see how my skin does with it after an extended period since it does have a small amount of salicylic acid. It’s been really hard to find a good lightweight moisturizer that controls my oily t-zone so I’m excited I got to try this and will definitely be buying the full size product! Love it!
