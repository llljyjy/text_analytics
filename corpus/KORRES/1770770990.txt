It’s winter, in Wisconsin and this just wasn’t my jam. My skin is normal and I usually don’t have any issues with my pores so when I’m using a moisturizer (especially when it’s cold) I want something that’s hydrating and makes my skin feel great. Unfortunately I didn’t get that from this product. I used it about 4 times before I gave up on it and each time withing an hour I needed to put my normal moisturizer on my skin because it felt dried out.  I must not be the ideal candidate for this moisturizer because I really didn’t like it... pass! I wasn't a fan
