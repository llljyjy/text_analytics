This product was sent to me complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I actually really like this moisturizer. I have oily skin and that’s what this moisturizer is formulated for. It absorbs quickly into the skin, doesn’t feel greasy or heavy, and makes my skin feel nice. Makeup applies really well over it. I don’t think it reduces the appearance of pores. But other than that, I am impressed and would purchase this with my own money. I like it
