I thought this product was nice! It melted well in my skin, there wasn’t a heavy scent, and it was like a soft cream. I let it sit for about 10 minutes and my skin felt soft, I didn’t see too much of a difference in pores but I like that this is a clean product and doesn’t test on animals! Pretty good!
