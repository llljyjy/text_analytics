Thank you to Influenster for giving me a sample to try! I have combination skin and this cream did make my chin get oily after I used it before bed. The texture was a creamy one and the scent is super light so you don’t really smell much. I would prefer a more perfumey but light scent but this might be good for people that don’t like much scent. While not for my particular skin type, this might be good for other skin types. nan
