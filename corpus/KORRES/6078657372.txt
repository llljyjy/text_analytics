 I was excited to try the Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream by Korres, because I’m a skincare addict and I’ve enjoyed some other products from Korres in the past. I received this complimentarily in exchange for my honest review.  My skin is mostly pretty dry, but I sometimes have an oily T-zone, and definitely struggle with large pores in my nose area. A moisturizer that can decrease the appearance of pore size definitely sounds good to me! It’s not the most moisturizing moisturizer I’ve ever tried, so being January, it’s definitely something I’m only going to use during the day and not at night. It has no added smell, which I like. I have used in combination with a few serums and sunscreen and the result is good. I don’t notice a difference in my pore size after a few uses, but I didn’t really expect to. Keeping an exfoliation routine and a weekly mud mask has always been my best defense against large pores, so I look at this as more of a way to support that, rather than do miracles on it’s own. I’ll definitely continue to use this because it’s a well performing day cream that does it’s job! Nice moisturizer
