I LOVE Korres Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream!! I tend to have dry skin in the winter months, however, I started using Korres Poreless Skin Cream at night. The next morning my face was smooth & hydrated. Itâ€™s more of a lightweight gel moisturizer that blurs pores, controls shine, & hydrates your skin all day. It has a powerful blend of Hyaluronic Acid, Salicylic Acid, & is rich in antioxidants, from Santorini Grape.I highly recommend using this Korres Poreless Skin Cream. Skin stays hydrated all day
