I received this product complimentary from Influenster I return for my honest opinion. That opinion says that I am not recommending this item. It smells horribly and is not creamy and emollient! Although I did see more smoothness and calming to my skin, this product didn’t really address my need for hydration. Again, the smell was overwhelmingly bad. I can’t recommend. It’s a no for me
