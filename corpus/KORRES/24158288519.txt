I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. The good: smells nice, no pilling, absorbs quickly, no greasy residue. The bad: made a rosacea acne spot flare up extremely badly & I haven’t been able to calm it after I quit using this 9 days ago, saw absolutely zero changes in my skin, made me have a full face breakout & I have never in my entire teen or adult life had a full face of acne, I’m unsure how this “blurs” pores as pores do not shrink, open or close. As an esthetician this is a very hard pass & I regret testing it on myself. nan
