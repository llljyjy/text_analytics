Overall I found this cream to be nice but not quite moisturizing enough for my skin in the winter season. I would be more likely to continue using this in the summer when the air is less drying. This moisturizer has a nice consistency somewhere between a cream and a gel that absorbs quickly into the skin and doesn’t leave my skin feeling sticky or looking shiny. It sits well under makeup and doesn’t cause any issues when applying makeup over it. It doesn’t leave my skin feeling as moisturized as other creams that I’ve used so I prefer to use it as a day cream. I appreciate that is dermatologically tested and it didn’t cause any irritation to my skin or breakouts. I didn’t notice an improvement in my breakouts with this cream but my skin doesn’t tend to have good results from salicylic acid. I didn’t notice a significant difference in the size of my pores with this product. The packaging is a nice color and I appreciate that it is recyclable. The moisturizer has an pleasant, interesting scent that reminds me of grapes and a little like cherries. I like that is cruelty free, silicone free, and vegan friendly. Nice but not quite moisturizing enough for winter
