I have used to this product for a full week and it is the perfect addition to your moisturizing routine. especially in the winter. I go for outdoor walks in 20-30 degree weather regularly for at least 45 minutes so my skin is begging for hydration and this Korres product feels so good every time I lather it on my face. Will continue to buy. Delightful and light on the skin
