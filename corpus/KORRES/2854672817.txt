I received a trial size from Influenster and Korres in exchange for my honest review. I have oily skin and large pores on my nose, as well as some around the nose area. I’ve been using this cream for almost 2 weeks and I’ve seen some differences. I like that it’s very lightweight, which is my top priority when it comes to a day cream. I used it only in my day routine and it worked fine. It smoothed my skin and I see my large pores were shrunk just after about 3-4 days of use. I’m glad they put both salicylic acid and hyaluronic acid in one product, keeping your skin hydrated while preventing the possible dryness and harshness of salicylic acid. Oily skin friendly
