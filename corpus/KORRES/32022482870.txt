I received a free sample size of this product and was excited to try it out on my large pores and oily t-zone. I will say after using for a week, I noticed my t-zone is not as oily throughout the day and seems more moisturized. As far as my pores becoming less visible, I have not seen a difference. I will stick to my benefit porebegone for immediate results and hope by the time I finish the bottle that this product provides somewhat diminished pores. Just Okay
