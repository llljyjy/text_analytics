I really like this Korres Poreless skin cream. I always have issues with my foundation sinking into my pores and texture so I have to use a heavy duty primer that sometimes dries my skin out. Iâ€™ve been able to use a lot less primer since switching to the Korres Poreless skin cream. It does a good job of leaving my skin smooth and hydrated. It has a very light scent and absorbs and sets quickly. Hydrating and Smoothing
