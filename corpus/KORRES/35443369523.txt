The cream I received was Santorini Grape Poreless skin cream. The subtle scent of grape is nice as sometimes products have overpowering scents. Not this awesome skin cream! I havenâ€™t been using the sample regularly but the many times I have it was gentle on my sensitive skin. It is not greasy or sticky like some creams can be. Overall it was hydrating, gentle to my sensitive skin and a great skincare cream I will continue to use. nan
