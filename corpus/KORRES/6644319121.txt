I am in love with Korres products and this cream is no different! I have been watching the weekly Facebook chat on Korres’ page and the explanation of the products is so fascinating! I loved learning about the resilience of the Santorini grape and how beneficial this ingredient is in drawing moisture into the skin.  Also, learned an amazing tip to apply moisturizer on top of a facial mist to really facilitate absorption. I love the brand’s commitment to quality and attention to detail. nan
