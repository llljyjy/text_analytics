I received a sample of this to try and review.  I have tried a few other products and loved all of them so I was excited to try this.  The consistency is a little bit thicker than I expected it to be but it doesn’t feel heavy.  I still use a moisturizer after this and it doesn’t feel like it’s too much.  My skin feels softer and smoother the next day. nan
