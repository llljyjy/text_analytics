I did not have the greatest expectations of this product from the product description. However, I actually really love this product, it has really done some miracles with my skin. I used to break out on my forehead a bit, but now that isn’t even happening. Besides that, my Dry skin problem around my nose has almost entirely disappeared, which has made me happier as Foundation doesn’t cake there any longer. I would definitely recommend this product, although I wish it had retinol, but I’ve supplemented with tonics for that. Balanced, Hydrated, and Pro Sensitive Skin
