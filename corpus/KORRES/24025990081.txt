I received Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review so here it is, the cream itself is very nice blends in smoothly and efficiently and seems to work well, however the smell was just not something that I liked. Iâ€™m glad I got a sample of this to try because if I was to look at it in the store I would have smelled it and not purchased, but with seeing how nicely it worked I can get passed the smell. So yes I would purchase this. Korres skin cream
