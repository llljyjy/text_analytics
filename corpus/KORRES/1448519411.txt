I received a complimentary sample of this cream. I will say, this seems like a quality face cream. It haslittle to no scent, which I like, and the texture is niceThe only part I do not like about this cream is that itisnâ€™t oil free. Unfortunately on the two occasions I triedmy cream, I broke out more than I typically would. Iassume because of the oils. good product, just not for me
