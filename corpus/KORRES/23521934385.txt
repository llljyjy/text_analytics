I was a little torn because I wanted to absolutely love this.  It felt pretty good going on but a little greasy.  Like it wasn’t absorbing well.  It did make my skin feel smooth at first but through the day it felt like it was clumping.  I haven’t used much with salacylic acid in it so it may be the cause. nan
