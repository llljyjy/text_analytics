I’ve received a sample size of this cream in exchange for my honest review. It doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. It left my skin feeling fresh and smooth. This product is weightless but it gives me the moisture I need. The smell is very refreshing. I still don’t notice any improvement on my pores but I will be using it more days to see what happens. Good product
