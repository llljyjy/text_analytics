I really liked this moisturizer. I received it complimentary to test and I was a bit nervous throwing a new product into my already established routine. Iâ€™m happy to say that I had no side effects from introducing this product into my regular routine. I like the consistency of the product. It blends well into my skin. It has left my skin feeling smooth and well moisturized. I really like it! Great moisturizer!
