I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. It is very moisturizing and lightweight. I love that there is not a strong scent. I’m very happy with the ingredient list as well. It does make your face feel smooth, and I do feel that it helped to minimize some of my pores. The only thing was for me I did not feel like it helped to mattify my skin tone. Which I would’ve liked to have seen a little bit more of. But overall great lightweight, silky moisturizer. nan
