I kinda love this product. The fact that its moisturizing and has salicylic acid in it is fantastic. I donâ€™t have a lot of acne but when I get one or two during *that time of the month*, its always annoying and a huge bummer. Not to mention the mask-ne. This kind of staves all that off WHILE moisturizing. Would definitely buy this. nan
