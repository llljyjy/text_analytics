This poreless skin cream surprised me. I have very sensitive and dry skin and I did not have any bad reactions to this formula. Typically, I do. I use it daily in my skin care regimens and it goes over well with my serums and all without feeling too thick or oily. It does reduce the appearance of pores, and I can see that around my nose area usually. I have many scars and it never made them more apparent or rashy. I plan to keep this skin cream in my regimen and I am really happy I got this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. Sensitive Skin Review!
