Love this cream. I’ve never used it before but plan on stocking up on this. I have combination skin and this gave a flawless and effortless look. Surprisingly my makeup didn’t look or feel greasy when used before application and it’s scent isn’t strong which is a plus. All in all, I definitely recommend. Love it!
