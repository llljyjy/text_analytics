The Santorini grape poreless skin cream is lightweight on my skin and help mattify oily skin while holding moisture in the skin. The cream smells like tropical sunblock which smells great. I like the scent cream and it did not cause any irritation on my skin. I think this cream is best for combination and oily skin since there is salicylic acid. The cream helps make my pores smaller and keeps my skin from being very oily. Controls shine and moisturizing
