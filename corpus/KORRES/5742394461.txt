This is a lightweight and hydrating moisturizer that does somewhat diminish the look of pores. However, applying face makeup over top of it, even when given ample time to sink in, it balled up and had awful texture. this would be a great moisturizer to wear without makeup, but a poor choice if youâ€™ll be wearing makeup on top. Solid moisturizer, not great under makeup
