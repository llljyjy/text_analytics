I really like this moisturizer and kind of feels like a primer. It’s light weight but very hydrating and great for dry skin. It leaves a super smooth finish and has a very good consistency of not being too thick or thin. Also smells very good! Def recommend if you’re looking for a new hydrating moisturizer!
