I received the Korres skin cream as part of my complimentary Influenster box. I was rather disappointed with the product. I used it on my face and neck and felt that it did not leave my skin feeling hydrated and there definitely wasn’t a glow. I don’t think the product is scented, but I wasn’t a fan of the smell of the cream. Mediocre Skin Cream
