I like this product so far, not sure if I’d buy it. (I received a sample size for review purposes). It smells earthy and natural, which I like, and overall seems to be a nice moisturizer, but it’s intended for non-dry skin and supposed to minimize the appearance of pores, my which aren’t my skin specific needs. I wouldn’t discourage others from giving it a try and I’ll use up my sample product. If I more any changes with continued use, I’ll update my review! ❤️ Pore Minimizing
