I’ve been using Korres Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream for a few weeks now on my nose. I have had very large pores on my nose for a few years now. After using Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream I have definitely seen a difference in the size of my pores. I received this as a sample trial, but I will definitely continue to use this product. It’s been a great find for me! My pores look better!
