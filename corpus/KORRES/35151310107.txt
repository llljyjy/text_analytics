I received this product complimentary form Korres & Influenster in exchange for my honest review.This product felt very light on my face and gave me the perfect amount of moisture for my dry face! I took one star away because I can’t stand the smell. I’m definitely a person that loves scented creams so this one smells awful to me. nan
