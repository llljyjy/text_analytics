This is really good! I bought this on a whim on the Sephora sale. I love it. I’m a double cleanser, so I don’t expect this to take off my make up on it’s own. I use in the morning and after I take off my make up for the day My skin is soft, cleansed a not strip dry I don’t know about redness or any of the other mumbo jumbo but it makes my skin feel cleansed and comfortable this is really good
