I originally got a free sample size and was floored by the “velvet” feeling this left on my skin, so I purchased the full size. When you get a full-size, you’ll see that the packaging is a little sneaky in that they don’t fill it to full capacity. It’s very similar to the effect you’d get from using rosehip oil on your skin, except this product is more viscous. I honestly prefer rosehip oil. The smell is pretty strong. A little bit from the dropper goes a long way. Seems to be temperamental in regards to what other products you can layer it with. A little bit “meh”.
