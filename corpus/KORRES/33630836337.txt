After cleansing my face with a scrub product, I would dry my face with a cleansing wipe before applying the cream. I love that the cream is light and have a soft scent. I loved that it leaves my skin feeling hydrated. My face feels moisturized for the entire day. I also loved that it is not oily. nan
