I had received this product complimentary for testing purposes. I really like the way that this skin cream applies to the skin and the subtle fruity scent that it has. My favorite ingredient in this product is salicylic acid since I have acne-prone skin.  However, I’m not sure if it’s due to the winter weather, but I felt that my skin was quite dry when I used this product. I tried to use this product no more than 3 times a week as the moisturizer step of my nighttime skincare routine after cleansing my face. I would like to see how my skin reacts to this product during the Summer when the weather isn’t as dry. I would recommend if you have acne-prone skin but probably not suitable for the Winter months if you have combination skin like I do! Nice, Subtle Scent, Light Gel-Like Texture
