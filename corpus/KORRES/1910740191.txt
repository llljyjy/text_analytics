I received a sample of this newly launched cream from Korres and Influenster (thank you!). I enjoyed trying it for sure, I don’t think there’s enough product for a full two week trial of twice a day applications/to get the full advertised results. That said, it was enough for me to form an opinion! I liked the blurring effect/dewiness and the light (fresh/green) scent. I think it’sa nice primer (especially for evenings, since it’s so hard to layer anything with sunscreens but it’s so important to guard against skin cancer). All in all I like this cream and will definitely consider a purchase in the future. nan
