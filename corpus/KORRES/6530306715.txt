This cream was nice and moisturizing it helped clear up my skin and didn’t dry me out excessively. I honestly wasn’t big on the fact that it was scented since I have sensitive skin. It also seemed to make my pores appear smaller. I would recommend this if you have large pores and acne prone skin, just be careful if your skin is sensitive. Pretty good.
