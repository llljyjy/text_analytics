I  received this KORRES Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.  This is a really nice gel moisturizer that feels very lightweight on the skin, but itâ€™s also very hydrating and nourishing.  I like that it controls my oily zones and blures pores, and the hydration lasts all day without feeling heavy on my skin. The scent is very faint and non-irritating.  While I do prefer something a little heavier for the dry winter months, I will definitely be using this more in the spring and summer! Controls shine and blurs pores
