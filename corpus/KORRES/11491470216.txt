Not sure yet if I limed it or not, the consistensy of this cream feels like an aqua gel or aqua cream, very lightly, which i dont like in this season of the year, i wish it was more moisturizer. After apply it into my skin ot feels so dry, i will keep using it inmy for a week just to see if i see a difference in my pores. No scent at all. left my skin super dry
