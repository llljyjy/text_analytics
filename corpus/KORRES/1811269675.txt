I got this as a free sample and wanted to give it a fair shot. The smell initially is really weird, kinda like a dairy product nearing expiration, but it goes away fast. I don’t like the way it sits on my skin, it never really fully absorbs and feels sticky and tacky and yet tight at the same time. I can feel my face and it’s not a good feeling. I have oily combo skin and this just makes my face feel super dry, I can’t imagine how someone with dryer skin would deal with it. Overall not a fan. Not a fan.
