This moisturizer is great for this changing weather. The formula is a bit thick but goes on very smooth. It did not make me break out or add any more oil to my face. It definitely added hydration through the day. The scent of this moisturizer is light and very pleasant. I would buy this for myself in the future or as a gift to others. Love that this product is clean at Sephora! Great moisturizer!
