I got this product for free from Influenster and Korres for testing purposes in exchange for my honest review. It wasnâ€™t bad at all. I love the ingredients and I love what it did to my pores. With the first application I felt my pores were cleaned to the max. I like this as a serum because this it a bit drying as a moisturizer. I also prefer this as a night treatment as it did not work that good in the day time under my makeup. It is too drying. But at night if I need to detox my pores and get rid of some maskne. This is it!!! It works so well at clearing up the skin and keeping your pores look amazing. I would love to try the cleanser that goes with this moisturizer. Great for pores but needs more anti-aging features
