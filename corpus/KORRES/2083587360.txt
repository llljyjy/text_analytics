I would like to begin by saying the cream is a nice consistency. I have oily skin and visible larger pores. With that being said,  it was more like a gel.  It left my skin feeling refreshed and not oily it was a nice base for makeup. I did not see any significant changes in my skin, but I have been using it only for 3 weeks.  I would not buy it on my own as this was a sample given to review. The long story short it is a decent moisturizer for a person with oily skin.  A lightweight gel moisturizer that blurs pores, controls shine and hydrates skin all day using a powerful blend of Hyaluronic Acid, Salicylic Acid, Willowherb Extract, and the antioxidant-rich, Santorini Grape.Korres Poreless Skin Cream Badge#ThatGreekGlow  I received theseproducts for free from Influenster and Korres in exchange for my honest review.
