I really love this moisturizer! At first I thought it may be drying due to the acid and me having the dry est winter skin. I’ve been using it in the mornings and it keeps my skin smooth and bright, perfectly prepped for make up or even just a little spf in a no makeup day. I don’t notice that it makes any improvement in the visibility of my pores, but my skin overall looks healthy and brighter. Definitely recommend! Great!
