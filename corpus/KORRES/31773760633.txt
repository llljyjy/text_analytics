My skin is generally non-problematic, I don’t get many blemishes nor do I experience any of the typical issues or sensitivity one can have with their skin. I do experience some dryness in the winter months so I was excited to see how this product helps with that. I’ve been using this product for about 2 weeks and it’s not shown me any added benefits from other facial moisturizers I’ve used. Don’t get me wrong, it is a good product- hydrates the skin, composed of mostly natural ingredients, little fragrance, not expensive. I just don’t think I would switch from my usual routine to use this product. Good moisturizer
