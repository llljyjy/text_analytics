I received this product complimentary to review for my honest opinion. I love this stuff. I’ve used it for about a week under my makeup in replacement of my moisturizer and primer. It kept my skin hydrated and matte. It has been a pleasure using this product. I’ll definitely be adding this to my go to products. Love This!!!
