I received a sample from Influenster. I love this gel moisturizer. I noticed clearer pores which led to less breakouts. Goes amazing with foundation, no piling. Has a slight flowery smell but it goes away. I recommend this moisturizer for people with sensitive acne prone skin. I have sensitive skin and I had no reaction. My skin loves it. Buying a full size.
