This moisturizer did not WOW me, I didnâ€™t like or dislike it. I did like the texture of the moisturizer and it performed very well under my foundation. I will say that it did not do ANY of the claims except moisturize...  It did not blur my pores or control shine but it did hydrate my skin very well. Just another moisturizer
