I love this. I have super red sensitive skin - literally just touching my face makes it red. The texture of this product is amazing, foams, smells so good (very light sent) and your skin feels so good after. No tightness, redness, dryness etc. 100% recommend and I’m saying that after trying almost every cleanser known to (wo)man for redness. The best I’ve tried for redness.
