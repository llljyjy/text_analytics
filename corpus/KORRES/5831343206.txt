While I do think this would be a nice cream for oily/combo skin, for my dry winter skin this cream simply wasn’t cutting it. I think this product does have some nice ingredients and a nice light weight texture, it simply wasn’t moisturizing my skin enough. Additionally I didn’t personally see the skin clearing/pore reducing effect this cream claims to have, though I don’t particularly have acne or larger pores. Again I do think this is a nice product, my skin is simply not the demographic for this cream. Decent Cream, just not enough for dry winter skin
