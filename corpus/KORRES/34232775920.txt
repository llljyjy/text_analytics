This is the best night cream I have never used. I’ve been using it for over a year! The texture is delightful, much like a whipped product so it’s light but very hydrating. There is no pilling and leaves your face baby soft. I’ve noticed my complexion is more even, skin is soft, and there’s less dullness. The scent isn’t overbearing which is a huge plus. 10/10 would recommend time and time again does the work while you sleep!
