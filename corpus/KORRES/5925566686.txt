Loved this product! I’m always on the lookout to try and test hydrating products since my skin is really dry specially on the cheek and chin area, and I’m pleased with the results given by this cream. My skin absorbed the product really well and did not leave a greasy or thick feeling afterwards like other creams do. nan
