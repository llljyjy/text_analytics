I got this product complimentary for testing purposes and absolutely love it. My skin is combination and it didnâ€™t dry it out or make it oily. The skin blurring seemed kind of minimal but still feels good on the skin. The smell is very mild. I like the benefits this product does for my face. Grapes on the skin
