I received a complimentary sample for my honest review. I really enjoy the poreless skin cream. Itâ€™s light weight and not oily. I use it when I first wake up and before bed. It leaves my skin feeling moisturized and smooth. It does help minimize the look of my pores. I look forward to continuing to use it in my skin care routine. Gentle and Effective
