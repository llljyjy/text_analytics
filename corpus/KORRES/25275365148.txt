The Salicylic Acid will actually make your skin tingle, which I love because then I know itâ€™s working! It made my fine lines and pores blur and gave light moisturize. I did need to use an oil as well, because the winter is so dry! I received as a free sample from Influenster, but I would buy this! Feel the tingle!
