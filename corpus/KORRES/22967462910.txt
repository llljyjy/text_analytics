I like that this is a nice lightweight cream with a pleasant scent. I am able to wear it under my foundation without any issue. I have only been using this during my oily skin days and it seems to help keep things under control. Usually my skin is pretty dry, so this wonâ€™t be my usual go-to daily lotion. It would be great for anyone looking for a lightweight cream with breakout-prone skin. I received a sample size product complimentary from Influenster for my honest review.
