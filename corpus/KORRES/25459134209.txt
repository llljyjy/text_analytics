The pros: the consistency feels awesome, it doesn’t smell gross / weird like the first aid beauty one does IMO, it makes your face feel refreshed, it doesn’t burn or sting your eyes or dry patches, now the cons: it’s extremely expensive for a cleanser, ( I bought mine on sale ) also if you have like extremely dry skin it may make your skin feel pretty  tight... I have dry skin and it does leave a tiny bit of that tight feeling but nothing I can’t handle. Over all I like would I pay 35 dollars for a cleanser though? Probably not. On sale ? Yes. nan
