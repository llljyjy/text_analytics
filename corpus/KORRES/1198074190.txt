Gel moisturizer that is lightweight and moisturizes all day without making my face shiny. I didnâ€™t feel greasy at all and my skin felt so soft immediately after using it. Pores do appear slightly smaller as well. This is a great daily moisturizer even for my hormonal acne prone skin. Great Moisturizer!
