I received this product for free from Influenster and Korres in exchange for my honest review. I really love this poreless skin cream. I’ve been using it almost 2 weeks now and there is such a difference in my face. I have really dry skin and it’s always hard to find products that don’t make it worse. This product is not oily and has the lightest scent which I enjoy. I use it before putting on foundation and my make up sits so much better. I also use it after showers before bed. I will definitely buy more and continue to use. My skin looks so much healthier and hydrated. I highly recommend. Great for dry skin!
