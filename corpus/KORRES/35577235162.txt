I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. I noticed an initial improvement in the dryness of my skin, but I also noticed an increase in breakouts. I didn’t notice my skin gaining any sort of clarity. The cream doesn’t smell great either. For the cold, Midwest winters, and my acne-prone skin, I need something with longer last moisturizing, that isn’t going to cause me to break out. I would not buy this product again. Not for severely dry or acne prone skin
