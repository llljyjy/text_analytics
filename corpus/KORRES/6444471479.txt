I recieved this free from Influenster, but found I really actually enjoyed it. I used it as a part of my a.m. skin care routine, right before sunscreen. The hydration it provides is really fantastic, and though not as extreme as my silicone based primers, it does provide a decent smoothing effect on my skins texture. I would definitely consider purchasing this when I need to replace my regular moisturizer. nan
