I received a complementary sample of this from Influenster in my latest VoxBox. I have completed the same size and itâ€™s a really gentle and nice product. I love the skin care ingredients within the cream and left my skin feeling smooth and hydrated.  There is a subtle fragrance with this but nothing too powerful but I felt it smelled clean and citrus like. Not my favorite smell for skin care but nothing worth not trying it out. I did enjoy this product. Definitely worth a try! Left my skin smooth
