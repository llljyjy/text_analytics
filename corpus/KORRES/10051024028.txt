I received this cream complimentary from Korres in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been enjoying this cream for over a week now. The scent is very light and clean. I have normal to dry skin and this cream really gets the job done. It’s light to medium in texture and leaves my face looking and feeling lovely. It’s not greasy at all. I do recommend this product and will be purchasing the full size. Great stuff
