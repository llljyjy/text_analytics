Just got this through influenster. This cream has smooth consistency and has a smell of olive oil. It was easy to apply/spread on the face and give me a smooth finish. However I do feel a slight burning sensation if the lotion is applied around the eye area. Otherwise, good face cream for the price. Overall decent but, Slight burning around the eye
