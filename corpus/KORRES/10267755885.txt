I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I started using this as a night time cream but it irritated my sensitive skin. It is thicker than what Iâ€™m used to using over night. It has salicylic acid which I love so I decided to try it again on my acne concerns. It did clear up my acne fast but still gave me slight irritation under my nose. I would not buy this product in the future. I wish it worked out for me since it has many great reviews but my skin is just too sensitive. nan
