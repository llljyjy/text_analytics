First of all, the scent on this is great! I don’t know what’s in it but it was definitely captivating and fresh smelling and I was at a spa for a minute if I close my eyes. I only used a dime size for my whole face and it was quickly absorbed into my skin even after applying my serums and essences. It didn’t break me out at all. I thoroughly enjoyed using it as it was given to me complimentary for testing purposes. nan
