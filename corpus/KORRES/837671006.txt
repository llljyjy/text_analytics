I’ve tried several Korres products and have loved them all. This cream even though it’s not for my combo/dry skin was still nice. It’s lightweight, smells nice and I love the ingredients. My skin lacked moisture but that doesn’t mean it’s a bad product. I’ve always had good results with Korres and I trust my skin to them. I added a couple of drops of a rose hip oil and voila. My skin felt great and my makeup looked really nice. I will definitely recommend! Great
