I have combo skin so my face loves moisturizers like this Korres Santorini Grape Poreless Cream. It is absorbed quickly and leaves my skin moisturized without feeling too heavy or oily. It hard to tell right away if it will make a difference on my pores but so far, it hasnâ€™t caused any allergic reaction to my sensitive skin. nan
