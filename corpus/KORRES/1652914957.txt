This is a lighter gel moisturizer that feels like on my skin and absorbs quickly.  This will be good for the summer months when my skin isnâ€™t as dry.  It created a nice base for my makeup.  Would likely use this more as a daytime summer moisturizer as my skin tends to be more on the dry side, but I think if your skin is a little more oily this would be great. nan
