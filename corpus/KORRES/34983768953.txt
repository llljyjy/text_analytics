I received this product as a complimentary sample through Influenster in exchange for my honest review! Love this product. Smells amazing, but still subtle enough that the fragrance doesnâ€™t react with my skin. This product is excellent at reducing shine on my face as well as the appearance of pores. It also has a slightly sticky texture when applied (in a good way!) that I believe also makes it an excellent makeup primer as well. I am very grateful to Influenster for the complimentary sample and hope to purchase this product full-size in the future! Thank you, Influenster :)
