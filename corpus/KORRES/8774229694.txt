I have combination skin and worry about what new products may do to my skin. This is a light weight cream and it seemed to smooth and soften my skin. I didnâ€™t notice any pores under my makeup after application but would have to use for a longer period to confirm a major difference in my pores. Overall, I recommend it. great product
