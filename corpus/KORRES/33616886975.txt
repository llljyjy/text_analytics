I received this product for free from Influenster and Korres in exchange for my honest feedback. I applied the moisturizer to my face and it went on smooth and felt nice. There was not an oily or greasy feeling once on my face. It dried quickly and to a nice velvety texture. It reduced the look of my pores and made my skin look more even. I used this moisturizer in place of my regular one. It fit well in my regular routine. It also worked well with my other products. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for this type of moisturizer. I will seriously consider purchasing this moisturizer in the future when my other one runs out. Pleasantly Surprised
