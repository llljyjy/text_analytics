This is the first cream from Korres that I have tried but I love their Greek yogurt foaming cleanser so I was super excited to give this a try. Right away I noticed that it doesn’t have a strong or off putting scent so that is a huge plus for me. The cream felt light and silky on my skin and seeped into my skin very quickly without leaving a sticky residue on my skin. Also a little goes a long way which is always a plus for me! I loved the slight sheen that it left on my skin and it almost seemed to blur my imperfections! I have super dry skin especially in the winter so unfortunately I need something a little thicker this time of year but I think this would be an excellent cream for me in the summer. Korres says that this cream shrinks your pores but I didn’t notice that at all but hopefully after an extended period of time it will do just that. If you are looking for a light and refreshing not heavy moisturizer than this is it!I received this face cream for free from Influenster and Korres in exchange for my honest opinion.
