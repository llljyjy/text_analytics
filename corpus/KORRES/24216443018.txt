Received this product complimentary for testing purposes. It was really easy to apply on my skin and I felt so hydrated and moisturized at the end of the day. A little bit goes a long way and it has a really nice scent. It doesn’t feel too heavy or leave you looking oily. I’m a big fan! SO Hydrating!
