Soaks into your skin completely in minutes. If you use this cream, you’ll wake up to a beautifully soft, supple face, wherever you use it. Sometimes I’ll even use it on the top side of my hands especially in cooler months and that works better than any cream to help bring back some moisture to them! I use this whenever my face is feeling dry and that works perfectly. Very moisturizing
