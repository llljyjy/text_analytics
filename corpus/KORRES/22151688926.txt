I received a complimentary sample for my honest review. I have oily skin so I was pleased with the very little oil I had by the end of the day. It’s lightweight which I like and not much of a scent so that’s good. I really liked this cream and I recommend it. I will be purchasing in the future and adding it to my skin care routine. Loves it!!
