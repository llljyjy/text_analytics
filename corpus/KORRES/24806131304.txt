I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. I have combined skin type and live in Arizona, which means a lot like A LOT OF SUN and  I need a super moisturizer.  I tested the cream in January, when there is not so much sun and sometimes rains and the temperature is somewhere around 65-69 F.  If you have the same climate, then my review will come in handy for you: the cream is not too greasy - this is a huge plus. Absorbs well and leaves no residue. Also contains silicic acid, which helps to narrow the pores.  I can not comment on this moment, because my pores are not wide. The product goes well with my tonic, but I would like to add a moisturizing effect. In general I liked this product and would recommend it for normal skin type! But Ofc itâ€™s all depend on your goals and skin type I received this product complimentary for testing
