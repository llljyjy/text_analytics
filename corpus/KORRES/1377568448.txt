This absolutely does a wonderful job of balancing my problematic skin. I have a lot of texture and large pores and I feel this helps my makeup go on smoother and not look cakey. I am also a fan of the way it sits on my skin and that it doesnâ€™t cause my makeup to breakdown after a long day at work. Very good at making my skin look and feel balanced
