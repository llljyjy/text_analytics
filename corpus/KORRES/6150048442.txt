I have combination skin and finding a moisturizer that works for me has been a struggle. I also have huge pores on my upper cheeks and nose. I pride myself in giving HONEST reviews even when something has been sent to me gratis (which this was sent to me by Influenster). This has been a game changer for me. I have only been using it for about 10 days and I can already see a difference when I use it. I have even been getting compliments when I don’t wear makeup! It absorbs well, plays nicely with other products and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. I pray they never discontinue this. Poreless Skin Cream
