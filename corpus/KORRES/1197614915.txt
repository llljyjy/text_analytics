I have normal to combo acne prone skin that’s also very reactive. This cream has a thick but non-greasy texture.  It goes into the skin very nicely,  doesn’t ball up & sinks in quickly.  It makes my skin look hydrated & smooth with a nice fresh glow without making it look oily throughout the day.  This plays well under makeup.  I didn’t have any adverse reactions to this cream & would definitely recommend it to other blemish prone people.  Just the right level of hydration & treatment. Great hydration for acne prone skin
