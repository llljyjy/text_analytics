I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. Normally, I wouldn’t go out of my way to buy a skin cream, so I was excited to try it! I quickly discovered that using the Korres Poreless Skin Cream on my face before applying foundation made the of my skin texture noticeably smoother. The formula is light and hydrating, and I absolutely love the Santorini Grape scent. Smelling it feels like I’m relaxing and eating grapes in Greece... it’s truly a win win… I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a lightweight skin cream or anyone looking to minimize their pores without the hassle of searching for an insanely expensive product that may not work for your skin.
