Love love love this product! I love the packaging, it’s very minimal and sleek. I love the smell. I used mine in the shower and it doesn’t take a lot to use. It kind of lathers up like soapy if you use a lot. I used it on my armpits and my lady bits and it left it feeling smooth and soft and I didn’t have razor burn afterwards. I can’t wait to use it on my legs. I also told my man that he should use it downstairs as well. It would be interesting to use out of the shower. This was complimentary from Hanni. You need this!
