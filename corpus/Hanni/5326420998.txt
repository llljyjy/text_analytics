Ok, so I’m in LOVE with this! Over the years, I’ve switched from the drugstore gel shave cream to cleaner options which are normally just a cream consistency that doesn’t lather. Then I tried this! Such a game changer! It’s definitely a multipurpose product and it’s so easy to use. I hate shaving in the shower so this is nice bc it allows me to shave anywhere and I don’t have to rinse. I just swipe, use a little bit of water and massage (since I like a little lather), then shave. It’s the closest, smoothest shave ever! I just rub in what’s left on my skin and I have smooth glowy skin! The scent is also nice. It’s light and not overpowering…more floral to me than anything. Soooo good! Amazing!
