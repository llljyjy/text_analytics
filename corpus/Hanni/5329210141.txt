I was gifted this razor complimentary from Hanni. I was excited to try it because I have tried a lot of razors on the market due to sensitive skin, most cause my skin irritation which lead to redness and bumps even ingrown hairs. This razor is so different from anything I’ve used on the market. It is very heavy so there is no need to apply much pressure at all. There is a learning curve with this and the first time I used it on my legs I had a few small cuts on one leg because I applied to much pressure on the shin area. After I got the hang of it though I had no issues and I use it on my underarms daily with no irritation which is huge for me. Best razor I’ve ever used!
