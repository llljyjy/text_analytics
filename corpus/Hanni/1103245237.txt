Where has Hanni Shave Pillow been all my life?! This has changed the shaving game for me! As a busy mom, it’s difficult to find time to shave in the shower, so I often went without doing so. Now I can fit a quick shave in literally any time! I’ve tried this on dry skin and dampened skin and either way works well. A nice close shave and no water or mess? YES PLEASE! An added bonus is that you can rub the gel formula into your skin for extra soft results. Easy and saves water!
