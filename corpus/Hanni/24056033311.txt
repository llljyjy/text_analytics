Hanni gifted this to me for review, but that does not affect my thoughts on it. It’s unlike anything I’ve used before! I’ve tried this in the shower and also dry-shaving, and it’s great for both. Also, while it’s not the most important thing, I adore the scent of it! This leaves my skin feeling really soft and moisturized, and I will definitely be bringing it with me on any trips I take because it’s so convenient! nan
