This is such a luxe and unique product. It’s heavy and the razor is really sharp. It’s easy to set up and use. It did give me a soft shave and removed all the hair. I loved how it looked. However, it might’ve been too sharp and gave me some nicks. I will keep trying as I think it can be great! What a cool razor!
