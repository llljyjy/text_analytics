This product was gifted by Hanni. Firstly, I’d like to say I really thought this product was going to be amazing. I was so excited to get it in and try it out.  After receiving the kit, I made sure to read through the instructions because I knew it was a single blade, weighted razor. After trying the razor a few times now, I can’t say I’m a fan. For the price (I understand the kit is more expensive than the razor), I expected a lot more. I don’t get a close shave and have to shave the very next day. I’ve tried it using the instructions provided multiple times and I just can’t get a nice enough shave to justify the price. As far as the quality, the razor is a nicely weight razor. The color coating however has scratched a bit on the handle. Which, again, for the price I wouldn’t expect to happen. The holder works ok, but can be tipped very easily. I do,however, love the shave pillow. I love how it smells and that it can be used without water. Another thing I like is that the kit comes with replacement blades as well as a little tin to put your old blades in so they can be properly disposed/recycled. Overall, unfortunately I just can’t justify the price. I’ve used much cheaper razors that have given me a better shave for a longer period of time. Not worth the price
