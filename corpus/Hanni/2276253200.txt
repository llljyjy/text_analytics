Using this razor is so effortless to shave. I have never seen any razors like this, heavy and look luxury, with interesting design. The blade is just like your dad’s razor blade, simple but effective. One thing I need to point out! Because there is no protective layer around the blade, be sure to use it light hand. It already got weight to the handle so you don’t need to press down very much. Or you will get yourself hurt…Gifted by Hanni. nan
