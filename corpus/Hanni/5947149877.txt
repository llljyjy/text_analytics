I was looking for a new razor considering I have been using mens razors for years. When I saw that it was gifted by Hanni I fell in love with the branding so I had to try. PROS:• Razor is very sharp so you don’t get any irritation. • The pillow cream is hands down my favorite. I have started carrying this razor in my purse especially for beach days when I forget some spots. It’s great for quick touch ups and this pillow cream is so soft and hydrating CONS:• Learning curve to use, but the company does a great job providing QR codes in the package for you to learn.• I used this product after not shaving for a week and I got my cuts than anticipated. Does not work well for people like me who don’t always have the time to shave. This is a great razor for everyday touch ups.• I would like to see more razor blades to get a closer shave. I felt like I had to shave the next day because it doesn’t get as close to my skin as a typical razor does. I am giving this product a 3/5 stars. Still a great razor but it’s not good for long hair legs after a week of no shaving, lol. Not great for someone who only shaves once a week
