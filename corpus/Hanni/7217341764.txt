this starter set is the perfect way to try out this brand. i was intrigued when i read hanni’s mission and even more so when i read more about their products. because this is the first weighted razor i’ve tried, i was extra careful and it took me longer to shave my legs than it usually does. i still need to get over the learning curve and continue to make sure not to press down intuitively. nan
