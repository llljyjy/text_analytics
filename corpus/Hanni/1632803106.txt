When I first learned about the Hanni Shave Pillow, I was a little confused on what type of product it is. For shaving? A body lotion? Why is it called Pillow? Once I read more about it, it made sense: an easy-to-use product for on-the-go shaving! I think this is such a clever product, I just wish the marketing or product description was easier to understand. I really like the product and I’m glad it exists! It’s especially helpful for moms like myself who don’t always have time to shave. Confusing marketing, but very cool product!
