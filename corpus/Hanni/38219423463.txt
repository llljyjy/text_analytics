The first few times I used the hanni razor I shaved in the shower and kept nicking myself around the bony areas on my legs like ankles and knees....so I was about to give up on this razor but then I tried shaving outside the shower with the Shave Pillow stick and this was the game changer. When I “dry“ shave I never get any nicks! I think it’s because I have better visibility of what I’m doing and also I can get closer to my ankles because I’m sitting down on the ground or on my bed. I’ll never go back to shaving in the shower again, and now I can get a super close shave without any nicks at all, yay! Worth it in the end
