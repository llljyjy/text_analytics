I wasn’t sure what to expect with this, but after you read the directions and get used to it, it’s so nice!! I went to use my regular razor after trying this and it felt so cheap and flimsy! I also love the shave pillow, it has changed the game for dry shaving for me. This is a great kit to start out and I’m so happy I got to try this out because it’s a new favorite! Smooth and soft shave
