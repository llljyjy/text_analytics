I received this set complimentary from Hanni. I loved the idea of this set. There is everything you need for the smooth and non problem shave, you can even do it on the go, without a shower. I wish instructions were a little bit clearer to make it easier to install the blade. They also are very sharp, so be careful. I think this type of razor is not for me but still was interesting to try. Cool idea but not for me
