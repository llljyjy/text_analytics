This razor that I received as a gifted by hanni is beautiful. From the boxes it came in, to the design and colors, I was very impressed. It is cool that it is weighted so that you do not have to press down. There is definitely a learning curve as it is very easy to cut yourself if you do not follow the instructions. The shave pillow is amazing! nan
