Ok… I wanted to hate this do to seeing some negative reviews about others cutting themselves badly BUT I can’t. It’s the smoothest and closest shave I’ve ever had. I used to think seeing all these labels about more blades would make my shaving quicker & easier but I know better now legit all you need is one blade and this product is the truth. If you follow the instructions “do not press down and do short glides” you will not cut yourself. I am sold forever. I wanted to hate it but I just couldn’t
