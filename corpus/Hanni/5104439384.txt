The Hanni razor definitely has a learning curve, it’s a weighted razor so you have to be very gentle and not apply much pressure at all, just let it glide on the skin. For me, it’s not a very practical razor because I found that it took way longer to shave compared to a regular disposable razor because I was being extra careful to not nick myself. I also found that I didn’t get as close of a shave. The Shave pillow is nice, I don’t mind the scent, I actually found it quite pleasant, this was my favorite item in the set. I don’t recommend using it on dry skin as suggested, but on wet skin it works well. I will definitely continue using the shave pillow. This set was gifted by Hanni. nan
