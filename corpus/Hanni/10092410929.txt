i really enjoyed how unique this was, you definitely don’t have to press against your skin to get your hair it’s a light hand gliding your skin and takes a while for your hair to grow back and you can use up to so many times! this is so unique but also dangerous because of putting the blade in yourself if you aren’t careful. cute but dangerous
