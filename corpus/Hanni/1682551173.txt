This is my first time using a razor like this, and I’ll never look back! There are some learning curves/habit adjustments - you have to shave slowly which allows me to enjoy the process, and you can’t press down into your skin. This razor gets such a close shave with pretty minimal effort! I love the shave pillow too. It’s great for those times I need to quickly shave my armpits or near my ankles and get out of the house. The weighted handle feels nice in my hand and I so love that it’s sustainable and I’m not throwing away cartridges. I think this might be my forever razor! Sustainable!
