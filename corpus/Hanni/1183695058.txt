I hate this razor.   No matter how gentle you are, you get a lot of little micro cuts which are then itchy and painful.  Results are at best, the same as my Venus razor.  Unfortunately, I did not try it right away and let it sit around at my house so I can’t return it.  But I’ve tried it 2x and gotten the same results.  And if your hand slips, you will a get a little cut.  Not a good experience for me at all. hate it
