Gifted by Hanni. I’ve been wanting to try out a safety razor for a long long time, but it always scared me a lot. I tend to rush through things and I don’t pay attention to details, so I thought that it’s not for me. However, after watching a bunch of videos about safety razors, I decided it’s time to conquer my fears. The whole presentation of Hanni line is so beautiful! I love the simple yet very attractive design of all their products. I use Hanni shave pillow gel stick (both dry and wet) as well as my regular shaving foam, and the razor performes great in all these instances. I still prefer wet shaving just because I’m used to it (and it’s convenient to shave in the shower). As for shaving itself, the key is not to rush and not to apply pressure to the razor. I was planning to only shave my legs and avoid the knees when I was trying it for the very first time, but the whole process was so effortless that I ended up going over my knees and underarms too. So far I’ve nicked myself only once on that very first shave and only when I started to really rush towards the end. It might be just my imagination, but I feel like I’m getting a closer shave with a safety razor. I also haven’t had any skin irritation while using Hanni. I am very impressed with the quality of the razor, with the results and how easy using it is. I can’t believe I had all these fears for no reason. The best shave
