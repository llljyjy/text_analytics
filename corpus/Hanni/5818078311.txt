The weighted razor was easy to use! It did not take long to adjust to using this is new razor. I love that I do not have to apply pressure and simply glide it along my skin. I am prone to ingrown hairs and this has helped reduce the amount I have seen. My skin felt amazing after and I did not have an irritation at all. I love how the razor feels in my hand and looks on my counter. The stand and color fit in very well with my decor. The tiny tin used to dispose the razors is recyclable!! I will be using this razor instead of disposable ones. Gifted by hanni Cute!!
