I recently received the hanni shave starter set for all my shaving needs. I feel like shaving is a chore, so I’m always on the lookout for a smoother shave that will last longer. This razor is not a joke! It shaves unlike any other razor I’ve tried. Do yourself a favor and follow their instructions to not apply pressure. You want to just lightly glide this over your skin. That’s all that it takes to get the closest shave ever. I like the shave pillow included in this set to make your skin/stubble softer, as well as the razor stand and additional razors. Follow directions and you will have a great shave! nan
