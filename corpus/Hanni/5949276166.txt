This is the closest shave I’ve ever got in my life. I have PCOS so I originally bought this for my face but once I got started I couldn’t help but do everything. I have super course hair too so I was ever more surprised that this worked so well. Soooo smooth - works great with the shave pillow and regular shaving cream (but with shaving cream you have to clean more often as you go cause of the build up). Was weird getting used to not using any pressure but this was amazing. I am so pleased with this purchase I’ve already told so many people about it! Honestly the shave pillow alone is just a great product, especially if you like to shave outside of the shower. I love that you can just massage it into your skin as a moisturizer after shaving. And I love that the blades are so cheap after the initial investment for the set. I’m so happy I won’t have to buy any other razor ever again.I am happy I bought the set, I feel the extra money between this and the regular set was worth it! SMOOTH SMOOTH SMOOTH
