This was gifted by Hanni but unfortunately I did not receive the starter kit so I can only talk about the razor and blades. I like how luxe this razor looks! It’s a bit heavy but I like the style. Unlike razors I’ve used in the past this is very easy to use and makes my skin feels smooth after. It looks very high quality and it performs well! Love that it comes with extra blades however, did not receive the rest of what comes in the starter kit. Razor looks good but heavy!
