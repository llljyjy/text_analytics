This is my first time using a weighted razor and I am hooked! This gave me such a smooth and close shave.  Not to mention I can shave anywhere using the shave pillow.  Sometimes I like to just shave my legs or touch up an area without having to shower and I can dry shave by using the Shave Pillow or in the shower, whichever is more convenient at the time.  I’m prone to getting razor bumps, especially on my legs and I didn’t get any with these.  Since the razor is weighted it takes a little bit of trial and error to get used to it. The first time I used it I nicked myself because I was used to pressing down hard when I shave.  But if you just let it glide over your skin and not put too much pressure on it it just does it’s thing and leaves your skin smooth! This kit has everything you need and I’m happy I can refill the blades so that I use less plastic. Gives such a smooth shave
