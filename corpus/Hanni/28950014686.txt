I received this starter shave set complimentary from hanni in exchange for my honest review.Included in this set is the hanni weighted razor, holder, shave pillow, blades, & blade bin! I loved getting to try this out! The weighted razor works so well! I immediately liked it so much better than other razors, as once I looked up how to set up the blade into the razor, it became super easy to use! I liked that this weighted razor works without having to apply any pressure to your skin, so there’s a much less risk of cutting yourself by accident, compared to normal razors, in my opinion. I’m already a big fan of hanni now since with normal razors, I inevitably end up either accidentally cutting myself each time the tiniest bit or my skin gets sensitive because of how many times I have to shave over parts of my skin to remove all the hair! But since the weighted razor doesn’t require me to apply pressure to my skin, I don’t have to worry about hurting my skin when I shave over it a few times to remove all the hair. The shave pillow is pretty cool too! I like the idea of it since it’s so convenient to not need water or shaving cream to shave! LOVE IT!
