omg the packaging is absolutely stunning and sleek looking, you can tell it’s very high quality. It’s heavy (not like other razors I had tried in the past), it glides smoothly over the skin, and no pressure needed. I was trying on the dry skin it was a bit itchy, but then after using with the shave pillow, my legs feel so soft and smooth. Worth it!
