Complimentary from hanniI loved the whole concept of improved and more enjoyable shaving experience. First of all, I never tried a shaving cream in a gel shape like a deodorant. This makes it so convinient and easy to shave. No water required! I always shave without water and most of the time I use a bit of a moisturizer on my legs for example. But the problem is that any cream I would use will stuck on the razor and it’s hard to wash it off and the razor will just drag my skin around causing more irritation. The shaving gel cream doesn’t stick to the razor. It was also super easy to rinse it off with a tap water. The scent is fabulous. I smell like a fruity ginger bread and it reminds me Christmas time. The packaging is very simple and sleek. I love that the bottle is very nice to touch. It feels a bit rubbery and non-slippery to hold in my hands. So after shaving I didn’t wipe my left off because I wanted that extra layer of moisture on my legs to reduce the irritation after shaving. The feeling on the skin is a bit sticky, so you might wanna wipe it of with a tissue. In general I am impressed. Whoever created this concept is a pure genius! Looking forward to try more products from hanni. Loved the whole concept of shaving pillow
