The set it great and it comes with everything you need! The shave pillow is amazing and really help the razor to glide more easily. It was easy to assemble to razor blade. However it takes much longer to shave than with the regular disposable razor and even while being careful you can still cut yourself. It does take for the hair maybe 1 day longer to grow back and I also wouldn’t recommend dry shaving with the use of shave pillow because it doesn’t soften the hair and skin enough and creates micro cuts.Overall it was a fairly pleasant experience but I personally get a much easier and quicker shave with disposable razors that have 4 or 5 blades. Great option but not the best for me
