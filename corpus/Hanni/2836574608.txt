I was intrigued by the “shave out of the shower“ advertising and finally bought it on Sephora. This is for sure a game changing product for me especially for a quick touch up. I do find that if i do a full shave, the razor does clog up and will require frequent rinse out to get that smooth shave. But overall this is def. a must have for my routine especially in the summer. Highly recommend! I can shave out of the shower? Sign me up!
