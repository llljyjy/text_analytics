I loved the starter set because it made it so easy to literally get started with using the razor. I will admit I was definitely intimidated at first by having to put the blades in the razor, but it honestly was so user friendly. I really care about my carbon footprint as well so this product is seriously so exciting for me! also the shave it gave made my skin so smooth. It was super user friendly and I felt like I overall got a better outcome from using this razor versus the store bought one I was using before. I am definitely a lifelong customer now! Eco-friendly, super cute, and gives a great shave!
