First off all - I am super impressed with the first look of the razor . It looks so luxe and premium. Very pretty pastel shade as well . Now to the actual review - it is weighted , and need to be used differently than normal razors. Glides smoothly and gives a perfect smooth finish at one swipe . However I have very fine body hair , so it worked at on swipe for me . Very easy to handle and love the grip . Premium quality
