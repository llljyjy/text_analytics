I received this set complimentary from hanni in exchange for my honest review, and I didn’t know I could have a shave experience like this.  I’ve been using disposable razors forever and I was used to needing to shave often and not really feeling 100% smooth.  The first time I tried the weighted razor, I got out of the shower and ran my hands over my legs, and was totally surprised, they felt amazing AND my underarms weren’t itchy or irritated at all either.  The shave pillow is a MUST, it makes the razor glide easily and I’m glad it came with the set because I don’t think I would have bought it on it’s own, but after trying it, it’s a MUST HAVE.  This is a great set for anyone looking to reduce their carbon footprint and increase the smoothness of their skin.  I wish I had discovered hanni sooner. nan
