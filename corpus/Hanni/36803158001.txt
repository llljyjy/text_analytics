This is such a great set, the shave pillow makes wet and dry shaving really easy.  This was gifted by hanni in exchange for my honest review.  I’ve always been hesitant to shave my legs without water, but with hanni it is easy and you don’t have to rinse off the shave pillow, in fact post-shave I add a little and rub it in because it absorbs nicely and is a good moisturizer.  The razor took me a couple of shaves to get used to, but now I feel really confident using it and am getting a closer shave than with my old razors.  The shape of the razor is ergonomic and is especially good for underarm areas.  If you are deciding between purchasing the razor alone or the whole set, I recommend the set because everything works together really nicely to get the most out of the shaving experience and the closest shave. Great for wet or dry shaving
