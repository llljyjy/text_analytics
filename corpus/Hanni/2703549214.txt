There is a bit of a learning curve. I cut my legs a few times the first time I used this set but eventually figured out that you need a good shaving oil to use this successfully. The shave pillow cream is not good, get an oil. It’s definitely not a miracle razor and doesn’t do anything special but it works well. I’d recommend it to anyone trying to consume less plastic and who is willing to do some trial and error to find what works for them. Great once you get past the learning curve
