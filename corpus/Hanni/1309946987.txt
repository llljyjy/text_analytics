I never tried Hanni products before this but I’m glad I did. I was initially interested because this shave bar seemed like an innovative idea. I really like the intention and multifunction but in terms of logistics: it clogs up the blade when you shave. And if you shave it off, then would it still have the moisturizing effects? It’s a good idea that I wanted to love. I might just use this as a portable solid body moisturizer instead of it’s original purpose of shaving. Gifted by Hanni Shaving gel or moisturizer but not both
