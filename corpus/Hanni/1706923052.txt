I’m totally obsessed with this shave set! It actually makes me want to use it often and keep my skin hairless and super soft. I love how eco friendly the products and packaging are. The blade recycling system is also a huge selling point for me, if I can’t recycle I don’t want it! I also really enjoyed the weighted razor, makes shaving so much easier, and improves my accuracy too! Changing and refilling the blades is a breeze, very user friendly and so simple. The shave pillow is chefs kiss! Effortless application and makes for a super smooth shave. Overall, I’m really impressed and will never use anything else again! nan
