So lately I have been using disposable razors… and they work fine…But now that I have tried the Shave Starter Set gifted by Hanni, I don’t think I will ever go back! This is such a nice razor! Great quality! Plus it shaves like no other! No pressure needed! Just slide and let the razor glide leaving a smooth clean shave!  Does razor make shaving less of a chore and more like a self-care experience! nan
