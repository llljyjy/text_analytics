I’m loving how easy this is to use, I’ve used it in the shower and on dry skin. It glides on nicely both ways and helps for a close shave without the irritation. I like that in the shower it turns milky and is easily rinsed off, and for dry shaving it feels hydrating and doesn’t leave a sticky feel or anything. Just smooth skin! I also love that it’s in stick form which is easy for travel, and smells really nice too! nan
