Iâ€™ve never tried a shaving product like this and at first it was definitely an experience. You can use it on wet and dry legs, I personally used it on wet legs and required more product than I thought. My expectation was that it was going to be thicker but it was quite watery once on legs. Must use a good amount for a smooth shave. nan
