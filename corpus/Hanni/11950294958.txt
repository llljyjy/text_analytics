This is the first solid shaving cream I have ever used. Even though this was gifted to me by Hanni, I cannot say I would switch over to using something like this vs. conventional shaving cream/what I currently use because I find that this balm-like product collects in the razor when shaving (requiring somewhat frequent rinsing). I would only use this during the shower for that reason. This does however make for a great portable, travel-friendly solid moisturizer. My partner gets ashy-looking legs whenever he doesn’t apply moisturizer, and finds this product to be a quickly, effective, and long-lasting solution. It’s great for other dry spots too (like the back of the hands and/or elbows).All in all, I can’t say I would pay retail for this. I love what Hanni is doing by trying to go waterless, however it doesn’t really offer a better/more effective (or even comparable) solution to conventional shaving cream due to the razor easily getting clogged and requiring frequent rinsing. Great Solid Moisturizer, However Clogs Razor
