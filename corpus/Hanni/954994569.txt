This razor only fits the Hanni brand razor blades, but those blades are so dull it took 3 of them to shave my legs once. This wouldn’t be an issue if the razor fit other brands of blades, but they specifically make it an awkward size that only fits their blades. Not only is this an ineffective product, but it’s also environmentally wasteful. I have to use more blades, and if this razor doesn’t work for me, I have to buy a new one. If I return this item, it’s not the type of product that can even be resold. Defeats the point for many. Dull blades, waste of $$$
