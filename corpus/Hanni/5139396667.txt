I had wanted to switch to a more eco-friendly razor for a long time and finally bought this one.Believe me, there is a learning curve. I have to shave in the shower. The dry-shave thing leaves my legs looking like I just waded through a pond of angry cats. I was ready to return it. What I did realize when I took a break from it was that my old razor did not give as close a shave. The little red bumps that I thought were just my fate in life had started to dissipate with the Hanni razor. So, give it a little time. Take a break. It might end up working out if you are frustrated at first. I also love not paying $15+ for blades. Be patient
