Ok thereâ€™s a very small learning curve, but if you follow the directions and just use light pressure and short strokes, this razor is amazing. Like far superior than my old plastic razors. I can go longer in between shaves and I have none of the razor burn and itchy redness I had before - already recommended to all my friends. The Best!
