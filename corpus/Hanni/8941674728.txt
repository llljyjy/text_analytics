This set is amazing!First of all, I have to point out the weight of the razor, in a good way. The razor is so heavy so you don’t have to apply any pressure while shaving, just glide it! I absolutely love it and have never used anything like this. It is super easy to use and I notice I don’t cut myself with this one! I love that it comes with extra blades and also a container to dispose of them, so innovative! There is also a weighed razor stand that looks very sturdy and high quality.The shave pillow is such an interesting product! It’s a shave cream/lotion on the go, it looks like a deodorant and you just apply it where you need to shave for a smooth effect. I love how portable this is, I will definitely take it with me on my trips instead of shaving cream!Overall all of these products feel very high quality and also do an amazing job. I highly recommend to upgrade your shaving game and investing in a high quality razor like this one. Best shaving kit upgrade
