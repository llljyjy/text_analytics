Great starter kit! The razor is super high quality and very sturdy, also super sharp so quick and short strokes are best, I love the in shower holder but best of all the moisturizing stick. I actually use it after I shower and it makes my skin super soft and moisturized. Havenâ€™t tried it for on the go but it will sure come in handy.  Gifted by Hanni Awesome kit
