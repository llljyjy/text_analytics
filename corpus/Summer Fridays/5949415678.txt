*summer fridays sent me this in exchange for a non bias review*I have dry, sensitive & acne prone skin and I’m in love! the oat makes this so soothing. I feel like it’s helping my moisture barrier stay healthy. In the morning just this under spf is perfect for my skin! leaves me moisturized but not too heavy and it’s not pore clogging. 10/10! perfect day moisturizer for acne prone skin!
