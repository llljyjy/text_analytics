I received Dream Oasis Serum complimentary from Summer Friday’s in return for my honest opinion. What I like about it is it is very hydrating and lightweight. It absorbs quickly into the skin and has a very soft natural scent. It wasn’t enough to skip moisturizing for myself (normal/dry skin) but I did feel it helped hydrate well. Please note that it is important to apply this to damp skin to not only get the benefits to your moisturize barrier but also to help the product to keep from pilling. The first time I tried it out (on my hand) I didn’t have it wet and it pilled up within minutes. So it won’t play well with other products if you skip this step. This is a great addition for those who have sensitive, acne-prone skin or are just looking to repair their skins barrier from over exfoliation. nan
