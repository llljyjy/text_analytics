I grabbed this bc I was out of lip balm and the girl at the register recommended this one. I’m seriously disappointed. The taste was really over powering, and I feel like this never actually hydrated my lips and made them more parched overtime. I’ll stick with my 3 dollar aquaphor lip balm that has never done me wrong, thanks. not worth the money.
