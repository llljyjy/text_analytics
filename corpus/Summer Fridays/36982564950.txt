I’ve tried many gel creams and before buying this product, I used the Drunk Elephant polypeptide moisturizer because I love it, but I felt it was a little too heavy in the morning. After seeing how light-weight this product is I had to try it. I bought the full-sized one and I LOVE it. It’s super light but feels very moisturizing. It leaves my skin looking SO glowy and this is definitely my favorite lightweight moisturizer. I don’t use this at night because it’s not a very good thick night cream but it works wonders in the morning. I do see myself having to switch to a different morning moisturizer during the winter when I need some extra moisture, but for now, I love this product. Love this for the morning!
