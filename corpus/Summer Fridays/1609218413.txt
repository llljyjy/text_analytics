So far, I’ve loved everything from this brand and this is no exception. What I feel I really need from an eye cream, especially during the winter, is moisture. This is a very delicious, thick cream with no fragrance that feels good around the eye area. The one thing though is it definitely has reflective particles so I don’t like using this overnight--it will be primarily an AM eye cream for me. I’m not sure yet about the longterm results but will update. nan
