Dream Oasis Deep Hydration Serum, is a dream come true. I found that I can truly use this ALONE and still obtain a deep dose of silky smooth hydration through out the day. How many of you have serums that can do that?! Most serums that promise ALL DAY hydration seem to be packed with multiple oils that sit on the skin, but with this serum there’s no intense oily residue or film after application. It’s compiled of squalane, chamomile, glycerin, and hyaluronic acid which aid in moisture retention, soothing capabilities and barrier protection. Within seconds this super lightweight serum sinks into my skin quickly eliminating dryness layer by layer. My skin feels so plump, I adore it. I’ve been using it since the moment it landed on my doorstep, which was a week ago. I highly recommend it! Go ahead and drench your skin. Hello Hydration! Silky Smooth Goodness ALL DAY!
