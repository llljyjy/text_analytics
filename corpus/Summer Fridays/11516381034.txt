I’m usually skeptical of eye creams because I don’t find them necessary. However, this is an exception - vitamin c can be irritating when used around the eyes if it isn’t specifically formulated for use around the eyes. This texture is awesome, and I can’t wait to see the results from the vitamin c after using this for awhile! Definitely worth picking up! awesome new launch from SF!
