I love this product!! This product has an amazing taste (vanilla) and instantly moisturizes my lips. It has a bit of a sticky feel but is such a great lip balm. Super smooth and great to use overnight as well. I think itâ€™s worth the money if u can afford it but if not then save up because it is good! Must have!!
