This hydration serum from Summer Fridays is a nice texture and feels nice and light on my skin. I am not a huge fan of the scent; it’s unscented, but definitely has a…certain smell. When I started using this serum, I noticed quite a few little white pimples popping up, but they did get less frequent over time. This serum is okay but nothing all that special for me. I have dry skin and used this as the last step before applying my moisturizer, but the hydration was not enough for my dry skin and didn’t last all day. Maybe for normal to oily types it would be better. Just okay
