I was nervous to try this product after reading a negative reviews, but I am so glad I did!First, you’re not meant to scrub your face, a gentle circular motion does the trick. So even though this has some course ingredients, it doesn’t hurt the face. In addition, the scent, although strong, is natural and didn’t cause me any issues. Finally, I consider myself to have mildly sensitive skin, and this didn’t bother me at all. Of course everyone is different, so always spot test first. I really enjoy this mask. I use it twice a week as directed, and it leaves my skin feeling smooth. Pleasantly surprised
