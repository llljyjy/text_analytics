Love love love. Always use after a treatment like a peel or dermaplaning to calm and hydrate skin. So gentle and deeply moisturizing without being greasy, even for very sensitive skin that reacts to everything. I use as a sleeping mask at least once a week, just sinks into skin overnight beautifully, highly recommend. Skin Saver
