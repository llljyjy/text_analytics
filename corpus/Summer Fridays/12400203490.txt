I am LOVING this Light Aura Eye Cream so far and I actually notice a difference in my under-eye circles and puffiness being a lot less visible. I also love that this formula has caffeine and a slightly illuminating ingredient in it for a glowy brightening effect. This is such a great eye cream to wear under or over makeup especially because it doesn’t pile at all which is a MUST! Most under-eye creams I’ve used totally do that, which is why I stopped using eye creams all together, but this one is so good! OBSESSED! Super Hydrating and Brightening ✨
