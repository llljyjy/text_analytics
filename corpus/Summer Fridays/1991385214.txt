I really wanted to love it. It is definitely buttery and shiny but I noticed that after it would wear off, my lips were even more dry than before I put it on, I thought I was imagining things but I would use this product every other day and the same thing would happen. The glossier balms are way better in my opinion and still provide a good shine but actually keep lips hydrated (cheaper too) nan
