Where to start? This stuff is amazing. The applicator is unlike any I’ve tried before and helps it go on so smoothly. The product is a little thicker than I had expected, but because of that is lasts! This has my lips feeling hydrated all day long. Also, I’m not typically the biggest fan of vanilla products because a lot will smell or taste wayy to artificially sweet, but this one is perfect. It has just a subtle hint of vanilla that I love! Smells amazing
