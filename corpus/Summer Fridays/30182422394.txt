I had completely used up a 1.7oz (mini) of this cleanser and it’s definitely one I’d recommend for dry skin people! I felt that this cleansed my skin well enough without drying it out like most cleanser. I don’t typically wear heavy makeup...most days I don’t wear any makeup at all, so I thought this did a pretty good job at cleansing my skin. Great for dry skin
