So far, not the biggest fan of this. I was so excited to try it out because I have loved SF products in the past (I’m a big fan of the lip balm). This left my skin feeling tingly which was unexpected for a hydrating product. I’m wondering if maybe this is just a me problem since I haven’t seen many reviews mention this. I am using a daily tretinoin but otherwise my skin is not sensitive. Not sure if I’ll keep trying it because of this. nan
