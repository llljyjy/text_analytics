This product was gifted by Summer Fridays in exchange for my honest review.I really like this Lip Butter balm in the shade Vanilla! The packaging is clean and modern looking, and very simple. It’s also a really good size, a bit larger than most lip balm, but still small enough to easily fit in your pocket or small purse. It comes in a tube, so I know I’ll be able to squeeze every last bit out.The product itself has a super sweet smell and reminds me of birthday cake. It even has a slight flavor, so it’s a little hard not to lick off your lips. The consistency is smooth and soft and it applies easily. It’s a clear but shiny shade, which is my favorite.My husband said my lips looked wonderful and slightly shiny with it on, and when I kissed him, he said the flavor was lovely!My only negative is that it’s slightly sticky - not enough to turn me off from using it, but I’d love it more if the small amount of stickiness it had wasn’t there. I’d recommended using a battery chapstick or neutral lip balm and then applying this to help with that issue.I think this one is going to last quite a while because it didn’t take much product to cover my lips. I’m also on the fence about if I’d buy it again or not. It’s a little pricey, but I’d consider it.Also love love that it’s vegan! Birthday cake scent and flavor, slight stickiness
