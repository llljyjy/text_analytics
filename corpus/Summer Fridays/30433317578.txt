I bought this after reading many great reviews from so many places, not just Sephora, and I needed something to address my very dry under eye. I’ve been using it for a month and I may have gotten a very slight improvement overall but not as much as I had hoped for. Overall I like the product - I actually like the shimmer - but it just wasn’t the best for me. I had no adverse reaction and some lightening of my dark circles. I will probably not repurchase but that being said I have very very dry skin especially under my eyes. For dark circles and brightening it’s worth a try. Great for brightening
