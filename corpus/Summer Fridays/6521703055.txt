I’m very picky about lip balms because my lips can easily get irritated and inflamed. I had heard amazing reviews about this one and the hype is definitely real! It’s very hydrating and doesn’t feel heavy on the lips. I usually apply it before using lipstick and it prevents the lip color from drying out my lips,  eyeing the colored version of this lip balm now :) nan
