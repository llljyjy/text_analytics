Only four star because I cannot tell if it’s my routine or actual product, I use this every so often not daily just to add some hydration, seems to do it. I have oily skin so sometimes I get confused on what’s oil and what’s good glow lol. I think overall it’s a good product especially if you do have dry skin. good for dryer skin types
