I received Light Aura Vitamin C+ Peptide Eye Cream complimentary from Summer Friday in exchange for my honest opinion. I liked the consistency of this cream. It is creamy yet it absorbs in the skin quite easily. This cream moisturizes and repairs skin..it also has a little soothing effect. Whenever i apply it i feel coolness under eye area..I also loved the packaging of the cream.. nan
