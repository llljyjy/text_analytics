This serum is really hydrating but lightweight and doesn’t leave my skin greasy.  It wears well under makeup and sunscreen.  If your skin is combination or oily it’s moisturizing enough to be used a lotion by itself but if dry I would top with a moisturizer. It has great ingredients like squalene and hyaluronic acid. This was gifted by Summer Fridays. Super hydrating
