My lips have been dry and cracking this winter and none of my usual balms or oils were working to soothe them. I had a little sample packet of this balm stashed away so I decided to give it a shot and wow, did it deliver. I immediately felt relief and within two applications I was placing an order for a full sized tube, by far the fastest I’ve ever purchased a product based on a sample. I’ve been applying 2-3 times a day for a few days an my lips are completely healed. It’s not sticky, the vanilla scent is delicious and the glossy appearance is a plus. Lip Saver
