I do love this product and it leaves a beautiful shine on the lips. I had the original in the old packaging and recently repurchased this in the updated tube. The reason I’ve come to leave this review is because I’m shocked how little product is clearly in the new tube. I find I’m aggressively shaking the tube to get product out when I just bought it a week ago… super disappointed about this. I truly love the brand but the amount of product needs to be fixed for the price! Pushing in the middle of the tube literally releases 0 product. Beautiful shine. VERY little product in tube
