It didn’t break out my sensitive skin, but it didn’t seem to hydrate or plump it much better than any other (much cheaper) products would. I bought this based on all the favorable reviews, but after having used the entire bottle (which lasted a surprisingly short period of time), I saw no visible effects. nan
