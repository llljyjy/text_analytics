I’m not sure why I’m having such a different experience than everyone else .. But I don’t feel like this oil does much. It kinda sits on top of my skin. I’ve layered it all different ways.  It in turn doesn’t absorb and leaves my super sensitive skin still feeling very dry. I liked the Kora organics oil better. nan
