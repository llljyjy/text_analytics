I’ve had this for a few months, and it still has a lot of product. I use it frequently throughout the day, but I wasn’t entirely impressed at first. However, I used it before going to bed and for once, I did not wake up with dry lips, which at this point, I think I’ve had dry lips since primary school. Now, I only use it when going to bed instead of throughout the day. My lips do not look or feel dry the whole day when I use this like a sleep mask vs a lip balm throughout the day, which is better since you’re technically prolonging the product before it runs out. I also like using it on top of a lip tint, since those are very drying as well. I will be repurchasing again. Great night mask
