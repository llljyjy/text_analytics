I added this into the rotation to help combat my tretinoin dryness. I mix it into my Create hydrating moisturizer as the last step in my routine and it leaves my skin feeling like slink. My skin isn’t greasy at all from it. I have even tested it during the day just to see and it didn’t bother me, but I live in a dry climate and have dry skin. To me, it was worth every penny. It does have a natural oil smell to it, but once you have rubbed it in, it doesn’t linger and the scent is not overpowering at all. IN LOVE
