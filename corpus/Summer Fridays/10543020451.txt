I donâ€™t understand the hype around this product. I thought that it would aid in repairing lips or helping with hydration but I found the product a little too sticky and heavy for my liking. I do love the packaging and the applicator feels great when applying. Tbh I use the tip of the applicator to apply other lip balms. nan
