my skin is perpetually dehydrated and this product just may be Summer Fridays BEST. It’s a thick, lotion-like serum that is intensely hydrating and soothing. Like my skin GLOWS after application and throughout the whole day. I am also impressed with how soothing it is. It’s unfragranced and really soothes sensitive or sensitized skin from overexfoliating or retinoids. I have tried a lot of hydrating serums from Sephora and this one is truly unique. I will be repurchasing it over and over! intensely hydrating!
