Basically, this is a perfect eye cream. I love a good thick, rich eye cream and this one definitely fits the bill. It’s not too heavy and it’s not greasy at all. I also love the tint and but of shimmer it has to help blur or even out dark circles and fine lines....just a tiny bit of camouflage to help your tired eyes out.I’ve been using this for a while and haven’t noticed any milia. It’s soothing and calming and hasn’t ever irritated my eyes even though I’m not careful about things when I’m tired in the morning. If you’re considering trying this then DO IT. Just give it a shot. It’s amazing, hydrating, super moisturizing, light-reflecting... everything I’d want an eye cream to be! Perfect eye cream
