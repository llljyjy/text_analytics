I was looking for a new eye cream as I have been using the Tarte C-Brighter Maracuja Eye Treatment (which I really like) for quite sometime and wanted to see if there was anything else out there to try. I am 37 years old and have a very good skin care regimen. I’ve been in the beauty industry for 13+ years and I am also a makeup instructor. I am very knowledgeable with ingredients and love trying out new products and different brands that I’ve never tried before.I was recommended this product in store. I loved the way it felt and looked. It had light reflecting pigments in it to really brighten the under eyes and felt really smooth. The first 2 days my under eyes looked amazing! It looked brighter and appeared to be smoother. After that, it all started going downhill. My under eyes started to experience a slight stinging/burning sensation (as if I were doing a chemical exfoliant), it was getting very dry and had a lot of texture happening that I had never experienced before. I used it for about 2 weeks to see if there was any improvements but it just made my under eyes worse. My concealer did not sit well and it looked severely dry. I returned the product and had to use facial oil for about a week to get my under eyes back to how they were and went back to using my original eye cream. I can’t say I would or wouldn’t recommend this product as it really depends on what you are looking for. Unfortunately this just did not work for me. Wanted a new eye cream and this was not it
