This is my favourite lip balm I’ve tried. I love the thicker consistency, the smell, and the way it moisturizes my lips. I bought this after Summer Fridays changed the packaging from the original, which had complaints of the packaging leaking (I believe??). But I’ve noticed that with the new packaging as well. When I squeeze the tube, there’s an area at the top just below the applicator that the product leaks out of. It ends up wasting a lot of the product and makes it super messy. If they could perfect the packaging, this product would be perfect. Defective packaging?
