I’m obsessed with this serum. My skin is super dry- this serum is on the thicker side and coats the face nicely. It’s not sticky and absorbs into the skin quickly leaving behind a dewy and plumping effect. I love it! Plus there is Niacinamide in it which helps restore your skin barrier & regulate oil production- I’m acne prone so I love to see Niacinamide in my skincare products! nan
