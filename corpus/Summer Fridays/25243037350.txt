Love this mask, I’ve repurchased too many times to count. It’s the best for dry skin, I even used to use it as an everyday moisturizer but it started pilling with too many of my other products so I now just use it as a mask, sometimes overnight if my skin needs some extra TLC. I enjoyed the OG formula, but I did unfortunately receive one of the “bad batches,“ so I am glad they reformulated it to make it more gentle and removed the essential oils.
