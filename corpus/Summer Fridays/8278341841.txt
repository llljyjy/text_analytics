I am one of many on Tretinoin and it sucks my skin of any moisture. I got this to use at night as a first layer before I put the Tret on and I have definitely noticed a difference. No dry spots the next morning and it feels really nice on the skin, sinks in quick as well. I took off a star because when I use it on non-tret nights I donâ€™t notice a big moisture difference by itself. Overall, would probably get again. nan
