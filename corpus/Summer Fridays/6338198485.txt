This Summer Fridays serum is lovely thus far! It has a nice texture that didn’t make my other serums and moisturizers pill up over it, so it is a great layering product. It also hasn’t appeared to make me break out, which is great. I am not sure that it is super unique compared to my other thinner serums, so I’m keeping the rating to 4 solid stars instead of 5 exceptional stars, but so far, so good! nan
