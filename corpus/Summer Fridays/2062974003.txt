I’m a vanilla ‘snob’ and only like certain vanilla scents. THIS LIP BALM smells amazing! I wish I could put it on a spoon and eat it! The tip of the applicator is also really cool, it has an indent in it so it hugs your lips nicely. Makes my lips feel soft and smooth and doesn’t have a gross taste to it. Isn’t sticky or thick, just a nice balm. Highly recommend. nan
