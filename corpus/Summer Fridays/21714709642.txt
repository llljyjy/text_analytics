Both times I used this moisturizer for my night routine I chose my most hydrating toner and serum to use with it and chose to not use any other actives to be able to find out how this suited my skin.The 2nd night I used this after having worn it the night before and following  up the day with my “recovery“ daytime skincare, it did make my skin tingle a little bit. Both times after applying it felt more like a thin greasy film rather than hydrating, conditioning and/ or plumping. It didn’t feel bad it was just nowhere near being an occlusive enough cream to keep my skin feeling hydrated after the initial application being a decent experience. I did wake up with some flakiness on both my nose and one cheek the first use - this never happens unless I use products that don’t moisturize me enough or I had a rough and irritated skin day prior - and my skin was happy during both daytimes before I used this.I am honestly surprised by this as I have used a cleanser that has papaya enzymes in it so I thought this would be fine for my skin at night especially if I didn’t use anything else with actives in it.I also don’t know what could have caused the short term mild tingling a few minutes after applying this as the ascorbic acid (according to  online reviews websites) is very low at anywhere between 0.3 to 0.5%, I use a papaya enzyme cleanser almost daily, and I am a seasoned user of multiple potent actives in unison. That also concerns me that what looked like it would be a non irritating and hydrating formula ended up not being able to even simply not cause any skin reaction.This is probably best designed for people with slightly less sensitive and dry skin, but with so many more affordable while being effective and not sensitizing options out there that make my skin feel more nourished and not reactive, I won’t be reaching to try this brand out again. Not very moisturizing & triggered some sensitivity
