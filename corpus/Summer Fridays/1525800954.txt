I use the skin fix acne cleanser, rose water as a toner, applied this serum, kiehl’s ultra hydrating cream and fenty moisturizer with SPF. I also filled in my brows a bit. My 8 year old asked if I was wearing makeup!!! I apply all the products on a daily basis, the only difference was the serum. It’s not watery but not creamy…a great in between texture. A new staple in my skincare! Didn’t expect much…
