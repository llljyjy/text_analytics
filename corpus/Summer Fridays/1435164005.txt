Please lord bring back the old formula. When I first purchased it back in 2019 I took it for granted and one day I used it as a night cream instead of a mask and it changed my life (this is with the old formula). Everyday I woke up with glowwwwing skin, small pores and plump skin. I bought the new one recently and I read online they changed the formula. It’s not the same…. But it’s still good. I would give the new formula 4/5. I have dry dehydrated skin but sensitive and can easily get clogged with products. This doesn’t cause any clogged pores or breakouts. Summer Friday, please bring back the old formula :( nan
