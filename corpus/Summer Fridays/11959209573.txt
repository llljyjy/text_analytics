Love this product so much! This is my first product for any type of serum and it makes my skin look so plump. I have very sensitive combo skin that’s slightly on the oilier side and my skin drinks this up! My skin feels so soft afterward and I could go out using this as only a moisturizer if I feel that I don’t need extra hydration. I have acne prone skin and this has not caused any new acne or any flare ups HG!
