I’ve been so excited to try this and it didn’t disappoint!! Firstly, the tip applicator was very unique it’s more pointed to fit your lips better which is great. I have very dry lips and the hydration is spot on. It’s not thin or thick it’s somewhere in the middle. The scent isn’t overbearing at all. When I compare it to another brand like Rhode’s I would choose SF’s every time. The bottle is the perfect size and doesn’t soak in quickly so you’re not having to reapply constantly. I will definitely get the colored ones now. In love
