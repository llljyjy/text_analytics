I adore the Summer Fridays Jet Lag Mask, so I was already excited to try this serum once it launched. Most hydrating serums sink into the skin really quickly, but this one seems to leave more of a residue which I like. The texture is gel-like and it incorporated well into my existing skincare routine. I also use a facial tool at night and I felt like this product helped the facial tool glide on the skin more easily. nan
