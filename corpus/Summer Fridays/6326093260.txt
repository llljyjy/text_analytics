I am a lip balm connoisseur and I LOVE this lip balm, I got the vanilla one because I like having a balm for every day without color to take everywhere with me. I was skeptical at first because let’s face it… price point is NOT it but, you get what you pay for. This has a sweet sugar cookie smell but is flavorless. It’s also not as thick as I thought it would be, and it glides onto the lips very easily. Will repurchase for sure. Heaven-scent sugar cookie/vanilla balm
