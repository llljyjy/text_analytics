This was gifted to me by Summer Fridays in exchange for an honest review. To be honest with you, this brand has been pretty hit or miss for me. This serum is just...okay. While the product itself is pretty good ingredient wise, you can definitely find an alternative for a cheaper price but the product itself does deliver some hydration. nan
