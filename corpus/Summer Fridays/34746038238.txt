Have been using this eye cream for one week one. This have a light shimmery texture. Little bit of thick in consistency and absorb beautifully. As it have vitamin c in it ,so it beautifully brighten up your under eye area.This doesnâ€™t pill up with makeup. You can skip your concealer , use it and it will give you a natural bright eye look. Loving it currently Beautiful eye cream
