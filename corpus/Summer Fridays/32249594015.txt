This is my new obsession in my collection! It’s a hydrating and shimmering eye cream, I’ve noticed my under eye really plumped and not so dark, it leaves a nice glow and it has a great smell. The texture is kinda thick but it doesn’t feel like that when applied to the skin, q little goes a long way! I would keep repurchasing this! The best eye cream
