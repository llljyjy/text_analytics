This serum feels more like a moisturizing “lotion“ in its consistency but isn’t too thick or occlusive. In fact, it took me quite a few pumps to evenly hydrate my whole face and neck because it absorbs into the skin really fast and I kept needing more to saturate it. Despite all this, it works like a charm. The first few times I used it, my skin had been dry and irritated due to the constant changes in weather, When I put this serum on, it instantly stopped the pain I was feeling from the irritation and calmed my skin. The next morning, my skin was back to normal - plump and hydrated with no patches of irritated skin in sight. This experience is what sold me on this serum and I would definitely repurchase it for when my skin is really going through a rough time.
