Maybe it was just the tube I got but the product came 1/4 empty. I totally understand they can’t fill it all the way otherwise product would be spilling out but for $30 I was expecting more product. I also thought there wasn’t much color pay off ether. Maybe I should have got the darker shade? I did really like how this felt on my lips tho! Overall, I Don’t think this was worth the $30 and probably won’t be a reperches. Product came 1/4 empty
