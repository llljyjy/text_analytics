I’ve been using this eye cream in the morning as part of my routine and also at night. I love the consistency and the fact that a little goes a long way! It definitely brightens your under eye, getting rid of the dark circles I usually wake up with. I haven’t seen noticeable results as far as firming, but that may just come with time. Overall really pleased with the product. nan
