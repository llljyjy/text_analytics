The Summer Fridays Dream Oasis Deep Hydration Serum has been a wonderful addition to my skincare collection. I have combination skin so some parts of my face are oily while some are dry. This serum brings hydration to my skin, soothing the dry parts & hydrating the oily parts. It is very lightweight and feels wonderful under a full face of makeup. My skin is always left with a non oily glow after each use. I love it and believe all skin types would benefit from using this serum. Hydration is a must!
