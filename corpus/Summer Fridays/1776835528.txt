This is my first Summer Fridays product and I couldn’t be more impressed! The lip butter balm is thick but in the best way because it’s incredibly hydrating and long lasting. It also provides deep moisture to lips and works well as a lip balm and as an overnight mask. The vanilla flavor is also quite enjoyable. I plan on purchasing all of the other varieties now that I know the formula so good! Truly incredible!!
