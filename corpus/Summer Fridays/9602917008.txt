I’m a big fan of this face oil. It takes dull, tired looking skin and warms it up to the point of glowing. I’m 45 & I need some help to look good every morning. This hits the mark for me. I’m not sure it would work well on on oily skin, but for dry or combination skin, it’s highly effective. It’s easy to apply & it really has improved my skin texture, hydration & even color balance. The 1 oz size has lasted well with daily application. I think I’ll get six months out of the bottle. Very happy with the product. nan
