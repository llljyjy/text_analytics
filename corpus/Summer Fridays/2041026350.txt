I use this as a nighttime final step moisturizer to lock in all the serums/treatments I used prior. I also use this in the morning on my drier days or when I feel like my skin barrier needs some extra support. It is also amazing for traveling, which is its intended use. I always put it on in the morning before traveling and also pack this in my personal bag—but never end up actually needing it on the plane because it does it’s job the first time. A staple in my routine
