This stuff is amazing! I have combo skin so I am sensitive to products that sit on the skin, make your skin feel oily, etc. and this face oil completely absorbs into my skin. I mix in two drops with my moisturizer and it makes my skin look so nice all day long. It also doesn’t pill with any of the other products I use (serum, moisturizer, sunscreen). I appreciate that this product does not include any potentially irritating essential oils like some face oils do, and it comes up as a completely clean product on Clearya. This oil overall feels like an incredibly high quality product, and if you mix it into your moisturizer it can last for a long time, making it worth the price. It definitely a staple in my routine now and I’ll continue to repurchase. best face oil
