I really like this balm! As someone with plumper lips, I always have issues with my lips drying out in winter. I find that this product has really improved my lips overall since I began using it. I’m no longer dealing with the dryness and cracking. My lip makeup goes on so smoothly now and looks even more beautiful. The Vanilla scent is there, but it isn’t overpowering which I love. The packaging looks super chic, and the soft touch really elevates it.  I definitely reccomend this product and plan to make it a staple in my routine. I received this product complimentary from Summer Fridays in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own. Love
