I am lip balm/gloss FANATIC and trust me, I have tried it all. This creates such a luscious, glossy coat on my lips making them feel super super moisturized, especially in freezing cold winter temperatures in Toronto. Everything gets so dry and my lips suffer! I love that the formula isn’t sticky feeling, it leaves a subtle glossy look, and the applicator makes it really pleasant to apply. I’ve gone through my first tube in 2 months and am ordering two more to keep handy for the rest of the frigid winter season. All time favourite for moisturized lips!
