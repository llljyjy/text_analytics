My skin absolutely LOVE this serum. It has a thicker consistency, which is perfect for my dry/dehydrated skin. Sink in beautifully , leaves a slight dewy finish (we love that), and it’s fragrance free and contains ingredients that also helps my redness while soothing my sensitive skin. It’s a winner ! I can see my oily skin peeps love it as well don’t be scared of the thicker texture it’s very lightweight. exactly what my skin needed !
