Receiving this beautiful Dream Oasis Deep Hydration Serum was a nice surprise from Summer Fridays! I was first impressed with the bottle. It felt comfortable to hold and easy to use and not something I would easily misplace. Most serums come in smaller sizes, so it was nice to see serum served in such a good size, plus a convenient container.When I first used it, it felt mildly thicker than most serums, but as I applied, it became immediately lightweight and easily absorbed into my skin. I felt immediate hydration (it definitely lived up to DRENCHED). My skin felt moisturized even before applying on the moisturizer! This is a perfect serum to have during Spring and Summer when skin becomes a lot drier due to the rise in temperature. After a few weeks, it was my most-go-to serum, mostly for the overall feeling. It always left my skin feeling healthy, hydrated and smooth. I use this serum alongside their latest eye cream and it really makes my morning + evening routines. The feeling I can describe is overall clean and classy. I’m just overall impressed with the convenience of use, the way it hydrates/actually works on skin during colder days and how nice it feels to apply on. It doesn’t feel cheap, but light, absorbent, smooth and fresh. I love it. Light, absorbent, smooth and fresh!
