This product is amazing! I prefer to use it in the AM before applying makeup as it brightens under your eye to help remove dark circles. When looking at the eye cream before applying it, it looks a little shimmery but once you apply it there is no shimmer- which I prefer! Great consistency and will definitely be a staple in my skincare routine! Highly recommend this Eye Cream
