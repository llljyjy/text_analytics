First off, this is the only mask that really helped my eczema and visible flaking skin over the winter. This mask has to be used by itself, if you are trying it for the first time, do not use this mask with other “first time products“ or you will not be able to distinguish what products are causing irritation. On top of having eczema, I also get dermatitis as well as severe acne and this product did NOT irritate me. This product is also good if you are a sun worshiper. So try this mask after your normal routine. This product also helped remove deep lines caused by skin trauma from very cold weather... The best and worth the crazy price... The best mask out there!
