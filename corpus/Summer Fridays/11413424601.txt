So, I have been using this for about 4 to 5 days. I know that is not a lot of time to test a product out. However, I have mild to moderate and persistent acne that I have been struggling with for two years. I have tried, literally everything. I am currently using Tretinoin, and I have been struggling with irritation, and with new acne every single day. This may be a purge that I am getting over, but this is one of the only moisturizers that I have used in years that has NOT caused me to develop new breakouts. I usually get 2-3 new breakouts every single day, but I have had ZERO in the last 4 days. I use this everyday, day and night since I’ve received it, and I am afraid to stop using it because I don’t want my results to go away. It’s amazing. I’m so hopeful. Amazing!
