Smells okay, like a strong pumpkin spice, if you’re into that.  Kind of burns and I don’t have sensitive skin at all.  Someone called it an expensive St Ives and yeah, nailed it.  I rarely use it.  Feels like a waste of money.  Wish I would’ve returned it when I could.  $50 down the drain. rough and spicy
