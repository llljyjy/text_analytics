I got this complimentary from Summer Fridays in exchange for my honest review. I have been dying to try Summer Fridays to see if the brand is really worth the hype and I have to say this lip balm helps explain the hype. I got it in the shade Vanilla and it definitely smells like vanilla. If you like that scent, you will love this lip balm, if you donâ€™t, you will hopefully still like it because the scent goes away after a few minutes. It is a non-sticky formula that hydrates the lips for a long time. The packaging is gorgeous too and it is comparable in price to other brands on Sephora. I absolutely recommend it and definitely want to try more products from Summer Fridays now. Summer Fridays Lip Butter Balm
