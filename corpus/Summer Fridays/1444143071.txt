[Gifted by Summer Fridays] This brand has been on my wishlist forever, and I’m so happy to get to try their newest launch! The texture of this serum is so dreamy. Honestly, it feels so hydrating that I feel like I could even use it as a light moisturizer in the summer time. I’m definitely loving this so far! nan
