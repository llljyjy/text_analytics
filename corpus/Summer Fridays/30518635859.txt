I found that this eye cream is effective at brightening the undereye area and reducing the appearance of my dark circles.  Itâ€™s a thick cream, but it feels very lightweight and soothing when I applied. In addition to that, I really enjoyed how hydrating it was. Very pleased with the results so far and the experience I had using it! Loving the results already
