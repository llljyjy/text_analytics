Being the extra skincare girl that I am, my evening routine consists of 5-7 steps and products. Iâ€™ve found that when I layer the jet lag mask on top of several serums and a moisturizer the product pills badly. I love the product so much though, so when I plan to use it I tone down my routine a bit and use it in place of a moisturizer and that seems to work for me :) Pills on top of multiple products
