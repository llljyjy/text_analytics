I’m really enjoying the Summer Fridays Light Aura Vitamin C + Peptide Eye Cream. It leaves my undereye area feeling very hydrated and has a very fine shimmer to it which definitely helps brighten my dark circles instantly. I’ve only been using it for about a week so I haven’t noticed any significant permanent changes to my dark circles, but hopefully, with continued use, they’ll lighten a bit! I received this product complimentary from Summer Fridays. nan
