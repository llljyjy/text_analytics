The vanilla! This Summer Fridays lip balm is vanilla-scented, but like, for real. It’s made with vanillin, the organic compound found naturally in vanilla beans, so the fragrance is a rich and complex, not artificial. There’s no flavor or sweetener here, just lots of hydration and a cool clear tip so you can see exactly how much product you’re dispensing. Beautiful vanilla!
