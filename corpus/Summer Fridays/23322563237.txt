This amazing product was gifted by Summer Fridays. This is the time of year that the cold weather wreaks havoc on my lips and leaves them chapped, peeling and sometimes bleeding.  From the moment I first applied the Summer Fridays Lip Butter Balm it went to work fast hydrating my lips. It is not sticky at all, and it just glides across my lips. it feels awesome!  Using it daily is keeping my lips in tip-top shape during this cold weather. I also wear it at night as a lip mask.  I really like the applicator, and I am so impressed that the product is cruelty free. The scent is simply amazing. In fact, I love the Vanilla scent. I definitely recommend this product!
