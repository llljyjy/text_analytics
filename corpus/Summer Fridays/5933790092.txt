I got this as a sample and am writing this review after three uses (2 AM applications and 1 PM application). I really want to like this product because I have tried several eye creams and I like how this product absorbs into the skin. It’s not irritating to the sensitive skin under my eye. The consistency is great, a thicker cream and I actually like the little sparkle too. My one qualm (or one and half) is that it doesn’t keep the skin moisturized after a certain point and when I woke up, there was a slight orange build up. I can’t see this product having long term benefits if it dries up. so so eye cream
