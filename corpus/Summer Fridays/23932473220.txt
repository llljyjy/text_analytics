I have been using Summer Fridays Dream Oasis Deep Hydration serum for a couple of weeks for my dry skin. I love their Jet Lag mask so I was excited to see a serum by this brand. Fortunately, this serum does not disappoint in its hydration ability. It moisturized my skin without feeling heavy afterward which is lovely. Love that it contains clean ingredients and no synthetic fragrance. Another great product from Summer Fridays! nan
