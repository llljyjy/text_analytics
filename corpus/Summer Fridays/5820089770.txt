I was gifted this from Summer Friday’s in exchange for my honest opinion. I have heard lots of raving about this so I was excited to try it. A little goes a long way, it feels nice going on and doesn’t take a very long time to soak in the skin which is nice. The biggest downfall for me is the sparkly bits, maybe they are beneficial somehow but I do not want glittery looking under eye areas. For this reason I will only ever use this on days I plan to stay in. Such a bummer I would have enjoyed using this daily otherwise. I would only recommend if you don’t mind sparkles/glitter. Unwanted sparkles
