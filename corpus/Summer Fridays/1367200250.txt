I loved the little wash of color this balm had, but it wasn’t super moisturizing. On a positive note, the formula wasn’t sticky, just a little thicker of a consistency, so it felt nice and velvety on the lip. It wasn’t a go-to for me, so unfortunately I did return even though I really wanted to love it. It’s worth a try if you’re looking for a balm with a wash of color! nan
