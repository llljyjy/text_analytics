I purchased this after reading all the great reviews. I’m not too crazy about it ATM, but think it will be great in the winter time. It currently leaves my skin extra oily (I have combination skin with extra oily t-zone in the summer). I do like that it has no scent, is very hydrating, and the pump works great. I didn’t see a difference on my pores or fine lines. Makes me oily, probably best in the winter
