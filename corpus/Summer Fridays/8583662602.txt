I use this every night instead of a 10-min mask and it has transformed my dry skin. I used to wake up with my skin tight in the morning but this has helped so much. I notice in the morning that thereâ€™s still a small layer of it so I wipe it off with a warm towel. Truly fantastic for those with dry, sensitive skin. nan
