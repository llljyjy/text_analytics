I really like this. Great smell and I love that itâ€™s in a tube.  The only reason I took off a star is because the top had some of the balm leaking out but I was able to fix it with a lighter to seal it up again.  Since then no issues.  Will probably pick up the tinted version because of how great this one is. The texture is amazing
