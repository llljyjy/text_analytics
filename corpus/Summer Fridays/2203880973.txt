I have fallen in love with this. It’s a nice, mid weight serum without a strong scent in a gorgeous frosted glass bottle. The ingredient list is amazing, and my skin feels very soft and smooth by the collodial oatmeal and Squalane. It loses one star for price, this is $44 for only one fluid ounce and since I’m using it day and night, I’ll be going through it very quickly. That being said, my skin feels very soothed, very hydrated and much calmer than it did before. If you’re looking for a lightweight serum that will suit most skin types and adds a splash of soothing moisture, this is the perfect serum for you. Summer Friday’s Deep Oasis Deep Hydration Serum
