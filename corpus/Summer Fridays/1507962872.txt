I’ve loved this mask in the past because the formula was great and didn’t break me out. I used to wear it when I flew and it left my skin soft even in the drying airplane cabin. BE CAREFUL: With the new formula, most of the positive reviews are from people they’ve sent PR packages to. The new formula is awful. I went to repurchase and asked a Sephora employee and like other folks here they warned me that many people have reacted to this new formula. I will not be repurchasing. be careful with the new formulation
