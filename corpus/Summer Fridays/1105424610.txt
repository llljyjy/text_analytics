Feels nice going on but I am so glad I could try this in a sample before buying it because it is NOT for oily or combo skin. Made my skin so oily and gross half hour into wearing. By nighttime and the next day I had breakouts from it on my clear skin in areas I don’t even break out in too. No thanks It’s a no for oily or combo skin
