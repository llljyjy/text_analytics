iâ€™m normally wary of eye creams but omg this cream actually works and helped minimize my dark circles(thank you vitamin C!). Not only has it helped the overall look of my under eye, but the actual cream has little specks of sparkle in it, which acts as an highlighter(when i use it in the morning) lol. a MUST in my skincare routine
