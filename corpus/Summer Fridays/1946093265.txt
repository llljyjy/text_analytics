This saved my skin. My skin has been burning, stinging, and reacting for months, it got to the point where I can’t even wash it with plain water. I’ve used the cicaplast, the ceramide creams /Korean skincare and even plain sweet almond oil, some didn’t help at all, some help somewhat but they also break me out. I had to forget about any makeup because I can’t prep my skin, looks terrible, and I can’t wash it off later. This oil gave me a huge jump in hydration, soothing and healing. I’m still dealing with these issues somewhat but this keeps them way at bay. Removes the stinging feeling and I can wear my Kosas concealer again and it goes on smooth and doesn’t look so dry. I’ve even been able to go back to washing my face with Herbivore again. I will buy this again and again. I’m so happy it works and doesn’t make me break out or dry me out further. Some oils have done that for me but for some reason this doesn’t. I’m very grateful. The deep oasis serum on the other hand inflames my skin really bad and burns and stings it. It’s a curse to have dehydrated skin but not tolerate any of the humectants that work really well, hyaluronic acid, amino acids, fatty acids, glutamic acid, polyglutamic acid… still searching for a humectant serum I can tolerate to use under this. If anyone knows hmu. Finally something that worked
