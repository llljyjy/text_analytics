I am on my third bottle of this now and it’s got to be my all time favorite face oil ever. It sinks in and makes my skin look and feel smoother. It doesn’t break me out either which some oils can do. My skin is on the drier side and this is amazing for it. I use it in a heavier layer at night to lock in the rest of my skincare. In the morning before makeup I use a lighter amount to prep my skin for makeup. Absolutely recommend and I’ll happily buy my 4th bottle when the third I’m currently using runs out. LOVE
