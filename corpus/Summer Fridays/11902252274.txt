I’m such a fan of the Summer Fridays lip balms! I had the old packaging and while I love the metal crunchy tube for their other products, it’s not good for a lip balm. With the new packaging you can control the amount you use better and the application with this one is SO much easier. Glides on my lips like a dream instead of using fingers to apply. Slight con - If I use this too much I find that my lips actually get a little chapped. Not dry, just that slight sting of being chapped. Not all the time, just with overuse. Really good balm
