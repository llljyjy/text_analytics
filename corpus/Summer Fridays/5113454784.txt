Why oh why is there glitter/mica in a product used for the thinnest, most sensitive part of your face?! I used it for about a week then noticed my whole eye area peeling and it was flaky. This was the only new product within my skincare routine, everything else is pretty much holy grail, so I new this eye cream was the problem. It took two weeks to recover from this! I don’t have a holy grail eye cream and was hoping this would be the one as I’ve heard great things about the brand. Very disappointed nan
