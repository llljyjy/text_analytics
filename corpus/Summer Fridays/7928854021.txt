While it has great ingredients and is non-irritating, I’m confused about how to incorporate this. It doesn’t moisturize enough alone but when I layer a moisturizer on top it pills (and I’ve tried different moisturizers). It also leaves a sticky residue. I wanted to like it but it’s not worth the hype. Not worth it
