I wanted to love this, but I literally am so disappointed. I love the smell and the applicator is shaped great. The actual product is quite disappointing. I don’t know if I’m allergic to one of the ingredients or what, but my lips tingle and turn red just seconds after this is applied. I’ve never had a pimple near my mouth but after applying this product I woke up the next day with a pimple near my lips. I’m sad that this didn’t work and hope Summer Fridays can create a more sensitive skin friendly and hydrating version of this balm. Sensitive Skin beware !!!
