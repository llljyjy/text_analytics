I received the Lip Butter Balm in Vanilla complimentary from Summer Fridays for review. First of all, I love the chic and minimalistic packaging of this lip balm. It is transparent so you can wear this anytime. Lip balm is the must product for me year around and I wear it overnight. The texture of Summer Fridays lip butter balm is not too thick and really easy to apply. It works fast on my dry lips and they feel instantly smooth. There is a hint of vanilla scent but it is very subtle. However, moisturizing effect does not last for a long time. Since itâ€™s called lip balm, I expected to be very nourishing but it feels more like a lip gloss. Light lip balm
