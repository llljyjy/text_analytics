This is such an amazing light weight serum from Summer Fridays! I have really sensitive / dry skin and this was the perfect product to add to my skincare routine for a bit more moisture. It has some really amazing hydrating ingredients (Glycerin, Hyaluronic Acid and Squalane) as well as ingredients to help calm the skin. I havenâ€™t experienced any irritation or redness after use. Amazing for my dry sensitive skin!
