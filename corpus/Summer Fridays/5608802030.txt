I am so impressed with this Lip Butter Balm from Summer Fridays. Instantly it gives my lips a boost of hydration. It gives lots of moisture without feeling sticky on the lips. This balm smells and has a lovely nice vanilla fragrance that is not overpowering. I love that this product is vegan and has natural moisturizers like Shea butter to soothe dry lips. I also love the applicator tip, the slanted angle makes it great for easy application. I would recommend this to anyone! Soothing Butter Balm
