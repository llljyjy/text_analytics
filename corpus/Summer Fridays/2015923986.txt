Love love, this was a home run for me. I initially got a set of 3 last fall and fell in love. The new packaging is way better and i love the rubbery tip that has a slight curve to apply. The old aluminum type packaging is the reason i held off so long on trying it. This is closer to a gloss-balm in feeling, but with more shine than a typical balm. Sadly my favorite shade from the trio was brown sugar and limited edition so i hope they bring it back permanently. I use the clear one at home and throw the tinted ones in my bag.  The scent is amazing and not at all artificial smelling. They feel hydrating but still light and cushiony on the lips. This works day or night but Iâ€™d probably go with something heavier at night for the very cold winter months. vanilla / vanilla beige / brown sugar
