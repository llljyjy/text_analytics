My dry, parched lips feel immediate relief  after applying Summer Fridays  Lip Butter Balm Vanilla! Love not only the light and pleasant scent, but the instant hydration!  it adds the perfect amount of pretty gloss and my lips feel so good.  Great to use as a lip mask at bedtime to wake up to softer lips! So hydrating!
