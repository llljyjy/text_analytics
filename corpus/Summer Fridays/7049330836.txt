Ok 5 stars+!! Iâ€™ve been wanting to try this for a while and so excited I finally did. The applicator is thoughtfully designed and the balm is not sticky at all. My lips felt hydrated and smooth hours after applying when the product was no longer on the surface of my lips. I want to try the other tints now as well. nan
