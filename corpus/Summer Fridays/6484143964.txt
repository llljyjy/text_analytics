A thick creamy last step moisturizer/sleep mask! I have dry skin so I use this on top of a more jelly light moisturizer. My skin is so calm and smooth the morning after. Its gentle and fragrance free and goes on luxuriously. I think this product would be great for oily skin too as it has a pretty matte finish. Gentle and clean feeling! Thick and creamy.
