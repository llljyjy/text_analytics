This smells amazing!! Vanilla is one my favorite scents for lip balm and sometimes I find it to smell bad and artificial but this smells amazing! Besides the smell, this has done wonders on my lips.  It is a little sticky but I dont mind it too much. I also see myself using it as a lip gloss. Overall I recommend it! (complimentary from Summer Fridays) nan
