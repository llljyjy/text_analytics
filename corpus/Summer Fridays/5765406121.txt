Complimentary from Summer Fridays. This actually reminds me of Plum Plump from Glow Recipe. It’s a light gel hydrator, which I’m not detecting any scent from. The ingredient list is top notch, and it dries non sticky. It doesn’t pill up with my moisturizer, and on it’s own leaves a nice glow. I’m excited to see long term results of more hydrated skin! straightforward hydration lockdown
