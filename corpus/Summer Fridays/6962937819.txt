The beige vanilla colour has the most subtle brown tint that looks so pretty when you have makeup on (at least in my opinion) but I wouldn’t reach for this in particular if i had a bare face. It’s not the most hydrating for the price..if i feel my lips need a boost, I’m reaching for my laneige balm instead! Also not a huge fan of the applicator on this product. Overall, it’s a nice, non-sticky balm/gloss that i would use over already hydrated lips Pretty but not the best balm
