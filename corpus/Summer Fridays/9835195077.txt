Its almost spring / summer which means more oily skin but it still needs hydration. Summer Fridays Gifted me the new Dream Oasis Deep Hydration Serum and I love it!  This is a very unique textured serum as its almost more of a gel like formula and i love how it leaves the skin feeling hydrated but not greasy or heavy. Absorbs very well and leaves my skin plump, happy and ready for the next step! Perfect summer serum
