This was gifted by Summer Friday in exchange for my honest opinion. I am so impressed and happy with this eye cream. The texture is nice, slightly thicker cream. When you first put it on it gives a sheen underneath your eyes making it look brighter and fine lines smoother. It has a very slight citrusy pleasant scent. Perfect
