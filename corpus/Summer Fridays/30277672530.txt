I received this product for my honest review - and I absolutely love this eye cream! It’s a good formula, awesome frosted packaging, and the eye cream itself is like a pastel apricot. The eye cream actually kept my tired new mom eyes from looking like I was one of the walking dead - and that’s what I look for in my eye creams! No dark circles here guys! Definitely recommend this if you are looking to keep those dark circles at bay! nan
