Bought the mini size to use on a flight to help keep my skin moisturized. First, the product does not smell good, not sure if I got a bad batch or if that’s just how it smells. My skin didn’t seem to absorb the product and my forehead honestly seemed drier. I have drier skin so I would not recommend if you do as well. Not for Dry Skin
