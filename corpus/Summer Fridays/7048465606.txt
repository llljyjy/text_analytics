This is one of my new favorite lip balms! It really does have a melted-butter-like texture, so it applies easily into the lips. It also lasts a while on the lips of not disturbed and my lips donâ€™t feel dry after using this. If you enjoy vanilla scents, this one is for you.  The tube also has a soft silicone applicator that curves perfectly to the lips, making it easy to not waste product. nan
