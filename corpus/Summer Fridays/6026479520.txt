Super excited to add a Summer Fridays eye cream into my routine! I love the color & texture of this one as it has a bit of an orange tint to it, perfect for daytime use. It hydrated & instantly plumps my eye area, I also love that they included vitamin C as an ingredient for brightening! My only complaint is that it’s in a jar, as I have long nails so it’s hard to get out. Other than that, I love the packaging! great summer Fridays addition!
