I’ve been using this for 3-4 months and I found this a little too greasy during the fall, but when the winter rolled around, it was perfect!   It is now January.  It feels like -25 out and my heat is blasting which means my skin is super dry.  My cheeks actually got so dry it was flaking even though I normally have acne/oily skin.  After I use this at night, my cheeks are much better the next day and I can put on my powder foundation without it looking flakey.  Because I have struggled with acne my entire life, I checked every ingredient in this mask to make sure it wouldn’t break me out, and so far so good!  It also doesn’t have much of scent, so this is good for people who are sensitive to fragrances as well.Also a little goes a long way!  The sample tube I got lasted me 2 months and I use it twice a week. Best for flakey dry skin!
