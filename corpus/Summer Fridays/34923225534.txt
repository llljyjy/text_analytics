I was looking for an eye cream specifically for dark circles so I knew I wanted Vitamin C but this exceeded my expectations! I didn’t realize how dry my under eye was before I started using this! Someone else called this a cup of coffee for your eyes and it’s the perfect description. My dark circles have improved and this goes on so nicely! So Good!!
