I’ve used this for about three months. It applies nicely, does not burn, and I don’t mind the shimmer or tint. I have noticed no improvement in my eye area in regards to tone or texture. Occasionally, this product has caused mild breakouts around my cheekbones. It does not layer well, making it unsuitable for daytime use, and I don’t know anyone who appreciates a pot for eye cream. This does not even come with a spatula, unlike Summer Fridays moisturizer. It really should… If your eye area is moderately to very dry, this is not for you. My skin is oily, and this is barely adequate for me. Overall, this is a barely mediocre eye cream and I would only recommend it if you have glass-like texture around your eyes, wear zero makeup, have no problem with glitter, are not super fair, and are not prone to blemishes or milia. not for the fair skinned or sensitive
