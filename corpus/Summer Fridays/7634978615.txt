Love this lip balm. Mixed reviews so I thought I would share. It feels and looks like a luxury lip balm. The packaging and applicator is amazing and if you are ok with spending 30 on a lip balm it’s great. It doesn’t have a glosssy or a chapstick waxy consistency, it’s somewhere in between.  I love the look of it over lip liner for a no makeup look, it gives a nice shine to the lips without being sticky or glossy. There isn’t colour but it brings out the colour in my lips. This is my first high end lip balm so I can only compare it to cheaper products and yes it is better. Is it worth it? That will be up to you but I really like it. I hate the laneige, but I love this. nan
