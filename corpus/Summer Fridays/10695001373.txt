As a big fan of SF, I was a bit hesitant to buy this product.  Oil? For my face? Really? Yep, really.  It’s not what you might think. I can happily report that this stuff is nothing short of a skincare powerhouse!!  I’d been using Jet Lag at night and just love that product. It’s great for when my skin needs a real boost or feels, well...tired.  Now I’m alternating. Nightly my routine is Dream Oasis Serum followed by 3-4 drops of Heavenly Sixteen. I wake up.to soft, glowing skin.  This oil absorbs very quickly and it doesnt feel heavy or greasy. It just magically soaks into your skin, leaving it soft and luminous.  If you are undecided about this product, rest assured you are not wasting your money. It’s an investment for your face. Love, love, love it!! POWERHOUSE SKINCARE!
