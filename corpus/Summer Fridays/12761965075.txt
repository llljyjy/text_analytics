I received this product complimentary from Summer Fridays in exchange for my honest review. I have been enjoying this creamy serum for how calming and hydrating it feels on my skin. It has a lightweight texture that absorbs instantly while leaving my skin supple and deeply hydrated. Pairs well with the rest of my routine. Has no fragrance. Highly recommend! nan
