Light Aura Vitamin C + Peptide Eye Cream is housed in a small but heavy glass container.  The peach color as well as the shimmer inside the eye cream were unexpected. Light Aura is the perfect addition to my morning routine! The eye cream absorbs almost instantly and most importantly completely into the skin without leaving behind any unwanted greasy residue. The shimmery particles illuminate and brighten the under eye area and make my eyes look more awake. Anyone who is not a fan of strong scents, will appreciate the light and barely detectable scent of this eye cream. Brightens and illuminates the under eye area!
