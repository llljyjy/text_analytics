I love this! The color super sheer brownish tone and it’s really pretty especially if you have a warmer skin tone like I do. It doesn’t last super long, but it’s a nice topper to a lipstick in the same shade range (like the Merit Slip I believe is the name).  It feels very cute and festive. Love this!
