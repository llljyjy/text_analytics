Fantastic added moisture in the winter! I add a couple of drops to my face right before I rub my moisturizer on. My skin feels particularly velvety and hydrated, giving my moisturizer that little extra kick when its super dry out. I haven’t noticed any kind of break outs or reaction to this product, and I have a tendency to have pretty sensitive skin around my chin and cheeks. I’m interested to see if this is still the case in the warmer months.There is a kind of earthy oil smell when first applying but it goes away near immediately once it has soaked in. I don’t find it unpleasant even when I do smell it.Pretty stoked to keep using this product, my skin so far seems to love it. nan
