Summer Fridays Light Aura is very compatible to Ole Henriksen Banana Bright Cream. When you apply and compare the two products, you can’t really see the difference. However, Summer Fridays has more micro-glitter (which soaks into the skins within an hour - so don’t worry about all the glitter) and feels oiler compare to Ole Henriksen.  So far I don’t feel like it’s doing anything for me. But I must say, it’s moisturizing, but not firming. It definitely makes my under eyes appear brighter but without the product my under eyes still looks the same. I’ll continue to use it, and hoping to see some changes as it generally takes time for my skin to see results. Moisturizing
