This is my first experience with this brand. I had over exfoliated my skin and had really bad dry patches, especially around my nose. I wanted to try a hyaluronjc acid to help and I took a chance on this one. I literally noticed an improvement after 1 day. I am now using this morning and night. It’s allowing me to treat my oiliness and sebaceous filaments a lot more effectively because those products don’t dry my skin out as much anymore when I’m using this in for junction with them. I only wish it came in a bigger bottle because at two times a day I have already used a lot of it. Impressed
