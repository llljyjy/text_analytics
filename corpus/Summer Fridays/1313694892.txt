The packaging broke the first time I used it. The top opened quite a bit, making the product leak out. I taped it back together and am carful when I use it. I enjoy the way the product looks on my lips. It is shiny and lasts a long time on the lips. I donâ€™t find it moisturizing, I think that it might be drying out my lips. As a lip gloss it is nice, but not a lip balm. I will finish it but will not buy it again. packaging broke and the product is just ok.
