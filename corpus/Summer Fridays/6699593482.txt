Didn’t work for me at all. It had a tingling sensation at first, which I thought “that’s how it works”, but it didn’t. I kept using it to give it a chance and thought at least it can hydrate the area for a bit, but nope nothing. While I know my dark circles won’t magically disappear this seemed to enhanced it and I can see more of the small bumpy texture coming out. I wouldn’t recommend to anyone with sensitive and/or dry skin. nan
