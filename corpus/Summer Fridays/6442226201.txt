Such a gorgeous eye cream with so many benefits! I’ve genuinely noticed a difference in how my under eyes have been appearing lately, after using it. I really like how dewy my skin appears, I almost don’t need to apply concealer honestly. Not to mention, smells amazing. Only drawback, I’m not a big fan of thicker creams, but that’s just my preference. Regardless, it’s so rich and lasts all day!! nan
