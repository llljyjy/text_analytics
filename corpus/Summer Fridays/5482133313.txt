I wanted to use this for a couple weeks before writing a review.  I am obsessed with oils, but unfortunately a lot of them lead to breakouts on me except for a select few if I only use them at night after the rest of my skincare.  This one intrigued me because it is mostly cold pressed seed oils which are molecularly smaller and easier to absorb.  I apply 2 drops over my moisturizer (ole henriksen strength trainer) in the morning and my makeup applies beautifully over it.  I apply 3 drops at night over the same moisturizer and my skin loves this stuff.  It absorbs more than any oil I’ve ever tried.  It doesn’t absorb entirely, there’s still a bit that stays dewy and glowy, but not a complete oil slick like others that just sit on top and never soak in.  It had made my skin SO soft and smooth and cleared any active breakouts.  My skin was breaking out a bit when I first started using it, but my period was coming and was the real culprit. Because after my period, my skin cleared right up and I’ve been using this oil consistently day and night all the way through.  I think I’ve finally found the right oil blend for my skin.  I have dry skin with occasional hormonal breakouts.  I’ve tried Sunday Riley (Luna, Juno, CEO), Fresh, Josie Maran, Clarins, dermalogica, korres, etc.  If there’s a face oil in the line, I’ve used it!   This one takes the cake.  I’ve been wanting to try the True Botanicals Renew radiance oil, but this one is more than half the cost and works phenomenally.  So give it a try!   (Pro tip: rub it between your hands/fingers and press it into the skin, not rub). Best I’ve Tried
