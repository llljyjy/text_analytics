Smells great, but the product doesn’t plump anything at all- it also dispenses clear the first 5-6 uses before the color mixes in. Felt like such a waste, I can’t shake it to mix it because of the packaging and if you try to squeeze it to mix it you risk popping the opposite end of the tube. Only pro is the fragrance is delicious
