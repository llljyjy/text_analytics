I’ve been absolutely loving this product as a morning and night eye cream. It goes on very light and you don’t need much of it - I can tell this product will last me a long time. This is the first eye product I’ve used that has Vitamin C in it and I can definitely tell a difference in the brightness of my under-eye area! Excellent brightening eye product!
