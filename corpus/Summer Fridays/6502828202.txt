at first i didn’t think this was worth the price but now that i’ve been using it for a month or so i can really see a difference. i have an autoimmune disease that causes me to have darkness around my eyes and i always thought nothing would fix it. this eye cream hasn’t fixed it but it 100% has made my under eyes and eyelids look less dark and makes me look more awake. it’s also a nice consistency and very hydrating. give it some time to work and it’s worth every penny to me amazing
