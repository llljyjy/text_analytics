The poppy one smells SO GOOD. This was my first time trying a pricier lip balm and I’m really happy with it. It feels really nice on my lips and has a bit of stick to it, but it doesn’t get gloppy or stick to itself when you rub your lips together. It is so thick that it takes some effort to spread though. nan
