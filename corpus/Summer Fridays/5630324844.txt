Have been using for one month. Bought it because I was using a more expensive brand and was hoping to find something more reasonably priced. Liked it for the first week. But after a month, I noticed dry patches on my eyelids. Area around my eye has started stinging every time I apply the cream. Iâ€™ve stopped using and will not buy again. does NOT hydrate. disappointed
