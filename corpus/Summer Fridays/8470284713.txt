I started using this as a mask 2-3 times a week, but eventually started using it once a day as a nighttime moisturizer and my skin looks the best it has in years!! Great product! At first, I thought it was a bit expensive, but it is SO worth it and even though I use it every day it lasts a long time because a little truly goes a long way! Works great as a moisturizer!
