I brought the Vanilla Beige one and it’s a nice lip balm. It gives a nice sheer tint to the lips and it’s not sticky. I Love the scent. Not very long wearing, I find myself constantly reapplying and its not the most moisturizing. I feel the formula is on the thinner side. But I do enjoy it overall. Although its on the pricier side for a lip balm, it is decent enough to justify and I love the look it gives my lips and the scent. Not mad at it
