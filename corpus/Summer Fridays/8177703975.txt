I am absolutely in LOVE with this serum! The bottle says you can wear it alone or under lotion and I didnâ€™t believe it at first, but now I use it alone sometimes just when my skin needs a refresher throughout the day. A little bit goes a long way with this serum, Ali though I do wish it came in a bigger size. This is better than their CC me serum which I absolutely love also! Perfect if you love somewhere cold to lock in moisture Holy Grail of Serums!
