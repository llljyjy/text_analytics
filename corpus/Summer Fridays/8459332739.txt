Typically more on the oily side, but I do have combination skin. I donâ€™t use this every week, but when I do feel my skin starting to get dry, I will use this before bed. I really love the over night results. Makes my skin feel hydrated and refreshed. I am almost out and I will be buying this product again. I would recommend! Bye Dry Skin
