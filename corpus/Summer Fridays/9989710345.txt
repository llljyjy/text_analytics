This is a great serum if you have oily acne prone skin that needs some hydration! I like it because it’s a cream consistency, but it’s lightweight and it feels pretty nice on the skin. I took one star off because it’s pricey and doesn’t offer as much hydration as I would like but it’s still nice great lightweight hydration
