Smells SOOOOO good and the color is so pretty, but unfortunately that’s where the good stops. Although it feels great and buttery smooth after initially applying, this dried my lips out SO BAD!!!!! I’ve never had a lip balm do this before. I’m super bummed because like I said - it DOES smell and (initially) smell amazing :( nan
