I suffer from very very dry lips, especially in the winter. The applicator/packaging is amazing and it smells divine, but unfortunately, this product is only hydrating while it is physically on your lips. As soon as itâ€™s wiped off or worn off, my lips are back to being dry. I was hoping the results would be more long-lasting. underwhelmed
