this is one of the only formulas of lip balm I actually love. Any other lip balm is too dry and not long lasting. This is great for daytime as it appears like a hydrating gloss but feels like a buttery lip mask and not too heavy. You can also use it as a lip mask in dry and colder months overnight if you put on a thicker layer. It keeps my lips happy in the long term. My one concern is that the price is Too high but I still keep buying it. If you have money to spend and want a luxury lip item then you won’t be disappointed. my third tube…and I can’t stop
