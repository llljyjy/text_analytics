This is the every day eye cream I wanted. Good ingredients (vitamin c, peptide), feels thick and moisturizing without being greasy, and no weird smells. I use it under my eyes and around up to my lids. It feels so good going on and I feel like it adds the extra moisture I want to keep hydrated to prevent wrinkles. I use it am and pm and a little goes a long way, so the jar will probably last me a while. Great Ingredients
