This formula is very smooth and has a fun shimmer to it!! You donâ€™t need a ton of product when using it since it goes on so easily. I generally use this eye cream at night and I will occasionally use it in the morning if needed. If I do use it in the morning, I give it enough time to fully dry before applying my concealer and makeup. This product is very moisturizing and leaves my skin looking and feeling hydrated!! Smooth and moisturizing!
