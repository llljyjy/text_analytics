Summer Fridays hydration serum is amazing and it feels like heaven on the skin. After using it I immediately feel my face plump and become more moisturized. I enjoy using it after my retinols to add some hydration. It didn’t cause my other products to pile and it didn’t have an overwhelming scent Thankfully which is something I always pay attention to. nan
