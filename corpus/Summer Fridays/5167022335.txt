This is seriously one of the best lip balms out there. It’s so hydrating and nourishing to my lips without being sticky, and it helps to keep my lips from drying out so bad they get cracks (an issue I’ve been struggling with for years). They make tinted versions if you prefer a pop of color too. My favorite lip balm
