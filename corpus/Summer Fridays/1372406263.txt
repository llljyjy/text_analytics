I’ve hit the age where eye cream has become a regular part of my life and I had struggled to find one that I really loved.  Most were too fragrant or too heavy and left me feeling oily and greasy.  This one is so different!!  I love it.  It’s super light weight, refreshing and the smell is subtle and not overpowering.  My eyes are very sensitive to product around them and this one does not irritate them at all and leaves my skin feeling nourished and smooth.  Highly recommend! Refreshing and Soothing
