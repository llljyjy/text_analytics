This is a no for me. I think this would be a great beginner eye cream for someone who is young without dark circles or dryness. It does give the appearance of hydration at first but I think I see tiny gold flakes or glitter in it so that could be why. I have used an entire jar morning and night to really give this product some time to work and it just didn’t. I have a little bit of discoloration in the inner corner and it did not lighten it. I also have found that my concealer does not look better underneath this product nor does it look hydrated. I have had problems with pilling occasionally and the product did give me a burning sensation one time. Sadly, I’m still on the market for a great under eye cream. nan
