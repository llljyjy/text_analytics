I’ve been using this beauty for almost 2 weeks now and I’m so impressed! It’s light and absorbs well, gives my under eyes a lovely boost of radiance and glow. It’s hydrating and it has helped with morning puffy eyes too. I also have really sensitive skin/prone to getting milia and this eye cream didn’t give me milia - no irritation at all. So so happy! It also works well under makeup too. Definitely recommend this! obsessed with this eye cream!
