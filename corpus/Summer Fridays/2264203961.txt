Enjoy using this overtime mask. Despite there being no active ingrediant like an AHA/BHA for exfoliation, it uses apricot seed powder for a natural skin exfoliant. I apply it on dry skin with my fingers in a circular motion and then let it sit for ~ 10 mins (the directions say 1 minute). As you let it sit you feel a slight tingle (not a burn), which I like to feel with masks. Once I feel the mask has absorbed a bit, I dampen my fingers and wash the mask off in circular motion. The larger beads at this point help with a gentler scrub. The warm smells of nutmeg and clove oil also likely invigorate the skin for the within glow results at the end. Consistency is not runny like water/serum, but not like a thick cream either, somethingin-between. Good for a Sunday skin treat, after a light steam to your face for added penetration Natural skin scrub
