I have been using this product for a few weeks and I love it. It is very lightweight and moisturizing. During the holidays my under eyes were very dehydrated (because of the usuals -not drinking enough water, leaving the heater on etc) and this really helped me to rehydrate the area and remove darkness and puffiness. I swear by this now! Itâ€™s a must try! A must try for hydration!
