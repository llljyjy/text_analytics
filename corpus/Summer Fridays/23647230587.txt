Solid moisturizer! It absorbs quickly, not sticky, and does leave the skin feeling nicely hydrated. What’s nice too is that, if you feel dry again, it’s easy to reapply without feeling heavy. I live in super humid weather, so a typical cream moisturizer feels terrible if you’re outside for any amount of time. I’ve actually purchased this twice! Hubs and I really enjoy it. He has dry dehydrated skin, and I have more combo to normal skin. Great for humid climates
