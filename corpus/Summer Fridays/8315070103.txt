Obsessed doesn’t begin to cover how I feel about this eye cream! I LOVE all my Summer Fridays products but for the longest time I wanted them to make an eye cream and it’s finally here!!! It’s incredibly hydrating and I love the subtle glow/shimmeriness of it. My skin is very sensitive and overall dry (especially around the eye area) and I feel like this has really helped moisturize it and hasn’t caused any sensitivity or irritation. Definitely recommend! THE PRODUCT I HAD BEEN WAITING FOR!!!
