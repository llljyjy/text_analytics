I was very excited to try this serum and I must say it did not disappoint. I have dry skin and hydrating serums are my favorite to use as my skin just loves them. I really like the formula :  creamy and lightweight. The serum just sink into my skin instantly and gives my skin the hydration it needs. It’s not sticky at all and it works great with my other skincare products (I didn’t experience any pilling). Also it doesn’t have any fragrance which I personally love. This is a wonderful product. Wonderful creamy serum
