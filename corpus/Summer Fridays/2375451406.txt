I really like this product. It’s even better than lip masks from laneige and KAJA. It feels Vaseline like and really nourishes the lips overnight. It keeps my lips hydrated during the day even in heatwave and I do not need to put on lip balm during the day to keep my lips moist. LOVE! It’s my new favorite!!
