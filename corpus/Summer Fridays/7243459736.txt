amazing for dry skin! gentle enough to use as a morning cleanse if I choose and I love to use this after going in with Naturium purple ginseng cleansing balm. my skin is dry (I use 1-2 topical prescriptions which dry me out and I live in the Midwest so winters are harsh on my skin) and this is my fav cleanser I’ve tried (beat out Krave matcha hemp & FAB cleanser which were my previous holy grails). I got the rec to try from a Whitney Simmons vid, now I’m addicted lol! fav cleanser for dry skin!
