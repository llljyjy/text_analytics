This has to be my favorite new launch yet! Possibly my favorite SF launch aside from jet lag. This serum is milky, soothing and deeply hydrates my skin. I love to use it in the morning and the night after cleansing, and before moisturizer. Definitely my top hydrating serum you’ve tried, and I’ve tried a handful! It has not caused any irritation or breakouts and my skin is pretty reactive. I can see myself reaching for this for months to come! Soothing milky serum
