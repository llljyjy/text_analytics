*gifted by Summer Fridays*I love this new hydrating jelly serum from Summer Fridays! It has a light creamy texture that soaks into your skin very nicely and isn’t sticky or greasy. My skin feels smoother and softer after using. I’m so excited to see long term results! The packaging is also adorable and I love the pump. nan
