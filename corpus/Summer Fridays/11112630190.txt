I’ve been using this summer fridays lip balm for sometime & I must say how great this smells. The applicator is so easy to use and allows easy application unto lips not only for day time but also over night mask. This lip butter balm applies smoothly and isn’t sticky at all which I find happens in a lot of balms. It also has this beautiful vanilla smell so making my lips kissable lol . It’s hydrating and last sometime before needing to reapply Buttery vanilla
