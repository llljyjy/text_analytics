This reminds me of a mask I used to buy in Sweden by a company called Pur (discontinued/evaporated off the face of the earth) that made a pumpkin exfoliating mask. I spent years trying to find a replacement and this is it. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say this is the exact same formulation in different packaging. Might feel too gritty for some, but I love it. Doesn’t feel harsh on my sensitive combination skin. Perfect for Fall weather. Pumpkin spice vibes. One of my favorite masks
