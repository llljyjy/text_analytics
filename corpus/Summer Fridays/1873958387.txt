I have combo skin so I was a little skeptical about this mask being a balm because I thought it would make me super oily.. but to my surprise this mask gently exfoliated my skin & left my skin silky smooth! I love it. I did have to wash my face off a couple more times to get the balmy film off. Once I washed my face my skin felt AMAZING. Love this mask! nan
