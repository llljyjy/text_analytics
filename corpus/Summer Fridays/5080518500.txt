The formula thick and a bit sticky. Also, it has a very nice vanilla scent which may be too strong to those with scent sensitivities (my boyfriend could smell it a couple of feet away from me). I applied throughout the day and even though my lips looked nice and shiny when wearing it, once it wore off or once I ate or drank something my lips weren’t hydrated. I didn’t feel a difference on my lips after using it. Strong scent
