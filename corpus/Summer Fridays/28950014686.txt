I received this Light Aura Vitamin C + Peptide Eye Cream complimentary from Summer Fridays in exchange for my honest review. I thought this eye cream was pretty moisturizing and that it absorbed into my skin pretty well. I think that it seems to make my undereyearea look slightly brighter as well! nan
