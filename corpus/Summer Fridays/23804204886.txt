This is an AMAZING product. I had terrible skin before using it (huge pores, scaring, pigmentation, acne, etc.) and this serum transformed my skin! Somehow it significantly reduced my pores and my scaring a million times better. I wake up with hydrated and soft skin with a cloud like skin texture and I notice a big difference if I donâ€™t use it. It has even controlled my oil production. I do have oily skin so I use it at night because it is a bit heavy in the day for my super oily skin. Overall, it is like a magic in a bottle especially after about two weeks of use. Magic in a Bottle
