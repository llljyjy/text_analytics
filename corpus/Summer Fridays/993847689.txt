I’m in my early 40’s with dehydrated, combo skin living in a dry, arid climate so I knew from the moment the Dream Oasis Deep Hydration Serum launch was announced that I HAD to try it! It’s such an impressive lightweight hydrating serum. First of all, the ingredients are absolute perfection and my skin is responding incredibly to Dream Oasis. It has a light, fresh aroma and a gel serum consistency but it doesn’t leave the skin feeling sticky or tacky. It absorbs beautifully into the skin, doesn’t feel heavy, and settles into a silky finish that plays very well with makeup. This serum soothes my skin and truly does seal in moisture for all-day hydration. OBSESSED! nan
