The reviews got me excited but I don’t like this. Or maybe it just isn’t for contact lense wearers. When you first put it on it feels great but then it irritates the eyes and makes my eyes water! I also DO not have dry under eyes or dark circles but I swear this dries out my eye and gives me the appearance of dark circles. Also those glittery sparkles serve what purpose? I’m definitely returning this. nan
