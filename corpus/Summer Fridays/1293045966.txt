I really like this lip butter balm. I’m allergic to a lot of lip balms and was hesitant to try this out but my lips didn’t react to it. Not the most amazing lip balm though I’ve yet to find one. It’s very shiny on and moisturizing. My lips weren’t dry when it wore off like most reviewers. I do find this product quite pricey but I’m willing to continue using it as it’s difficult for me to find lip balms I’m not allergic to. I like it enough to purchase the colored one. Not too bad
