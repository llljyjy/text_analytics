I love this serum; let me tell you why. I really like the packaging. It’s aesthetically pleasing to me. The pump is easy to use and I haven’t had any issues with clogging or malfunctioning. Now, for the formula itself. I must say I feel that the price is reasonable. You get a full ounce of product which is standard for many luxury skincare brands. The serum is not so much a serum but more of a jelly type consistency. It’s not going to drip down your face because it’s liquidy. It absorbs really well into the skin while leaving behind a hint of tackiness. I know that it’s there yet it doesn’t feel heavy. Also want to mention that I applied this before foundation to see what it would do as a primer and it worked well with the combination! No pilling or patchiness. I would highly recommend as this serum works so well for my skin. This serum was gifted by Summer Fridays. In exchange I provided my honest review. This serum is great!
