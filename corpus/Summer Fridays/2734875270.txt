Got it for an undiagnosed rash I’ve had for the last 11 years. I suspect eczema. Not important, anyways this  wonderful mask not only soothes my skin when almost nothing else will, it also seems to have cleared up all my acne and most of my hyperpigmentation has faded. My skin is actually flawless. Btw if you’re like me and your skin hates everything, I also recommend the overnight repair cream, dewy skin mist, and the essence by tatcha. I also recommend dr jart’s sheet masks! But back to this product… so many people have recommended it to me over the years and I finally got it. No regrets. This is a new favorite for sure. GET IT
