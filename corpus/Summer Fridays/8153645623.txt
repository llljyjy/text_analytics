Loves this. Makes your lips feel so buttery smooth and it glides on effortlessly. I love the applicator and how it kind of goes with the roundness of your lip. Smells so good too. Only complaint is I feel like the tube should have been a little fuller for this price point, or maybe just donâ€™t use such a long tube? Idk but I will be buying it again. buttery as the name says
