i have this lip butter, as well as the vanilla which is clear and i have to say i prefer vanilla more, as i feel that it’s more moisturizing. however, the color of this is absolutely gorgeous and this is very hydrating, though i find the hydration doesn’t last as long as the clear shade. still an amazing product and i will most likely repurchase because i love the scent, the color, and the formula. nan
