There’s nothing I don’t like about this eye cream so far. It has an instant brightening effect but also contains vitamin C which should help to brighten and the peptides help firm the area after long term use. I usually get milia & congestion 1-2 days after using any eye cream. I’ve been using this for 7 days and I can say I haven’t had any congestion/breakouts, it brightens and works well under concealer & other makeup. Obsessed! Brightening
