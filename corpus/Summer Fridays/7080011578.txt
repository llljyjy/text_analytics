From the moment I opened this I knew it was going to be an amazing product based off the smell alone! It’s super convenient in the tube compared to other lip masks I’ve used that are in a jar. It was non-sticky, long-lasting, and left my lips feeling super nourished & hydrated. I definitely recommend this to others! nan
