I’ve just started using this and have already seen results. It’s a thicker texture but not heavy and easily absorbs. I can wear makeup over it once I’ve given it time to set in and it doesn’t affect my makeup! It’s not irritating and it cancels out/brightens the blue tone under my eyes. I think it’s one of my favorite eye creams and I’ll definitely be using it consistently! nan
