Bought this on a whim because of the god forsaken clock app, like literally walking around Sephora being ignored by the employees and just recognized the product. Anyways, I stay up way too late gaming and this really makes it looks like I get 10 hours of sleep. I don’t use make up most days so it’s a life saver, still dope under make up too. nan
