Iâ€™ve been using the Beige Summer Fridays lip balm for a few months and recently tried the Vanilla one as well. Both are very hydrating, not sticky and feel nice on the lips. The packaging is great, the applicator makes it easy to apply on the go. Bonus: they smell divine, like sweet delicious vanilla (not sickly sweet though). They will last a long time too. Very good!
