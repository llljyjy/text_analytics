This eye cream is light weight yet moisturizes enough that I feel hydrated after a nights sleep. I can’t stand when eye creams disappear on your pillow or somehow vanish from your eye by morning. It also brightens your under eyes ever so slightly which is nice, especially on no-makeup days. Makeup application goes on smoother & flawless. Very satisfied with this product. Light ✨ yet effective
