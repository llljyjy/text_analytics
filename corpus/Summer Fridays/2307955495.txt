Oasis is a beautiful and extra hydrating serum. I have an oilier skin nowadays and used this serum first time over my vitamin C serum. It took only a dime size portion to cover my face and neck. Serum has a watery texture and feels bit sticky on my face, similar to how hyaluronic serums work. I did not layer a cream over it as my skin seem to be loaded with hydrating coat. It leaves a dewy finish and my skin felt bit oily and shiny afterwards. But it wasnâ€™t a turn off for me as I loved the plumper looking skin. It definitely gives a dewy skin finish if used under makeup as well. Super Hydration
