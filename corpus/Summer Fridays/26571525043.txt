I bought the travel size version of this in hopes to keep my skin hydrated and plump looking for my flight to London, then Paris, then back home to NY. This did a great job and I’m happy with the amount of product given for the price. The consistency is a bit thick but a little goes a long way. I wouldn’t put too much as you may risk looking a bit too oily if you have combo or normal skin. PS: my typical skin care products are La Roche Posay, Youth to the People, and COSRX. I washed my fash at the airport w/ LRP face wash and applied my snail musin from COSRX prior to this product and they all worked well together. No pimples to report! Works Well for Hydrating
