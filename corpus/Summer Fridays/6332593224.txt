One of the best lip balms I’ve ever tried. It’s super moisturizing and has such a sweet subtle scent to it that’s barely noticeable. The applicator has a curve to it which is great for getting a smooth and even application. It also distributes a little at a time so you’re not left with globs of product on your lips. Love it! Love it
