This product is nice, creamy and soft. I expect to have a very citrus like scent but there is actually hardly any scent and for someone like me with allergies to strong scents this was really nice product! Itâ€™s cute and travel size which is perfect for people on the go. The texture itself reminds me of clay but way softer and lighter. Im a sucker for eye cream, anything that helps tighten and refresh your skin and this does exactly that! Goes on smoothly and leave skin feeling firm, bright, and fresh. So excited to try more products! nan
