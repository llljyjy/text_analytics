This has been such a life saver. Recently I’ve used an eyelash serum that has irritated my under eyes and made them a bit darker. I’ve in turn, used concealer under my eyes more often which has made them dryer than usual. This Summer Fridays eye cream has not only lightened my under eyes but also hydrated them after frequent use.  Now my concealer looks smoother and less dry under my eyes. nan
