Hands down one of my new holy grail lip products. It truly feels so buttery and comfortable, but not sticky at all. Nice and thick, and deeply moisturizing, and keeps my lips hydrated for hours (works GREAT as an overnight balm!) and adds just a beautiful, natural tint. I use this daily and will be buying more colors/fragrances! New holy grail!
