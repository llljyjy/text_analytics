You need to experiment with this to make it work.  1) if you wait too long after toner, the serum will just sit on your skin and creates a gummy barrier  2) figure out what sunscreen or moisturizer you can combine this with.  I have so many that do not work well together (and end up pilling at different degrees) and have resorted to only using this when I work from home.  Itâ€™s not worth the hassle for me. Feels great on skin, but pills like crazy
