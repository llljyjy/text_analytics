Upon first application I loved the way it looked under my eyes. I use eye cream around my entire eye area and this eye cream is not for that. It looks wild if applied on top eyelids. I love the color and the shimmer. But I’m terms of effectiveness it does nothing. After the second time I used it my eyelids were itchy and irritated. It is not a soothing formula. It pilled horribly. You basically have to swipe it a couple times and then leave it alone otherwise it pills way too fast. Does not work well under makeup either because of this reason. I gave it a few more chances before returning. That itchy burny feeling was super annoying and if I tried to scratch it it would just pill up. Honestly seems like more of a makeup product than it does skincare. Only gave 2 stars because I did enjoy the look of it upon initial application. Otherwise it would’ve been one star. Really lacking
