I have been pleasantly surprised with this cleanser! It has a really nice lather, smells good, and cleans well without stripping the skin. So far, I haven’t had any irritation and I have extremely sensitized skin. It’s only been a few days but I have found myself reaching for this cleanser the last couple days over other ones. This is a little pricey but if you want a gentle but thorough cleanser for sensitive skin, then give it a shot. The packaging is also super sleek and cute! Try it!!
