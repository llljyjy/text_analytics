This product is NOT for sensitive skin. I use this around my period because my skin usually breaks out due to hormonal imbalance. I notice if I keep it in my makeup fridge it causes more irritation than applying at room temperature. The first 5-10 minutes cause a strong irritation but after that the sensation dulls out. I wash with cool water to prevent anymore irritation and use (a deluxe sample) of the fresh overnight calming mask (I recommend REN’s evercalm mask over fresh’s, it’s cheaper with significantly better results.) By the morning, my breakouts have calmed down, my skin looks less dull, and overall I like what it does. I took a star off since it’s quite harsh for how expensive the product is. nan
