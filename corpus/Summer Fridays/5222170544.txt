This stuff looks great on, but I agree with other reviewers that it’s not very nourishing or moisturizing. I have extremely dry lips all the time no matter what I do or wear, and I was really hoping this would do more to combat that. Unfortunately, it doesn’t last very long either. I continue to use it, but I probably won’t restock when I run out. The color is beautiful, though! More of a gloss than a balm
