LITERALLY LIFE CHANGING. I have always had bad acne and I am currently on my second round of accutane. The first time I did accutane, I had horrible skin peeling and dryness. After starting my second round of accutane, the only product I changed was adding the summer fridays oil at night and I seriously haven’t had any peeling or dryness during my whole 6 month accutane treatment. If you want even more hydration, use this and then top it with a moisturizer (i used cerave cream) but it’s seriously an amazing product. 10000% recommend Literally cured my accutane dryness
