I have extremely sensitive, Dehydrated skin that can easily break our (lucky, I know), and nothing hydrates my skin like this mask. I use it more as a night moisturizer for best results. It doesn’t break me out and makes my skin so supple, smooth and even. My facialist couldn’t believe how much my skin improved! This mask truly is incredible as a moisturizer for winter!!!!
