I truly NEVER write reviews but I had to for this product. It is so hydrating and really calms my skin. I have rosacea and this product doesn’t irritate my skin at all. I love so many of the Summer Fridays products but this has to be my favorite. I haven’t even finished the bottle and I already ordered a new one. My only complaint is that I wish it came in a bigger size! Already repurchased after one week of use!
