It helps, for a day. This is not a long term product, Iâ€™ve used for 6 weeks and cant notice any big differences under my eyes, but right when I put the product on and even a few hours later the dark circles will be gone. so if your looking for a day product or a night out, this is a good product to try, but if your like me looking for something permanent, I would try something else.
