I have the laneige lip balm is the squeeze form and i wanted to try this one out. i didn’t like it. it doesn’t smell amazing like i thought, there is tiny which i didn’t know. i just thought it was called beige vanilla and i thought that was the sent or something. it was expensive and i’d rather use the laneige one. don’t get it
