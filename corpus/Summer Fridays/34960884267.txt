This eye cream looks sticky in texture, but gets absorbed into the skin very easily, leaving the skin around the eyes instantly hydrated. It has almost no smell. After using it for a few days, the fine lines around the eyes seem to be reduced. I have not seen the effect of removing dark circles. After all, I often stay up late. nan
