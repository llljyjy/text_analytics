I love this balm. I didn’t have any issue with the previous metal tube packaging because I only used this at night, and wasn’t bothered with any mess. At least I knew I was getting every last bit of it. You could see when it was DONE. What I realized with this new packaging though, is that it’s easier to use, sure, but man, there is a LOT of product left inside the tube even after you’ve pulled a muscle squeezing it for the very last bits. I cut it open and scraped out every last bit...and I ended up with a blob that’s good for at least 15 more uses. And then I scrape the corners of the 2 parts of the tube even more, and yep, there’s still more stuck in the corners. My point: cut the ’empty’ tube, and you’re good for a couple more weeks. Packaging leaves product inside!
