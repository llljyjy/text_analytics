My very first Summer Fridays product and I’m pretty happy with it! It’s a lightweight serum which I love for my combo skin, it provides a nice layer of hydration without feeling heavy or sticky. It’s also fragrance free which is a big plus for my sensitive skin. This product was gifted by Summer Fridays for an honest review! nan
