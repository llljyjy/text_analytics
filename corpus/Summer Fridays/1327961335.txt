This serum is hydrating without feeling sticky or leaving a residue, it absorbs nicely and layers under my moisturizer.  My favorite time to apply it is at night and Iâ€™m a bit more liberal with it because I like the way it gives my skin a moisture boost and calms my face after removing makeup.  If you have dry skin, you may want to apply it in AM and PM, but if you have oily or sensitive skin like I do, I recommend PM to help restore moisture while you sleep.
