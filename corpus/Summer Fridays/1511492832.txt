This is currently in 2nd place for my top lip care products. In terms of hydration it is comparable to Fitglow Beauty’s Night Lip Serum (which is my HG). It is not as thick and doesn’t contain ceramides, however it does cost less. It feels nice and moisturizing on the lips, stays well, and once it wears off it doesn’t make your lips dry like other gloss-like products tend to do. I have very dry lips so I’m usually pretty picky when it comes to lip balms/gloss. The applicator is nice to use as well. I love the fact that it can be used as a night mask or clear gloss during the day. Will definitely be repurchasing this again. A great moisturizing lip balm!
