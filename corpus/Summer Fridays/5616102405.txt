LOVE love love this! Wish I tried it sooner when I saw it. I have both vanilla and vanilla beige. Vanilla I have repurchased two more to stock up but will not be getting vanilla beige again. Vanilla beige Is just too much for me, when I apply it and then put my lips together it smears above my top lip and looks like a kid applying lipstick haha. Iâ€™ll use it at night to finish it up. But vanilla, or both in general formula is great, scent is beautiful and its the perfect glossy look thats  not sticky. nan
