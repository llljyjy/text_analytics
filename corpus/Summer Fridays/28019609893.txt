The packaging is top notch like all of Summer Fridays other offerings. I love serums that come in pump and not droppers, so much more hygienic. This serum is pretty lightweight, absorbs well into the skin and provides great hydration for my combo mature skin, and it layers well with my moisturizers and foundation. Gifted by Summer Fridays nan
