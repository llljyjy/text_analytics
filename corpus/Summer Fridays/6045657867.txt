I was excited to try this, and they were offering a sample so I snapped it up. To my disappointment, it did not feel hydrating on my skin at all. It was slightly tacky and didn’t seem to sink into the skin properly. My skin is normal, but I can always appreciate a good hydrating face mask. But this isn’t it for me. I’m glad it was only a sample, and I didn’t pay for it. nan
