Absolutely love this eye cream! I have extremely sensitive skin, and am always hesitant to trying new products, but I am so glad I did! It had no strong fragrances, and is lightweight yet super hydrating. Another huge plus is it doesnâ€™t affect your foundation/concealer when applied on top. In fact, it actually made it look better! Love this product and highly recommend for sensitive skin! nan
