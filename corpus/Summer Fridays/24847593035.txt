This lip Butter was gifted by Summer Fridays I really like the way this lip butter smells. The vanilla scent is so nice and not over powering. I also love the way my lips feel after using this. If they are really chapped though, I do have to use this twice to get a good results. I usually use it as a lip mask at night and if my lips are still not 100% smooth I will use a little in the morning. The consistency of it reminds me of a thicker vaseline. Nice scent
