I have been using this face oil consistently in the AM for about 3 weeks now and I am in love! It leaves my face feeling so hydrated and soft and I look glowy and bright. I like to mix a drop or two in my moisturizer for application. I really love how it has a very unnoticeable scent. I’m only taking off one star because it’s a little pricey but honestly so worth it. 9/10 would def recommend amazing facial oil
