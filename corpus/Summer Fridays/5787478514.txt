I have dry sensitive skin that has been extra dry due to really cold weather! This serum has been my savior. The texture is similar to a light creamy gel that melts into skin effortlessly. I felt immediate hydration and it eased the tightness of the dry skin on my face. I also love that itâ€™s truly fragrance free and smells like absolute nothing! I have tried multiple hydrating serums but this one by far blew the others out of the water! The BEST hydrating serum out there!
