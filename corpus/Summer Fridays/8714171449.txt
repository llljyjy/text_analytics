I have the old packaging version and it’s made badly, so I’m glad they redesigned it. That said, the product still isn’t good because I’m constantly reapplying it because it dries out my lips. It’s more something you apply over another actually moisturizing lip product to lock it in. I will use this product until I’m done and then I won’t ever repurchase. I’m shocked because SF has so much hype around their stuff so this wasn’t a good first impression for me. just naur
