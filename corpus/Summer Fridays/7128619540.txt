WOW!! After using this for 2 days (twice a day) my Undereyes have looked so much smoother and more hydrated. Due to the cold weather my Undereyes have been feeling and looking dry making my concealer look crusty. This has helped so much. After examining the ingredients list I had to try this. What I look for it’s something that’s brightening (wo concealer) depuffing, smoothing and great to use before concealer… this fit that perfectly!! WoW!!!
