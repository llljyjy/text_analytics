If only I could give zero stars, cause that’s how I feel. Save your money or spend it on a different brands. Smells good, but does not moisturize. In fact, once the balm wears off , my lips are even more dry than when I applied it. I have been disappointed by this brand, lip products , face products, they just don’t live up to the hype. Doesn’t Work
