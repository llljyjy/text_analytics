Quickly becoming a staple in my everyday skincare. When I purchased this mask I thought it was just a standard hydration mask. No! Itâ€™s a 3 in 1: can be used as a mask, moisturizer, or overnight mask. I have dry skin and my skin LOVES this I would just make sure you have properly exfoliated your skin. not just a mask!
