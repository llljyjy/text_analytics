When Summer Friday gifted me their vanilla lip balm I was ecstatic! First, I was impressed by the cute packaging. Also, because I am absolutely obsessed with butter lip products and lotions. I have to tell you guys, this product did not disappoint me at all. Love how moisturized and soft my dry, cracked lips feel and look. I especially like wearing before bedtime because my lips get super dry. I think it’s because of the dry air from the heater. It also doesn’t hurt this awesome lip balm is vegan. Soft, moisturized lips
