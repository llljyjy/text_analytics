I was gifted by Summer Fridays this vanilla scented lip butter balm. Winter is always the worst for me when it comes to chapped and cracked lips. With this Summer Friday lip balm my lips feel so hydrated again! The vanilla scent is lovely and calming and not overwhelming in any way. The formula itself is quite hydrating and doesnâ€™t have that gross sticky texture you get with some brands. After a couple of uses, I can definitely see that my lips look a lot healthier. Satisfied and repeat customer! Great for the dry winter weather
