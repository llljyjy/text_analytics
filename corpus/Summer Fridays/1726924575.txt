I absolutely love this face oil! It’s nice and moisturizing without being heavy. A trick I’ve found is to apply to your lips! I have dry wrinkly lips and if I apply this and leave it on while I do the rest of my makeup, my lips go from looking bad to looking so smooth and wonderful. It works like magic! I don’t like the price, but, this will last me so long that it’s worth it. Magic on your lips!
