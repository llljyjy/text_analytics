I’m about to buy my 4th bottle! I’m always wary of 1 or 5 star reviews. They seem fake. But this product 100% deserves 5 stars for me. I absolutely love this serum it was the perfect amount of hydration in the morning all summer to keep away any dryness without feeling like my skin was suffocating in heat/humidity. 4th bottle
