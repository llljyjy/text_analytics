I’ve been using this as my nighttime moisturizer for over 3 years now and I honestly swear by it! It’s not oily on my skin and has never made me break out (not the old or new formula). I love that I can apply a thin or thicker layer depending on if I’m in a dry or humid climate and it keeps my skin adequately moisturized either way! It’s a holy grail find for sure. holy grail moisturizer
