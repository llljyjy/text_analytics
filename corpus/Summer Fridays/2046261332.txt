I received this Lip Butter Balm just in time because I was having cracked dry lips from the recent dry and hot weather. I used it once with thick layer at night, by next morning my lips were already less cracked. I used it two more times, morning and night, by the morning of third day, my lips were no longer dry or cracked, dry patches were completely gone. I was very happy with the result. It says vanilla but I didnâ€™t taste too much of it, which I like. Now I use it every night to keep my lips moisturized throughout the night and day. Highly recommended. Best lip balm
