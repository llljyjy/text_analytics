I have been super impressed with every Summer Fridays product I’ve tried so I was super excited to try this! I have such dry skin in the winter and this has really helped. I don’t have any dry patches now and my skin feels so hydrated and smooth. I do follow with more moisturizer just for the added hydration. It doesn’t feel heavy on the skin and soaks right in. I was gifted by Summer Fridays in exchange for my honest review. nan
