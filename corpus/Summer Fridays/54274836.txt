I received the Lip Butter Balm in Vanilla complimentary from Summer Fridays for review. I have dry lips even during the warmer months, so in the colder months I definitely need a lot of help. I was happy to try this balm since it falls under the “clean“ product category. The smell/flavor is great and the texture is pretty thick to provide a good amount of hydration. I didn’t have an issue with it being overly sticky and it definitely moisturized my lips! nan
