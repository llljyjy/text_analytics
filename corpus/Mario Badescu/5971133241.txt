There is nothing special about this product. I guess, of course, facial sprays in themselves don’t actually even do much. The spray it’s just refreshing for about 35 seconds until it kind of wears off, and honestly I feel like it makes my skin feel dry and tight and sticky after it dries. Affordable but wouldn’t recommend. There’s no purpose to it and I feel like it makes my skin worse than if I hadn’t sprayed it. Literally doesn’t add anything special.
