I am new into getting into skin care. I have always been a makeup addict but I’ve never been one to do enough with my skin. I liked this kit since it’s an easy to follow multi step kit. I have sensitive skin and so far it’s caused no issues to the skin. The only product I dislike in the kit is the eye cream. I have dry to combination skin and the eye cream is super oily and doesn’t sink into the skin. It just sits on top of it and gets into the eyes and moves into other areas of the face and I end up having to wash it off after a couple of hours. Or it’s all over my pillow nan
