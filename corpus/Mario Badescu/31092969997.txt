Honestly, this spray is fine--and that is the best way to describe it. There is nothing special about it. It does not smell particularly wonderful, and so much comes out in each spray that I feel like the bottle was half gone before I even got into a routine. It is very light and not greasy, but not particularly effective. It is cheap, so I guess you get what you pay for, but I would not buy it again. Okay Spray
