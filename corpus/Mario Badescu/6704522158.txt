This powder mask is awesome. Itâ€™s gentle, affordable, and very effective at reducing oiliness and the appearance of pores. As other reviewers have suggested, the best application method is to mix a bit of powder with a few drops of water and apply with a mask brush. Great product for oily, sensitive skin. nan
