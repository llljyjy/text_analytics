Ok i’ve loved this thing for years this is maybe my 3rd one and they last a lifetime. the product itself is thin but hydrating the flavor doesn’t get in your mouth if yk what i mean and everything about it is really good. The reason it gets 3 stars is the packaging. When i tell u this is impossible to open it is IMPOSSIBLE. It comes with so much product too so it rly is a shame but that lid is horrible. honest review
