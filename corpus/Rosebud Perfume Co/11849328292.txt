Wow, this wins the award for the beauty world’s worst packaging! Admittedly I made the mistake of ordering this in July in the US, so it arrived melted with grease all over the inside of the shipping box. The funniest part is that despite this, you would think the lid would come right open. Nope! It’s stuck to the point that I scratched up the entire tin trying to pry it with various items, without success. Sephora is too far away from me to bother returning a $7 item, but it really sucks to have to toss out a new product. Never touching anything from this brand again until they figure out a better container. container makes this impossible to actually use
