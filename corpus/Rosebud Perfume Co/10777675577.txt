I initially hated this packaging.  The tin was SO hard to open it took me like three minutes.  After the first few times opening it, it does get easier.  Next iffy factor is smell.  It has a scent of very very artificial strawberry (the body shop has a better scent btw).  Anyways, it was okay to me, but super strong.  I went to school and used it in Spanish class, and the second I opened it the boy that sat in front of me started coughing.  He was like “what is that??“ and was flipping out.  I asked him if the thing bothering him was strawberry, and it was pretty obvious that that was it.  It gave him a pretty bad headache apparently.  Mind you he sat about a yard away from me, so if you have sensitive smell don’t get this.  I also noticed myself hating the scent after a few days since it’s so strong. More important than the smell or tin is the product itself.  This product leaves your lips feeling greasy immediately after application.  If you use it over the span of a few days, they will progressively dry out.  It tastes awful and dries your lips, so I would not get this ever again.  I would only buy this as a part of a petty gift for someone where you just buy pretty garbage. GREAT if you want to gift it to your worst enemy!
