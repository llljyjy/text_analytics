I used to use the vaseline lip therapy containers and though those work very well, I didn’t love the fact that I had to use my finger to apply. Definitely wasn’t convenient when I was out. I decided to try this lip balm after hearing great things about the brand. I love it so so much! I get the hydration that vaseline provides, but in a tube and with a better scent. I’ve been using it for about a month now and have a lot of product left so it is long-lasting. For reference, I re-apply lip balm multiple times a day. Love it so much! A new Fav!!
