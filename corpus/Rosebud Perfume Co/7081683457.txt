I would have rated this balm five stars but unfortunately, the last tube I purchased smelled badly different. The new smell was not the menthol smell I like but more spearminty and sweet and unpleasant compared to how it was for years before that. Also, I feel like the formulation may have changed, or I got a bad tube. It seems now this balm is causing me to breakout around my lips, and it feels much more pore-clogging and Vaseline-like in texture.If my next tube is like this I will have to find a different product to use. Getting Worse?
