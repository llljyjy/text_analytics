I first tried their Rose & Mandarin lip balm and loved it so I wanted to try this one, but it made me so disappointed. The best way to describe the smell is like a kids chap stick or a bad artificial lollipop that expired 3 years ago. It’s also really thick and heavy which made it unpleasant to wear and I don’t think it helped my lip like their other lip balm. Plus for some reason the print started to flake off the tube really bad after only a day and got everywhere, I don’t know if it was just something wrong with my product but it gave using glitter and finding pieces of it even years later’ vibes. Loved their other lip balm :(
