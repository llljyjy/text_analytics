I love the balm...great scent and it keeps lips hydrated for a long time. However I will never buy this again because the container is ridiculously difficult to open. Maybe they aren’t all like this (I see mixed reviews), but I’ve broken nails trying to pry this thing open. I usually put lip balm on after I wash my face, which I definitely can’t do anymore because the lotions make my hands too slippy and I can’t grip the lid of the container very well. But, even when my hands aren’t slippy, I have to work pretty hard to open it...and then when I FINALLY get it open, I’m just so annoyed that I don’t want to use it out of principle. great balm, horrible container!!
