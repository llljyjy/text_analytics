Havenâ€™t been able to try the product due to the packaging design. Spent 30min trying to get into the tin as salve arrived melted to the sides of the lid. Definitely need to go back to the drawing board with packaging. Maybe a deeper tin that you could fully grab to open would help. Very sad to toss, but will stick with my Cloverine salve for now. nan
