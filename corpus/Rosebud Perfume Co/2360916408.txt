I swear by this salve!  It works on everything from chapped lips to small scratches and burns.  I  got my daughter hooked to it too.  The only downside is the tin is really hard to open at times.  So I took a small cosmetic jar that held face serum in the past, cleaned it out really well and transferred some of the salve into it.  Problem solved. Had to transfer it to  a small cosmetic jar.
