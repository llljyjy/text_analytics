I have been using this lip balm for a couple of years now. I have dry skin usually, especially on my lips. This is the best lip product I have used thus far. Itâ€™s very moisturizing and I appreciate that there are not many ingredients in it. It also looks very good when paired with a lip color on top. AMAZING!!
