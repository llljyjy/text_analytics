I love this product so much! It not only leaves my lips nice and glossy but it keeps them hydrated just like a lip mask would.  I also use this when I have a small scab on my face or my body and it goes away in 4 days.  I have repurchased it in the tube and in the original packaging.  If I could give it a 6, I would. Best. Thing. Ever.
