I got this is the starter pack. I wanted some color for my sister’s wedding since I am normally pale and I am wearing a light colored dress. This was my first attempt ever with self Tanner. I was amazing!!!! Nice and bronzed not orange. I also don’t need makeup or less makeup every day! It made my redness go away and I never broke out. Which I was nervous about. I will be using this all year long now ! Must have for self tanning
