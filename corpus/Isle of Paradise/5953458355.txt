Never going back to my tanning foam again!! This mist is truly the best that I’ve ever tried. It smells amazing, not like the typical foul fake tanner smell. The mister is super fine and it does a great job of evenly coating my skin with product. I wipe it in with my tanning mitt with no streaking. I have the light version because my skin is very pale and it gave me a nice healthy glow. Not orange and not fake looking. I will never use another brand of self tanning products again!
