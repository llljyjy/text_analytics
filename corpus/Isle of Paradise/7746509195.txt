Just another amazing product by Isle Of Paradise! I’ve tried quite a few of their products and I have to say this one does not disappoint! I love this product especially because of how it’s formulated to leave your skin so hydrated! It’s easy to apply with a simple spray and blends super easy, leaving my skin even and not sticky! A bonus is the smell, it smells super refreshing and certainly not like the traditional self tanner smell. This brand is always coming out with outstanding products and this is now another favorite of mine that I’m adding to my tanning routine! Thanks Isle Of Paradise for always being vegan and cruelty free! THIS FORMULA
