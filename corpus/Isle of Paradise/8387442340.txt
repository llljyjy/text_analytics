I really tried to like this stuff but I just can’t. It’s sticky after you apply it, it smells like burnt coffee, and it fades patchy. It also doesn’t last very long. I have used a lot of these products in the past and have never had something fade as patchy as this it looks horrible after two days. It’s a really easy way to apply it but isn’t up to par with a traditional mousse. nan
