The first time I used this product I went a little overboard and used like 8 drops on my face, and at the end of the day I looked a bit orange. Now, I just add 2 drops to my moisturizer and a few more drops when applying all over my body. I am super happy with the results. Next time I’m getting the blending brush because using my hands can leave marks if I don’t wash/scrub right away—eek! Less is more!
