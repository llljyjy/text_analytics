Sadly, I did not like this compared to other self tanners! I had to add a lot of drops to each handful of lotion to see even a marginal difference, meaning the bottle doesn’t go very far. And the extra step of having to mix it with lotion was time consuming. The only upside is that the smell isn’t quite as strong as other tanners. Go very Disappointed :(
