Yes I’m pale as a sheet of paper but I’ve used ’dark“ tanners previously and wanted to be darker so I got this.  1. You can’t double apply or correct anything once it’s somewhat dried,  it just streaks up and removes what you just put down. 2. I waited 6 hrs just incase and my body isn’t tan at all,  it just changed my skins undertone to yellow. And 3. the tanner is stuck in my pores on my legs (u can see in the picture) so it tanned inside my pores but not my skin??? Def not "ultra dark" more like light
