It has been my experience with multiple formulas that if you don’t spend a decent amount of time massaging this product in in every section you will have a splotchy result. I only use this on my legs and stop at my underwear line. I’m carefully to not really put it much on my toes at all and just use the minimal amount on my feet. It’s also my experience that I don’t achieve my full color results for 12 hours, as opposed to the 6 they taut in the description. Definitely give it time to dry down some after applying so you don’t smear your results as well. Be sure to thoroughly rub it in!
