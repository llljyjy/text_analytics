Great product, leaving a natural glow. I read through the reviews for application tips before using. I apply in the evening before bed after all serums and a light layer of face cream. Then I use 2-3 drops in a penny size of face cream and go over my whole face and neck. Iâ€™ve found that doing it this way leaves a more natural look and allows for the product to be dispersed more evenly. nan
