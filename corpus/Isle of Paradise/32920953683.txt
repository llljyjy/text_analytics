I purchased Sephora’s Sun Safety kit that had a variety of sunblocks to try and also had a trial bottle of this. I was skeptical but this actually works! Possibly too well. I often wear a fitbit watch so I have this very noticable pale spot on my wrist. In the morning, I used a single drop of this self-tanner and spread it over the pale area. By that night, my wrist was obviously more tan. Unfortunately, I wasn’t precise where I put it so you can see some of my natural tan actually got darker too so there’s an overlap (see pic). So it works...but you gotta be careful if you’re trying to cover a specific target area. Works...but only apply where you want it
