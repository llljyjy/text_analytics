East enough to apply but make sure to get the right shade for your natural tone. Iâ€™m extremely pale with very yellow undertones and have been tanning using the st tropez express tan for years, but decided it was time to try something other than a mousse as I hate the consistency and the transfer is awful. This has zero transfer, the initial smell is nice when applying but does turn quite biscuity the day after. Everything was good aside from the fact that I left it on for about 6 hours, went to bed looking decent after showering, and woke up a dark orange. Will be exchanging for the medium shade. nan
