This is my favorite tanning product I’ve tried already. I love everything from isle of paradise I’ve tried especially the drops but this is even easier because you just mist it on and blend it in. It doesn’t have that nasty self tanner smell either and hasn’t stained my sheets or anything. New fav for a subtle non orange tan New fav
