So I usually use regular self tanner. And it works great. But I’m a mom and with a toddler it gets hard to keep up because I’m tired and not in the mood to full on sleep in sticky tanner all night after a long day lol. So this stuff was easy, just added it to moisturizer. It did leave a nice glow. But I’d say only you will notice. Others might notice a glow but I doubt anyone will notice it as a tan. So if you want your face to match your body, def try this. But if you want an actual tan try something else. Great for a glow, but not a real tan
