I am not the tan type...I am so pale I glow in the dark. I was a little nervous about trying this self tanner, but I am glad I did. I sprayed it directly on my legs first, as a trial run, and the color developed pretty quickly. It does not have the terrible smell other self tanners do, which is a plus. My legs were so gorgeous and glowy that I used it on my arms. I have white furniture and I was scared it would transfer, but it didn’t. I’ve been receiving compliments all day! I also love that this brand is cruelty-free! nan
