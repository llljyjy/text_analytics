I wasn’t very confident about this product. I always use self tanners but drops looked untrusting ))I mixed it with my body butter to apply on legs. It worked pretty well, no strokes. Looks pretty much natural, no orange hues. And also applied it with my moisturizer for face. I love it better on face :) I think I will continue using it on face, not body.
