This is my second bottle and honestly, it’s the easiest self-tanner I have ever tried. You just mix a couple of drops with your facial cream and that’s it. I prefer to use it at night so that the next morning I wake up with a glowing naturallylooking tan. It usuallylasts on me for a week or so and you literally need 1-2 drops, so this bottle is definitely worth every penny.I received this product complimentary from Isle of Paradise. nan
