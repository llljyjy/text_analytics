One of my favourite brand to get tan which literally lasted for a week.Yes its very easy to use and give a natural looking tan and within few minutes  i got tan on entire body. It gives hydrations to my skin too so drying skin is not a problem with this. Plus thing it’s smell is not weird. I like it has color correcting formula and Its doesn’t irritate my skin. I like how my skin glows after applying it. This is totally vegan product. nan
