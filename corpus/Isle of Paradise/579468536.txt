Nope, this ain’t it. It does smell nice, but it’s impossible to get even application. Even with exfoliation prep and a good tanning glove - the one I use to apply other brands flawlessly - I can’t keep this one from being patchy and drippy. Even when I know I’ve gotten coverage everywhere, the parts that overlap end up darker. And you can’t tell where it’s overlapping since it’s clear. It doesn’t blend whatsoever. wanted to love it
