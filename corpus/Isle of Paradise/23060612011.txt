it’s good for the face! it doesn’t make me breakout, it feels nice on the skin, smell isn’t super strong, not overly orange on me so long as I don’t use much! wouldn’t recommend it for all over the body, it’s pretty unpredictable and hard to get even when applied everywhere. while I love that you can mix it with your fav lotion, I do wish that they gave you more guidance on that because I’ve found some lotions work a lot better than others (if they could recommend a specific kind of lotion I’d love to see it). It's good for a glow
