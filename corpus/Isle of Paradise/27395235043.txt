These Isle of Paradise tanning drops are my FAVORITE! I’ve tried other brands before and they either don’t work at all or give me a fake, orange color. This is where IoP is different! These drops give me the mostly beautiful and natural tan. I use them on my face, arms and legs with moisturizer or body lotion. This product is so easy to use and mess-free, just remember to wash your hands well afterwards! *Complimentary from Isle of Paradise.* Love!
