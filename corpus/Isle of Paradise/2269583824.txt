I use shade medium and it is the perfect shade for my fair olive toned skin—it’s not orange at all but rather it gives me a warm healthy glow! I apply this product to clean skin with a fluffy highlighter brush and contour my cheeks, jawline, nose, lips, and forehead. The next day, my skin has a beautiful natural glow to it as well as a more defined and sculpted look. I love how this product makes me feel put together when I’m not wearing any makeup. Even though this product was gifted by Isle of Paradise, I have been using their products for years and will continue to do so because the quality speaks for itself. Adds a Beautiful Natural Glow
