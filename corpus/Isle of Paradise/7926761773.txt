love this self tan, I usually use Bondi Sands as a base tan and throughout the week when I need a touch up this is a perfect product! I usually don’t go for self tans with no guide color but this never turns out too bad… color payoff is nice lasts pretty well and doesn’t give your skin that dry cracked look when it begins to fade! nan
