Overall I really like this formula and if you like the face drops, youâ€™ll like this product. It has a bi-phase oil consistency that absorbs in nicely and does not leave the skin feeling greasy. It can be a bit splotchy if you do not take your time with application so I recommend applying a barrier cream (aka rich body cream) on your knees, elbows, underarms, and any other areas prone to dryness, them working in sections and rubbing in thoroughly. My skin tone is Light/Neutral and the Medium shade gives a noticeable amount of color while still being natural. No orange finish! Although I always apply with a tanning mat or gloves I feel like this one would be fine w/o (as long as you wash your hands quickly). Glow Goodness!
