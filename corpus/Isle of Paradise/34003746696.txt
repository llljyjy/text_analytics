Not overly impressed with this product. I’ve used the entire bottle (exactly as directed) over several self tan sessions and don’t notice any difference. The only positives I can give is it doesn’t smell like your typical self tanner and actually has a pleasant smell and it didn’t stain my clothing or bedding like some self tanners do. I can’t see myself buying this again. Didn’t work but smells great
