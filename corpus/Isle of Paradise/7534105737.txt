I tried this when it first launched a year ago and this is still my favorite product! I’ve learned the key is to really moisturize your skin well with it when applying- make sure you’re not just using a minimal amount and spreading it out. Some reviews say it left them patchy, but I’ve never had that happen. It’s a lotion, so I find it easy to apply. My tan looks so glowly and sun kissed! I also have the drops in green and will sometimes add some drops to this lotion when applying and I get the richest looking tan ever! It doesn’t fade weird either! Must have product!!!!!! I Need This In A Supersize! FABULOUS
