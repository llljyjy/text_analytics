the color develops nicely and smoothly however there is an orange hue to the skin for sure. it did leave me glowy and soft. i noticed that after a week or so the product was actually scraping off my skin. i could scratch it off with my fingernails and it left lines and weird residue wonâ€™t. be buying again. meh
