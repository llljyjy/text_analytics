This is my first time trying self tanning mist and I loved it! The product is surprisingly hydrating, my skin felt super soft and silky afterwards. I tried it in one leg (see photo) and I was shocked to see the beautiful glowy look it gave me. It looks like a natural tan and I’m obsessed. Super easy to apply, just spray blend and let it dry. No sticky feeling at all, and I didn’t notice any uneven tan either. It also has no smell at all, which is something I really liked, compared to other tanning products I’ve tried. Incredible product and brand, super important that they’re also vegan/cruelty-free. I loved it!
