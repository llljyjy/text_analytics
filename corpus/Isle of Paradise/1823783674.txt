This does not apply well compared to other tanning creams I’ve tried. The shimmery gold in it bunches up and pills and later flakes right off the skin, and I think that contributed to the patchiness of the tan later. No matter how careful I was or what I tried I always had weird streaks and patches. It was less of a subtle tan on me as well and darker than I thought. I definitely wouldn’t buy again but still down to try other Isle of Paradise. nan
