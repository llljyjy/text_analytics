i’ve always loved self tanner but don’t love all the stickiness, the daunting orange color, and the smell. i decided to give isle of paradise a try and couldn’t be happier. the tan looks SO natural and is so easy to put on. the product is white so there isn’t any super intimidating orange color going everywhere. very subtle smell too which is a huge plus! So easy to use!
