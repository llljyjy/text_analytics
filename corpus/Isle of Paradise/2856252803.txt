Application is key. I use a continuous sprayer and mit to blend it out after spraying in each area. I also use a makeup brush on my hands and feet to blend it out better so it doesn’t leave any blotches or noticeable fake tan streaks. Love the formula so much! It smells great and dries quick and don’t transfer - the best part. my ride or die
