Totally loving these tanning-drops!! Its super easy to use by just mixing the drops into my daily moisturizer. love that I can customize the intensity of the color as well. This is my go for when I go on a trip or if I’m poolside because it has great wear and I don’t have to put on any makeup with this! The smell is lightweight and not overbearing and the color develops very nicely and fades very evenly as well! I received this product complimentary from Isle of Paradise in exchange for my honest review. Love these drops!
