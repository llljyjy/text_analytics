I’ve purchased this many times!  It is the only self tanner that DOES NOT STAIN clothes and doesn’t get all over my sheets!!  It’s a perfect glow.  Make sure to put lotion on dry areas of body.  I use with the mister bottle (gamer changer) and blend out with my hands.  Super fast and low maintenance and everyone comments on how glowy I look - it also lasts almost a full week for me! (I’ve also never noticed white things in the refill which a lot of comments were saying). Best Self Tanner I've Tried!
