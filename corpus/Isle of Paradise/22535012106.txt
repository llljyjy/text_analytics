I’m super pale and get a medium and just use one drop with my night moisturizer so I don’t have to use as many drops if I bought the fair one. But it smells good and gives yourself a nice even glow the next day without causing any break outs. Does not leave stains on sheets or anything, but would recommend washing hands after using it, as it will tan your hands if doesn’t get washed off. Amazing easy low maintenance face tanner
