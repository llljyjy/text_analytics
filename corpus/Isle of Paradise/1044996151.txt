This is my favorite tanning product. I love that you can adjust the intensity with the number of drops you add to your lotion. It’s easy to use, a nice neutral color, and in my experience, doesn’t streak as long as you rub it in well. I’ve repurchased a few times and will continue to. Cool product, nice tan
