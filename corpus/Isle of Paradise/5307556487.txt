BEST self tanner I have ever tried for the face. I add 8-10 drops into a bit of my face moisturizer (about the size of a quarter) and apply. The most beautiful, natural, and deep bronzed glow ever. I only use the purple dark one. Lasts about 5-6 days. I used to put regular self tanner on my face but noticed it never looked good and figured it can’t be good for the face long term, so I tried this and have been using it for over a year. I am a self tanner die hard and have been using self tanner for over 15 years so I know my stuff. I won’t use anything else. Hands down the best ever! You won’t be disappointed. BEST SELF TANNER EVER!!!
