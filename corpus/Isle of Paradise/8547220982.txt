I was gifted this product by isle of paradise for free. I was so surprised at how well this worked and how natural the tone was. It’s super easy to blend, so it’s good for a beginner (like myself). Overall, I really enjoyed the consistency, it was super buttery. It’s such a nice product to have for summer to give you that tan look without being out in the sun. It has color correcting tones in it too, which I thought was really cool. The formula is very hydrating and I really enjoyed how quick the process was. Natural + easy to blend
