I was extremely disappointed with this product. I wanted something that was less maintenance than a self tanner, so I opted for a gradual tanning lotion. But itâ€™s streaky, orange, and has glitter. I did everything I was supposed to. I shaved, exfoliated, vigorously blended. Horrible! Do not recommend!!! nan
