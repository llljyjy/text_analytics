I typically love Isle of Paradise products, and Iâ€™ve tried a few different ones so I was excited to use this gradual self-tanning butter. The initial smell is very light, unlike other tanners that have that immediate smell. It leaves a very subtle glitter on the skin, and the color pay off is definitely noticeable. It was easy to apply, but I think that I need to be more careful about my application to prevent streaks, just like any self tanning product. I would definitely recommend this to those looking to start getting a natural glow, maybe even diluting the product with another moisturizer to work up to full strength. nan
