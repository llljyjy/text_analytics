I was gifted by Isle of Paradise there Self Tanning Drops. I’d like to mention I’ve NEVER used self tanning drops. Maybe a handful of times I’ve dine pre mix lotions which never worked on me I’d turn more orange or it would be splotchy. I used about 3 drops per section and made sure everything was fully covered. I appreciate it doesn’t have a heavy chemical smell and so far I haven’t had any skin irritation. So my overall goal was to get my upper half to close tone as my arms. And within 1hr I started seeing my chest and shoulder starting to darken and warm up to my arms tone. I’m very glad to have the opportunity to try the self tanner: I will say I just wished they had better instructions or maybe had videos suggested for application. Because saying from 1-12 drops is not helpful for a novice. Took me a week of researching before I felt comfortable to actually apply the drops. Easy Glowing bronze
