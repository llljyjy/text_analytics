I really like how easy this is to apply. I stood in my shower and just sprayed it all over my arms, then used a tanning mitt to make sure it was covering evenly. The smell is really nice. It makes me feel like I’m laying on a beach on vacation with a fruity smoothie. My skin wasn’t sticky at all and actually had a bit of moisture to it after using the most. My first application the tan was light which I am a fan of because I’m able to go back and spray again to build the tan! Easy to use and good color
