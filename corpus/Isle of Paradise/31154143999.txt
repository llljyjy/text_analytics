I was gifted by Isle of paradise. For someone as fair as me, this is a very innovative product. I have always had to be careful with self tanners because they come out uneven on my light skin. This is so easy to use. I love the option for light, medium, dark where I can pick what it best for me. Overall, I enjoy the gradual build of color and how easy it is to use with my moisturizer. nan
