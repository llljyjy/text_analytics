I impulsively bought this and I’m so glad I did. I used it last night and woke up today with a lovely color. Minimal to no streaks. I think that’s because I rubbed it in for a long time. Showered and exfoliated before. I washed my hands right after but they still got stained some. Overall I like it. I’ll definitely use it consistently. I bought the tanning drops too and tried those out tonight on my face. I’m excited to see results tomorrow. Impulse purchase!
