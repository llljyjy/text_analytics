This is a fantastic self-tanning product! It is so incredibly easy to use and I love that it doesn’t leave streaks. It also isn’t super messy and isn’t sticky at all. I like that it doesn’t smell like a typical self-tanner so you skin doesn’t have that smell for days afterward. My skin feels super soft, hydrated, and looks glowy. It gives a nice tan to the skin and is definitely going to be my go-to self-tanner! Very nice!
