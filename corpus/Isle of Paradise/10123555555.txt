Obsessed with this because it goes on like an oil. I love the way it feels and for some reason it makes me feel like I have a more even distribution of the product. It creates a beautiful glow and a nice tan shade that isn’t orangey. I applied this with my hands after doing a full exfoliation of the skin. I really like that it’s a mist and the bottle is surprisingly big. I just stood in my shower to keep from making a mess in my bathroom. It also smells nice upon application but does have a hint of sunless tanner smell as it develops. I didn’t notice any transfer either. Gives a beautiful tan.
