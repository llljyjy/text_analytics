I have tried SOO many self tanners- foam, spray, lotions and they all have the worst stick feeling or they don’t last more than 2-3 days. This one goes on so smooth its a very light oil, not greasy with residue and it doesn’t transfer AND lasts for so long, with the most natural nice color! The added bonus is that this is moisturizing since its an oil/ spray. AMAZING AMZAZING AMAZING
