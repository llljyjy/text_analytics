I love how even a glow this product gives me! Didn’t use a mitt at all, just massaged this oil in with my body cream and let it sit until touch-dry. No transfer on my cream sleep shirt. No weird self-tanner smell either. The glow I get is just a subtle warmth, no orange vibes at all. The perfect transition shade from winter to spring if you’re on the paler side. Plus the oils help keep my skin soft and subtle. Love how this self-tanner range is body care and tanner in one! Hydrating and glowing!
