After using this on and off for a month and Iâ€™m not a big fan of this product. Most of the time it looked really muddy on my face and it would look different depending on the moisturizer I mixed it with (not a criticism, just a warning). I think there are better products out there, I just felt like my skin always looked worse when I used this, but it might work for other people! nan
