These drops are amazing! Just 2 drops mixed with your moisturizer results in a beautiful glow just hours later! Thus far I have only used on my face, but they can be used on the body as well. Since I use exfoliating products, it does seem to “wash“ off, but that isn’t surprising. I personally, was not looking for something that would dye my skin. It seems very gentle. I have had no issues with my skin since using. You can sense that “sunless tanner smell,“ but it is not over the top like other sunless products. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!
