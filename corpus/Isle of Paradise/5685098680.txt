I’ve been using the product for a few years, and the quality of the pump seems to have gone downhill. I just bought a new bottle and the pump clogged on the first application, leaving a messy liquid that doesn’t apply well at all. I would say AT LEAST half of the bottles I’ve bought have had their pumps break, but it would least be towards the end. The color is fine, and the smell can be overwhelming until your first shower, but I won’t be buying this again due to the pump issue. Pump clogged on first application, useless
