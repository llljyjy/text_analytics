This has easily become a staple in my self-tanning routine. It’s THAT good!! You don’t have to worry about that horrible self-tanning odor most products tend to have.  Mixing this with moisturizer adds the perfect glow to your skin. The color payoff is phenomenal. I never have to be pale again!! Gifted by Isle of Paradise. LOVE!!
