I have medium brown skin and my body is always darker than my face so I use these drops to even out my complexion, and its goood!! I mix this with a really moisturizing lotion and max 2 drops and apply evenly throughout my neck and face. It has an off scent of coconut, and I personally hate the smell of coconut but the smell is bareable so you dont need to worry about that. It never gets “blotchy“ and “Streaky“ its even and makes my skin look warmer. I feel like the reason people are having issues with this product being “blotchy“ or uneven is because they’re getting the drops that are too dark for their skin. If you have light skin, go for the medium drops, not the dark drops. These drops don’t change the color of my skin by a whole lot (depending on # of drops) so the fade away is very subtle. If you are lighter and you use the darker drops, obviously your tan will look more harsher and be more noticeable, so keep that in mind. But for my brown girls, this is definetly good if you wanna even out that skin complexion. FOR MY BROWN GIRLS
