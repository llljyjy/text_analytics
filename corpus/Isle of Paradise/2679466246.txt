I was pleasantly surprised with the look this tan gave and the ease of application. I’m extremely fair skinned and normally use loving tan ultra dark mouse. This didn’t make me quite as dark but gave a more natural tan. I didn’t have any streaks after putting this on my whole body, except my hands were a nightmare. I’m a seasoned fake tanner.. but putting a clear tan on your hands is a new beast. Also, my palms were orange even though I washed them after use. Some other complaints are that the product never dried down so I stayed sticky all night and when spraying it on it can get quite messy. I’d recommend doing it in the shower with a towel down so you don’t get orange soles! Overall, I would use it again but I don’t think I would repurchase. good but not great
