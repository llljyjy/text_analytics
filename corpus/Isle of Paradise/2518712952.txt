This product develops into a perfect color every time. The application is so easy, I use a mitt to apply all over my legs, chest, and arms. Itâ€™s super easy to use and a beautiful oil mist. I do not sun tan as melanoma runs in my family so this is a perfect safe option for me. I am also sensitive to smell and this product has barely any scent at all. I am so pale but I love being able to feel confident in my own skin and the color this gives me really makes me feel better about myself. nan
