Love/hate. Love the way it tans and even clears and evens my skin tone. Bigggg downside is if you have gel nails it will turn them orange/brown. I even made sure not to let it touch the nails but I guess washing your hands afterwards will get the oil on your nails. Super annoying downside of this product otherwise I loved it. Gel nails
