Love this product! Added it to my moisturizer and it was not streaky at all! It didnâ€™t transfer onto my bedding at all. I added 3 drops to about  1 1/2 pumps of moisturizer and there was a noticeable difference about 6 hours later. It does have a scent but that washed off after about two washes nan
