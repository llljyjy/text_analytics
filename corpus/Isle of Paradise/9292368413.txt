This is my new go-to gradual self tanner! I absolutely love the smell- it has  a cucumber melon scent, which is great because it doesn’t smell like your average self tanner. The color forms gradually and leaves a nice bronzed look. I use it right after the shower and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and tan! It’s also great to use a couple times a week after you have already self tanner- to keep that nice glow. It doesn’t transfer either which is a win win in my book! The perfect gradual tanner!
