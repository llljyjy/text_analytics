Unfortunately u cannot recommend this product. My first bottle was great. Im quite fair and this worked well. Not streaky if applied properly. Gave me a good tan if i left on for 4-6 hrs (needed longer on my legs). Second bottle - pump not working. Product sprayed out all over the place as liquid and not foam. Made a huge mess. Totally unusable. Since this was a backup i just brought out i am outside the Sephora return window. I have contacted the company and am waiting to hear back. So disappointed. Product is worthless if the packaging will not dispense it properly. Faulty packaging
