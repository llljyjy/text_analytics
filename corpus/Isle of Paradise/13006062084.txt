It’s a no from me. This self-tanning butter left me streaky and patchy. It’s such a shame! The application was nice- the cream is not sticky and it’s nicely scented like cucumbers. I expected a more subtle glow with one use of this tanner but the color was far more drastic that I expected or wanted. nan
