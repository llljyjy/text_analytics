I’ll start by saying Isle of Paradise is my favorite self tan company. I have tried the tanning water mist in the past and thought it gave my an uneven tan. It was so easy to apply but difficult to blend. But since I love the mist application, I thought I’d give this formula a try, and I’m so glad I did! As with the first, the mist is so quick and easy to apply, which I love. The oil mist version gives it a bit more slip, so I feel like I can really blend the tan with a mitt or even my hand. I’ve used this quite a few times and I’ve gotten a natural looking even tan. Highly recommend the brand, and this is my new favorite formula—super easy and great results! nan
