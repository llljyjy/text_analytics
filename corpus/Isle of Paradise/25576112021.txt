This product has a bit of a learning curve since it is clear so it can be difficult to remember where you’ve applied it. But, after a couple of tries, it’s become the quickest and most hydrating way to get a nice tan. It only takes me about 15 minutes to apply, and about 5-6 hours to develop, and it doesn’t have the bad self-tanner smell most products have. Favorite Self Tanner
