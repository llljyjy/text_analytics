Got this in “Dark-Bronzed Glow“ (purple bottle) because its the best value as you can add more drops for a darker finish or less for a lighter.  There is a little bit of a smell as it is processing but nothing like other tanners.  NO ORANGE colour, the tan was really natural looking.  I love that you can control the finished shade and use your own lotion to mix with it.  A little goes a long way so a bottle is great value.  I also love that the formula is more on the natural side .  My advise is to build up your colour gradually.  I used every night for 3 nights until I got to a shade I liked, then just used twice a week to maintain it.  A few drops is all you need.  You can also use it on your face.  EXFOLIATE FIRST for the best finish. LOVE THIS! Natural finish (NO ORANGE)
