I was told by staff this would be washable at end of each day. i tried it out for 3-4 days with less to half the recommended drops to ease into it. in those few days i had an unnatural colored tan with small swatches  attaching color around my eyebrows. i mixed it with my moisturizer on my hand and have an obvious tanned splotch which after a week since using it last is only ‘just’ starting to fade. all in all, not washable and have quite a yellow-ish fake tan affect on my skin. i’ll be returning nan
