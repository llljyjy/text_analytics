Really easy application, and the bottle is really pretty to display. It actually has a nice scent to it compared to some tanners that just have that awful chemical smell. I feel so glowy, hydrated and ready to hit the pool just in time for the warmer weather. It gives me a light natural looking tan, looks like I took a vacation for a week and came back. Glowy and showy!
