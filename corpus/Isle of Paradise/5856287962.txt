I really wanted to love this but after multiple tries, I’m really disappointed. I’m newer to self-tanning but even after watching countless application videos (including ones from the brand) and using a mitt and blending brush, I can’t seem to get this product to apply well. As others have said, it sinks into drier areas even with proper prep. The product gets all over your hands when spraying, making the bottle impossible to hold on to. The bottle also doesn’t spray upside down so my legs are always lighter than my arms/upper body. My hands either come out covered in orange stains or the product cuts off at my wrists. I’ve gotten way better results from drugstore brands. This was a waste of money. nan
