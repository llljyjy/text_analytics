great ! I have tried the isle or paradise tanning water and drops and I think that this might be my favorite yet. The lotion is easy to apply, blends seamlessly and is incredibly hydrating for the skin ! I do miss being able to control the intensity of the tan, like with the drops, but find that the medium glow is really stunning after about two uses. nan
