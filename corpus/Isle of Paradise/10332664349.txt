I received this as a gift from Sephora. I’m not going to lie, I was not a huge fan. I’m not a big fan of self tanners because of the way they smell and can get splotchy. This was no exception. It smells good (better than most) when you first put it on, but as it settles into the skin it starts to have that burnt smell. Not my favorite, but tans well
