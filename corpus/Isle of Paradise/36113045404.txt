I’m not super impressed with this. You have to make sure your face has been properly exfoliated and moisturized before using these drops otherwise they’ll cling to your dry spots and look soooo bad. They look glowy and natural everywhere except my nose and around my eyebrows bc they get so orange and dark around there. I put it all around my mouth too and there’s still a white circle around my mouth where the tan didn’t absorb. Not super happy with these especially since they’re not cheap not my favorite
