I got through 75% of my body before my lotion started pilling. I guess my lotion and my drops didn’t interact well so it just started clumping. I’m so disappointed since I used 25% of my bottle to do so. The actual product will streak if you aren’t careful enough, since it’s clear it can get kind of hard to see. The product does smell like fake tanner but it isn’t an overpowering smell. The product is OK but I wish I knew that certain lotions don’t mix well BE CAREFUL OF WHAT LOTION YOU USE!
