I have really pale skin and self tanning lotions or sprays have never looked good on me. Needless to say I didn’t have very high hopes for these drops, but I am surprised to say I was proved wrong! These are a great choice for someone who has trouble getting an even look that doesn’t look too orangey. Even though the bottle isn’t very big it lasts quite a while. I found going conservative keeps you looking much more natural and gives the sun kissed look without an unnatural orangey appearance. If you use too much you may end up with the dreaded orange look. It’s really easy to apply-just add a few drops to your normal body lotion or facial lotion and mix it up and apply like usual. For an even look I’d highly suggest to exfoliate properly beforehand, but even if you don’t it applies pretty well and looks good when it’s absorbed. The only downside to this product is that the tan doesn’t seem to last a long time. It’s there for about 3 days or so and then it’s time to reapply. But because it’s so easy to apply it’s not too much of a hindrance. I also did have a slight amount of acne that popped up after use-although it may have just been my face reacting to a new product and it has since subsided just fine. Overall I’m happy with the product and will continue using it and will repurchase it. Easy to use
