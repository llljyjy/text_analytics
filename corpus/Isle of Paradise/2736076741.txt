I was gifted by use of paradise  this item in exchange for my honest review. I’ve used tanning products on my legs in the past. Since my face is the first place I usually get a ton I use tanning products on other parts of my body. I followed the instructions and added six drops to my body Lotion. They mixed well together and then I applied to my legs. You couldn’t see the tan right away. I have a medium deep skin tone. So I use tanning products to give My skin a uniform glow/ bronzed look if that makes sense. And this product did just that. I would recommend getting it close to under your feet as it makes your heels & soles brownish also. I would recommend this product Wonderful sun kisses glow
