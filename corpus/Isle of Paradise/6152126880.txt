I have medium skin so I got that shade dark and this gave me a natural tan (I added before and after photos). I like how this was quick and easy to apply and was not streaky. This made me skin feeling nice and hydrated. I appreciate that this doesnâ€™t have a traditional self-tanner smell and is vegan & cruelty-free. Love this self-tanning oil! Natural looking tan!
