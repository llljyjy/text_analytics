I was super excited to find this kit at Sephora because I’ve been wanting to try out a few Isle of Paradise products for the summer, but when I opened the box, the Self-Tanning Water had slimy, white streaks floating around in the bottle. I tried it anyway, and was really disappointed when I woke up to a really unnatural, deep orange tan (I naturally have yellow/olive light-medium skin). I also tried the Self Tanning Glow Drops on my face, but got same result. 2/5 stars only because I liked the smell. Will be returning. Faulty product…
