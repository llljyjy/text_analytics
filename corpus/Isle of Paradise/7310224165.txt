I love this gradual self tanner! It is so easy to apply, going on so evenly. It is also super hydrating, giving you color and a gorgeous glow! It doesnâ€™t have a harsh smell, like a lot of other self tanners do! After about 3 uses you will notice a difference in your color. Perfect for this time of year! Love!
