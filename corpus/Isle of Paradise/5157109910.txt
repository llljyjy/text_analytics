I was looking for an easy way to get a natural glow and this is it! It’s pretty foolproof and doesn’t have a strange odor like a lot of tanners. It goes on so nicely and builds up to a gorgeous natural finish. It’s like coming back from a beach vacation all the time. It’s also so moisturizing that my skin is always looking it’s best now. Gorgeous and Easy!
