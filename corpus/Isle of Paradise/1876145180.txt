Everyone saying this goes on patchy, I would hike up to user error. This product goes on evenly and nicely given that the person knows how to mix it into moisturizer and they use the proper amount. Usually 3-5 drops works well. I had to stop using this, however, because whatever ingredient in it that tans me actually breaks me out. I don’t have sensitive skin, but I do think my skin hates whatever ingredient has the tanning properties because it isn’t just this one. I’ve tried the Tan Luxe, St. Tropez tanning drops, and they all break me out... probably because they all use that same ingredient. Unfortunately had to give to someone whose skin can handle this. But wasn’t for me. Really hoping it was though. I think I’ve given up on finding tanning drops that don’t break me out. Applies wonderfully, but ultimately broke me out
