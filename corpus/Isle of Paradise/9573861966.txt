As a very light skinned girl who burns easily, I don’t get a tan very easily. I have tried a few tanners in the past but I couldn’t stand the smell. This does have a scent but it’s not too bad especially compared to what I’ve used before. The color definitely works, but it’s kind of annoying how it varies by the lotion to drops ratio because it’s hard to get it the same multiple times. It also seems to fade pretty quick and to me it’s not worth it. I’m a busy mom and don’t have time to do a tanning process twice a week. I would expect it to last longer. I was gifted by isle of paradise for my honest review. Needs to last longer
