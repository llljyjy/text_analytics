This tanning mist was so hydrating! Most I’ve tried have left my skin feeling sticky or would automatically rinse off. This one was so easy to apply just as the mist and doesn’t have that tanning after smell either. Would definitely recommend this! I got it in medium but you could choose light or dark too! Definitely recommend! Not sticky!
