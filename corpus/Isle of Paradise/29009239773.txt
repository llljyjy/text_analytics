The best quality about this product is that I’ve experience minimal transfer onto clothing and the application is wayyyyy quicker than mousse or lotion self tanners. However, in order to get a noticeable tan you either have to really saturate your skin (which kinda wastes the product) or go a shade darker than normal, which is what I’m gonna do for my next purchase. Unlike other tanners I’ve used, this one doesn’t look like a “stain” if that makes sense. It seems to evenly apply and develop more naturally than the mousse products I’ve used. Mind you, the only other tanners I’ve used are jergens and Hawaiian tropic, both of which are way cheaper, and this product is a mist, so there very well could be other most products with better results. Especially since this mist has possibly the worst application on hands feet that I’ve ever experienced lol. I’ve learnt to just use a gradual tanning lotion for hands/feet for a better application. Overall, it’s a decent product and fades gracefully relative to cheaper products. A little pricy for the quantity you get (it has lasted me about a month and a half only applying 1-2 x a week), and the bottle is the dumbest shape ever and you can’t set it down properly when applying it due to the rounded shape. But it’s super convenient to use and it looks really even/natural, so for that I’d say it’s worth it. Just maybe consider going a shade darker. nan
