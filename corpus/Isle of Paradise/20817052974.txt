I purchased these tanning drops in hopes of darkening myself for the winter, and it did exactly that! I would recommended using 2-3 drops with cera-ve moisturizer at night before you go to bed. I wash my face, then put on my serums, then do this and moisturizer last. WASH YOUR HANDS after use and VUALA! SOFT GLOW!!!
