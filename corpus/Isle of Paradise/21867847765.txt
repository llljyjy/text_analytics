I’m beyond in love with this self tanner! It smells so yummy because it has a beachy tropical scent, but it’s not overpowering. This really helps give my skin such a beautiful back from vacation glow which I LOVE!! It’s a gradual build, which I like because I’m in control of the depth of glow that I want. I love how quickly the moisture absorbs into my skin which makes me feel so soft and dewy. It’s perfect! I highly recommend it. Oh and a little goes a long way! I love the design of the bottle because there’s a lot in it! Glowing Dewy Bronzy Skin
