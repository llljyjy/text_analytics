I really wasn’t sure about this product to be honest. I have a huge Rubbermaid tub of products received from subscription boxes. I just kind of threw it in there and forgot about it. I was going through the tub, and found this…why did I not try it earlier??? It’s amazing. I did my full skin care routine, then hesitantly sprayed it on my face. Let it dry and went to bed. HELLO morning!! I had a beautiful amount of colour, evenly distributed on my face. My tan from Mexico in April was back, and frankly, nicer! I rarely ever leave reviews, but I am in love with this stuff. I also have the Isle of Paradise drops you can use with your body moisturizer. No streaking, or blotching at all. I don’t use it every day, just every few days so I don’t go overboard. I’m fair skinned, and I like the natural look. I can definitely see how it would be problematic for those with oily, or acne prone skin may not find this suitable for them. nan
