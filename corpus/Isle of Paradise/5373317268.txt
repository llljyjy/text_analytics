I wanted to love this product especially after all the rave reviews. But omg I cannot wear it. It is definitely not an all over body product it’s so patchy and doesn’t last. So I tried using it just on my face, using different amounts of drops to see which I prefer. The answer? None. It is either way too dark or way too light, there’s no happy medium. I’ve been using my Bali body face tan all over my face and then using this with a cream to do a contour so I can at least use it since I spent the money. This is the only way I can use it that I don’t hate. I wanted to love it but alas it’s a no for me
