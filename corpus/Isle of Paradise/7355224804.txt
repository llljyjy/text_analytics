I received this a few days after purchasing and it was all milky and chunky, looked very gross. I contacted Sephora and they sent me a new one, and it was identical to the first one. I decided to reach out to isle of paradise and told them the condition of the product, sent pictures and ultimately wanted to know if it was safe to use. They finally got back to me and told me the product SHOULD be clear, not milky in colour and definitely no chunks. They indicated that the product was exposed to heat/higher temp causing the product to breakdown. However, the product is still safe to use and doesn’t pose as a health concern. I did use a small amount on the inside of my arm and it does give a subtle tan, however still looked a bit orange on my skin. I can’t get over the condition of the product so unfortunately these will be going in the garbage. I wanted to love it so bad. Chunks floating and milky colour.
