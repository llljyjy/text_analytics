Love love love! I was hesitant at first because of the negative reviews, but seriously this is the easiest product to use every few days to get that tan look on your face. I exfoliate a lot because I have acne prone skin, so my face is usually quite paler than my tan body. This product not only tans my face to match the rest of my body, but I can also wear it under makeup. The smell isn’t nearly as bad as self tanner (which tends to make me nauseous after awhile), and I don’t notice any oily residue. So easy to use! I’m so happy I bought this! Love love love!
