I can’t recommend this enough! I tested it, it DOES NOT come off on anything. I put it on ~10 min before I got in bed with WHITE sheets (I wanted new sheets anyway lol) and they’re still perfect! It gave me a noticeable tan after one use and it went on so even. I used my hands to rub it in after I sprayed it on. I used it on my face as well, I didn’t breakout at all. My palms are a little stained but I didn’t wipe them off or wash them right after I used it. Don’t walk, RUN to get this
