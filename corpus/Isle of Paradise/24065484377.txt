obsessed! It’s great to use overnight but even today I put some in with my moisturizer to get a gradual golden hue throughout the day. It doesn’t really seem to be ruined if I get water on or sweat while it’s developing. Subtle scent but nothing negative - kinda like a musky coconut. I like how it’s buildable based on the amount of drops. I use four typically and two for touch ups. BEST EVER
