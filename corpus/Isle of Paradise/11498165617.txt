As someone is pretty fair-skinned and has a seemingly endless farmers-tan, a product like this is super helpful in boosting my confidence in evening my bodies skin tone. What I really appreciate about this product specifically is how long lasting, easy to apply, and specific to different skin tones it is. I found it not too much of a fuss to apply, and actually felt moisturizing. Just make sure to wash your hands after, I forgot and had a little bit of staining between my fingers. Overall Iâ€™m a fan! Perfect for different skin tones!
