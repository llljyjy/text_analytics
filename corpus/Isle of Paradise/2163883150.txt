Excellent product. Leaves no marks if used carefully. Gives a gradual tan that is buildable. Has no odor and leaves no weird texture on the skin. Doesn’t irritate the skin and absorbs as quickly as the lotion you use it with. I used it on my body and face. I’m light-handed on the face, applying only one drop every few days and this is enough glow for me. Been telling everyone who will listen about these drops and would absolutely repurchase. nan
