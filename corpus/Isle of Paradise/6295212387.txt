Gifted by Isle Of Paradise in exchange for my honest opinion. This was the first time I have ever used a product that you add to your moisturizer in order to receive a greater tan. The drops mix very easily with my moisturizer and are very easy to apply. Also the scent is amazing! It smells like Cucumbers mixed with a specific perfume that I love. These work very well so I recommend using a little at first before you know how well it will work with your skin. Sunshine Is Fine!
