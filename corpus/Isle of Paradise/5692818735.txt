One of the easiest most user friendly tanners. Expect your first time to be a disaster but after that, its super user friendly ESPECIALLY if you have a helping hand to get your back. Overall I do find this gives a bit more of an “orange“ colour than my tanning mousses however the ease and moisture this provides makes it one of my top pics. It does stain bedding- so what I’ve done is do it in the morning when I’m working from home, and then rinsing before bed to minimize the staining over the course of the week. Another bit of recommendation would be to rinse your feet FULLY (I stand in the tub to apply) and then use whatever is leftover once drying. Prevents it from pooling under your feet leaving you with orange feet.Big fan, would definitely recommend. Beginner friendly!
