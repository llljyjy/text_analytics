I made the mistake of getting the darkest color and it looked slightly orange on me. I think that if I got a lighter shade it would’ve turned out better. For reference, I have olive skin that gets tan in the summer and is pale in the winter. Right now it’s winter so I am pale. I sprayed some into my moisturizer and applied to my face and it came out a bit streaky. The color lasted a decent amount of time though. not bad
