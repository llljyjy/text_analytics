I enjoyed the color that this made my skin. When self tanners are clear, it makes it harder to really tell where you’re spreading it or missing so I did find it to be a little splotchy but I think that’s because of me and not necessarily the product. The smell is not as strong as a typical self tanner and I did feel hydrated after use and not sticky. Excited to continue trying I like it!
