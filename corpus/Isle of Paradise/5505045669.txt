This is a unique product to their line. I’ve tried their drops and the hydra glo formula and the sprayer. I like that you can spray this on-it makes it super easy. Wish it came with a mitt to rub it in. I was a little hesitant to use on my face but it didn’t cause any issues with my sensitive skin. I love the color this gives! Love the spray option
