Since turning 30 I’ve really been into taking care of my skin using a lot of SPF but after summer is over I always wish I looked a little more sunkissed so I finally decided this year to have a year of self tanner. After seeing a lot of mixed reviews I was a little worried after I bought this set to try it. But I came here to say how wrong those negative reviews are! I combined the two products and it’s the most beautiful streak free tan ever. I showered using a loofa, did my skincare routine without putting on moisturizer on my face, the lotioned my body combining my favorite moisturizer (Laura mercier body cream) with 3 drops and then I did two drops with my normal face moisturizer. I think sprayed the water all over and buffed it with the glove and it totally looks like a natural tan. Highly recommend this! It’s better than any foam I’ve used! nan
