honestly my favourite tanning product so far. i usually don’t write reviews but i am in love w this product and definitely recommend it. it gives you a very natural tan, doesn’t make you look orange at all and is completely streak free. i was worried about seeing streaks due to not being able to see where it was applied when putting it on but it develops seamlessly. it also doesn’t have the strong smell of tanner like some other products have. only complaint is i wish the dark tanner would be darker, i feel like if i went with medium i wouldn’t see a difference in colour at all. lovee
