Wanted to add my review as it is not incentivized like most reviews for this. You have to use this tanner correctly for it to work. I noticed a lot of people that viewed this product negative are going in it with the same expectation as the foam or the other bottle spray. This is an oil based product a little of it goes a long way so use it minimally. I usually use the medium foam bottle but went for the dark oil and use much less and get a good result. I didnâ€™t notice a smell like some reviews are saying. It smells the same to me as any other of their products. This is hydrating and gave me a nice glow but as stated you MUST use less than you usually do to avoid it being too dark and too oily. Using too much oil just makes to tacky and oily however, use this product correctly and you will love it. This is just going to be one of those products that you either love or hate. If you have naturally oily skin just stick to the foam. Use correctly for wanted result!!!
