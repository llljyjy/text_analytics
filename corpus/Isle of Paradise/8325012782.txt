Everyone has asked me when I’ve come back from vacation! I bought this on impulse. I exfoliated the night before, moisturized elbows, ankles and other “streak zones” I like to call them and applied next 24hrs using sweeping motions. This will tan you and to not be taken lightly if you don’t wash your hands. I read the directions so every couple of minutes of when I had a break applying, I washed my hands. It’s been a few days and it’s still a really nice color. I’m olive tone/latinx. One of my favorite things is the peppermint oils. I used a mint scrub in the shower and putting this on post shower felt refreshing. It does have a tan smell, which is less desirable than some of its competitors. Compliments!
