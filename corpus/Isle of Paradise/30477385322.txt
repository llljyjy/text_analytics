This at-home self tanner is definitely different than others I’ve tried. There are pros and cons to the formula and the packaging. Some of the things I do like include: the spray doesn’t have that typical “fake tan smell,” but by the next day it does fade to a light self-tanner smell; my skin feels hydrated with the oils; and it provides a nice, natural looking tan (I am pasty, middle-of-winter white and tested the “light”). Some of the areas that I think could use some improvement include: the fact that it can’t be sprayed upside down, which is a big issue when you’re applying to your own body; you have to shake the bottle repeatedly throughout the application process to ensure the oils are dispersed; and the scent still fades to that fake tan smell after a day or two. Overall, it’s not bad, I’ll probably keep using it. But there are definitely some opportunities for improvement. Pros and Cons
