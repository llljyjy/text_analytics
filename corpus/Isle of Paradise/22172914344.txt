I love self tanning as a safer alternative to going out in the sun and drops are usually my favorite formula. I was excited to try this one that I received from Isle of Paradise as I’ve heard a lot of good things. I got the Dark shade and mixed about 5-6 drops for my whole body and my tan was extremely dark! I think getting a darker shade is more economical since you can use fewer drops for a darker color. My only complaints were that it was pretty streaky somehow on the 1st and 2nd day which was odd because I never had that problem with tanning drops before. Thankfully it evened out enough later on! The smell is another thing I disliked about this product though, as soon as I opened it, it has a super syrupy scent and it doesn’t smell good at all. Negatives aside, I do like this enough to continue using it! nan
