I really like this product! Lasts a long time and is super hydrating while giving a gradual natural looking tan. I’ve put it on during hot days and it doesn’t get streaky from any sweat. I did take away a star for the smell. It smells like a self tanner, and takes awhile to fade. I use this in between self tanner days when I’m feeling a bit lazy and trying to stretch it or just needing a bit extra Moisturizing self tanner!
