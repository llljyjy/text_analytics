This product is by far the best self tanner I have ever used. Unlike most self tanners, the smell on this is SOOO subtle. It gives a very very natural glow and looks just like makeup. I love that I can mix it in with whatever moisturizer I want. It makes me feel much more comfortable putting this on my face. This was gifted by Isle of Paradise. Love!!
