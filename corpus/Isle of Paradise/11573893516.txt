The tan you have been looking for! I was considering spray tans because I tried loving tan and Bergen’s and they looked patchy & not long lasting. This was easy - I recommend the spray (put the applicator on a brush handle to reach your back lol). The color is perfect and I’m naturally very pale. STOP SEARCHING - this is THE TAN you want
