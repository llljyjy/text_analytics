This product is awesome! It is so easy to mix into your moisturizer and offers control over how tan you want your face to be. I just use 2 drops to help even out my skin and add a little glow and more when I actually want my face to look tan I will probably get the one for medium skin next time so I can get the results with using less product. It hasn’t caused breakouts so far. The only downside which is the smell, which is almost grassy mixed with the typical self tanner smell? I still think it’s worth it though! nan
