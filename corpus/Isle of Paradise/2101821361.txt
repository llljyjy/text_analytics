I absolutely love this new tanning mist. Itâ€™s easy to use and blends well when using a tanning mit. I always exfoliate my body with a sugar scrub and apply a body butter all over prior to tanning, focusing specifically on the knees, elbows, and wrists / hands. Take your time with the application process and it will turn out great. I also highly recommend the face tanning drops from this brand! Dark Tanning Mist
