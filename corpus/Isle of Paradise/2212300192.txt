This lotion is a nice, not too heavy consistency that applies easily to the skin. I am new to self-tanning and I got a mostly streak-free tan the times that I used this. I’m sure a portion of it was user error, due to my lack of experience. It gave me a nice tan, not too dark for my fair skin. I did feel it pulled slightly orange on me, but most tanning or bronzing products do on my pink undertones. If you don’t have an issue with this like I do, I’m sure this will be a great shade on you. I am interested in trying more products from Isle of Paradise! Nice tanning lotion
