The colour turned out quite nice, but unfortunately because it’s clear I couldn’t see the spots I missed so it ended up being patchy. It is kind of sticky and has fake tanner smell (haven’t found one that doesn’t). I think I’ll stick with my Hawaiian Tropics mousse because I can see where I’ve applied it and it comes out evenly. too hard to blend
