I love these tanning drops! they apply evenly, look natural, and definitely give me a good confidence boost! the only issue i’ve had is that these seem to fade quickly; the tan will last for roughly two days before fading. however, if you just need a quick and subtle  tan, this is the product for you! I also have sensitive skin, and this product hasn’t given my skin any irritation or problems. Overall a great product, and I will be purchasing again! safe and subtle glow!
