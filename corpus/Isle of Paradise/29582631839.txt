I’m so in love with this tanner! It smells amazing right out of the bottle with  super fresh peppermint smell, but after it’s been on your body for an hour or two it smells like other self tanners, but just faintly. It’s a super natural, sun kissed glow and I love how it doesn’t transfer to my clothes. My skin also feels so hydrated and soft. My new go-to moisturizer. Hydrating, Everyday Tanning Lotion
