I am naturally quite pale, but avoid using fake tan because it gives me a fake orange like glow. So I was quite intrigued when I cam across this tanning butter. First of all, it is quite easy to use. The product is a squeeze tube so it make dispensing so easy. The product itself gives me a natural back from vacation glow. It lays on the skin as a gradual tan so I don’t look orange. I’m able marry my natural skin tone with a little but if bronze. I highly recommend. Natural and Cruelty Free
