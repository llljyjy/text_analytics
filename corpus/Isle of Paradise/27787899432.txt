Although I have a dark complexion, my face is lighter than the rest of my body so I was very excited to try this product and have my face match my body. The drops blended perfectly into my skin and my makeup also layered well on top of it. Also, the glow you get after blending out the product is amazing! It looks so natural and it was not patchy as I applied it with my hand and smoothed it out with a sponge. This product was gifted by Isle of Paradise. Very natural tan finish.
