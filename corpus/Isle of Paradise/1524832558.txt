Literally my new favorite tan. I did it 3 days ago and I’m still dark. It says it’s suppose to last a week and I love it. Love the color and I always exfoliate before I apply. Can’t wait to put it on again. Beautiful golden bronze color and shimmery in the sunlight. Looks like I’ve been at the beach all day!! nan
