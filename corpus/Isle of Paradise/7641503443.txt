I got the color medium. I’d have to say that I was pretty disappointed in this product. I had really high hopes and it probably doesn’t help how hyped up it is but it just didn’t work for me. The only part of my body that got color (and I should mention, LASTED) were my arms. Hardly any color showed up on my legs and I drenched them, other parts of my body like my stomach and chest did get some color but it faded away after a day.. it’s suppose to last for “2 weeks” as it states on the bottle. I do not care for the smell, it smells like a faux tan. But I will give some positives 1. The color that showed up on my arms was pretty 2. I like that it’s clear and transfer proof (that is true). I’m happy it’s worked for most as I see on the reviews but I can’t say if ever purchase this product again or recommend it. It’s a lot of work for a faux tan when other brands work better and actually last. Ehh.. Not impressed.
