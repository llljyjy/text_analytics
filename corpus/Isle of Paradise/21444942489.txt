I received a sample of this to try. Like others mentioned, the tan itself is actually quite natural and I like I can mix it with my own moisturizer. However that does NOT help the dreaded self tan smell. Ughhh. If only it could smell like coconuts or something pleasant! For that I donâ€™t think I would purchase it. nan
