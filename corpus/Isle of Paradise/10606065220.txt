I am fairly pale so I got the light shade and I was very disappointed. I tried it twice to see if I just didn’t put enough drops but each time I didn’t notice any difference in my skin tone. I could try again and use even more drops per section but I’m just going to exchange for medium shade instead of wasting so much for the price meh
