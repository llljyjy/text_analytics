I’m someone with an olive complexion that doesn’t love my face in the sun, tans easily, and loves to be tan. All that being said, this really provides a great natural looking tan. Because my skin is naturally an olive tone, I’ve never used self tanner before and this is great for beginners/people like me who don’t know what they’re doing. I was afraid of looking orange, but mixing 3-4 drops in with my moisturizer gives me the perfect look. Definitely wash your hands after applying. It doesn’t smell amazing but not bad either - can’t even smell it after rubbing it in. Also, I have sensitive acne prone skin and this has yet to break me out! I will say the tan only lasts a couple days, but I just use this on my face so it’s gonna last me a while. nan
