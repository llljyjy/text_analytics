I was sent this product for review. I am an amateur tanner, and I applied this for the first time after showering last night. Felt amazing and super moisturizing. I didn’t notice a harsh smell. My skin felt really soft. I washed my hands, and this morning I woke up with beautiful tanned skin. I did have a few streaks, but it wasn’t super horrible! I will definitely use this again! Perfect for beginners
