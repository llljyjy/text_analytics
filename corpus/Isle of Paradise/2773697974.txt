I had never used a self-tanner before (always had been really worried it would leave me streaky and orange). This self tanning lotion was so easy to apply! I exfoliated and shaved before, and wore long sleeves/pants to bed, and I woke up with a really even slightly golden tan. I didn’t go overboard and apply a ton, so this didn’t make me super dark, but it left me with a nice golden glow. It did make me slightly streaky in some spots, but so easy to apply that I’m willing to overlook it. Pretty easy to apply!
