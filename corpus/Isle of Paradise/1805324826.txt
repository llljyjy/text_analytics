Picked this up today and was pretty disappointed. It’s my fault. I went for St. Tropez and the sales associate who wasn’t familiar with self tanners talked me into this. I exfoliated 24 hours ago and on clean skin today I applied for 5 hours. I didn’t realize it was more of a moisturizer than a self tanner but tonight it’s already flaming off. Also I’m sorry for typos. The Sephora app isn’t letting me see the typed text after a certain point. You never not want something to work
