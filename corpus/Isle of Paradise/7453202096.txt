Very easy to apply and I like that it’s built into a moisturizer. I definitely recommend covering or hydrating and dry patches such as knees and elbows as it does tend to gather and look darker there. I’m also not sure the color was right for me. It may have been a bit orange for my liking. The only thing I don’t love about self tanners is the smell other than that it’s a good product that definitely works if you need a quick bronze! Nice self tanner but strong smell.
