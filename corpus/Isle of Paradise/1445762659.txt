As a very pale redhead, I am incredibly picky about my fake tans.  I canâ€™t handle an orange tone and honestly hate that lingering scent.  Lucky for me, Isle of Paradise exists!  The sun kissed glow is oh-so-natural, and so is the lack of tell tale tanner odor.  The formula is so moisturizing my skin looks fantastic after application, and never patchy.  This is definitely the tan you want to rock all summer long! Gorgeous Glow Ahead!
