I am so glad I decided to give this stuff a shot because it gives the most natural looking tan without the nasty smell! It can be a little tricky at first but once you figure out how many drops you need, you’re golden (literally).  I get so many compliments on my tan and best of all it forces me to moisturize which I never do.  The previous self tanner I used smelled awful and left my sheets stained and the color barely showed and didn’t last long at all.  I am already on my second bottle of this and I only wish it came in a bigger size! Best tan ever!
