Iâ€™ve been using this everyday for the last week going from 2 drops in every hand of lotion to 6 drops building the tan I want. LOVE how it evened out my harsh tan lines and gives me a light glow. Of course like ANY self tanner, you need to use plenty of lotion to avoid those streaks on dry spots. I am fair skin with pink undertones and I do not use it on my face. It does not look orange for me but I can see how it would if using too many drops Buildable tan
