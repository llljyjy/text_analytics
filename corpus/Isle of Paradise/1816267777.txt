The best tanner I’ve tried. Follow directions to have the best results—mix it with your moisturizer and wash your hands after applying. Get your hairline, neck and ears so everything matches. It smells like tanner the first day of application but the smell goes away and the tans sticks around for days. Love this. Makes me feel so much more healthy looking in pale winter months. the best! follow directions!
