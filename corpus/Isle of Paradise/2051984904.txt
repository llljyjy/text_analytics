Orange. Orange, orange, orange. I am an avid fake tanner and consider myself to at least know what I am doing and when i tell you I am orange…. To put it into perspective, my friends called me Trump. It’s streaky, uneven, and STINKS! Granted, I don’t think I’ve found a self Tanner that doesn’t stink, but I was hopeful. No “guide color” meant no stained sheets but I will have about 1 layer of skin left after exfoliating this atrocity off. ORANGE ATROCITY
