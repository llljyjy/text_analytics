I wanted to love this product but in comparison to St. Tropez itâ€™s not even in the same ball park. This tan comes off quiet orange and not natural. The oil spray gets everywhere and takes about 30 mins to dry on your skin. The color is something similar to a $10 tanning cream! Sooo orange. And smells terrible as well. Orange so Orange
