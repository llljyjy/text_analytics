Um wow this WORKS. And the best part is zero funky smell. It makes your skin absolutely glow. Now for the tips. Make sure to apply this on towels or somewhere safe. The oil got on my floor and almost took one of my children out.  Also itâ€™s a bit hard to know how even the application is the first time since the oil is sheer. I recommend using a mitt. Good stuff
