Out of all IOP products, the self tanning oil mist is by far my favourite. Very quick to apply and the applicator allows a finer mist to disperse, which gives a beautiful streak free glow. Like all IOP products, no scent, no mess on the sheets, and you can get dressed after application and it wonâ€™t ruin your tan. Make sure to shake the bottle between application sprays. I personally noticed better results second time I used the product- first time around I only shook the bottle once before I used it. The tan also lasted longer on me vs the water and the drops. Definitely will be my new go-to self tanner! Flawless Tan, Even & Streak-free
