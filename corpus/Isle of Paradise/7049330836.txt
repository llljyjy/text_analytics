I’ve tried nearly all the Isle of Paradise sunless tanning products and this is a new favorite! Similar application process to the tanning water. I love that both of them are clear but still I don’t have issues when the tan develops with being splotchy or streaky. It left my skin feeling very hydrated and glowy and I would say that it developed a deeper tan that the tanning water. Next time I just need to be more careful to not get it all over my bathroom floor as well :) Deep Color with Maximum Hydration
