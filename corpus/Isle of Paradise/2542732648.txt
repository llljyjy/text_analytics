This is basically the only brand of self tanners that I’ve tried and I’ve been having great experiences with all of their products so far. This one in particular contains oils in it that you have to shake to activate. The process is pretty simple where you simply spray all over and rub it in. It does take a couple of hours to fully develop and as a very pale person, the light is a natural sunkissed finish. I do wish I got the medium instead now so I can see the tan more, but this product can be layered as well. It did leave my skin feeling really soft and the scent is pleasant. My only critique is the packaging. Although very cute, I do wish it can stand on its own when the cap is off. Other than that this has been a great self tanner! nan
