For the longest time, I never considered using self-tanner since I’ve always been naturally tan all my life.  Recently I saw a video of a Tiktok creator using self-tanner on her dark complexion and it looked GORGEOUS! It really evened out her skin tone, was extra glowy, and just enhanced her beautiful skin tone. So of course I tried it out for myself. It’s important to apply it evenly and have patience. I was super impatient and sloppy with my application, so it ended up looking a little blotchy but even so, my skin had a natural-looking glow and more evened. It even made my KP slightly less noticeable too. I will definitely continue playing with the application. natural glow
