Fan of Isle of Paradise products,  however not of the oil mist.  Aside from leaving a somewhat sticky residue, it gives barely any color - just a slightly yellow cast.   Expecting the “dark” to be darker than the regular body butter, but not the case.  Returned. Does not give a “dark” tan - no go for me
