I got this because I hate the smell and feeling of tanning mousse. This was my first time using a spray, and I found there were pros and cons:Pros: - It doesn’t have the gross strong smell that mousse has. - It doesn’t have the same greasy/dirty feeling as mousse. Once it dries you can’t really feel it. - The application is less messy and bit quicker. Cons: - It makes me look a bit orange and is darker than I expected. I would say it looks pretty clearly like a fake tan, so if you want something more natural this might not be right for you.- The face drops say to use 2-12 drops, so the first time I used it I went with 6 drops and my face was WAY darker than my body. The second time I used 3 drops and it was still a bit too dark. If you’re using it for the first time, I would start with 1-2 drops. - It applies transparent and doesn’t develop for a few hours so it’s very difficult to tell if it’s patchy or be precise when applying. The first time I used it it came out super splotchy and looked horrible. The second timeI was more careful when applying and spent more time rubbing it in, but it still came out sort of patchy in some spots. I’m going to use the rest of it, but won’t repurchase afterward. There are pros and cons
