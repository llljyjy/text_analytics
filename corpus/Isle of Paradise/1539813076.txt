Iâ€™ve always loved Isle of Paradise tanning products because I always feel like they leave your skin looking the most naturally tan. I have very pale skin so a lot of times most tanning products just look fake on me or too orange or too splotchy but I love this tanning mist because it gives you the perfect glow and allows you to have a lot of room for error and not look like you just got tanning lotion all over your hands. The fine mist allows for a very even and natural tan. So easy to apply! Easy Tanning for Amateurs
