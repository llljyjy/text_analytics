have tried a handful of different tanning lotions, oils, and serums. While I really enjoy their tanning serum this one is a hit too! I love the way it smells and the ease of use. I used this with a mitt and applied it right before we headed to the beach for the weekend. It hydrated my skin without leaving it sticky. I had the most beautiful tan the entire weekend! Next level
