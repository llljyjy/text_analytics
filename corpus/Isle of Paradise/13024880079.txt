I’ve purchased the light and the medium, do yourself a favour and get the dark. It’s significant better and very buildable. I am generally fair skinned, blonde so I was worried about looking too dark however it gives a good nice middle of august deep summer tan. I also had to use it a few days in a row to develop the shade that worked best for me. nan
