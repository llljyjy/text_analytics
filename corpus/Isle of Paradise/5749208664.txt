Im not a huge fan of the lingering smell, but that’s to be expected with most self tanners. With that aside this is perfect for your legs. I wouldn’t reach for this for all over body, just because it can settle in the typical areas (elbows, fingers, armpit creases). But, goes on the legs amazingly and fades naturally. nan
