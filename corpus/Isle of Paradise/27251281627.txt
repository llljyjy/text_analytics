Iâ€™ve used self tanner for many years and this is the worst one i have ever tried!!!! the color for the dark drops was so insanely orange and patchy, and impossible to get off. would never recommend to anyone. 2 stars because the smell was actually not bad like other tanners! Orange and Over priced
