WORST PACKAGING - for this much money i expect a foaming pump (something every soap brand in the world can do on a $4 product) to work. after my patch test the pump broke and essentially straight liquid came out. At that point i’ve already started one leg and was stuck completing with weird liquid, made a huge mess on the table i had it sitting to pump as holding in hand wasn’t an option without making hand completely soaked in tanning water. My tanning glove was totally soaked through by the end and i expect this to be a completely patchy tan as a result. I’ll be scrubbing it off before feeling comfortable enough to leave the house to return it.... shame as the test section was really pretty.... If i wanted tanning water i would have gotten that. BROKE IN ONE USE.
