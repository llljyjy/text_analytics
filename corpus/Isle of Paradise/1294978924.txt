I followed the directions and even used the same brand glove to apply. Dried in about 15 minutes but took almost 24 hours to develop and when it did it was slightly orange and very patchy. I did not have an issue with the pump but I did only use it the one time and just on my legs. Huge disappointment! Patchy and Orange
