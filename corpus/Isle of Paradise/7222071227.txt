This gave me a very nice looking tan. HOWEVER, it broke my ENTIRE BODY (where I applied it) out in hives. I was itching for dayyyys. One of the most uncomfortable things I’ve experienced. And yes I performed a patch test, it wasn’t until about 36 hours later that the itching started. I have pretty sensitive skin but this is the first self tanner that has done this to me. Also the spray bottle was kind of annoying when spraying at awkward angles and wouldn’t spray nicely at times Wanted to love BUT…
