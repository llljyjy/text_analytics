I’ve loved using the Isle of Paradise Self-Tanning Butter! It is very creamy. It is so easy to apply! It smells wonderful. It’s my new favorite self tanner as we go into summer. My legs look believably tan.It’s one of my favorite products! I think it’s very hydrating and my skin looks illuminated after use! The cream is thick and wonderful! It works with all skin types. It creates a gradual finish. I appreciate that this product is vegan, gluten-free, and cruelty-free. It is a luxurious formula! Would recommend! Works well!
