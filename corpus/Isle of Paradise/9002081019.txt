I have tried many different kinds of self tanner over the year. This one is the best!! I normally have fair skin (although it generally tans well in the sun), and this gave me a nice, even gold color. I used 3 drops per area. Definitely noticeable color, but not extreme, and NO orange tint. I applied with my hands and then used the Isle of Paradise kabuki brush to go over my knees, ankles, wrists, and backs of hands. This is the first time I’ve ever had no streaks and no orange palms! I didn’t really notice any scent either. Highly, highly recommend!! Best self tanner ever!!!
