The jury is still out on this self tanner. I tend to prefer sprays/liquids over creams. It was easy to apply but didn’t dry down as fast as a liquid. This left some streaking around my wrists and feet. The color actually looked really pretty around day 3, very natural and he’s faded nicely. The smell is standard self tanner smell. I like the bottle, easy for travel. Still playing around with
