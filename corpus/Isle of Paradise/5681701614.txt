Save your money and buy another self tanner. This one is SO greasy—I felt mucky for the whole evening and night after applying. Because it’s clear, you can’t see how uneven it will be once it settles in. My hands are bright orange, even though I washed with soap and water a lot after applying with a mitt. My feet are also orange in the toes. I’d use a more typical self tanner so you can really see where you’re applying. Splotchy and uneven, spend your money elsewhere
