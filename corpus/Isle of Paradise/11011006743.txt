This is my second summer using these drops (i use year round) and they are the most effortless way to keep a glow! I am ALWAYS complimented, asked if I’ve been away because they look so real/good. I am generally fair/slightly olive skin and I use the dark ones. I use them maybe 2-3 times a week. The tan fades after a few days. Just add to moisturizer (I don’t count the drops, just use size of a penny maybe) and voila! Takes about 8 hours to develop. I like to put them on in the morning and by night I am good to go. Use less on face or it can tan too much/look orange. Wash hands after you apply, palms and back of hands. I never get streaks/marks/ etc. The only thing is if I wear running shoes while it’s setting my feet stay white, so wear sandals or do your feet at night while you sleep! You can better at applying after a few times. IE on face get into hairline but they are so golden! My forever self tanner! PS smell isn’t that bad.. no one smells anything but you and its super light while it develops. After wash you smell nothing. Its a non-issue.TRY THEM! I am obsessed!!!!
