So I really like this product in the sense that it gives a really nice glow. Other reviewers are correct, you have to shake the bottle vigorously and give quite a few sprays to the face to give a nice glow. However, I knocked two stars off because this stuff absolutely stinks! The smell is subtle but it definitely gives off a weird odour. Still on the fence whether I would repurchase since I don’t like the smell but do like the glow it gives. Mixed feelings…
