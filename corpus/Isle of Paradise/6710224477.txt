I usually only leave reviews if the product is good because I don’t like feeling negative… but this is awful. :/ I used it for a week and All that happened is it broke me out on my face (granted it isn’t marketed for the face so that maybe my bad) and made my wrists and ankles sticky. I rubbed the product in and it left a sticky residue. I NEVER saw a difference in color. Not on my face or any other part of my body. This honestly just doesn’t work. I wish I would have listened to the reviews. I didn’t listen to the reviews and I regret it.
