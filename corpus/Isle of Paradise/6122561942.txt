So, I’m in a love-hate relationship with this product. It definitely works, in that it darkens your skin, but I can’t seem to figure out how to get it even. I reeeeally take my time trying to spread it out evenly—I use a generous amount and really work it in, but I always end up with streaks and patches. On one end, it’s nice that it doesn’t have a color because it won’t stain your clothes or sheets, but that’s also the issue, because you can’t see where you’re applying it. I don’t know. Maybe if you’re much more skilled than I am at self-tanning you’ll like this, but it’s a pass for me. Also smells bad after it sits on your skin for awhile. What am I doing wrong??
