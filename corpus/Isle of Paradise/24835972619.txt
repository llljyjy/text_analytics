This is my first time using a gradual self tanner and I really like it! It moisturized my skin just like a regular lotion does and gradually tanned my skin. It wasn’t too drastic and appeared natural.  I was worried it might irritate my skin but it didn’t. It also didn’t mess up my clothing or stain it in any way. I am pleasantly surprised how good this tanner is and will definitely continue to use it! Isle of Paradise
