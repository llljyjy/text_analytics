Wow! I’m impressed with these. I have a light/medium tan depending on the season with yellow undertone and these drops bring the nicest tan. I’ve tried a few tanning drops and these are by far the best, no orange look. I use 2 drops in my Riversol moisturizer. I absolutely love it and the price is very good too. I’m sold! The best tan!!!
