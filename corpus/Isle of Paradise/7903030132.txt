This was so easy to use! Perfect for touching up or evening things out. I had a weird tan line from gardening outside and this really helped make it less noticeable. Really enjoyable experience because of just how easy it was to use! Can get a little messy if youâ€™re too wild, so I preferred to apply somewhere I could easily wipe down.-AKA my bathroom. nan
