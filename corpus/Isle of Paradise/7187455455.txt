I received this product for free from Isle of Paradise. This product definitely works, gives your skin a very good glow and feels hydrating on the skin. My only issue would be that it can very easily look patchy. I thought I rubbed it in all over in circular motions but I still had weird streaks and patches on different parts of my body. So as long as you really WORK it in to your skin it looks great! nan
