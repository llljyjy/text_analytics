okay i finally third this butter cream tan, let’s just say it doesn’t worth the hype unless it comes with a sponge to help you apply the product all around your body and a guide to see where you already applied so it won’t look uneven, the only thing i’m thankful is that it doesn’t last for too long, which is great because i can’t wait until this fades away nan
