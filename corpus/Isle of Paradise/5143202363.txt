If you wish to cover yourself in a dark brown liquid that makes you look like you colored yourself with a brown magic marker, that rubs off on everything that lightly comes into contact with you for the recommended 4 hours, only to wash it off completely without any semblance of a tan - then this is the product for you!!! If I could rate this 0 stars I would, that would more accurately rate the product since it will give you 0% of a tan. Save yourself the trouble and just buy st tropez, at least that will get you tan. worst self tanning product ever
