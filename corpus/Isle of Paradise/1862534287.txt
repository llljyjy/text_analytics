I have never seen a formula like this in self tanning before so I wasn’t sure what to expect but I am BLOWN AWAY. The application was very easy, it melted right into my skin and I didn’t feel sticky or oily after, just hydrated. Normally I find random patchy spots on my body from self tanners but I think the fact that this is so hydrating helped even everything out. Its also been a week and my tan is still in tact! Thank you IOP! Love!!
