I absolutely love Isle of Paradise products so I was super excited to try this one out! I ended up loving it. I love how easy it is to apply and it smells great! I definitely recommend using a mitt though and really rub it in. It leaves my skin super hydrated and glowy! I also love that itâ€™s vegan and cruelty-free. Super easy to use!
