I have sensitive skin that breaks out from just about any “new“ product I put on it so I was super skeptical about this but I love it. I started out with the medium shade about 2 years ago & it was okay. I’m not naturally pale so it was a little too light for me bc I only do 3-4 drops at a time. However, I switched to the dark shade around a year ago and am obsessed with it. I still use 4 drops at a time and the color it gives my skin tone is amazing. It’s so easy to use & I see results within 24 hrs which is awesome. It doesn’t leave weird patches or fade unevenly. Overall love this product and don’t think I’ll ever find a better face tanner. Amazing for sensitive skin
