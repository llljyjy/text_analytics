Sun-kissed vacation glow.I was looking for something to help me keep the deep, beautiful shade I got from 10 days in Kauai.This worked so effortlessly. at first I tried medium tone, but quickly upgraded to Dark.I apply lotion all over my body and my facial skin routine, then add several drops directly on top of my lotion. Head to toe.I wake up with a gorgeous golden glow.it also works well to even out any tan lines. Sun-kissed vacation glow
