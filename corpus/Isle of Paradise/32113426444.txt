I was sceptical but I’m glad I decided to get it. I don’t wear foundations or concealers and this have the perfect colour. Ok I should of washed my hands better.  I’ll wear gloves next time. The spray worked amazing and I added the drops to my ceve moisturizer. Everyone I saw asked if I used something different. They kept saying my skin looked amazing. Gave a great colour and than I added the smashbox Halo dewy glow/plumper. I can’t remember feeling this good. So happy I decided to try this. It will definitely be a staple in my skincare. I usually tan but I had my eyebrows tattooed and I didn’t want to lose my tan so this was the best alternative. The body spray gave me such an even amazing colour. Nothing besides a little of my palms had a little stain. If you want a nice healthy glow I definitely recommend this so glad I bought this
