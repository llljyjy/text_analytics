This is the MESSIEST self-tanner I have ever used.  You cannot set the bottle down mid application because the bottom of the bottle is rounded.  So you end up with an oily bottle rolling around the bathroom counter.  And then you look down and realize your entire bathroom floor is covered in oil because the mist has gone everywhere.  Not cool.  Now you have a massive clean up job while trying to keep the cat out of the oil spill and not mess up your tan.  I’m taking it back because I can’t be cleaning up a dang oil spill every time I want some color this summer. Disaster Waiting to Happen
