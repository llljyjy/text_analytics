I don’t wear a lot of makeup, nor do I like being in the sun too often. A friend recommended this to me and I love it. I mixed my moisturizer and 2 drops of the product and massaged the product between my fingers, then applied it to my face making sure to rub it in very well. Don’t forget to rub into your hair line and jaw line and down your next. I woke up to a beautiful glow... i am very happy :) LOVE!!!!!!!!!!
