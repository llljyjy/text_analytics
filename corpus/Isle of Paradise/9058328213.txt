This stuff made me look soo dark and worked super well!! I got a lot of compliments telling me I looked tan. It was easy to use overall with the spray but I did get some build up on my hands and feet, and streakiness on my arms. I’m not a pro so I definitely think I could work on my technique so I bought isle of paradise’s brush so that’ll hopefully help next time I use it!Once it started fading it got super patchy as you can see in the photo, but I went over it with a dry brush and it got rid of it. I also ordered st tropez exfoliating mitt which works super well too but if you already have a dry brush or other exfoliator that would be fine. I’m going to keep using it but will probably buy a lighter shade next time :) <3 nan
