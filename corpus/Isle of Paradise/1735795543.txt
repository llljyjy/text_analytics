I am a big fan of the isle of paradise tanning oil so I was excited to try the tanning butter. First off the color is beautiful! I like that it has a green undertone, it also has golden shimmer which gives the skin a glowy look. Only issue was the bottle says wash hands after use so my hands were noticeably whiter. Also make sure to fully rub this in - the lotion can become a bit streaky if not fully blended. Beautiful color, need practice with hands
