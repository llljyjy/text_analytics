I’m a huge fan of Isle of Paradise, already using their self tanner drops and mouse so was excited to try out this new self-tanning oil mist. It’s super easy to use and the results so far and comparable to the other products in their line. I also love this line because they don’t have that typical self tanner smell I get with other products and can’t stand. So easy!
