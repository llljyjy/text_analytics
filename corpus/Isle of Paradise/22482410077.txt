So, I am a bit of a self tanner snob, but this was a pretty good tanner! My issues with it are that it’s a spray (which makes it messy and got all over my bathroom tile), since it’s oily my body felt kinda sticky while I was sleeping in my bed, and the bottle got so slippery while I was using it that it was hard to use lol. But, the next morning I showered off and I saw a beautiful glow on my skin. It wasn’t as tan as u expected but it definitely looks more natural, which I always want! Overall a great product and definitely makes my skin feel more hydrated Hydrated and glowy tan!
