I’m very happy with this buy! It gives a really nice color that actually lasts more than a day. Easy to use, just put it on like lotion. Let it dry for a few minutes before putting on clothes. Color was a tiny bit splotchy on the wrists/knee/feet area like most self tanners, but not bad. First use gave me a nice color and lasted several days. I used it again after 3 days and it gave me a deeper glow. Not crazy about the scent, but most self tanners don’t smell great, nothing horrible though. Plan on using this 1 - 2 times per week to maintain a nice color. I also used the drops for my face which also worked nicely. Easy to use, nice color and pretty long lasting. Overall great stuff that I’ll def be repurchasing! nan
