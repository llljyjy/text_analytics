I tried the oil mist because the mousse was making my skin dry out and itch in places… so far the oil mist has kept my skin nice and glowy but it does feel more “sticky” than the mousse ever felt. Love the color though and how natural it looks! (Recommend this for sure if your tanner dries you out) nan
