I think this product is marketed as an easy way to get a tan but that is not entirely true. You really have to work with this product and find a good technique for you. I used less drops in my lotion to get a lighter color but I did a poor job of blending it into my neck and hands. I think it would be amazing if you used a makeup brush to lightly blend those areas.
