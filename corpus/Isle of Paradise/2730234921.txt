Okay so I loved the tanning drops and thought I would try this for an instant tan. It is VERY dark and very instant. I have no clue what the people who say it is light are doing because I am halfway to bodybuilding tan. I am not a rookie with tanning products and I struggled with this product. It dries very fast so it is very easy to streak. I lost my mitt so I used rubber gloves and that may have been some of my problem, though some people prefer them! It doesn’t have an overwhelming scent so that is nice and I have now learned a little goes a very long way. I applied this morning and I will rinse off and apply sparingly with lotion to see if that evens it out a bit and helps it not dry so fast. I’m not sure I would buy it again vs. the tanning drops. When they said ultra dark they meant it!
