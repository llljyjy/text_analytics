This tanning mist is perfect for on the go! I can’t wait to use this in the spring and summer for an easy tan. It wasn’t streaky and gave a gorgeous glow to the skin. I applied it every other day after the shower and let it dry and rubbing it in. Then I applied a light amount of moisturizer and it was perfect! I had to make sure to wash my hands and rub around ankles, knees and elbows but it still looked so good!! nan
