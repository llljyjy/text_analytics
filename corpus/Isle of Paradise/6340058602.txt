When summer comes around, I want to be tan 24/7 in my skirts, dresses, bikinis, etc. This Self-Tanning Butter provides me with such a gorgeous, natural-looking glow that is so easy to apply! Since it’s gradual, I can apply it after every shower and build up such a pretty tan that looks really natural and not at all orange. It’s also so hydrating and makes my skin feel refreshed and hydrated. This is a summer staple beauty product. Gorgeous, Healthy Glow
