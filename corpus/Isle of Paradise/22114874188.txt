I do enjoy these drops. Depending on how many drops I mix in with my moisturizer, I notice the subtle or obvious tan tint in my paleness. I’ve seen reviews saying that these drops leave orange streaks on their skin. I had unappealing orange stains on my hand when I first tested the drops out and it is something that can easily be avoided by evenly distributing the drops with your moisturizer. I will say though, after applying the drops, the next couple days I can smell the tanning solution on my skin quite heavily. It’s not something that puts me off personally, but if you’re bothered by the smell of tanning solution then you probably won’t enjoy this product after a couple of days.
