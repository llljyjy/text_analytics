These are my favorite tanning drops by far! I have been self-tanning consistently for about 5 years and have tried a lot of the major brands. I use 2-5 drops per pump of Cetaphil lotion while tanning my body. This does make my face break out, however, so I don’t usually use it for my face. On the plus side, it does not have a strong scent, especially when mixed with a nice smelling lotion. The lack of heavy scent is perfect for me as I am asthmatic.It’s very buildable. I have pale, Irish skin but the dark drops do not make me orange. It’s a very natural color. The only real downside is you can’t really use a mit as you have to blend the drops into lotion. I tend to just put lotion on my hands beforehand as a barricade against the color and wash my hands after an hour or so. Totally recommend! Start with a lighter color or less drops to find the right shade for you! My ride or die!
