Great product, works well! I’ve been applying it to my body every other day after I get out of the shower in the morning. Tip: make sure your skin is totally dry to avoid streaking from any water that might still be on your body and trickle down. I put enough body lotion in my hand to apply to each arm and each leg separately. Then, I add 4 drops and stir with my finger until combined and apply to my arms/legs. Wash your hands immediately! I wait until everything is absorbed, get dressed, and get on with my day! I’ve never had orange hands or streaking, just a nice natural looking glow. nan
