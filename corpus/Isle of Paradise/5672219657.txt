I am so happy with this purchase! I received the drops as a sample from Sephora and bought the value kit with the tanning water and drops because I was so happy with the sample. I was apprehensive about the water at first because it just sounds so different- water?! BUT I love it! Such an awesome, chill glow. I followed the instructions (exfoliate and moisturize elbows, knees, hands, and feet) and it made a difference I am sure. My tan is so effing even I want to sing it from the rooftops! 5/5 stars! This Self Tanner is Bomb!
