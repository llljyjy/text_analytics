Ok, I would like to give this 4 and a half stars because although everything about this product is actually really amazing if your black or dark skinned more specifically I think it may not be enough color payoff. I am black, and light skinned so this worked really great on me, and I am so obsessed with the smell !!!! I will say that I think the mousse gives a deeper more sun kissed tan, so I end up buy-in that and putting it in a spray bottle for a deeper tan, but this is amazing for when I want a subtle natural glow. literally no streaks and I love that it can be used for the face as well nan
