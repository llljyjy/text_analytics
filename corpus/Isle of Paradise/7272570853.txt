This is by far my favorite tanning product I’ve used! I only keep it in for MAX 45 minutes, so it doesn’t get too dark. It always turns out way better than the tanning products that I need to keep on for 6+ hours. I also moisturize immediately after I wash off the product which helps it stay even and last longer. The tan continues to develop so if after 45 minutes you don’t look tan, you’ll continue getting tanner. nan
