New technology alert!! I’ve never seen tanning MIST! I’ve been going to a tanning salon for year but since the big C happened that has been on hold.  Discovering Isle of Paradise changed the game for me, it makes everything so much whiter and I can do when whenever I want to. It keeps my skin hydrated and gives it a nice glow too. It doesn’t smell like your average self tanner cream, slightly fresh aroma which is kinda nice! 10/10 game changer
