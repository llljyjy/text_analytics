It’s orange and smells  pretty bad. Super disappointed. I used the whole dropper in like 2 weeks. Now onto the spray because I got a kit with both. It smells so bad. Doesn’t last either. Waste of money. I’ve bought cheaper self tans that are way better. I’ll never purchase again and I do not recommend it. nan
