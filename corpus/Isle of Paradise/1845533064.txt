I love this new oil tanning mist! I am absolutely floored at the results! I was pretty skeptical. It said within 2 mins I would have a nice tan, it’s a bit longer than 2 mins but by EOD you’ll have a nice layer of a tan! You do need to exfoliate for sure and if you want a nice golden tan by the weekend, give yourself a couple days to layer (once a day) and you’ll love the color this medium one brings. I don’t have the best lighting but trust the process! I was absolutely floored at the results with just a couple sprays! I am getting married in a few weeks so this will be a nice tan before our special day! More for my arms and neck that the legs but will use it consistently. It has a slight fragranced scent and you should follow the directions to a “T”. Exfoliate and wash your hands thoroughly to ensure no patchy spots as well and so you don’t have spotty areas you missed. nan
