Isle of Paradise self tanners are my fave and this one is no exception! I love that it is a moisturizing oil, so application is smooth and streak free. This formula smells amazing (no stinky tanner smell!) so all  I’m left with is a summer glow  that looks like I’ve been on a tropical vacay! I love it! So hydrating!
