I’m a huge self tanner girl - I’ve tried the majority out on the market today in all different types of formulas: foams, lotions, creams, in-shower, etc. This self tan lotion is a beginner-friendly dream. There’s literally (almost) no way to mess this product application up. No more orange ankles, knees and elbows. The super hydrating formula make for an effortless and easy tan application + result. Definitely my new go-to lotion self tanner. As a mom of 2 under 2 I have no time for a self tanner application but this takes minutes and is no fuss. Good lotion self tanner
