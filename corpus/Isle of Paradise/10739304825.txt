Loove this product! Rubbing it with a little bit of my favourite lotion until it creates a pasty consistency and then letting it dry/ soak in for a couple of minutes creates an even tan in six hrs. (Just don’t get wet before it’s finished developing) Has never transferred onto clothing or sheets for me before and it fades gently after a couple of weeks nan
