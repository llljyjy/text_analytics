I’ve used a lot of different types and brands of self tanners. And while I really like some of this brand’s other self tanning solutions, this one is not it :/For one, I’m not a fan of how the bottle is set up. The opening is at the bottom, so every time you want more product in the middle of applying you have to flip the bottle upside down and the opening can be tricky when you have tanner on your hands. It also prolongs how long the tanner sits on your hands, which can lead to orange palms.Speaking of orange... that’s kind of what the color is. It did not apply super evenly and the shade is a bit orange-y. Nothing catastrophic, but, not great.I will say that the texture of the product is nice, and I liked the initial scent (something cucumber or aloe-y). I didn’t really notice a bad fake tanner scent that others mentioned. I also liked that it dried instantly, and I didn’t notice any transfer to my clothing or sheets. The color developed pretty quickly and I noticed a different from my original skin color.Overall I would not buy this product. I much prefer the drops because I feel like I would go through this product quickly since you don’t mix it with anything. I also wasn’t psyched with the application or color. Not Tantastic :(
