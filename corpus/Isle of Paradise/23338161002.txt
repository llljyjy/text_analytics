This product is interesting! It’s really moisturizing and feels nice on the skin. It also smells really nice! I like the way the bottle works as well, it’s upside down so all the product is already toward the lid. However, when the tan developed it was a little too orange for my liking. It stuck to my knees and ankles (even though I exfoliated beforehand) and was a tad patchy. I think I’ll keep trying it, but it may be a little too orange for my skin tone. Love-hate
