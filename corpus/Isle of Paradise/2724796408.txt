I think I’m in love! I was curious how this would work, being an oil mist but it honestly feels more watery than oily which is great. I applied with gloves on, not a mitt, and it blended perfectly! I’ve used many many tanners as I’m naturally very pale. They tend to look very orange on me but this one looks so natural I can’t believe it! It also doesn’t have a stinky self tanner smell! This may be my new go to! I will add, a few hours after I applied I noticed a little change but wondered if I should’ve gotten medium instead but the next morning, BAM! I was tan! Absolutely amazing!
