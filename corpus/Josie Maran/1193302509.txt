I love the lush, rich texture of this. It feels super nourishing without being heavy or greasy. Absorbs completely with no tackiness. Love how it immediately makes my skin feel soft and supple. I experienced no irritation or redness. Overall, this cream stands out to me bc it delivers the benefits of retinol in one of the most nourishing formulas Iâ€™ve tried! Great for dry, sensitive skin!
