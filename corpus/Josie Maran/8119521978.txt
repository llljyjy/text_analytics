I was gifted by Josie Maran. Iâ€™ve had bad luck with sunscreen, but this one might be my new favorite. First off, it does have a scent to it, but it is more of a sweet scent than a sunscreen scent. It blended into my skin with no problem and left a glowy finish. If you have oily skin, this might be too much, but I have dry skin and enjoyed how moisturizing it felt. nan
