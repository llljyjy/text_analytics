This stuff used to be good, that’s why I bought a second tube. However, the second tube I received has like sand in it or something, its SO gritty and doesn’t dissolve well into the skin. I decided to give this product some time to see if the little gritty things would dissolve-they never did- and now I can’t even return it because its been too long! ): I would not recommend this product at all, I don’t know if its a formula change or what, but do not buy unless you want to put sand on your face. Used to be good..Not anymore
