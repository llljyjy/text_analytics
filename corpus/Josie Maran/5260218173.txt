Wow, What an incredible formula Josie has created with her Argan Beta-Retinoid Pink Algae Serum! I decided to try this Serum as I have some fine lines on my forehead, and I’ve starting noticing signs of Crow’s Feet. I have been using this clean formula that includes unique ingredients such as Organic Argan Oil and Quercetin at night. It’s consistency is somewhat oily, but my dry skin loves it. I am happy to say that I have not had any irritations, and my skin is looking more youthful and healthy! Another HG from Josie!
