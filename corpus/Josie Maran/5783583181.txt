I received this product complimentary from Josie Maran, but my opinion is honest and solely based on my experience using this product. I am a big fan of Josie Maran and I think her products have helped my skin over the years, so every time there’s a new launch I get excited. This sun milk comes in a sturdy jar packaging and has a pump in order to dispense the product. The formula is lightweight and the product goes into my skin right away. Honestly, this is not the formula of a typical mineral sunscreen. It feels so good on, it was a slight fruity smell, very lightweight, yet hydrating and no white cast at all. Due to it’s lightweight formula you might think you need to apply extra, but just do your normal “dose“ of sunscreen, I noticed the first time using it that it started peeling on my neck (I am thinking it must have reacted with another product I used that morning). I did not experience any of that after other uses. I really enjoy it! Another great product from Josie Maran
