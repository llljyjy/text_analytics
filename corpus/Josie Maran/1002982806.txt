I received this product to try and I love it, I used about 6 pumps for my face and neck and ears and it Blended so nicely, smells AMAZING and feels so good on the skin. The Kakadu super fruit blend smells like a dream and the Argan oil is perfect! This sunscreen is super hydrating and not greasy or heavy feeling at all! This would be great for all skin types. No white cast and I have medium normal, dehydrated skin and the best part is it didnâ€™t hurt my eyeballs! This was gifted by Josie Maran I love this.
