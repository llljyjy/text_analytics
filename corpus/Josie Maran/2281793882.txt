This product was gifted by Josie Maran for review purposes. Wow, where has this SPF been all my life! It’s so sheer and lightweight. It literally takes just a couple of seconds for it to blend into the skin. This formula is such a game changer, especially for a mineral sunscreen, and I’ve been adoring this in my morning routine. I have sensitive, acne-prone, and combination skin and this just works like a dream for my skin. nan
