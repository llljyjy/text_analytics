Josie Maran gifted me this awesome sunscreen to try out. My favorite part about this product is how it’s not only a sunscreen it is also a skin care product. With that being said, the sunscreen is lightweight and it’s not very heavy on the skin. It it leaves a tiny bit of an oily residue but definitely not as much as a normal sunscreens. Which I love. Even though it has a tiny bit of an oily feeling, it does make my skin look very dewey and hydrated. Plus, I am in love with the packaging. It comes in an orange box, and then the bottle is brown with a white lid. This fancy sunscreen is definitely a 9/10! Love it! Awesome Sunscreen
