Gave this to my husband, a retinol newbie, to try out! He has mature, dry/combo, sensitive skin.His thoughts:- pretty good job at moisturizing - tingles a little when he first applies it- a little bit goes a long way- used it everyday for a week, hasn’t seen noticeable results yet - surprised because he thought retinol was supposed to be harsh on sensitive skin, but it wasn’t Great for retinol newbies!
