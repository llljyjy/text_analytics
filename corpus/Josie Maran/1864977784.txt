I’ve used tretinoin on my face for years, but wanted something gentle specifically for my eye area. I’ve only used it 2 - 3 times a week and my skin is red and sensitive and burns in contact with any moisture. I’ve now woken up with puffy eyes which I’ve never had in my life. I really wanted this to work, but I’m a few weeks in and it’s just getting worse. nan
