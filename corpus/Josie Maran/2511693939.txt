I received this product from Josie Maran in exchange for my honest review.  Initially I wasn’t quite sure how to use the creamy oil. It has a thick texture.  I have dry skin that is prone to dry patches. I found that this works well on those areas and helped to clear them up quickly. I also have been using this on my elbows and feet and it has made my skin so soft! From my experience so far, I have learned that this is a very versatile product and there isn’t just one use, but many.  The tube is generous because a little goes a long way.  I would have preferred the product without the citrus scent, but I am not bothered by it--just a personal preference.  I am excited to try slugging with this as another reviewer mentioned. I think it will work really well for that. Awesome for Dry Skin!
