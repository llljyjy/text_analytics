This product was gifted to me by Josie Maran. This has a really nice thin texture that easily blends into skin. I apply this 10-15 min after moisturizer to avoid any pilling. It is white because it’s a mineral formula but I don’t find it leaves any white cast on my light toned skin. Because it’s mineral it felt very slightly dry after a few hours so I would just make sure to hydrate well with this! Love the chic packaging. Really nice mineral formula
