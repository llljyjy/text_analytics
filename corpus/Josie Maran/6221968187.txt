This is a gorgeous moisturizer from Josie Maran. I was really excited to try this as I have a few other products from JM that I love. It’s lightweight but packs a hydrating punch. The only thing I didn’t love about this was the scent. It isn’t overpowering it’s just not the best. Highly recommend! nan
