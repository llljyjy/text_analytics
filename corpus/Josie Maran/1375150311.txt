I like this sunscreen a lot. It’s hydrating and adds a nice base to my makeup routine or by itself. The only downsides are that you have to use a small amount or it will pill and I do wish that the SPF content were higher but that’s just a personal preference. Would totally recommend this product for people interested nan
