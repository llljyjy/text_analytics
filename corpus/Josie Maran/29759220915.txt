This is probably my all time favorite skincare product I own. I have dry skin and I use this as a nighttime moisturizer in my skincare routine, and it’s amazing. If my skin is feeling dryer, especially in the winter or anytime I’m not wearing makeup, I’ll add a little bit after my morning moisturizer and before my sunscreen. It gives your skin a really long lasting glow and you can feel the hydration! It doesn’t just dissipate after a while. I got the sample from somewhere and as soon as it ran out I ordered the full-size, this literally cannot be beat for the price. I also ordered the body butter from this line and can’t wait for it to get here! HOLY GRAIL for dry skin.
