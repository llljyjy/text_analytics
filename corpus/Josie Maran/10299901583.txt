I’m so happy I got to try this mineral sunscreen that’s gifted by Josie Maran as it’s packed with vitamins and feels amazing on the skin. The lotion like formula goes smooth on the face with a little bit of the white cast as you apply but as you work it in the skin, it blends so beautifully. The glow this sunscreen gives is just amazing Love it!
