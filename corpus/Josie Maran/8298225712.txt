This product is very hydrating and moisturizing. I appreciate the function of this vitamin c - argan oil. I used to use a different argan oil by itself and although it did provide a layer of moisture, my skin was lacking hydration. I stopped using my previous argan oil and began to use this product on my skin. This product has been super hydrating and moisturizing. It is a life changing product and I am loyal to my products. This product has great functions, I will continuously use it. A little goes a long way, I use two tiny drops of the oil and it is enough to cover my face with product. Definitely worth the purchase! Life changing product
