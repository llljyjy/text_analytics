This is my favorite tinted SPF, and I think it’s particularly great for dry skin as it’s VERY dewy and hydrating. I wouldn’t have guessed that a sunscreen would get me compliments on my skin but this one does—it just leaves my skin looking healthy and hydrated.  If I had one gripe it’s that for me it’s so dewy that foundation applied on top of it just doesn’t work—the application is patchy and uneven and it doesn’t wear well at all. I don’t wear foundation often though so this isn’t a dealbreaker for me. I’m not sure how “universal” the tint is but for reference I’m typically the first or second shade of “medium” in most foundations and this is a perfect tint for me. Great for dry skin.
