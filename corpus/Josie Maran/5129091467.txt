I like the formula of this so much. It’s light enough that I can layer it in the serum stage of my routine (yes it’s an oil but I’ve found it absorbs quickly), and it sits well under makeup to keep my dry skin happy. For night time, I’ll use it as a final serum and then finish with an occlusive moisturizing cream. It’s not something everyone *needs* but I find myself using it at least once a day if not twice.
