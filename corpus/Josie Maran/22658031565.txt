I’ve been a long-time fan of Josie Maran, and this formula is their most gentle and effective yet! It glides on smooth, is absorbed quickly, and leaves my skin feeling hydrated, refreshed, and soothed. It was gentle on my sensitive skin, and the smooth texture of the product made it that much more enjoyable to apply. Plus, it helped even my skin’s tone and reduced fine lines around my eyes after just one week of use. I’m hooked! Another Winner from Josie Maran!
