I generally have very oily skin, but in the winter it leans a little more towards combo and can get a bit dry and red on my cheeks and forehead. I bought this because I heard Argan oil is very unlikely to break you out, and it has “hydrating“ in the name. It is AMAZING. I swear when I wake up in the morning after using this, all my little wrinkles are plumped, my texture is less noticeable, and my skin is GLOWING. 10/10 recommend!!! Amazing for Combo Winter Skin
