This serum feels so good on my skin! The packaging is adorable and pink of course! The product smells very natural, probably how algae would smell, but I appreciate that because I do not want to be using added fragrances on my skin. Which reminds me of my favorite things about this brand, they are vegan and cruelty free, and well as enviornment concious by putting their products in recyclable packaging! This serum feels more like an oil on my skin which I actually love, I found that it makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated after use. I applied and let it soak in, then applied moisturizer. This was gifted to me by Josie Maran. Great product!
