This is a basic moisturizer that doesn’t provide really any oomph. It’s nothing special. It sort of feels like it sits on my skin rather than soaks in, and does nothing for the dry patches on my face. For the money you spend, it’s definitely not worth it. It doesn’t do any harm, though, so no complaints beyond not being much of a “wow”. No hubbub
