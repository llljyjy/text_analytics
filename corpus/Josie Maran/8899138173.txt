This sunscreen is great. It doesn’t leave a white cast on my face which is really nice considering I’m already really pale to begin with. It is very light weight on my skin and I feel like it leaves my skin a bit more moisturized than other sunscreens I’ve used in the past. This was gifted by Josie maran Light weight sunscreen
