I received the Get Even Sun Milk SPF 33 as a gifted by Josie Maran.I have been using this sunscreen for the last few days and I liked the light and moisturizing formula. After applying it, it does not leave your face white. I always wear makeup and look for sunscreens that blend well with foundation and this is one of them. nan
