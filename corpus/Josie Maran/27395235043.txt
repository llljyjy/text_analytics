This face cream has a nice, medium rich texture. Itâ€™s moisturizing and gentle, and my makes my skin feel soft and supple. However, it can pill depending on other skincare applied before it. There is also a scent that is especially pleasant- not an added fragrance but probably just the natural smell of the ingredients. nan
