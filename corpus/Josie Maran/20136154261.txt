This is a mineral spf and wow! I don’t typically like physical sunscreens because they are heavier and greasy but this has been so amazing! Very lightweight and hydrating too! I also have oily skin and throughout the day it didn’t make me feel oilier (which most spf do for me). I am fair skin and there’s no white cast (can’t speak for deeper skin tones). Pricey but this has been the best mineral spf I’ve ever tried! This was gifted to me by Josie Maran. Best mineral spf ever
