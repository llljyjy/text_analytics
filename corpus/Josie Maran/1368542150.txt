This is a great non-greasy way to use argan oil. Loved it after more intense treatments like glycolic peels etc. found it was very soothing because of the way itâ€™s formulated. Absorbs easily into your skin better than if you were using a regular oil. Used this in combination with the milk eye serum which is definitely a favor if you can find it for the eye area. Easily absorbed!
