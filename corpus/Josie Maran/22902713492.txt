I am on my second bottle. I like how clean my skin feels after cleansing but it isn’t tight (which often happens with other foaming gel cleansers). It is a bit thinner consistency but considering it is meant to foam with water I don’t mind it. Scent is such a personal preference… I find this quite comfortable and neither overwhelming nor unpleasant. I have noticed my nose pores are tighter and nice and clean. Nice clean feeling
