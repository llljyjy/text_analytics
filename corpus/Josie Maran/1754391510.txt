Wow … not in tube but in tub again.  Now this is a good buy. Each of it 60ml total come up to be 240 ml. The holiday butter buttercream divine smells choco., vanilla vacation faint vanilla is pleasant sugar glazed apricot sweat smell as heavenly. Unscented is okay just no scent works well with everything ,J M body butter is the best in the market right now . I found this works much more than loccitante. Very smooth creamy ,little goes long way. Fantastic. I’m stocking more. Thanks jm.sephora to bring just for holiday n fall. I used it all year round. Grab it. Best ever
