Finally, an intensive anti aging treatment that doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin! This cream hasn’t caused the normal retinol issues I struggle with like blemishes and flaking. It feels so nourishing when I put it on and has a thick and rich texture. Quickly falling in love with this one, it’s looking like a keeper! nan
