Packed with over 30 moisturizing ingredients, Argan oil, and a pink algae derived retinoid. I’ve been LOVING this in my PM routine.

Can’t wait for the long term effects of this amazing cream. This is perfect for my dry winter skin. Retinol is a must for me and I’m loving the Josie Maran pro-retinol cream. Also love that it’s fragrance free. Now I need the body butter. Super hydrating
