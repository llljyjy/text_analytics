I always have enjoyed everything I’ve tried from Josie Maran. This face cream is super creamy but has a super strong rose/flower-like scent. It wasn’t for me since I’m allergic to strong flower-like scents. But it is one that I have enjoyed in other areas of my body to stay hydrated like my hands and my elbows and feet! If you aren’t sensitive to scents, I’d totally recommend this one. If you are sensitive, I’d say pass on this one as it could be bothersome. nan
