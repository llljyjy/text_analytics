Such an awesome mineral sunscreen. It’s lightweight, absorbs well, doesn’t whiten my skin (I hate this about sunscreens!) and basically works like a nice moisturiser. I love it’s gentle smell and the fact that it’s made of natural and organic ingredients. It’s definitely going to be one of my favourite products this summer! It was gifted to me by Josie Maran. Perfect lightweight sunscreen
