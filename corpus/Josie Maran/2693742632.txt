This Get even sun milk spf is awesome, it feels really nice on the skin like a serum and it has a very nice and pleasant scent. I like the packaging and how I can use this with makeup or by it self. It gives a nice glowing look. A small amount goes a long way.  This was gifted by Josie Maran all opinions are my own. Love it
