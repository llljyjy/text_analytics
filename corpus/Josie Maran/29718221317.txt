I received it complimentary from Josie maran. I like the fact that it does have antioxidants and moisturizing properties. I like the hydrating silky texture of the serum.  This is vegan and cruelty free and comes in a recyclable packaging.If you are looking into starting to try retinol then this is a good one to try Good start
