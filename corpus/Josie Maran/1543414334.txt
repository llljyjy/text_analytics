Iâ€™m absolutely in love with this sunscreen! The formula is super lightweight and milky. You only need one pump. I found that if  I used more than that it looked like there was a white cast left behind ( on tan skin tone) besides that though, I love how luminous and dewy my skin looked and felt. (Gifted by Josie Maran) A luminous and dewy finishing sunscreen!
