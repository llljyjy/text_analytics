This cream/oil delivers! I love that it is super multi functional and can be used on face, lips, hair, hands, and body. It has a luxury look and feel, and my skin feels deeply hydrated immediately upon application. My favorite way to use this is as a last step before bed on any extra dry areas + dabbing a very small amount on my crow’s feet and lips. It’s perfect for the extra dry months in the winter, particularly for raw and red hands. The texture is plush and pearlescent and leaves a dewy finished when used on the face. Smooth As Butter
