Sun milk is such a good way to describe this sunscreen. Its smooth, lightweight and feels incredibly light on the skin. It took just a little bit of effort to rub it in, but left no white cast after, and make my skin look even with a dewy finish. I am grateful to have had the product gifted by Josie Maran, but can see myself purchasing in the future. nan
