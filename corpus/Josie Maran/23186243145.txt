I’ve tried quite a few eye creams and never really saw a difference.  Within two uses of Argan Pro-Retinol Eye Cream, I saw drastic improvement.  My dry underlines were more moisturized, smoother and brighter.  I actually stopped using concealer after a week. I apply in the AM and PM. I’ve had no problems with application.   You only need a bit.  I hold my finger on top of the product in the jar,  Once it starts to soften, just a few seconds, I take a thin swipe and rub it into my under eye.  I do it a second time for my lid.I know it’s pricey, but it is worth it to me.  It makes me feel brighter everyday. Works beautifully for me.
