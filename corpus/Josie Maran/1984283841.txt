The tint comes off as very pink for my medium, olive toned skin.  Aside from this I love the moisturizing quality of the formula which is hard to find in mineral zinc based sunscreens.  My sensitive skin hasn’t seemed to develop any breakouts or irritation from this, but I would prefer if the ingredient list didn’t include fragrance halfway through the list.  Fragrance is a known irritant in skin care products and one can develop allergies to these ingredients over time. I’m not sure why fragrance was added as it does not provide any benefit or enhance the product. The box lists this product as synthetic fragrance free, but fragrance is still fragrance even if it is naturally derived.  Eliminating this ingredient would enhance this product even more and make it more marketable as a gentle sunscreen for those with sensitive skin, pregnant, breastfeeding, etc. Moisturizing and Gentle Yet Contains Fragrance
