I have dry sensitive skin and it tends to get rougher and drier! This cream is a skin savior and can be applied in many ways! My favorite is to apply the end of my night skin routine to lock in hydration and also to apply at my knuckles and elbow region where it gets rougher. An all rounder for the winter months! nan
