I have a lot of sunscreens and tinted moisturizers. I love Josie’s argan oil milk and this is it for daytime with the bonus of a sunscreen!  I am 46. I have oily, acne prone skin with large pores (I used to have acne & cystic acne) but it’s more thirsty now that I am older. This stuff makes me so happy. You don’t need another moisturizer with it. Maybe the people that find it greasy don’t need daytime moisture?  I use my active for the day then I put this on top. I will also mix this with my tanning drops then apply my tinted moisturizer or serum skin tint or foundation. I didn’t get this at Sephora I got it on QVC in a bundle. My husband doesn’t take care of his skin at all yet needs sunscreen. When he wears this he looks 10 years younger!  He needs the moisture apparently. My all time favorite SPF!
