I struggled with finding a good SPF for my skin for the longest time, and I couldn’t find anything that didn’t react with my other skincare products, pilled up and flaked off, or made my skin greasy. This is the easiest SPF I have ever used. It doesn’t react with any ingredients I use, it doesn’t flake or pill up, and my skin feels smooth and hydrated with it on. Will forever repurchase this product. The only SPF I use
