This formula is SO buttery! My skin soaks it up without any stickiness or greasy residue. It has hardly any scent, but is a gorgeous pink hue. This was complimentary, so I only have used for a couple weeks so far, but I’m really excited to see the long term wrinkle softening results! Even if wrinkles don’t go away, it’s extremely hydrating and I would use it anyway :) so far so good!
