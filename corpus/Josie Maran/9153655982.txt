I really enjoyed this hydrating cream. Feels fresh on my skin and not thick. My skin feels softer and glowier after use and it’s exactly what my face needs now with the cold weather. It’s such a great formula that causes zero irritation to my damaged skin barrier, it’s helping a lot for now! Super nice!
