This is a great multiuse product. This creamy oil can smooth flyaways, soften skin, condition lips, soften cuticles, and more! I like to use it on my hands when they get dry and start to crack. It is a bit thick to me, so I havenâ€™t tried it on my face, but have used it on my lips. It has a slight citrusy scent to is that is pleasant. This product absorbs quickly and leaves skin looking great. Love A Good Versatile Product!
