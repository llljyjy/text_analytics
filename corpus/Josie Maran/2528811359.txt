I purchased this and have been using it as a makeup primer and it is a game changer! I don’t have particularly dry or oily skin, but I find sometimes my base products, even tinted moisturizers, dry out my skin while I’m in the office because of all the forced air. This stuff keeps my skin hydrated and happy all day! Great Makeup Primer
