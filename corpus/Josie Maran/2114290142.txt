I used a very similar Josie Maran product around 4-5 years ago and while this one is MUCH better, I do think there is still room for improvement. This one is thinner, feels much less heavy, and leaves no white cast on me (all things that have improved since the original formulation). I am a stickler about using the two finger method when getting enough SPF for my face/neck, and it’s easy enough to get the right amount of product out with the pump. It blends in seamlessly and I do really like the consistency. The downside for me is with the 2 finger method you’re obviously using more product than many people would think, which can lead to it feeling a little heavy on the skin after the fact. It is not a dealbreaker for me because it isn’t *that* bad, but I do notice it when touching my face that I can still feel it, and this is why I took off 1 star. I layered my products with a copper peptide serum, vitamin c, and then this spf - no pilling which is always a win! Overall, this is a great improvement and I’m happy to continue using it. gifted by Josie Maran Big improvements made!
