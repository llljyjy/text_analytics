There is no better retinol for sensitive skin than this one. Due to my sensitive skin, I am able to use it every single day without pause, which is awesome for me. I love this product and it has become one of my favorites so far. I use it every single night of the week and I never forget to put on sunscreen in the morning after watching it out in the morning. As a result, my skin became smoother than ever.It is amazing that is vegan, cruelty-free, and also comes in recyclable packaging.gifted by Josie Maran The best!
