The incredible Josie has a new SPF! Get Even Sun Milk SPF 33Sunscreens are one of my favorite products to test but let me tell you why this one has been different. It’s a 100% mineral formula (4.08% zinc oxide & 3.15% titanium dioxide) with no white cast. I repeat. No white cast on my medium skin tone with this mineral sunscreen.  I even washed it off and applied it again on the first day lol. I was like this has got to be a glitch in the matrix right? It’s a lightweight milky, serum texture that leaves a dewy finish. Which is another mind blowing thing to find with physical (mineral) sunscreens.I think this is due to the oil blend that it contains of Argan Oil, Jojoba, Safflower Oil, & Squalane. These are rich in vitamin E and fatty acids, and this blend of nourishing oils helps lock in moisture throughout the day for smoother, hydrated,and healthy-looking skin over time. I’ve never tried a formula quite like this before and though I have combo oily skin, I don’t find these oils to be too much. They balance out the physical filters just right and allow the sunscreen to glide evenly across the skin. It also contains her Kakadu Plum Complex, a trio of antioxidant-packed super fruits that protect the skin against free radical damage while boosting luminosity. So yeah, I’m giving it to the kakadu plum for the glow I see when I wear this. My skin looks so flawless I even want to apply it with my PM routine and wear it to bed lol. The Get Even mineral SPF moisturizer was inspired by plants (who thrive in the sun yet still protect themselves) and I really love the concept behind it and the way that it’s been carried out as well. I don’t think you can miss out on this new launch, it’s become a must have for me ♡︎☀︎︎I was sent this complimentary from Josie Maran for review nan
