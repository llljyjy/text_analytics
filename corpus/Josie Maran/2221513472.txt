I was skeptical about this as the product is really light and when I applied it I noticed a bit of a white cast as I am darker however once I rubbed It in there was no more cast a little goes a long way and it is pretty hydrating I only applied once in the morning, also my face felt a little weird when I first applied it but not anymore this was complimentary from Josie Maran Pretty good
