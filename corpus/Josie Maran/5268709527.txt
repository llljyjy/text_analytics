This SPF was gifted by Josie Maran  in exchange for a review.I’ve tried mineral SPF’s before and didn’t like any- chalky, heavy or left a white/gray cast on my dark skin. This one I approached with with some reserve but…it works!The finish was natural, there is a scent but it fades rather quickly.AND it left no cast. It applied well- I have normal to combo skin.While it didn’t apply as easy as a chemical SPF, I’m thoroughly impressed with the performance Mineral SPF worth checking out!
