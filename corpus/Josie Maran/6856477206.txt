Really love this set. I always wanted to try the pro-retinol butter & love the formula. Was a little apprehensive about the scented ones because I don’t like sweet smells. They are all different types of sweet but what I like is that they don’t linger & choke you lol (like and bath & body products I find.) I have to go sniff my arm up close to catch the scent which is perfect for me. The glazed apricot is my fave so far. Will be buying more as the sizes are so convenient - keeping one for my bathroom, bedside, handbag & travel : ) My Go To Body Butter From Now On
