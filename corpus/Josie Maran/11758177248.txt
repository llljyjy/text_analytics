This mineral sunscreen has a very nice formula. The most important part is that it doesn’t leave white cast so I think it can work for almost all skin tones. It is also hydrating but it doesn’t feel greasy at all. Because of it’s liquidity texture one pump is not enough to cover all my face but two do the job just right leaving my face hydrated and fresh looking. I do recommend it. It was complimentary from Josie Maran but all opinions are my own. No white cast and lightweight
