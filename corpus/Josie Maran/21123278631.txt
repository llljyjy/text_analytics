I received the Argan Beta-Retinoid Pink Algae Serum complimentary from Josie Maran. I really enjoy this serum because of itâ€™s unique and effective combination of ingredients and how it makes my skin look. My skin feels softer and I can see how much smoother it looks. I think consistency is key for long term results so I use it twice a day. I love the fact that this serum vegan, cruelty free, & comes in cute recyclable packaging that makes me feel good about the product. Amazing results
