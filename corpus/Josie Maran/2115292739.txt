This product is so amazing! It has a lightweight consistency and doesn’t feel heavy on the skin. It doesn’t leave and white cast and blends in nicely. I also really like that it doesn’t irritate my eyes like most sunscreens do. This was gifted by Josie Maran in exchange for an honest review. Love this!!
