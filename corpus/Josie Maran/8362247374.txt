Honestly this stuff doesn’t get enough praise. I’ve been using it for at least 6 years now and it’s never led me astray. Always removes ALLLLL my makeup, doesn’t dry me out or break me out, and is just generally good to my skin. I’m always a little terrified of oil products because most oils clog my pores, but argan is one of the few non-comedogenic oils. Bonus points for the hygienic pump. One bottle lasts me ~4-5 months. Make sure you use it as instructed on the packaging! A top-notch cleansing oil
