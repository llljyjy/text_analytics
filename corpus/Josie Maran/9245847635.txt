An argan oil-powered mineral sunscreen that provides even, long-lasting, and luxuriously lightweight coverage—no white cast in sight.performance | .75 star | ok love this sunscreen! However it doesn’t play nice with certain products; depending on the moisturizer and a couple different Hyaluronic Acid serums, it can pill up like crazy. BUT when the right products are applied before, this spf is bomb af! Def no white cast, leaves skin super glowytexture | full star | loooove this thinner more lotion-y texture, doesn’t feel heavy or greasy at all! scent | .9 star | smells so yummy! Bummed it has added fragrance thoughpackaging | full star | the iconic brown bottles with simple verbiage is always gonna win my heart! The pump on this disperses the perfect “finger length”, so 2-3 pumps is golden!ingredients | .9 star | always appreciate Josie Maran products formulated with clean ingredients, just a small doc for the fragrance value | .8 star | $46 is a lil pricy for spf, and with the pilling depending on the base.. but if you have the money and don’t mind a lil’ trial & error run figuring out which products it’s gonna do well with, then go for it. It really is a nicely formulated mineral spfTotal 5.35 out of 6 stars Did a Gemini formulate this??
