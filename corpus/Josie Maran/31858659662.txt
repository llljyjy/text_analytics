This was gifted by Josie Maran. This has become my go-to sunscreen. I love the bottle because it looks super fancy and pretty. Besides that it has no scent which is a major plus for me because I don’t like the scent that other sunscreens have. It looks at first like it has a white cast but it leaves nothing, all you need to do is blend it well and it’s gone. The skin feels soft and glowy, and not sticky. nan
