I love the consistency of this face cream, it really locks in moisture while plumping and smoothing fine lines and wrinkles without the irritation you can experience with retinol. This has become a great addition to my nightly routine for my dry skin. I love it is unscented and great for all skin types. Such a wonderful face cream
