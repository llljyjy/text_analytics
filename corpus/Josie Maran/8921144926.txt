I am a Josie fan since day 1! I use her body butter daily, argan oil, and face butter. So adding her SPF into my skincare collection, seemed perfect! I am pretty picky about SPF, how it blends, the ingredients in it, and how long it lasts for the price. The SPF is so smooth and blends well into the skin. It has a delicious smell and leaves your skin glowing. I have been using it for my walks in the morning or afternoon and really like how lightweight it is. I was gifted by Josie Maran. The perfect lightweight SPF leaving you glowing!
