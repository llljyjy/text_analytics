Gifted by Josie Maran, I love this sunscreen, it is the best I have used so far! The consistency is light-weight and it also glides on to my skin super easily. I love how it doesnâ€™t leave a white cast on my skin which is also perfect for an everyday wear. My skin feels really hydrating and plumped every time I use it. nan
