I am very impressed by this SPF cream. I used the older SPF 47 by Josie Maran for years, and I feel like this one is an improvement. It’s still moisturizing, but the texture is more lightweight, so it works great on my dry skin, but it’s not too heavy and oily like the SPF 47 one was. The cream has barely-there green tint, but it leaves no white cast on my face. In the last 2 weeks I wore it a lot outside, and I have nothing bad to say about it. All in all, this is an awesome SPF cream! Gifted by Josie Maran. Love it!
