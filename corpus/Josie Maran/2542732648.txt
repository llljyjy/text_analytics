This is a multipurpose cream that can be used alone to help dry areas or you can mix in makeup for a creamier finish. I find the texture to be more on the occlusive side than an actual cream which took me by surprise, but makes sense as a moisturizing product. I personally enjoy using this over a cream to really help lock it in and keep my skin moisturized. This product does have a bit of a citrus scent. It’s not overpowering at all, but if you’re sensitive to scents, that might be something to be careful of. Overall, this is a nice multifunctional product that’s perfect for the upcoming winter! nan
