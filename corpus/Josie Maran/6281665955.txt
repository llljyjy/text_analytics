This isn’t a very good cleansing oil in my opinion. It’s very thick and sticky, so it pulls and tugs at my skin when I’m trying to cleanse my face with it. Compared to other cleansing oils I’ve used, I find that I need to use way more product in order to spread it across my face (because it’s so thick I think) and by the time I’m done, it doesn’t even remove my makeup very well. I always double cleanse, but with other cleansing oils, they at least remove the majority of my makeup, or loosen it up so that my next cleanser can finish up the job. When I’m done with this one, I still have eye makeup on that hasn’t been loosened up at all. It doesn’t even fully loosen up my foundation. So overall ... it’s kind of useless! I’d rather buy a cheaper cleansing oil from a Korean brand that actually does a good job ... hard pass on this one guys, trust me. Doesn't compare to other cleansing oils
