The Argan Infinity Cream Intensive Creamy Oil by Josie Maran is different from other skincare I’ve used. It’s goes on almost like Vaseline, but instead quickly morphs into a unique texture that is somewhere between an oil and a silky cream. My favorite aspect of this creamy oil is that it’s a multi-use product for face, lips, elbows, etc. I hope to put this to good use when the colder weather arrives. Despite the creamy oil aspect, it didn’t take hours to absorb. I love that this product contains clean ingredients as well. nan
