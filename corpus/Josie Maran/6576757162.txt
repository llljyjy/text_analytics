I have dry, sensitive skin, but I needed some exfoliation.  This cleanser is a great exfoliant, and it also gets along well with my temperamental skin. My skin is clearer and more even toned. This leaves it soft and clean with no dry spots. Itâ€™s expensive, but this is one of those times when the product is worth the price. Great for sensitive skin
