I really like the initial texture and lack of white cast with this sunscreen. I used the Josie Maran tinted moisturizer for a long time and I thought this would be basically the same but without pigment. It was not. It pills like CRAZY. I tried it with many different moisturizers and nothing worked. I will probably just use it on my body but it is disappointing to have to do that with such an expensive sunscreen. Going to go back to Biossance. Trouble with pilling
