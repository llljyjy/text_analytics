This cream works great for my combination to dry skin. My face is showing some fine lines and wrinkles and this Mega Moisture Face Cream really helps to reduce the appearance of my fine lines and wrinkles and to provide my skin with a more even tone. This cream comes in such a beautiful luxurious packaging. I use this cream after cleansing and toning my skin. It has such a beautiful smooth texture that sinks right into my skin. It feels very lightweight on my skin and does not leave a sticky feeling. My skin feels instantly hydrated and soft and is looking bright and more radiant. I love that this Argan Pro-Retinol is gentle enough to use daily without any skin reactions like peeling or dryness. I make sure to follow with a sunscreen. Since using this cream, I have notice that my fine lines and wrinkles are less visible and that my skin feel softer, hydrated, firmer and is looking brighter. I highly recommend this cream! Beautiful texture, radiant skin
