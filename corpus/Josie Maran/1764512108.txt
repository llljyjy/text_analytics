I received a trial size format that lasted me about 3 weeks.  We were two people using it daily. It is an okay cleanser. It cleans without drying the skin.  I remember reading one of the reviews that it smelled like a hotel room.  I agree with it.  Itâ€™s not a product that I would repurchase again. I believe the smell can be fixed. Meh, does what any cleanser does
