I’ve been waiting on Josie Maran to release a retinol face cream! The smell of this isn’t strong at all, but has a light floral scent. I love the pink color, and the texture is super silky. It’s thick without feeling too rich, and my skin feels hydrated and soft after using this. I can’t speak to how this impacts wrinkles yet, because I haven’t been using it for long. I’m excited to see long term results though. Beautiful texture!
