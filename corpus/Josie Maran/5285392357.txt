I wanted to love thisâ€¦ smells amazing and makes my skin look so glowy BUT it pills like crazy. I tried it under my makeup and it immediately pilled, had to take it all off and start again with a different SPF. Then tried it with nothing but my moisturizer underneath, still pilled once it dried down (seemed to rub in fine at first). I will be returning. It PILLS!!
