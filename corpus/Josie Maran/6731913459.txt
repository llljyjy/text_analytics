I love all things JM. This eye cream lasts me about 6 months with regular use. I mainly use it at night and wake up with the undereye area feeling moisturized and nourished. I don’t have dark circles so I can’t speak on that, however I did notice a difference in brightness. I keep repurchasing this product, I really enjoy using it. It’s scentless, creamy, pink, natural and effective. Give it a try. I mean... it's Josie Maran
