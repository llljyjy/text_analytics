I do like this sunscreen, but it’s definitely not my favorite. It’s very lightweight, and I do like that it’s a mineral sunscreen. I have very sensitive skin, and this does not burn at all. It does have a very strong, fruity fragrance, which dissipates quickly after application. I have not had any issues with pilling. However, it is very greasy, so it doesn’t wear too well under makeup. It’s also only spf 33, and I prefer my sunscreen to be higher (at least 40-50 spf). A little greasy
