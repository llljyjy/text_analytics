Holy crap, is this magic in a bottle? I’ve been using Josie Maran argan oil moisturizer for a couple years, but I just added the argan milk to my routine a few weeks ago, and my fine lines have all but vanished. Especially the ones under my eyes, I have to be very close to a mirror to even see them. For reference, I use Tarte sea deep dive cleansing gel first, then the argan milk, and last I use the argan oil moisturizer. I am 36 years old and my skin hasn’t looked this good in at least 5 years. magic in a bottle
