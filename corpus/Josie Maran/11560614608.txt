Gifted by Josie Maran for review. I like this more than I thought I would. i typically don’t use mineral sunscreens, but this one isn’t bad. It takes some time to blend in, but i’m pale enough that this doesn’t leave a white-cast. this is also very hydrating, and leaves my skin looking dewy, which is always a bonus. I think this is too expensive for how much you get, though. A cheaper mineral spf will work just as well. nan
