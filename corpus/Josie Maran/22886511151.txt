Josie maran body butters are my fav and this intense cream oil is no surprise, its very thick and balmy. I have oily acne prone skin and would not use it as a moisturizer on my entire face but works soo well on my neck and chest area. I even apply it on my lips and spot treat any dry areas. A little product goes a longg way. Max hydration
