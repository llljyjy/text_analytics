Omg, wow. New holy grail! I’ve been looking for a non-chemical face sunscreen that doesn’t leave a white cast, and I love josie’s moisturizer with spf but for me it leaves a bit of a white cast and is hard to rub in. Not this one, however! This sun milk blends in so seamlessly and feels like silk on my skin. This is by far the best face mineral sunscreen I have ever tried! I’m hooked! I’ll definitely be repurchasing this one. Highly recommend!!! AMAZING
