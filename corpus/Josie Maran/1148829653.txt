If you always wanted to try using retinol in your skincare routine but was afraid of getting irritation, this cream is perfect for you!! It’s gentle enough that it doesn’t cause any irritation but gives you great results in improving aging skin. I was lucky enough to try this cream before release and used it consistently (for 2 weeks) making sure to follow the correct way to apply it..I’m super happy with the results I got within this time frame- my texture and pores look less visible, my skin feels softer (improved dullness a lot!!) and my overall skin looks plumped and hydrated! I can’t wait to see more results! Great addition to my aging skincare routine!!
