My skin is loving this moisturizer. My dry skin feels hydrated but I am also loving that it has retinol in it that hasnâ€™t irritated or made me peel like a lot can. My face looks glowy and refreshed but also hydrated. I definitely would recommend for anyone concerned with hydration and wrinkles. nan
