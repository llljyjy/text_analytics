With the weather getting colder I’m so happy to have discovered the Argan Infinity Cream Intensive Creamy Oil. If your like me and love a multitasker product your going to love this.  I’ve been using on my hands, elbows, face so many possibilities.  The formula goes from cream to oil and the size is perfect for on the go. A little goes a long way. Perfect for Dry Skin!
