Gifted by Josie Maran. I like the formula of this serum. Makes my skin feel hydrated and nourished, so I have been incorporating it in my nighttime routine. It’s gentle, and I am unsure of how effective this form of retinol (I believe it’s plant derived) is. Feels nice on the skin though, so I will keep using it. nan
