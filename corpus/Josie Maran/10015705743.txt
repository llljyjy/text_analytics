I received Argan Infinity Intensive Creamy Oil complimentary for review from Josie Maran. I was very excited to try this product because it helps moisturize and hydrate dry skin areas on face and body. I applied the oil to my face, elbows, and hands and was impressed by how quickly my skin started to fell soft and deeply moisturized. This product has a solid texture when applied, but it melts into soft creamy goodness on skin contact. I liked how the feeling of deep hydration and moisturizing lasted for several hours after applying this product. This oil stood out to me from other products because it didn’t feel greasy and didn’t cause breakouts or oily skin. I also really enjoy how multi-functional this product is. Deeply moisturizing
