I’ve been using this product for a week, in the morning and at night, and am waking up with very itchy eyes. Granted, I have seasonal allergies, but my regular eye serum/eye moisturizer did not cause a problem for me. I’ll stick with this Josie Maran product for a little longer though, as I am hoping the pro-retinol can smooth the small bumps under my eyes. The texture is very nice, almost like a primer. I wear a high coverage concealer most of the time due to dark circles. I have found that I really need to let this eye cream absorb well before applying my concealer, otherwise the concealer just doesn’t have the great coverage I am used to. On the fence right now
