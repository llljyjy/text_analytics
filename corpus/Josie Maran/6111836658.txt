This was gifted to me by Josie Maran. Iâ€™ve been searching high and low to find a watery sunscreen that layered well over my skincare and under my makeup. This sun milk is it! I wish that it was a higher SPF because I prefer more protection on strong sun days, but I like that the texture is such that I can get full coverage with my applications. Great for layering
