I love the Josie Maran’s Get Even Sun Milk SPF 33. It leaves the skin feeling so hydrating and how it doesn’t leave a white cast. It blends like a tanning oil and is lightweight feeling on the skin. It is easy to blend and I love how it feels on the skin. I have been loving this product. Even though this has been gifted to me by Josie Maran, I would purchase this Golden Vibessss!!!
