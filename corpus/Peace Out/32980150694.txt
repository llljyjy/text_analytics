I know lightening spots takes time, and I thought using a more expensive product would yield better results... but they didn’t work for me. This package is just 12 dots. And, the box says something like “2x/wk for 2wks should show results“. Maybe these work for folks with fresh acne scars, but they didn’t work for my old acne scars OR relatively new sun spots. Also, unlike some dots, these are not invisible, so plan to wear them at night if you do buy them. Didn't work for me
