I’m always excited to try out a new acne hydrocolloid patch. This one did not disappoint! It’s easy to apply and I like the larger size since tbh it is often needed. It sucked the gunk right out! Didn’t fully heal my zit, as another head reformed… but still impressed. Definitely will be using now when I break out! Gifted by Peace Out Skincare Impressed :)
