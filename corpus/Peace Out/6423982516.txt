I have a really stubborn pimple and wore a patch for about 6 hours. It reduced the size a little, but that’s it. I then went to sleep with a patch on, and again, reduced it a little, but it’s still there. 2 patches for a combination of around 16 hours didn’t do anything. Will be returning. Wore for 16 hrs, didn’t do anything!
