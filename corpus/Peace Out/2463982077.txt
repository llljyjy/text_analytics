I use it as the last step of my nighttime skincare routine. Too sticky and oily, feels heavy. It’s an ok ok product. The packaging is the worst as after every use you have to push the product back inside with your finger. My first purchase had the same issue and I exchanged it for a new one but again same issue so I just kept it. Won’t buy it again. Too oily and sticky
