This is one of those pore minimizing primer type products, very siliconey in feel and kind of brown in color but blends into the skin colorless. Iâ€™ve found this does a good job At temporarily blurring pores and slightly mattifying even though it has a dewy feel on my hands. I quite like products like this they tend to work well for me having large pores and oily skin. Staple.
