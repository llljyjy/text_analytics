Why must companies change a great product?? This was my favorite. Used it regularly for a year. The texture of the new recipe is completely different and has a horrible smell!! It’s a much worse product now. Sad to say I will be returning and I won’t be buying again. Major bummer because the old stuff helped my skin so much. Changed serum… much worse horrible smell
