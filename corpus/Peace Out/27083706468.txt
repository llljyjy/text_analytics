These pimple patches have become a real staple in my nightly routine. They work extremely well on small white head pimples- and for the larger ones they also help to remove some of the pus and they help to make it super easy to pop the rest of the pimple because the area is soft and moist. They do not really help large cysts but they are wonderful for any white head/near white head pimple. nan
