BEWARE! They changed the formula. I loved this and it smelled great. It now smells absolutely HORRIBLE like mildew and burnt plastic. The smell alone is enough for me to stop using it. Why change it when it was so great? Really bad decision I hope to see it change back. Lost a customer for sure. Beware formula changed and itâ€™s awful
