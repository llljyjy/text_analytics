My skin is pretty sensitive and dry. This product doesn’t irritate my eye area on its own, but I add on moisturizer for good measure. I use mine about 3 times a week (worked up from once a week), and I’ve noticed a significant difference in lines and aging skin around the eye area. Which is great! My only complaint is the stick form--initially, it makes it really easy to apply, but when you get to the end of the product, the metal rubs against your skin, causing irritation. Would love this product even more if you could push out more product. I just use my finger now, but its quite annoying and messy. Still, will continue to use! Good Product, Mechanism Could Be Improved
