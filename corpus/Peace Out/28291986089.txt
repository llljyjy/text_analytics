These acne patches are awesome! I prefer using the night patches; I just put one on right before bed and when I wake up it’s ready to take it off. They definitely work! I also have sensitive skin and these patches cause no irritation at all. Also, the day patches blend perfectly into your skin it’s hard to notice it. Night to Day Difference
