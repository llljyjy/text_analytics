I have dry, sensitive skin and wear a mask all day so I was looking for a moisturizer that doesn’t feel heavy or clog pores—this did the trick! I personally like how it doesn’t have a strong fragrance so I won’t fault it for the smell but it is annoying to have to screw off the lid every time to get to the bottom of the packaging so I knocked off a star for that. Overall I would recommend! Good Moisturizer Overal
