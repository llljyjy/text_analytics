Encapsulated retinol, peptides, and antioxidants for the eye area?!?! Yes please! I am a dedicated retinol user but I find my prescription strength too intense for my undereye. This product is perfect for that delicate area. I love that itâ€™s in stick form. Glides on easily, leaves undereye area nicely hydrated, smoother, and brighter. Consistency is key with any retinol product. I am definitely getting results and will 100% be repurchasing this product. Its amazing! A must have
