I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to reviewI love the concept of a Retinol Face stick. That’s why I was so excited to try it esp cause it’s from Peace Out Skincare and I’ve heard a lot of good things about them. I use this product at the end of my evening routine to lock in all the benefits of the products I’ve used prior. I noticed that the fine lines in my forehead has reduced in just days of using it and my skin looks healthier too. Glad I discovered this product!
