Every gal should give this balm a try honestly feels amazing. My skin is extremely sensitive and dry. I have tried all types of eye cream including natural, vegan, vit C, oils, clean beauty etc. I have dark circles, puffiness around my eyes and super dry skin. I’ve been using this balm from almost a week now and surprisingly I don’t feel any strain in my eyes or irritation which is caused by most of the eye creams for me. Skin around the eyes is very thin so be gentle while applying this balm coz it’s hard and but tricky to apply. I stretch the eye area lil bit from the corner and slightly move the balm from outward  to inward. Hope this helps! Why am I so late in finding this perfect eye balm?
