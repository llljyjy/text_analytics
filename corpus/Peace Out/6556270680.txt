Peace Out has some of the best pimple patches I have tried. I don’t get acne too often but I love how invisible and fast acting it is. I always pop one on whenever I feel one about to form and the next day it’s gone. I do get stubborn acne from time to time but it’s nothing the patch can’t fix — however I do experience scaring but probably bc of me picking. Does a great job
