I’ve never used something like this. I don’t know if I’ve ever heard of another kind of retinol stick or balm. I really like the concept of retinol added into an occlusive for overnight. I do wonder about the efficacy of retinol as a last step since I normally use it earlier in my skincare routine. Even so, I can definitely see a brightness in the mornings when I use this. I’ve only been it for a few weeks so I’m interested to see how’s much better my skin looks after a month or two. nan
