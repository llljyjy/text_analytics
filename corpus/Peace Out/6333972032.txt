It’s not a terrible product the product itself may work very well it’s the application I just can’t get over. The stick is firm not very emollient so when you apply it it drags and tugs on the delicate skin under the eyes. I can apply to a finger and Pat under the eye but again it isn’t very emollient or creamy so I don’t feel like I’m getting a whole lot on my finger and rubbing my finger on it doesn’t really warm it up and make it more the way I want it to be. It’s a pass for me. Pass
