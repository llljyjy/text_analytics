I wear heavy make up on the daily so a primer is usually in my routine. So far I’ve been a huge fan of this one! It has a very similar consistency to the Benefit Porefessional but doesn’t feel as slippery or oily. I do see an instant blurring effect which I like and it’s silicone free. I wear my make up for 8+ hours at work and I came home last night and it still looked pretty good. My foundation wasn’t broken apart. I would definitely recommend! Would definitely recommend
