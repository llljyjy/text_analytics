I received this product complimentary from Peace Out Skincare in exchange for my honest review. The packaging is very cute. When I first squirted the product into my hand, my initial impression was the scent (which I didnâ€™t like). However, the scent wore off after a few minutes. The product itself seemed to work as my dark spots from where an old pimple was lightened with each use. Overall, effective but the smell could be improved upon. nan
