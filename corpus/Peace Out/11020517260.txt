Peace Out Salicylic Acid Acne Treatment Serum is great for unclogging my pores, and it instantly dries out my pimples and relieves breakouts on my skin. The texture is gel, easy to apply, quickly absorbed. I donâ€™t have a lot of acne, but my pores are constantly dirty, so a 30 ml bottle is enough for me for a long time. Excellent product, I will buy more! Good result
