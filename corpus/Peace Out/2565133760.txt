I really like this retinol! I have sensitive skin and usually they are very irritating. I use this over my moisturizer like it recommends. I can’t speak to the effectiveness because I’ve only been using it for 2 weeks, but it doesn’t break me out or cause ongoing irritation (which is a wine for me!). I will continue using this. nan
