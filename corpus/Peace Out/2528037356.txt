The concept of this product is great , however they don’t work at all. I used them for weeks and saw NO results. They actually made my breakout WORSE, & that’s quite disturbing bc I do not have acne prone skin. I had one pimple that I hoped to get rid of & the surrounding area of my face broke out.(which caused me to use more of the pads)  I wasn’t able to clear my skin until I STOPPED using these. Do not waste your money on this product. You’ll regret it! nan
