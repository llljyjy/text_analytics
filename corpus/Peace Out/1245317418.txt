I love the convenience of this. I do hate products that I have to dip my finger in. This is just so much more sanitary for me and easy to use. The only thing I don’t love is that sometimes it seems to tug on my under eye a little bit, even after warming it up as they suggest. Also, once you’ve reached the end of the tube, as with a lot of products, there is still a lot left that seems to just go to waste, so you really have to dig it out if you want to make use of all the product. nan
