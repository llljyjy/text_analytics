I found this effortless to apply. Simply press in and then lightly tap. It minimized the look of pores around my nose and cheeks. Also helped with overall texture and redness. I really like that they included ingredients like niacinamide and malic acid to deliver long term results too. I love that this feels hydrating and doesnâ€™t feel chalky on my dry skin. I appreciate that this product can be used with or without makeup. My preferred way is without makeup. Creates a nice blurring effect with some color correction. Love the soft smooth finish too. I also really appreciated that how to use/pro-tip was clearly stated on the tube itself. Worked well with my dry skin!
