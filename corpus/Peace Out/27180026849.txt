I want to rate this 10 stars!! Ok this is my new holy grail skincare product! I’ve used this twice and woke up with glowing smooth brighter looking skin. I am shook! I have some acne scars and aging skin and this stuff has really improved the look of these scars and my fine lines already. It stings just a tad when you first apply but it’s not bad. And it does have a weird smell but I’m used to skincare smelling strange so it doesn’t bother me. If this doesn’t bother you then you need to try this! Gifted by peace out skincare Love love love this product!
