The moisturizer itself - A+, I’m glowing. It’s wonderful. But, I’m still red faced because I’m SO annoyed by how much product this packaging keeps locked inside it. Brands should be focused on minimal packaging, not minimal dispensing. Do better Peace Out. Now I have to have days long internal debate about whether to repurchase it when it’s the best moisturizer I’ve ever used. great moisturizer. worst ever packaging.
