I bought two packs of these on Peace Out’s website and I absolutely regret my purchase. Each pack has two pouches of 3 patches for a total of 6 patches. First of all, you only get 6 patches for $24!! That’s crazy expensive. When I tried them for the first time, I used 3 patches: 1 on my forehead, and 2 under each eye. That’s already 1 pouch gone. I used the second pouch a few days later, and well I pretty much finished 1 pack of these patches in less than a week. Clearly, they don’t provide you with enough patches for you to use consistently and actually get results. Secondly, when I put the patches under my eyes, they hurt really badly. My eyes were turning red and I wasn’t sure how much longer I could leave the patches on. They were honestly a bit painful. Over time, the microneedles eventually dissolved and the pain went away. However, it took some time. Lastly, I saw no improvement in my fine lines/wrinkles whatsoever. Like I mentioned earlier, I finished 1 pack of these patches in less than a week, so obviously using these patches for that short amount of time is not going to yield any results. These kinds of things need to be used consistently for a long period of time in order to see any results, but they give you so little patches for so much money. I cannot afford to keep buying these patches every single week just to see if I get any results. Also, because of how uncomfortable these patches were under the eyes, they are just not worth it. I will not be repurchasing these again. Painful, expensive, and ineffective
