I was expecting the product to be green like the photos, but it’s a neutral beige shade. From the other reviews and photos, it seems to be normal, so I’m not alarmed.  This primer is thick enough to blur my larger pores and even out my skin’s texture, and it doesn’t pill and makes my foundation look even smoother. I have found my perfect skincare routine and FINALLY found my favorite foundation and beauty sponge, but this primer showed me what I was STILL missing. Ingredients like mushroom and Niacinamide promise to help reduce redness with continued use which is fabulous because I get redness for no reason at all. I’m really happy with how my foundation has held up in this unusually hot and now humid summer I’ve been dealing with. awesome for hot weather!
