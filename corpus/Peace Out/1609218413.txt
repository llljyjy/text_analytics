I was a big fan of their retinol eye stick so I was excited to grab this retinol face stick! It’s a much chunkier stick and easier to spread over the whole face as a result. I live in the hot south, so I didn’t feel the stick needed to be warmed up and it glided easily over my face. I used my hands to rub it in to make sure I didn’t miss spots. I’ve only been using this a few days, but so far so good, and very portable! After using it, I experienced no redness or irritation. Gifted by Peace Out Skincare. nan
