Love the application and consistency. Ease to maneuver under the eye. Doesn’t break me out or burn. But I’m unsure of how I feel about this eye balm? I don’t feel like it super hydrating and lasts as long as it says. I haven’t noticed any difference of any kind around my eyes. Only time will tell I guess. nan
