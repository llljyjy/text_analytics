My wife got me the Peace Out Retinol Face Stick for Christmas. Normally I wouldn’t buy something like this but I figured she bought it so I might as well try it.. and it actually works. I have some stress lines on my forehead and some laugh lines as I’m 44 years old and this product deminished them within just one week of use.  I was happily surprised enough that I came on here and gave a review which is also something I don’t usually do. You can Buy this product with the security that the product works. Craig nan
