I suffer from acne, and they’re typically more of like a white head or under the skin. So pimple patches really help me kind of maintain my acne so it doesn’t get too bad and hurt. These patches are a good staple to have in your cabinet and I really enjoy how thick they are so they’re easy to apply and take off. Gifted by peace out cosmetics. nan
