Im actually surprised at how high the reviews are on this product because ive been using it consistently as directed and ive seen absolutely no difference, and for a product at this price point, itâ€™s disappointing. It does go on very smooth and is easy in application, but i feel like, contrary to a serum/lotion, the fact that its a balm means most of it gets wiped off as soon as your face touched the pillow (prob a contributing factor as to why its not working as well as it should), and since you cant really apply retinol in the daytime, theres no real alternative. not impressed and surprised by the high reviews
