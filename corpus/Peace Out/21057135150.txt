I never write reviews but these dots are the absolute best! I have hormonal acne on my cheeks and jawline and these have helped so much! They pull out all the sebum and help with texture. I have dry skin so when I take them off in the morning itâ€™s a little flaky but I just wash my face and follow with hydrating serums and it is fine. Highly recommend!!! Nothing Better!!!
