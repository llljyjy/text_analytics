This pore primer has been really great at smoothing my skin! It feels super nice and light, it doesn’t have any silicones or weird ingredients. I think my makeup look substantially better and my skin looks super smooth after using this!! I really enjoy this brand so I’m happy this primer was a success for me. I was given this product for free to review but my opinion is the same! nan
