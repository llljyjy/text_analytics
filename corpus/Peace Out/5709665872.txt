I loooved the original formula and felt like I finally found the perfect skincare routine with this serum. I just restocked and noticed the new bottle design but compared the ingredients and nothing stuck out as having changed. Boy, was I wrong. This new formula smells AWFUL and the consistency is milky as opposed to the previous gel-like serum, and my skin has not reacted well. What a huge disappointment. Why the change?!
