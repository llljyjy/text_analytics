This was NOT it for me. :/ Applied it on my face and immediately didnâ€™t notice a difference in my pores. I was also thinking the color would be as advertised, but this reminded me of a moss green. Which this product claims to help with redness, and that was far from it for me. If anything I looked more like a glowy red tomato. nan
