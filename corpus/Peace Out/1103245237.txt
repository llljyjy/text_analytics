I received the Retinol Face Stick complimentary from Peace Out Skincare and I really enjoy how simple it is to use. I do my normal night time routine and swipe this in my areas of concern, which are mainly my forehead and smile lines. I’m currently using this about 2 to 3 times per week and I have not experienced any irritation at all. It’s still fairly new to me and my first impression is definitely a positive experience! Convenient and easy to use
