I am South East Asian and have very sensitive skin, generally oily in texture and prone to allergic reactions and acne, generally in the area of my cheeks and temples. This product did not irritate my skin at all. I would stick a dot on an individual pimple or particular problem area overnight and the next morning, I could visibly see all the excess oil that had been drawn out by the dot. This product is also great because it prevents me from picking at my skin. Effective!
