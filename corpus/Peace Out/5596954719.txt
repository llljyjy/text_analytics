The Peace Out Acne Serum help reduce acne and keeps my skin from having too many future breakouts while the current acne is healing. I like that it has no scent but does have a natural scent from the mixture.  I use this during the night and put a thin layer on my skin. I try not to use too much because it just wonâ€™t work any faster or better doing that. I did notice around a month of using my skin is less reddish and my acne has gone down a bit. I think in another month it will calm down and heal more. nan
