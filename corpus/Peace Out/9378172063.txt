I bought this products months ago on sale and I thought it was a great opportunity to try it. It did not disappoint me. I do not use it every day, because of the small exfoliating particles it has, but when I use it, my skin feels incredible, super smooth, and it is super gentle with my breakouts. If youâ€™re thinking of trying it, give it a go. A great addition to my routine
