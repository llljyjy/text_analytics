I am someone with lots of hormonal acne and few systic acne spots. I tried this out on one of my mega huge pimples (im talking volcano sized, red, huge, and painful) and used it for 4 nights in a row. I dont blame the product for taking multiple nights to get rid of that pimple because it was huge and super stubborn. I found that while this product didnt get the redness to go away, it made my pimple’s lifespan significantly shorter and took away the pain. for my smaller white heads/ hormonal acne, this did the trick over night. I really like how sticky the dots are, i use a tweezer to grab and apply them and I never had an issue with them coming off even though im a face sleeper. i also like how well they blend into my skin, i have medium to fair skin so it works for me but I understand how it wouldnt work with everyone. theyre also very comfortable to wear, once they were on i couldnt notice them at all. My biggest issue with these are the price point. Like i mentioned, i suffer from hormonal acne and sometimes i can have up to 4 pimples on my face at once, for multiple days. I cant afford to be buying two boxes of these patches every single month just so my acne’s lifespan is shortened. I wish they were cheaper because I think they really do work, but i need to use these sparingly and for emergencies. If you only suffer from acne occasionally or have a big event coming up and need to get rid of a pimple fast, get these! Effective but too expensive
