Product is a little thick but blends in nicely. Wouldn’t say it completely blurred my pores but it did minimize the appearance of it. I followed the instructions in the back and applied it to my face before my makeup application. Noticed it left a weird texture on my face and my concealer + foundation didn’t sit well on top of it. I’ll have to give it another try without makeup but so far I’d give it 3/5 because it didn’t sit that well with makeup. nan
