I was so excited to try this product when I bought it, but ended up so disappointed when a tried it ... If you are looking for a miracle, I don’t think this product will be it. First, the healing dots are not sticky enough to stay on the skin. I used some bandages to make them stay on my face while sleeping ... you can imagine how non-sticky they are ... Second, they are way too much stiff for the chin or the nose, even for the cheeks. They won’t curve at all so they are really difficult to apply ... Finally, they are only efficient if your pimple is almost already popped (like white, big and ready to explode in your mirror...)  This product is just a big deception for me and I won’t buy it again ... Maybe my type of skin is the problem, maybe I am not using them right, I don’t know ... Really big deception ...
