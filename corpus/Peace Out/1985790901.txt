I really wanted to try this product out to even out my skin tone and texture. But the smell was so off putting that I had to discontinue use. It seems silly that something as simple as a bad smell or adding a little fragrance can change the game for a product. I will never know if this product actually works for me until this change is made. :( until then this was a no-go for me. great if you can overlook the smell
