This product was gifted by Peace Out Skincare. It’s so refreshing to see a makeup/skin prep product that really can pull double duty as skincare. I love the ingredients included in here as many of them are ingredients I’m familiar with and I know my skin responds well to. The texture is quite thick but very smooth and it glides onto skin really nicely without any pilling. As you can see from my before and after image this provides immediate pore minimizing effects and reduces redness and makes my skin look much smoother with less visible pores/imperfections. I use this both when I wear makeup and on days that I don’t wear makeup and I have noticed with continued use that my pores are looking less noticeable and my redness is minimizing. This is an awesome product to have in your skincare arsenal! Must Have Double Duty Product
