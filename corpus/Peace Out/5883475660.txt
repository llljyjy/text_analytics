I think this is great worn with or without makeup. It hydrates and calms my skin. It did have a little bit of a cast when applying that goes away pretty quickly. I usually apply it to the areas needed which is mostly my y-zone. I like that it smoothed and lightly mattified my skin in a natural-looking way. nan
