As someone who doesn’t wear foundation I was skeptical about whether or not this would be a good product for me. I hate the feeling of stuff on my face. I’m happy to report that this product is lightweight and when I touch my face it still feels like my face! I have some enlarged pores on my nose and cheeks and it softens them without looking like I caked make up on. Love! My skin can be a little sensitive and finicky too and so far no issues with itchiness or hives. A double win! Pleasantly surprised
