This retinol face stick is gentle and non-irritating on my skin with my nighttime routine a couple times a week.  I like how easy it is to apply over my moisturizer. My face is glowing. It is also smoother and slightly plumper.  It hasnâ€™t erased my fine lines, but I think they have diminished. Love how easy this is to use
