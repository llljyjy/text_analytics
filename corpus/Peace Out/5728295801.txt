I received this product complimentary from Peace Out skincare to try. I’ve been using it the past week as a primer and first step in my makeup routine and I’ve been really liking it! I’m probably not the best judge of its pore perfecting abilities because I have skin on the drier side and don’t experience enlarged pores that you can see. But as a primer I love it! I feel my concealer and foundation sit really well on top of this and it doesn’t pill up at all nan
