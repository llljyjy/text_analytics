I received this retinol stick complimentary  from Peace out skincare in exchange for a review. I’ve never used retinol before and I know I definitely should. I am so excited to have this. It is so easy to use! Just rub the stick on your skin as a last step, I then rub it in with my hands. It blends sooo smooth and doesn’t tug my skin. My skin is very sensitive but noticed no reactions to this so far. I haven’t used it long enough to notice results but I will use it up and am enjoying it alot so far. nan
