I used these peace out skincare dots on acne on my arm and my face, and both times, within a couple of hours, the white head was completely gone and the zit had gone down by a lot. I haven’t used them overnight yet, because I’ve found that just a couple of hours was sufficient enough for them to work! These really work!
