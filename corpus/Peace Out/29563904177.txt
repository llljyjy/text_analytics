I have been looking for a new cleanser as my 46 year old aging and slightly dehydrated but still oily skin changes and rejects other things that used to work before. This cleanser is working on a lot of levels and even allowed me to combine other products into one so I have less on the shelf as well with everything it has in it. My skin does not find complain or get irritated with this at all, and I have been using it nightly for about a month now. I am really impressed with it, and I think this one will be a rebuy for me, I am very pleased with it! Great for my 46YO oily dehydrated aging skin
