This was gifted by the company. I love this fun little stick. It’s packed with Glycerin and squalane to keep your eye area from drying out, and the retinol in it is potent, I’m only able to use it about once a week to avoid irritating my eyes. This has made my under eye area a lot smoother, my fine lines look a little less prominent, and I even like to use it on my lips for my lip line. I heard that they came out with a face stick for this, and I plan on buying that as well. I love how it’s compact and can travel as well! Peace Out Retinol Eye Stick
