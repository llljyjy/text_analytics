Pore perfecting without the slippery silicone mess! This product was made to use with or without makeup, but I’ve been loving it as a makeup base. It feels cooking and refreshing on the skin. Subtly mattifies without adding dryness and helps blur pores for a seamless base application. Helps to keep my oils at bay and doesn’t pill on top of my skincare. I’ve liked other products from this brand, but this one I love! Game Changer for My Makeup Routine!
