I like this product! The texture is nice and cold (wakes me up in the morning!), lightweight, and glides across the skin smoothly. My one note would be that the product has a bit of a smell initially that I’m not fond of. But, the smell isn’t noticeable after putting it on. It hasn’t broken me out so far, and it doesn’t make my skin oily after applying. nan
