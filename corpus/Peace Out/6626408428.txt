I’m not a fan of stick formulas but I absolutely love this. I was afraid it would irritate me because I have super reactive skin & acne. My previous retinol product had only 1% retinol and this product is 3%. I experienced ZERO irritation and saw improvements within the first night. I had 3 major hormonal pimples on my chin and in the morning, they were 85% gone. Literally, overnight. I apply this like a toddler with a sharpie marker now lol I’m obsessed!!! Hydrating and easy to use. Get it!!! ZERO regrets
