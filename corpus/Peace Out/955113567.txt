I was skeptical about these but they really help! They soak up zit gunk and help heal it. I will cut them if I have smaller zits to get more uses out of a patch. It doesn’t work overnight but in two to three nights it’s pretty much healed. I only wear them when sleeping. But I have worn one a couple times out because they are also a good zit disguise. nan
