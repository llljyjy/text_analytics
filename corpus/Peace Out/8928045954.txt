Great results  so far and I have only been using it  for a week.i have dry under eyes and sensitive  skin and I started having puffy eye bags for a few months  now and I tried several eye creams from clarins  to exuviance  to shiesdo  and a lot of others and nothing seemed to help untill I started using this. After the first use I noticed  the next morning  I hardly  had anymore eye bags, it is very hydrating  and does not affect  my sensitive skin.i highly  recommend  this product,  I saw results  right away !! It works!!!
