I like this brand so I was intrigued that they were dropping a new serum that is supposed to address dark spots, especially as someone who suffers from PIH or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. This serum checks all the boxes as far as ingredients you’d expect for a product like this: AHA, Tranexamic Acid, Alpha-Arbutin, etc. That being said, it is a strong formulation of actives so be wary when combining this with other actives in your routine. I used this every other day and never when I use my retinol and so far, no irritation.As for dark spots, time will tell, but I do think the ones along my jawline are moderately faded so far! It’s enough to keep me trying this, at least. I do think this is rather pricey at $29/1oz, which is why I docked a star.  Overall, though, I think I am experiencing improvements with my hyperpigmentation and recommend trying it if you suffer from PIH like me. nan
