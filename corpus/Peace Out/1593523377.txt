While these are a great concept.. I think they can only do so much. For one, they are much thicker than other brands which makes them less invisible on the skin if you want to wear them out unnoticed. They definitely pull out any oil or sebum from a breakout which is great overnight to wake up with a reduced pimple. I would use a spot treatment product before grabbing one of these to use overnight. Thicker than other brands
