I got this product when I had a painful zit from wearing a mask for too long. After a day it not only went down but my skin around it felt smoother too. I decided to use this in the shower as it has a grittier and thicker texture and found that the steam help. The best part is that I decided to try it for my bacne, and it literally worked wonders and took away discoloration and scarring that was becoming really annoying. So, five stars!!! Should last a while but I would def buy again when I run out. great for maskne & bacne
