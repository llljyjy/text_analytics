I really love everything about this product. Not only is it incredibly convenient and travel-friendly with its compact water-free stick format, but it’s also packed with incredible active ingredients that improve the look of fine lines and wrinkles and brighten the skin.  Probably the best thing about it’s formulation is that it’s encapsulated retinol blend is actually gentle enough for retinol novices like me and since this product is used as the last step in the skincare routine also places several layers of products in between it and your skin further minimizing the risk of irritation. It has a very light natural scent and is easy and effortless to swipe on, so I am definitely keeping it as a part of my routine from now on. nan
