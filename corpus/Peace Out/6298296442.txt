I have such a love/hate relationship with this product but ultimately cannot recommend it because it’s cons outweigh the pros. It has easy packaging and an easy application style, and I could tell a difference (at first) with my fine lines and even a milia spot near my eye area. I actually loved the product so much I bought a backup and added it to my loves. However, this only lasted maybe 3 months before I actually felt like my fine lines were becoming MORE noticeable and I think it’s due to the fact that the product is a little hard and tugs at the delicate skin around the eye. I also just noticed an overall lack in hydration and worsening of dark circles. As soon as I switched to a different eye cream, these problems lessened. So I hate to say it, since I had great results at first, but this is definitely not worth it in the end. Pains me to give this 2 stars but…
