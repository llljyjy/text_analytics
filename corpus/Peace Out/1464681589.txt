I’m really liking this dark spot serum compared to other tranexamic serums on the market. First off, the texture of this is amazing. It glides on and sinks in and doesn’t leave your skin feeling dry or dehydrated. Secondly, it doesn’t smell off putting. Many products for acne fading, especially with tranexamic serums, can smell funky! I don’t notice any strong scent with this. If you’ve ever tried topicals faded, it’s nothing compared to that lol. I like the mix of acids as well, it tingles for a second upon application for me. This is one I can add in a few nights a week. Hopefully see some fading results soon! A great fading serum
