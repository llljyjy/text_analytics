WOW! I was NOT gifted this item in exchange for a review, I just was looking for a simple retinol to incorporate into my routine to try to get rid of my fine lines that had really started to bother me lately. I’m 28, so these lines were nothing too crazy, but they were getting deeper and I knew I wanted to start prevention soon. This product is absolutely insane. Within a week and a half of use — a few times a week not every day — my fine lines are basically gone. It’s incredible. I’ve had no drying effects whatsoever and I have dry skin to begin with. Definitely worth the money in my opinion…want to try to eye version next! Almost Unbelievably Good - BUY THIS!
