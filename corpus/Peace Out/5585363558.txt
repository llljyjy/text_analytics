Let me preface by saying that I have very dry skin and I usually go for a dewy base. That being said, this primer is SO good. It calms down my redness and even gives a nice cooling sensation. You can wear it alone for a ’your skin but better’ look or under makeup. It actually makes my makeup look really good! It gives a beautifully even base. It does have a little bit of a smell (that I can’t pinpoint) but it dissipates quickly. Don’t sleep on this one! nan
