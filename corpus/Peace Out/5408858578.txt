I so wanted to love these! They seemed to be the answer to all my 11 line problems, but it ain’t. Well, partially. After wearing a patch on my 11 lines for all night, I did wake up to a smoother skin. however, after sleeping with a patch twice a week for 3 weeks, I’m sorry to say that no noticeable lasting results are visible.I also had a pack of 3, which I tried on my laughing lines, and honestly, wearing under eyes patches regularly will deliver more and better and cheaper results. (Such as my favs in K Beauty, Berrisom Placenta firming hydrogel eye patches.) Wanted to love, but returning to my K Beauty patch
