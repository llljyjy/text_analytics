Iâ€™ve been using this product for over 2 years now and I just purchased the new bottle. I immediately noticed the new packaging but thought the formula would be the same. What a mistake! It smells disgusting! Will be returning which is a shame as this was a part of my daily routine for more than 2 years. I will be looking for a new product unless they bring the old formula back. Why would you mess this up #peaceout?! Such a shame ! Such a shame !
