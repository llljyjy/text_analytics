I love this primer! I really appreciate that itâ€™s silicone free. It contains Hyaluronic Acid for hydration, while still managing to blur my pores. You can see in the before and after how it quite literally filled my pores in and minimized the appearance of the pores in an instant. It also helped to soothe the redness around my nose. I apply the serum in the morning as the last step of my skin care routine. I use about a pea sized amount for both cheeks. I first smooth it out with my fingers and then tap it in. I like to use it with or without makeup, it creates a flawless base. Amazing Primer
