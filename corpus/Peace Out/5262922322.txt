My daughter is a teenager and has been struggling with breakouts. These pimple patches are great because the daytime patches blend into the skin well enough for her to feel like she can wear them to school. The night time patches really pack a punch with active ingredients, but they show up more. That’s okay though because she’s just at home with us. These didn’t take away the pimples overnight, but they were smaller and less raised after one use. It took 2-3 uses of both patches before they were gone. These are good pimple patches. They won’t really work unless the pimple has come to a head though. If you have those deep, under the skin pimples you’ll need something else. Great duo!
