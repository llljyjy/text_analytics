I was very disappointed with these. They kept sliding down my face and wouldnâ€™t stay in place.I use to use the Tarte brand ones (for some reason they are no longer available through Sephora) and I was able to sleep with them on and they would stay in place. these i had on for 10 mins and they were already sitting on my cheek bones. Do not stay in place
