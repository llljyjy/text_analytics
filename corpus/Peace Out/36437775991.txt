I love this product! I have oily/combination skin that is prone to breakouts. I also have a lot of redness. A few days in and I am already noticing a difference in my skin texture, It is lightweight and not greasy. The only downfall I have found is the smell. It has a dirty sock smell. Not sure what that is all about but I will deal with it because I do like the product. Great Product Funky Smell
