I have dark circles and I wasn’t sure if it was going to work, bought it anyway I’ve been using it for a month now and not disappointed! I have to say I still have dark circles but I feel like they tend to disappear, they aren’t so dark anymore. It’s easy to use, but do warm it up before use so it melts perfectly onto your skin without pulling. 4 stars because it’s a bit expensive for what it’s worth. I do recommend it though. good product
