I was pleasantly surprised by this retinol eye stick.  I was afraid it would be dry and tug on my mature, delicate skin, but it was quite the opposite!  This has more of a serum-balm texture that glides on easily, and feels very hydrating.  Iâ€™ve been applying it nightly for the past few weeks, and have noticed my dark circles are lighter, and my whole eye area looks so awake!  This eye stick also has smoothed and softened my fine lines and wrinkles.  I love that it comes in a convenient tube that makes it handy to take with me when I travel!  Definitely recommend!
