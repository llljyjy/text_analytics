I received these complimentary from Peace Out Skincare. These work nicely for those ’just about to surface and I want it gone’ pimples. They help stop the pimple from becoming bigger and more paingful. They dont work so well for super big hormonal cysts - for something like that youd want to use something stronger - but for the run of the mill 1-off pimple - this is great. ok for moderate pimples
