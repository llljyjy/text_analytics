I loved the idea of this but it is quite hard and does not apply easily on clean skin, I have to use a moisturizer first. The packaging is cool but quickly broke. And I’ve seen no difference in my skin after regular use for 2 months, so probably won’t buy again. I think there’s better product out there! Not wowed
