I received the Peace Out Wrinkles Patches from Peace Out complimentary for my opinions and reviews. Although my wrinkles aren’t the most noticeable, I’d like to take steps to prevent wrinkles early on so that they don’t worsen over time. I was very excited to try these wrinkle patches because I had never seen anything like them before. They did fade the wrinkles when I took them off, but I’m eager to see the long term effects and benefits! great!
