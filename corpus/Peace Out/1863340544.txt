This is a great serum that works at fading dark spots. I have very dry skin and put it on under my moisturizer at night.  it did not irritate me at all or feel heavy under my cream. I had a few sun spots I am noticing fade very nicely. As others noted, there is a rather unpleasant smell. That does go away fast for me and does not prevent me from using. does a great job
