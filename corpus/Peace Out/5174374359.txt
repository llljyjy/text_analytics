Peace Out Skincare has done it again. I received this dark spot serum complimentary from peace out skincare and it has done what it said it would do and more. This is a soft lightweight serum that helps fade dark spots and blemishes on the skin. A little goes a long way for me. Iâ€™ve been using this for a few weeks and have definitely noticed a difference. I do have dark spots on my chest and I am considering using this on them given that it has worked wonders for my face. Definitely one you should consider trying. It works!
