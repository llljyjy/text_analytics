I live by this. I can’t get to my last clear sheet I’ll panic and send someone to get me another box. I recommend this to everyone I know I should be getting paid for the recommendations I put out for this. I will be very rich lol! I live by it and I strongly recommend this. I clean my face.( especially when I feel there’s a pimple coming out) and I place it there for over 6hours.  I take it off and clean again and place again! My pimple or bump will be less visible. I even have MEN wearing this I promise. the lord in a sticker
