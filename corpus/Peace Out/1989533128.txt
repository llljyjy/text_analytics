Like others have mentioned, there is a really off-putting scent to the serum, I can’t even describe the scent, it’s just odd. The second time I tried it, I apply a scented cream that I love over it, so it kind of helps mask the smell until it fades away eventually. That smell is why I gave this 3/5 stars. The serum itself absorbs nicely into the skin, and it also works under makeup. It did help lighten my post-acne marks, but the scent is what will deter me from repurchasing when I finish it. nan
