I bought this product to help healing my acne scars. Has I first try it, I noticed it was a little bit irritating. I wonder if it’s normal or if my skin is sensitive to this product in particular. I usually don’t react to a lot of products. For the rest, I like the texture of the cream, it’s hydrating, great absorption! A little bit irritating
