I was really excited to try these out after seeing these on tiktok and elsewhere. I only have one wrinkle, on my forehead, so I thought I would stick it there. I have included before, during, and after photos. I followed the directions completely and left it on overnight. I saw results when I peeled off the strip in the morning, but by the time I had finished getting ready, it looked exactly the same as the night before. I thought I had done something wrong so I tried it again the next night, and the same thing happened. Maybe my wrinkle was too much for the strip? I don’t know, it didn’t work for me. Didn't work for me
