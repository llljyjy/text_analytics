This product is unique in using micro needling to brighten dark spots. My experience with this product. I found the patches are comfortable to wear even over night . There is no pain involved while applying the patches. I used this product to treat a age spot on my hand . I couldn’t tell of any different in the spot after my first two weeks of treatment. My age spot is old so I can see why results will vary. Didn’t work for me .
