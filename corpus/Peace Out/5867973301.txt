I was starting to notice fine lines around my my eyes and was previously only using a moisturizing eye serum. Switched to this and love it! the lines have disappeared. I absolutely ADORE the applicator. The product itself is a medium consistency balm that sinks in to skin nicely. I havenâ€™t noticed any irritation from the retinol and I also find it very moisturizing as well. Under eye go to!
