i was skeptical about this product cause it’s pretty affordable and let’s be real a lot of eye products on the market do nothing! but not the case here! 1. you need to actually be old enough to have wrinkles to fix - not creases or puffiness or any other issues. this is for wrinkles. im pushing 30 and i’ve finally just started using anti aging products please do not use them if you’re like 25 and younger you don’t need them yet i promise! 2. you can apply this product with your fingers! if you don’t like dragging with a stick then use your fingers! hello! 3. it WORKS! it doesn’t irritate! omg i cosplay at conventions and by day 3 and 4 my eyes have aged an extra 5 years from the constant makeup application and removal, lack of sleep, hydration, and all things healthy. i WISH i had this for last con but at least ill have it for the next! i legit look 3-5 years younger it’s been so nice after looking so tired! aging can be a bummer! this is a new staple in my night time routine. best eye product i’ve used with extremely quick results and a great price point! can’t get better than that. the real deal
