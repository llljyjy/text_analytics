I really liked Peace Out eye retinol stick so I was very excited to try this one. I was surprised this stick is used as the last step on nighttime skincare routine on top of serum and moisturizer. It seals out all the moisture and has benefits of Vitamin  C and 3% retinol. It does feel a bit greasy so give it a time to absorb before you go to bed. It glides on very nicely without pulling or tagging the skin. Gifted by Peace Out Skincare great
