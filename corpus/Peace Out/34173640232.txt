The Peace Out acne patches are great. Short ingredient list of just salicylic acid, aloe vera, and retinyl acetate, minimizing the chance for any other skin reactions so theyâ€™re great to use. Only negatives are that these are extremely pricey at $19 for 20, when many Korean brands have them at $4-5 for 20-30, and that the packaging coming in a box is just very wasteful space wise. Nothing wrong with the product but the packaging is definitely there just for the sake of the markup. nan
