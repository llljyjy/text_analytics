I’m really starting to like Peace Pit skincare. This is the second product I try from this brand and it wasn’t a let down. So far no irritation on my sensitive skin. I’m excited to continue using this in the long run and I mix it into my normal skincare routine. I also like the texture of it not to thick and it easily absorbed into my skin. I think I little goes a long way.  Based off my first impressions I give a Green Light! Definitely try it out! Do it!
