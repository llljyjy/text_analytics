I received peace out retinol face stick. This is used after a cleansed face. It is to be used all over. I have seen some lift after applying this. It has filled my fine lines and light wrinkles. It does not have a scent. It is rather thick on my skin. Not heavy just creamy and oily. It does go on clear and blends well. But it does leave a glossiness to your skin. Over all I like this I think it could be thinner applied and more of a blend glossiness wise. Otherwise it is a great product it does what it says and itâ€™s very easy to apply. Does what it should
