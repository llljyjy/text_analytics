I don’t know how much any eye cream can progressively and permanently reverse fine lines and deepened color under the eye HOWEVER this handy stick has likely helped slow down the rate of increased lines. And it’s just so handyyyy!!! I don’t love putting on eye creams and things so this stick is the easiest application, quick, and actually fun! I wouldn’t want to use an eye treatment in any other form factor from now on. it’s all about the stick babyyy!
