I was gifted by Peace Out this acne serum to test and review. This is my first experience with this product and I have to say it works well for me and the results are better than I expected. I like the texture of this serum and I use a hydrating moisturizer afterwards to prevent dryness and peeling. All in all I am very satisfied and would use again and recommend. It works!
