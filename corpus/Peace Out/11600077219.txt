I really wanted to like this product but it just didn’t perform the same way on my skin as expected. I tried this for two nights on a medium sized pimple on my forehead. The pimple had a head and easily could’ve been poppable but I wanted to see if this could get the gunk out. I put the healing dot on at night after washing my face, and do my regular night routine on the rest of my face. there was unfortunately no improvement in the morning, no gunk removed by the healing dot; the only effect it had was the skin around my pimple where the healing dot covered was dry. Tried this again the next night and had the same result. didn't work for me :(
