These dots stick well and are comfortable to wear. I did my full routine, put it on, and wore it for about six and a half hours. It didn’t itch, and I slept soundly. In fact, I forgot I had it on until I got up to wash my face. Pulling it off didn’t stress my skin. I was glad I went ahead with my hydrating routine before applying it, because I found the patch a little drying to the area around the pimple and left it feeling a bit tender. I had trouble getting a good shot, but the dot also pulled the gunk out of my pores. I was happy to see the gunk was actually moisturizer and that my pores were nice and clean. It also drew most of the liquid from the pimple and left the whole area flat. It did leave the a bit…open, so I made sure to put cica and some additional aloe in the rotation. I’d worry that a larger pimple would leave a larger open area when it came to a head, so while it’s effective at drawing out the contents of a pimple, I’d keep healing products on hand. Pulls out all the gunk…
