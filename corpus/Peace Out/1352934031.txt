Peace out retinol face stick is an interesting product. This is the first time I’m using a treatment product in a stick form. It very convenient to use and take with my on my travels. It is a water free concentrated treatment made with 3% of retinol so it’s relatively mild and gentle on the skin. Also contains fruit enzymes and bakuchoil (also called a plant based retinol). I’ve only used this for a week, I notice my skin feels a bit smoother in the morning. I’ll have to see how this works out long term. Wonderful retinol stick
