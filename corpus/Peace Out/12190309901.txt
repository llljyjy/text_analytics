Truthfully I put these on whenever I’m having a stubborn pimple and when I wake up the next morning the pimple is never *completely* gone HOWEVER, it does effectively take down the swelling and redness of said pimple…for my skin at least. Not everyone’s skin is the same and different things work on different people. I find these patches to be a really grays overnight pimple healing solution and I keep repurchasing the value pack. A little trick I have learned is you can get more use out of them by cutting one patch in half too! nan
