I received these acne patches complimentary from Peace Out Skincare in exchange for my review. The ingredients salicylic acid, retinol, and aloe vera absorb impurities from an acne spot and make it look and feel less annoying. These patches are very convenient and easy to use. I applied this patch to an acne spot on my chin for two days and it was gone! My skin was much calmer and not as red. Thank you for this opportunity to try out these patches Peace Out Skincare! Easy and effective!
