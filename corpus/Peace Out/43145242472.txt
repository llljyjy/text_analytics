Wow! I am seriously impressed by these little Peace Out Wrinkles patches! I used 3 on my forehead as thatâ€™s where my biggest and deepest wrinkles are. I applied them after cleansing and then did a skincare routine on the lower part of my face and slept with them on. I woke up to super plumped and hardly there lines! They go on super easy, stick well, and remove easily. I have used other patches but these have the micro needles that release encapsulated retinol, peptides, and vitamin c. I will absolutely be using these 2-3 x a week and excited to see my long term results. If you are trying everything to combat wrinkles, especially stubborn forehead lines, definitely try these! The price point is awesome and you can reuse these several time! Highly recommend! Loving these!
