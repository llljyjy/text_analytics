I get post-acne pigmentation since my teens, and I easily pigment from pretty much everything. I tried A LOT to fight this, and this product is probably the best out there.It started working *the very first time* I used it. It fades old spots, and even the skin tone and prevents new spots from deepening. “complimentary from Peace Out Skincare“ nan
