This stick is little but MIGHTY!  I have been using this product daily for the last 60 days and I am more impressed as the days go by.  I HAD pronounced “11“ between my eyes and they have softened and nearly disappeared since I started using this face stick.  I love that I have never had any type of skin sensitivity to using it daily.  My skin looks clearer, brighter and more youthful as I use.  It is SUPER easy to use - I wash my face, moisturize then swipe the Peace Out Retinol Face Stick across my forehead, marionette lines, upper lip, and neck (which are the problem areas I am focusing on). I go to bed and wake up with hydrated and refreshed looking skin the next morning.  You will not be disappointed in purchasing and using this product! Youthful skin in a stick
