I am a big fan of this brand. In fact, I already picked up a back up this weekend and planning to get another one on the VIB sale. For someone with sensitive skin and consistently struggle with post acne hyperpigmentation, a good Dark Spot serum is vital for me. This is pretty lightweight, formulated with amazing ingredients and safe for sensitive skin. Iâ€™ve used it a few times already and my recent dark spot is already lightened. This works so well with their blemish repair moisturizer. Love it and will absolutely continue to use it! Gifted by Peace Out skincare. PS. This is perfect for treating acne scars. While the salicylic acid acne serum is perfect for active acne! Love it!
