I actually am impressed with this stick gifted by peace out skincare! I have tried retinol before in different forms and my skin has broken out (due to mixture of ingredients in the products) so I was hesitant to try this. Iâ€™ve used it multiple times with no breakouts at all. Plus, I love how convenient the stick is I can easily run it over areas I want to treat and be done! I even saw a slight improvement in my smile lines overnight! They looked less noticeable. I do recommend this product! Great addition to your skincare routine! Great retinol product!
