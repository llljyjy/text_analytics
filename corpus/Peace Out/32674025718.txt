This product was gifted to me by Peace Out Skincare, and it’s so good! I didn’t find it to be drying like other retinol products sometimes can be. I used it on my under eyes and my forehead lines overnight, and it made my skin smoother and the lines appeared lighter after only a few days of use! So easy to use!
