I was so excited to try this, but the smell. Sweet baby deity, the smell. Sweaty feet? BO? Dirty gym clothes left in the trunk in July?Even with the smell, I figured I’d give it a try - once it was on and I put moisturizer on, I figured it would go away. I was wrong. It was right before bed and everytime I moved, I’d get a whiff of it. I waited several minutes, but that was all I could do before getting up to wash it off and start over.I can’t speak to its efficacy because of this - back it goes. Smells like sweaty feet
