So I’ve been using this on top of my typical nighttime routine for about a week and a half. First things first, this did not irritate my skin like some other retinols do. This also glided on smoothly and set in nicely on my skin. At first I didn’t really notice a difference but about a week in I could tell that my forehead lines didn’t look as deep as they usually do. Wish I took before and after photos but whatever. More than anything I’m starting to get some lines on my chest from the way I sleep and I think I’ve noticed the biggest difference there. Love this product and I’ve never used anything like it but I will def keep this in my everyday line up. nan
