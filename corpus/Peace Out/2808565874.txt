I was excited to use these acne patch but it didn’t work as good as I thought it would.  I have used it twice already. I put it on at night and the next morning I peel it off but my pimple is still visible. I admit it looks a little better than it did but I’ve tried other acne patches before and those work way better. It’s okay
