I have combination skin and suffer from frequent hormonal breakouts.  Many moisturizers I’ve tried in the past have either been too heavy and further clog my pores or too lightweight and leave my skin feeling parched after a short period of time.  This moisturizer provides the perfect balance of being thick enough to effectively hydrate dry areas overnight without being impenetrable so it doesn’t occlude my pores and doesn’t aggravate pimples.  This cream is quick to fully absorb into my skin and doesn’t leave it feeling greasy or sticky.  I would describe the finish it leaves as more matte than dewy.  There is a subtle fermented scent upon initial application, but it dissipates after a few minutes.  My skin often reacts negatively to new skincare products, but this moisturizer has actually tamed any residual redness on my face from breakouts or harsh acne treatments.  I find that three pumps is the ideal amount for my face, neck, and chest.  I’ve been using this day and night, and this moisturizer layers well with makeup and all of my other skincare including sunscreen without causing any pilling.
