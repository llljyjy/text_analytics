I love the packaging, it is super convenient and it is easier to apply. I haven’t seen any changes yet but this is moisturizing enough as a retinol. Love that is has great ingredients and it absorbs quickly into my skin. This is my first time to use a retinol around my eyes so I’m taking it gradually. nan
