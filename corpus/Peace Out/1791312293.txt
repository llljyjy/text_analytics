I enjoyed using this product both barefaced and under makeup. I did find it blurred the look of pores on my nose, and I noticed how much softer my skin looked and felt where it was applied. I don’t have much problem with makeup longevity, so I can’t speak to the staying power as a primer. Highly recc moisturizing and exfoliating before use, otherwise it can bead up a little. nan
