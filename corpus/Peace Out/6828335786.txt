I’ve been using this product for about a week now and have noticed my dark spots getting lighter.  The consistency is light weight and doesn’t feel heavy on the skin. It’s definitely more of a serum consistency. The only thing I didn’t like about it was the smell it has at first but it doesn’t linger so the smell does go away after a while. nan
