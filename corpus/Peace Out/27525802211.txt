This is a great primer with so many benefits! I have sensitive skin and this did not irritate it. I also thought that it may be too dark for me since I’m pale, but it didn’t look too dark on my skin! It did make my pores look much less noticeable after applying makeup over it, and I did notice that it helped reduce redness too! I love that it’s good for your skin, so it makes me want to use it even more often! A primer with lots of added benefits!
