I received this complimentary from Peace Out in exchange for my honest review. I get small breakouts every so often but more around my period. I also have a very oily t zone. The texture of this is very creamy and sinks into my skin which is great as I can wear it under my makeup. Though I know it can take time to see results I love that it has salicylic acid and niacinimide. nan
