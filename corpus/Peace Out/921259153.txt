Gifted by Peace Out in exchange for my honest review. The Retinol Face Stick is so convenient to apply all over my face including my neck area before I go to bed. It needs the warmth of your skin to give it a smooth glide so donâ€™t immediately try to roll it all over. It did not irritate my skin and left my skin feeling soft and smooth. Initially, it can feel a bit greasy and heavy but gradually goes away as it gets absorbed into the skin. I wake up with fewer fine lines and a smoother look. The Retinol Eye Stick is a smaller size like a chapstick makes it so easy to apply to the eye area. It did not irritate my eyes, did not creep into my eyes as creams do, and felt so hydrating and soothing. This makes my bedtime skincare routine so easy for my dry/mature skin, and what an amazing deal for both of these retinol sticks!! Great results and an amazing deal
