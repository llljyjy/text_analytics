It does blue my giant pores some but not like a silicone primer does. So if you want to stay away from silicone this is great but silicone for me is what makes a huge difference on how smooth my pores look. Love that it’s cruelty free but I feel it’s kinda pricey for the size. I also love that it co twins niacinimide but that does take consistent use to see the effects from it. It helps slightly with my redness which I also like because I have a hard time covering mine on my cheeks so this with a good concealer is a great combo. Overall I like this but it’s not my holy grail  primer for my huge pores. Makeup does look great on top for me. Helps the look of redness
