This acne serum is very easy to use. I found it to be gentle and not harsh in any way (although your skin may vary). I love that it’s a clean beauty product without fragrances or any harmful chemicals. It’s very lightweight on the skin and goes perfectly under any moisturizer. I love that you can use this to prevent future breakouts. It’s great! nan
