Honestly no. I’ve worn other acne patches that greatly relieve and diminish size of pimples within hours, these are essentially just empty gel dots. Will take them off a day later to find my skin the saaaame shade of red and angry! Only thing they do is keep you from seeing/touching them, I guess. I’m incredibly bummed out and disappointed. Spend your money on any other product, I promise it will do more than these nan
