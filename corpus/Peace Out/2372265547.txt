I love the concept of these patches and that you can speed up the acne healing and disappearing process overnight and out of sight! Other patches I have tried are hydrocolloid only and I’ve had mixed results, so I like that these also have salicylic acid to actually clear up the acne as well as soothing ingredients. The packaging feels very high end and luxurious compared to other brands I have used as well, and I love the resealable pouches for the sticker sheets, it makes it feel like these won’t dry out prematurely. These stuck very well even after I had moisturized my face (you’re only supposed to apply to a clean face but I always forget not to moisturize!), even in the awkward bend near my nostrils where I break out a lot. My painful, growing pimple was barely able to be seen and not painful at all once I took off this patch after wearing overnight. Definitely a fan of these!This product was gifted in exchange for my honest review. nan
