I had recently moved to a humid climate from a dry one and my sensitive combination/dry skin has been oilier and more blemish prone so I decided to try this balm. It’s now my favorite. It acts as an exfoliant and primes the skin for whatever treatment you use after. I’ll definitely be buying more. nan
