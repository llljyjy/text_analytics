I am impressed with this formula/product! This acne serum actually helps with acne. I have never really used a product that was creamy and hydrating while helping lessen the appearance of acne. I use it before I know hormonal acne will come and after  and I can tell it really helps without breakouts. I can even tell after over a week almost every day, my acne scars are fading. It feels nice on the skin and not that drying like other acne serums! complimentary from Peace Out Skincare. nan
