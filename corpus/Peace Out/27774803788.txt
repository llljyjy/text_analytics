This Peace out skin care is great for acne it helps reduce inflammation. I love this because it helps my pimple heals faster and protect it from dirt and keeps it less irrtated. It also helped me a lot not to pop my pimples and avoiding it from getting micro organisms from my dirty hands.  I like the packaging and it is resealable too which helps keep the patch clean ans sealed. It has night and day patches that I can use and I am happy and impressed with this product. I got this as a complimentary from peace out skin care for my honest opinion. Amazing acne patch
