I was a little scared to use this under my delicate eye area, but it has been working wonderfully. I havenâ€™t had any irritation whatsoever. I warm my stick up in my hands and it glides on extra smooth. I use it at night with my Peace Out Retinol Face Stick and it has been killing it. Complimentary from Peace Out Skincare Loving It
