complimentary from Peace Out SkincareThe bottle is very cute. I love the color of the packaging. The spot treatment contains 2% salicylic acid which is pretty much standard. It does have a scent, which is not strong and not overpowering. The scent doesn’t linger around after the application. It doesn’t sting or burn as other spot treatment would do (I have one that does). I applied it over nasty and cystic acne and overnight the inflammation reduced, no joke! I was applying the other stinging acne spot treatment for 3 days and the acne spot was still the same color and size. So peace out skincare acne serum is really helping with my breakouts. works on cystic acne spots
