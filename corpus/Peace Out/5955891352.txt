A staple in my skincare routine. Iâ€™ve always struggled with my pores especially on my nose. This is the best they have ever looked and it is thanks to these treatment strips! Every time I use them I am both excited and grossed out to see all the gunk it pulled out of my skin. The picture speaks for itself :-) I like to cut the rectangle strip and use it to extend the nose strip to my cheeks a little bit. absolutely essential
