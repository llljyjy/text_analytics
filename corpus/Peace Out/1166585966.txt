I really wanted to love this. I was so excited to buy it and try it it out but it was a complete disappointment for me. I am 40 and have puffy under eyes and hereditary darkness and I usually use shani darden or shisedo products under my eyes. I tried it and it seemed to be moisturizing but I woke up with my under eyes looking puffier and darker than before. I like to try things a few times to give them a fair review but this just seemed to accentuate my under eye issues no matter how I used it. I tried it on a relative and she had the same issue. It’s none irritating which is a plus but it just made my under eyes puffier. I know it works for a lot of people but not for me sadly. I wanted to love it …
