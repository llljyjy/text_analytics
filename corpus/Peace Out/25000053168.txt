This product was gifted to me in exchange for my honest opinions after using the product consistently for more than a week. That being said, I had high hopes for this product since I have sensitive, acne prone skin. I also have very dry skin so I love a good moisturizer. In general I think this is a decent moisturizer. I can’t say that it helped my acne at all unfortunately, because my hormonal acne can get kind of bad, which is a bummer. The one negative I have with this moisturizer is the natural scent. It’s technically fragrance free, but the scent of the product once it sinks into the skin is very strange like a musty/sour scent and it really makes me not want to use it. If scented skincare doesn’t bother you, and you don’t have bad acne, this would probably be a great fit for you. Not my fave, not the worst
