I love tranexamic acid serums so I jumped at the chance to try this! It’s very lightweight, non sticky or greasy, and has a very slight scent that dissipates quickly. The ingredients definitely work to lighten dark spots and give an even skin tone. I have also noticed less acne since I’ve incorporated this into my routine. I’m taking away a star because Peace Out suggests using twice a day and I do not agree.  I’ve been using every other night, seeing results, and keeping my skin barrier in tact. Great Serum!
