The serum glides on smoothly and I don’t notice the smell that other reviewers are mentioning. I’m very particular about fragrance too! This feels like an easy step between cleansing and moisturizing. I’m looking forward to less hyperpigmentation as I continue to use it. Peace Out products have always worked well on my skin and I’m not surprised that I like this one already. Love this so far!
