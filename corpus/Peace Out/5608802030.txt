This is such a unique product. I love the fact that the encapsulated retinol comes in a stick form. This makes it super ease for daily use and it is amazing because it keeps the product from being messy. Upon application the balm texture leaves the skin feeling hydrated. I also like that this product firms the eye and the retinol does not burn the eye area. This product is also ideal for travel and a great product for daily use. Plus the packaging is super cute!
