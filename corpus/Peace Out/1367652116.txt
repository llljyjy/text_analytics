Excellent product. I am used to using a serum based so a solid stick for the convenience of travel was just what I was looking for. After just a few uses my dehydration lines on my forehead have significantly reduced however the biggest change where the tiny lines I had developed around my mouth! Looking forward to continued improvements (Iâ€™ve only used it 3 times!). For anyone concerned about any tugging on the skin until the product warms up; either swipe it on the back of your hands or hold it in one spot on your forehead for a couple of seconds. It will glide easily after warming up with your body heat. Astonishing and Convenient
