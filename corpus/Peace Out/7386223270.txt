I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. I’ve never used retinol in this form (ie stick) but I have to say I’ve been enjoying it! It almost feels like a facial massage/gua sha when applying, which is a nice added bonus. I do think this is a more gentle formula (and it may take a while to soak in since it’s layered on top of other skincare steps), but I think it’s been a nice addition to my routine and that  and it’s be a great option for retinol beginners and/or travel. nan
