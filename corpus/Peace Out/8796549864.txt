I struggle with adult acne in my twenties, and have always been on the lookout for “miracle products”. Trust me when I tell you that this stuff works. I put a sticker on before going to bed, and when I wake up my pimple is flat and significantly less red. Sometimes it takes 2-3 wears before a pimple disappears completely. The sticker colour is not noticeable, I imagine that varies by skin tone though. All in all, highly recommend! This works!
