I feel like this should be advertised as the beginner’s retinol and perfect for anyone who hasn’t used retinol before. This convenient on the go stick tells you to apply it after your moisturizer which means it has a lot of “fighting through“ other products to get to your skin.  I would say that’s its probably not as effective given that (retinols are usually serums that allow deeper penetration).  It did not bother my skin at all and I would bring this when I travel. Its very easy to use and glides on well. I haven’t seen much change in my skin yet. I was gifted this product by Peace Out. nan
