I really enjoyed trying these. They were easy to apply and also they stayed on all night long. Removing them there was no film or anything left on my skin. They definitely took my blemish down and decreased the imflamation which lessened the time it took for my blemish to go away. Slso when the patch is on i didnt pick at it Overall I would definitely buy them again. Acne dots
