i do really like this stuff, it has a great texture, smooths and evens out my skin even before makeup, and makes my face feel really nice. the only issue I have is that you do need to use quite a bit of product to get the effects, and thereâ€™s so little in the tube. I wish it were filled more or the bottles were bigger. Other than that, a must have! works great, wish more came in each tube
