OH MY GOSH. I’m obsessed. I’ve been using these for over a year, but I just had to share these pics! I’ve been having the worst/most painful hormonal pimples. They feel so big and like deep in the skin. I did end up popping one, but then put the healing dot on to suck up all the gunk. I had two really bad pimples! LOOK AT WHAT IT PULLED OUT! I forgot to take an after pic of my face, and I’m wearing makeup now..but the pimples are flat now! Still some redness, but SO much better! Beyond thankful for these healing dots! Holy GUNK! Love these healing dots!!!!
