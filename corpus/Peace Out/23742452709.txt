I NEVER leave reviews but I just had to for this product! I started using it two weeks ago and my skin has honestly never looked better. It does smell like a dirty sock but once you get past the smell it’s amazing for your skin!! I used it in combination with an acne treatment called TactuPump (adapalene and benzoyl peroxide) that my dermatologist prescribed and my skin has honestly never looked better! I have always had dry patches no matter what moisturizer I would wear or which primer I would use before applying my makeup but now they’re gone and my skin looks dewy and clear! This is my new holy grail moisturizer and I will definitely be purchasing again :) BEST MOISTURIZER I HAVE EVER TRIED
