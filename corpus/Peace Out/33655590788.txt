I purchased this product for my 11year old who has started to get breakouts. I noticed the the redness in her face started going down after using it consistently for about a week. The only downside that she said she doesn’t like is the smell. She said that it has a weird smell to it but it goes away. Im glad because as soon as I heard her say that I thought it would discourage her from using it, but im glad she’s seen past it because I feel that it has been helping her. great product for my preteen!
