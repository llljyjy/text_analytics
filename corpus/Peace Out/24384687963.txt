First of all, I love the key ingredients of this product, especially the malic acid! The texture is surprisingly smooth and buttery in comparison to similar products from other brands. Also, it provides a pleasant cooling effect. The color provides great coverage for skin redness. The only thing I didnâ€™t enjoy was the scent. Perfect for redness
