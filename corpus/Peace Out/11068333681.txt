This retinol eye stick has retinol, peptides, and squalane to soften wrinkles. I haven’t been using it long, so I don’t expect to see any results yet, but it hasn’t caused any irritation. I’m very intrigued by the packaging. I’ve never seen an eye serum delivered in this way before. I like the fact that I don’t have to scoop this out of a jar with my finger or a spatula. The only drawback is that swiping it under my eye makes me nervous. I’ve been using it on a wrinkle I have between my eyebrows to get the product warm and then I dab it under eye. My guess is that it delivers less of the product that way, but I think it could still work out, just at a slower pace. Fantastic Ingredients
