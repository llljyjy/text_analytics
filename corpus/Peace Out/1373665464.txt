Peace out oil absorbing pore treatment strip does is good at removing sebum and oil from the skin. I place the strip right before bedtime and removed it in the morning. It is easy to apply and remove. Itâ€™s perfect for travel, when one needs a bit of help with congested skin. Complimentary from Peace Out (Sephora). nan
