I am absolutely obsessed with these pore strips !! I had gotten a sample of some of the acne healing dots & those worked wonders overnight, but my main issue is the black heads on my nose so when I saw these I instantly bought a pack. I saw someone say these are different than the dots but they seem to work very similarly. I had one on my nose & one on my chin for just an hour & could already see dirt & oil coming up through them. These definitely work & don’t hurt as bad to remove as some strips do. I saw some people said these didn’t work for them also but you have to do this on a clean dry face , without any products already on it. These are for overnight or you leave on for at least 4-6 hours so it does take some time for them to pull anything out. I put my on at 4pm & removed them at 8pm & they were both full of gunk, I could also see them continuing to pull some out as I was removing them. My face isn’t extremely clear as this was my first use but they definitely removed a lot you can tell where some areas are completely clear. definitely going to use another tomorrow night but i’ll do it while I sleep so it has longer to sit. Worth the price !! They really work !!
