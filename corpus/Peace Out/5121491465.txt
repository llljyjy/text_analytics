This product contains a whopping 10% AHA, so for those who are newer to using chemical exfoliants this might cause a slight tingling sensation. Please remember to use SPF the next morning too! Overall, my skin is loving the ingredients and has paired well with my regular nighttime routine products, which is always a plus. Absorbs well, no tackiness, and Iâ€™m very happy so far! nan
