When I first got the Instant Pore Perfector, I was a little hesitant to use it. It comes out as a thick brown paste like substance. But it was magic putting it on. It went on silky smooth and feels as if there is nothing there. (trust me, I keep touching my face to feel if I can feel it.) The brown paste smoothed out some of the redness. My only hint to those out there with drier skin....use a little bit of moisturizer first, otherwise it can pill and not rub in as smoothly. It did this a little by my chin, but I grabbed a little bit more product, which did the trick. nan
