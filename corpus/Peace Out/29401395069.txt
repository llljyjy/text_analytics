#gifted I’ve enjoyed trying the Peace Out Instant Pore Perfector. It has kind of a tinted cast, when applying. It dries quickly. It has a thicker consistency. I’d liken it to a clay consistency. It is scentless. It does create a smoother appearance. I can’t say it’s an extreme pore correction, but there is an improved, smoother appearance. Not only is it a smoothing result, but it has beneficial skincare ingredients such as hyaluronic acid, niacinamide and mushroom extract. Overall, I think there is a benefit to using this product. Its packaging is beautiful. Would recommend! Effective for skin smoothing!
