I received this product complimentary from Peace Out Skincare. I was excited to try this new product to help with my sun spots and discoloration on my skin. It’s not bad, but noticeable in certain areas and enough to bother me. I’ve been using this serum for awhile now and have noticed some amazing changes. My skins texture is better and so much smoother. My dark spots have definitely faded some, and I’m hoping with more use goes away completely.  Also my skin is much brighter and has a beautiful natural glow to it. I use this at night, and in the morning my face looks refreshed and rejuvenated. I will definitely be continuing to use this product. Dark spots be gone!!!
