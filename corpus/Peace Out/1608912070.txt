Gifted by Peace Out Skincare.  I had the opportunity to try this duo, and I can honestly say, I would only purchase one of them in the future.  I liked the Retinol Eye Stick.  I love the ease of the product, and not getting my hands full of product with application.  I would definitely buy that again.  As for the face stick, my face just felt way too greasy/oily after use.  I was afraid to sleep with it on, as my pillow would have been a mess.  I could possibly continue use on my neck, but it wasnâ€™t great on my face. I liked the Eye Stick!
