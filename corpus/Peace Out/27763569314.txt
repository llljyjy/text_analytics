Wooohoo, I am so happy to received a complimentary from Peace Out Skincare. I am absolutely in love with this Peace Out Retinol Eye Stick. It’s super sleek, easy to bring anywhere I go, travelling friendly. I really impressed how it works, this product is super easy to use, I love the main ingredient of this product, it contains retinol, which I’m a big fan of, it helps my under eye area to brightened up, feeling soft and smooth. I only need a lil amount of product to use in my skincare routine. I highly recommend the product. I love this product!
