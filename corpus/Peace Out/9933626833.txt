I have tried literally every medical grade eye cream you can think of and ALL of them have given me milia in the under eye area. It is super frustrating and annoying. I even tried SKKN by Kim desperate to find something and it gave me the biggest milia to date. But within a week of using this, my milia are shrinking and improving. I love this stuff! holy grail
