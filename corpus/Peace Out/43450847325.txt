I’m fairly new to skincare as a guy, but I’m trying to figure out stuff fast because I want my skin looking healthier and quick. I got this salicylic acid acne serum to help my breakouts a couple weeks ago. I’ve been putting it on once a day, because my skin is sensitive, and it’s really made a difference in my skin redness and has cut down on spots and breakouts noticeably already. I recommend it highly for all the guys and gals and non-binary pals out there! Good stuff, highly recommended
