Best part about this product is that it actually works,  surprisingly. BUT! It’s a very temporary fix.  It fades fine lines for about a day, then you’re back to square one without nightly use.Which leads me to the worst part of this product... the price! It’s ridiculous that you have to pay nearly $30 for a measly 6 stickers. That doesn’t last you a week if you really wanna see results.  It’s virtually the same price for a full bottle of product.So yeah,  it does work,  but only if you use it every night,  which would be a huge blow to my wallet! As much as I swear by Peace Out’s pimple stickers,  I’m afraid I’m gonna have to pass on this product. It works... for a day.
