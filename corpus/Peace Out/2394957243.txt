Ok so I use this a little differently. Of course I put it on my eyes, as a buffer for my daily tret routine. Also my eyes like a little extra barrier before bed and this does the trick. Eyelids, under eyes, and outer wrinkly spots. Now here’s the ticket, I also use it on my lips before bed. I started noticing a smokers-like line on the left side of my lip, prob from drinking water out of a straw all day. So I started putting this on my lips, focusing on my upper border (and got a new container for water lol) and I’ve noticed an improvement. I have extremely dry finicky skin and this has never led to any irritation even when using it on such sensitive spots. Love it! Good for eyes AND LIPS!
