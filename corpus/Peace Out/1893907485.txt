These are definitely not the pore strips you are used to getting from a drug-store. They have to be worn for at least 6 hrs, so be prepared to sleep or not see the public for awhile. I have oily skin and while the strips did absorb the oil, they didn’t quite pull out the impurities. The surface of my nose needed to be extracted before going out the next morning. While my pores did look smaller, it was just a different experience than what I was expecting out of a pore strip. Absorbs oil and that’s about it
