I have been thoroughly enjoying this dark spot serum. I have combination-oily, acne-prone skin and after a breakout, my skin definitely shows more pigmentation in the areas of the breakouts. While I haven’t been using this long enough to see how it helps with pre-existing spots (those tend to be harder to fade), I have found in the past few weeks of using this that new breakouts don’t leave spots that last as long! I feel like it is a little more intense than other serums i’ve used, so I apply it every other night. The brand recommends to use it twice a day which I would disagree with, so I am removing one star from my review. I feel that using it twice a day would damage the skin barrier and hurt more than help. It is slightly sticky but the feeling goes away after applying a moisturizer. Overall I am happy with this product and will continue to use it. Great for acne and spots
