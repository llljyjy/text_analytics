This serum has a very strong chemical/BO smell to it. It’s so strong that I can’t even bare to use it on my face. I’ve tired the texture out on the backs of my hands, and it does have a very silky texture that sinks into the skin nicely. It does not have a tacky finish and I love that it’s packaged in a pump. However, I cannot get over the strong scent. I don’t now if I got a bad batch, but I can’t imagine this being on my face and the smell does not go away. It’s been on my hands for about 30 minutes and I can still smell the horrible scent. Sadly this is a pass for me and I can’t even try it out on the dark spots on my face. Smells like BO
