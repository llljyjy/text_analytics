This is the second serum from Peace Out Acne that I’ve tried and I must say I love it. The tranexamic acid and AHA blend are powerhouse ingredients that work so well together and aren’t too strong for sensitive skin. I have only been using this serum for a couple days so I will have to stay consistent to notice results, but I am pretty sure I’ve already noticed fading on an old acne scar I’ve had for a while.
