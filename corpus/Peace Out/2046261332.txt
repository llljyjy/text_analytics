I received this from Peace Out Skincare complimentary for a honest review. I have been using this dark spot serum for about two weeks, at night time before my face oil (or moisturizer/cream). It’s lightweight and absorbed into my skin nicely. It does seem to make my complexion brighter. However, I haven’t seen differences on my sun/dark spots yet. I will need to continue using this longer to see. Brightens my Complexion
