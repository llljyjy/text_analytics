I wish the instructions had been a little clearer - you need to pop your pimple BEFORE putting on a dot. The dots are a good size and stick very well, but if you don’t have a great seal they don’t really work. Otherwise, it’s pretty satisfying to put on a dat and wake up and see how much gunk has been sucked out. nan
