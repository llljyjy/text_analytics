It is my first time using this Retinol stick product and from my experience I must say that it is very easy to use. You just have to open it and spread it all over your face without having to use your hands. My skin feels very moisturized and certain age lines look more diffuse with prolonged use of the product. I must also add that my face looks firmer than before. and because of this my skin looks more radiant and without leaving that greasy effect that other brands leave. My recommendation is that you always wash your face with your Cleanser before using it. Good Product
