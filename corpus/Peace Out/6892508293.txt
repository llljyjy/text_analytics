I like the texture, it’s not heavy or extremely sticky at all, the smell completely threw me off, it’s super weird and I just can’t describe it, I’m still testing it but so far so good! The ingredients are magnificent, It’s definitely a product that takes time but it does a good job for sure, it was gifted by peace out skincare It’s alright
