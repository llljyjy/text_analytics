I was a bit skeptical about this product at first because I had literally given up on trying to fix my dark circles that had gotten worse after I had Covid. But this product works like magic! I have used it for a few days and I can see a major improvement in my dark circles, the fine lines will take a bit more time I guess but I really wish I had taken a before and after photo for this one.  Given that I have never used a product with retinol before, my skin seemed to adjust to it pretty well. It did not dry out my skin either. Itâ€™s a 10/10 for me. Thank you for making this, peace out!
