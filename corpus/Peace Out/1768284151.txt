Great ingredients, great formula. Layers very well, doesn’t pill when I dab some oil over it unlike other moisturizers I have. Also, great price! Will repurchase as I’m scraping the bottom of my first bottle. Only con is the smell, not pleasant, but doesn’t last, dissipates between 5-15mins. Will repurchase!
