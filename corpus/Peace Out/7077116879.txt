I’ve used the regular dots in the past and repurchased many times because I honestly think they’re the best hands down. I adore these new sheer/thinner ones!! They’re basically not noticeable at all unless someone is right up in your face so you definitely could easily wear makeup over it but I honestly prefer wearing them when I’m running errands or out and about no makeup as they’re not visible! nan
