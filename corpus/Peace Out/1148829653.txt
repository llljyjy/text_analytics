This serum combines a blend of AHAs and actives to target hyperpigmentation! Being a dark skinned girl, I’ve always struggled with discolorations on certain areas of my face (mouth area, cheeks and forehead) so I was super excited to try this. It’s also a Clean at Sephora product + affordable!! Anyways, this serum feels thin, and once applied takes about 5 mins to fully absorb. I didn’t notice any harsh smell to it either..it’s very  gentle on the skin which I love (I didn’t get any irritation using it).. my troubled hyperpigmentation areas def improved (got lighter) a little after using it for a few weeks..can’t wait to see more results with continuous use. Actually works!
