I have been using this product for about two months and have felt no changes. Pros Nice packagingConsDoes not help with dark circles (probably makes them worst)Does not glide on smoothly, even if you warm it up on the back of your hand. Leaves your under eyes dry and chapped next morning.I regret buying this. nan
