I have been using this face stick for more than a week now. This balm stick with soft fruity scents, glide easily and smooths out my skin. It melts into my dry skin with no sticky feel. My skin looks super hydrated as you can see in my picture there is a significant difference. It’s very easy to apply, mess-free, convenient, and perfect for traveling. I’m also using it to touch up the dry skin patches on my face. The best part is it works reducing the appearance of my fine lines. I used it in my pm routine before bedtime, I woke up to a dewy, fresh, and hydrated skin with no breakout. I love and recommend it! It works, mess free and travel friendly
