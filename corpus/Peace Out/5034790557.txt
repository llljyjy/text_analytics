FINALLY found my HG moisturizer, this has helped my skin so much, I think it truly has been repairing my moisture barrier. This doesnt make my skin oily, its helped reduce redness, and reduce breakouts!! perfect for oily skin and normal skin types for sure lightweight, hydrating, perfect for oily skin!!!
