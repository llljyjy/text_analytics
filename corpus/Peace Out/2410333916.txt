I don’t have acne, but bought this product to try on the occasional deep blemish on my back, where I can’t reach to deal with it effectively. I tried three different blemishes, and left the dots on overnight. When I took the dots off in the morning, I had red circles where they had been, but these faded. However, keep that in mind if you want to apply the dots to your face. The red marks are why I removed one star. The dots worked well to pull “gunk“ out of the blemishes, and in fact, I found that the worse the blemish, the better the results. The blemishes were much less sore and swollen after I took the dots off. They dried out and healed more quickly than usual. I recommend using these on your worst blemishes - given the price point, and that they’re less effective on smaller eruptions, save them for where you really need them. nan
