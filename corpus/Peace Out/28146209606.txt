I love the packaging, as it comes in this handy, mess-free, stick format. I have used a lot of eye creams, serums, etc., in the past trying to find one with the right active ingredients that will help the early signs of aging as I just turned 30. When I started using the Peace Out Retinol Eye Stick, I immediately knew I found the holy grail. I use this at night after cleansing around my entire eye area. Start off using a small amount before increasing the usage to make sure there is no sensitivity. I made my way to using this into my AM routine as well. This helps hydrate, smooth fine lines, help with firmness and dark circles. I noticed my skin feels brighter. I am enthusiastic about continuing to use this product so I can see the ongoing improving results! Amazing!
