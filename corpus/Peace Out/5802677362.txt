My journey to this product started with me liking the their blemish balm, then I added the acne serum to my routine and when I finally figured out that the moisturizer I was using was causing me to break out I stopped using that and decided to give this moisturizer a try. Doesn’t break me out, leaves face feeling moisturized, great moisturizer to wear if you need to wear a face mask. I’ve heard a few people complain about the smell but I honestly don’t think it smells bad, there’s nothing wrong with the scent. If you have oily and acne prone skin I would definitely recommend you trying this moisturizer; in fact try the balm and serum out too! Peace Out is really a great brand! Awesome!!!
