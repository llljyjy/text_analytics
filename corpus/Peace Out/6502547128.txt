Really love this product and that it’s a primer plus skincare. I like it for my t zone because it’s fairly matte and seems to reduce shine in oily areas. It’s very smooth on my skin and you only need a tinyyy bit. I do like using a more luminous primer on my cheekbones but I’ve been using this every day on my nose, chin, and forehead and love how it looks and reduces redness so I don’t even need concealer or foundation in those areas! Matte and smooth - great for oily skin
