Love the ingredients on this one! I get breakouts from time to time and they always leave a dark mark that takes a while to fade. I’m definitely a fan of the ingredients and the texture of this product. It’s very lightweight and it incorporates nicely with my other products. However, I don’t like the scent. It’s quite potent, but it does fade quickly after application. The price of this product is also really fair, especially for the type of product it is, so definitely worth a try if this is what you’re looking for. nan
