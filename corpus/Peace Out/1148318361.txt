I received this product as a sample and really loved the consistency! It went on smooth and when worn with makeup, my tinted moisturizer definitely went on smoother. I didn’t notice a huge difference on days I didn’t wear makeup, but I think the product is still worth it to swap in for a primer. Easy to apply under makeup!
