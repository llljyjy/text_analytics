I’m really impress with this! After my first use, I could already tell a difference in my skin. My skin was a lot brighter the next day,texture minimized, and bumps are just smoothed down way more. It is a bit strong though for me, so I’d only see myself using this maybe 1-2 times a week. My old PIE/PIH scars (that I’ve had for a few years) were a lot less red and dark looking. Could definitely notice a difference in acne scars and I’m just so impressed with how effective this was. It does sting a tiny bit at first but it isn’t drying to my skin, it soaks in well and quickly. Overall, I could see myself getting it again and can’t wait to see more results! Effective even on old scars!
