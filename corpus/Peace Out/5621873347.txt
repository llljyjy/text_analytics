I absolutely love these healing dots. As someone with sensitive skin and eczema, these helped eliminate even the most stubborn pimples by reducing swelling and redness. I just wish they came in 100 dot packs or were a bit larger. Sometimes I have pimple clusters and have to use multiple dots to tackle the area. nan
