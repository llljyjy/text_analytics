I had such great results with this cleansing balm. I was having some mild break outs around my jawline and my skin seemed to be oilier than usual. After using this for three weeks my skin was completely cleared up, ph level evened out and it even got rid of the occasional blackheads I get on my nose. My skin is so incredibly soft now too. I use it every night as part of my double cleanse routine. A little bit goes a long way. It’s very reasonably priced and is A good size. It helps with a myriad of issues and has many great ingredients.  It does have an exfoliator in the balm but it’s mild. I just opened my second container and still using it everyday. This is now a staple in my skin care routine. Now a staple in my skin care routine
