This is my first review ever on Sephora… this product is just that good! I started developing cystic acne for two years now. I discovered this product couple weeks back and let me tell you I am never living without these. They flatten the open pimple overnight! I wash my face and wait for it to be dry, delicately poke the cyst with a sterilized needle (I am extra careful) and then stick one of these dots on the cyst. I wake up to almost all the gunk out. Please note that I am not a doctor so be careful! Also, yes, they are expensive, but believe me that they’re the best. I tried other brands thinking they’re all the same, but no. None compare to the ingredients and efficiency of peace out. They’re absolutely lifesaver for me. They’re simply the best and stick very well into your skin compared to all the brands (they won’t come off overnight). I am okay with paying extra if it works. Just make sure 1) the pimple you want to cover is open and 2) the surface you’re sticking the dot on is dry if you want it to stick all day/night. Must buy!
