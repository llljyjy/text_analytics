I have been using the Dark Spots Serum that Peace Out gifted me and here is my review. First, my skin is super pale and everything shows on my face. I have freckles, some sun damage & post acne scaring. This contains so so many fabulous ingredients to fade dark spots. I have normal but sensitive skin so I was really hoping this wouldn’t be too harsh. This isn’t harsh at all and although I haven’t been using this long enough to see any long term results, I do think it’s made my skin tone more even and brighter. Be aware that this combination of ingredients do make the have a slight sour scent but it dissipates. Sensitive skin
