I’ve bought 3 boxes of this product already I cant get enough!! I get frequent pimples and they usually will take a week to a week and a half to heal, every since I started using these patches they go down and heal within 3-5 days. Just like the product states, I would recommend applying these once you notice the pimple has a head already, if it just barely appeared and is still somewhat flat, its not going to do anything as there is nothing to absorb. Also if you have pale skin like me, acne usually leaves me with a slightly pink/red scar, this doesn’t prevent that. It simply drains the pimple and makes it go away faster. Which is great for me too since my pimples tend to swell a lot. Just follow the instructions and I’m sure it’ll work for you too, remember to only apply to clean skin, BEFORE skin care. When you take one off, clean the area as it’ll leave some glue residue and apply again immediately. Some ppl probably don’t apply as often so they can save product but really it’ll only work if you keep using one after another. A little costly but worth it in my opinion. But for that reason I wouldnt recommend this to someone with a lot of acne. You’d be having to buy so many boxes. Even treating two pimples at once for myself I feel I use them up pretty quickly. nan
