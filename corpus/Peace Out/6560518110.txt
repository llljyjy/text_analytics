I actually love this product, it was my first ever used from the Peace Out brand. I use this to help with my acne (I’m a 20 y/o with very acne-prone skin) and it does a WONDERFUL job of essentially erasing my zits. The formula is very balmy, which is likely why a lot of other users dislike the “greasy” texture associated with it (since it’s a water-free formula); it frankly does not bother me that much, but I can see why someone would dislike the feeling or have very oily skin and not want to use it. However, it’s the last step in my nighttime routine and I always allow some time for it to sink into my skin before actually going to bed, so that helps with keeping the product on me. I actually love this (and rebought)
