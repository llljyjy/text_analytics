A new holy grail product. This serum goes on so smoothly and it works like a champ. Calming, curing, brightening. I love that this serum fights current acne and keep your skin clear. Even after a few days, I’ve seen my complexion improve— it’s clearer, brighter, and  softer. The texture is lightweight, smooth, and it easily absorbs into the skin. And I love that it had salicylic acid and niacinamide in it too. A great product for keeping your skin clear, while also brightening it with Vitamin C. This product was gifted by Peace Out Skincare, but I will certainly buying it again when this one finishes. nan
