I have worked in cosmetics for 15 years. My skin has broken out consistently since I turned 18 and I’m 35 now. I started with this moisturizer and the cleansing balm and my skin feels so moisturized, yet not greasy and the pimples are so rare now- I am blown away! I also have the retinol stick for face and dark spot serum and love those too! I don’t notice a smell at all and I’m on my 4th bottle. I will never be without this! I always wanted to scrub and exfoliate to treat the acne but this did the job without the irritation. I bought the acne dots and haven’t even needed to use them! Very happy girl here!! After 15 years of acne- I finally found it!
