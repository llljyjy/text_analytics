I received Peace Out Retinol Face Stick as a gift by the brand. At first, I found it hard to apply on face because it is not moisture enough to directly apply on skin and it sits there. However, I apply on the back of my hands and warm it up first, then patch on skin, it is much better. My skin feels smooth and not greasy when using this method to apply. nan
