I really love this retinol face stick. It’s so easy to apply and glides so easily on my skin.  I like that it’s a stick because it lets me target the areas that really need it. Stays on all night and my skin feels smoother in the morning. I also had no irritation. I’ve been using it for about a week and can already see a difference on my forehead. Will continue using and I’m sure I’ll see better results the longer I use it.  Gifted by Peace Out. Awesome face stick
