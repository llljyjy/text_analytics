I haven’t used these as consistently as I probably should in order to see thorough  results. But even with that being said, I have been able to see a difference in my deep forehead lines that I have had for years! I was extremely self conscious of my forehead because at 25 I noticed VERY deep forehead lines, not just wrinkles. These patches aren’t miracle workers but over time and a few months I have definitely noticed a more shallow look and feel to my lines. This has definitely increased my self confidence and sometimes I forget I even have them until I get closer to the mirror. So not some crazy miracle product but very very good and I’m thankful I’ve found them! Not a miracle worker but pretty darn good
