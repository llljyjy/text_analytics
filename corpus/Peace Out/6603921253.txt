This was an amazing product.  I’m 48, I don’t look my age yet and I want to stay that way for a while.  My eyes are aging faster than the rest of me though.  So I really wanted to try this product.  So far I’m not disappointed at all.  It is in the directions to warm the stick of you have issues with tugging, I recommend this,  as it is a bit hard to smooth on cold.  It is amazing though and doesn’t have a bad smell.  I found it to be soft and a bit weird to get used to at first.  I actually like the way my skin feels after using it.  I feel 10 yrs younger already. Seriously amazing!
