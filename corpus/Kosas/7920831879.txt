As a licensed esthetician in the beauty industry, I’m excited to share my professional opinion about the Kosas Plump & Juicy Lip Booster Buttery Lip Buttery Treatment. I wear some kind of lip treatment every day. If it is not lip balm, it is lip gloss (which is my favorite)! The way this buttery lip treatment feels on your lips once you apply it...seriously like butter. Instantly you feel like your lips are revived. There is no stickyness to the gloss like most lip treatments have, which is a plus for me! It doesn’t really do much plumping but my lips do feel moisturized, smooth, soft, less flaky, less irritated and soothed and I think that is what can give you the look of a plumped lip. I would highly recommend using this alone or even on top of a lipstick if you want to add some shine! nan
