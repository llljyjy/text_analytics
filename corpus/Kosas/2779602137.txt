I love everything I’ve tried from Kosas, it’s a clean brand with fun packaging and it’s great quality. Learning about this product, I was so excited to try. The concept of a spray serum after washing, to capitalize on the magic minute after washing that skin is most open to receive product is genius. I love this glass bottle, it’s gorgeous packaging and feels expensive. Love that this is a collagen serum as well. I love spraying it on, it’s so convenient. Unfortunately I didn’t feel a huge difference nor did I see one. I felt more of a difference with my rose water spray. I am oily-combo, and I did feel some hydration boost but nothing very dramatic. I hate to say, but my honest opinion was that it’s just okay. It has amazing ingredients like vegan collagen, peptides, and hyaluronic acid, so it would be great to replace a set of products as it’s all in one, maybe you will have a better result! Interesting concept
