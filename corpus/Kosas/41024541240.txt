What a great product for adding plumpness and hydration to a dry oily face! I do not have a spray serum in my regular routine but after trying this product, I think I have one now. As a beauty expert, I really like to find beautiful products in industry from my clients. I enjoyed the lightweight mist on my face from this product. No sticky or film feeling after letting the product dry on my face. I tried the product before makeup and after makeup and found that my face gets juicier results when the serum is sprayed on after makeup is applied. I love the packaging of this product and it seems to be the right size for adding to my makeup kit. I tried the product mostly during the day, but it can be applied for your night ritual for adding that firmness while you sleep. Plump and Spray
