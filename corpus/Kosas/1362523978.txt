This Kosas spray on serum is a little bottle of sunshine. The glass bottle is gorgeous and I am in love with the sunset color. The serum sprays out evenly in a super fine mist. This is a great all around serum for balancing and hydration. This would be great during a facial treatment for the dehydrated client as well as in those drier climates. The product is unscented and the absorbs into the skin easily. This serum is appropriate for all skin types and can be used morning and evening. The ingredients really deliver with peptides, hyaluronic acid, vegan collagen and probiotics. The product is easy to use and leaves the skin with a lovely dewy glow. I love this for the client who wants a quick routine that delivers. Kosa brings us another great product here nan
