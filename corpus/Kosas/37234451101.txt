As a makeup artist and skincare specialist, I always look forward to learning about and trying new and innovative products! I was recently introduced to a new product by Kosas. I was given the opportunity to try their new Plump & Juicy Spray- on Serum. This spray-on serum was designed to hydrate, firm, lift and plump your skin. It is dermatologist tested. Even the most sensitive skins can use. What I like is that it contains a vegan collagen and it is a probiotic serum. Itâ€™s to be used twice a day on a clean skin followed by your regular skincare regime. I starting using the spray-on serum and could see and feel how refreshing it felt. My skin felt soft and smooth as well as hydrated. I noticed firmness and plumping to my skin. I really like this spray- on serum! I am a little disappointed at how strong the force of the spray is. Other than that, I highly recommend this plump & juicy spray-on serum! I highly recommend this spray-on serum!
