This is still a fairly new brand for me, so I was excited to try this serum! The vibrant packaging already captured my attention as did the brand’s commitment to clean beauty…I just needed the product itself to wow me. This vegan collagen spray boasts of its probiotics and ingredients that encourage hydrated, firm, and more supple skin.  First, I thoroughly appreciated the spray application which allowed me to minimize waste and take it on-the-go if desired. Upon first use, I was impressed with how refreshing it was! It’s cool and lightweight with a very subtle scent. After spritzing it onto clean skin, it absorbed nicely and prepped my skin well to receive my other skincare products. I used this serum in both my morning and night routine for several weeks, and although I do notice a more hydrated and supple complexion, I can’t help but feel as though it’s missing something. Be that as it may, I would consider this a well rounded product. I’ve been in the beauty industry for about a decade, so I’ve used my fair share of serums. This one would be great for those with normal to dry skin that would like to integrate a serum into their routine, but may not know where to start or don’t want to use any active ingredients to get results. Not awful…
