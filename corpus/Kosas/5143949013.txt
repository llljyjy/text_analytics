I have been a licensed Esthetician for over four years and a Registered Nurse for over 30 years and am always looking for products and cosmetics to improve my personal appearance as well as my skin health. My appearance is very important to me as far as my clients first impression.  I try all products on myself before I recommend to my clients based on skin type so I know how it looks feels and smells. Kosas is a great product line that is clean and proven product line that is great for sensitive skin and feels really good on your face. Kosas Plump and Juicy is one of the first Collagen spray on serums I have ever tried.  It does not disappoint. Some of its great ingredients, that help it give great results are Hyaluronic Acid, Artemisia flower extract for soothing effects and plant probiotics to balance the skin barrier. And what I like best is it is so easy to apply and does not contain alcohol which can dry the skin. I would recommend this for all my clients and all skin types for at home use. Love this Spray Serum
