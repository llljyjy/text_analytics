Kosas does it again! First of all, the packaging is beautiful and doesn’t feel like a cheap bottle. It also looks so pretty sitting on my bathroom vanity. Ok, now for the actual product itself...the serum is a wonderfully lightweight and hydrating formula. I love the versatility of the product! It works as a traditional serum underneath a moisturizer or over your moisturizer for an extra dose of hydration. You can also use it as a face mist throughout the day to post radiance and hydration for skin-great for the upcoming winter months when indoor heating can dry your skin out. As a professional makeup artist, I love how nicely this worked as a skincare prep spray on my clients before makeup application. Since Kosas is a consciously clean brand, I know the ingredients in this vegan-collagen probiotic serum are safe for all skin types, including my most sensitive clients. I also loved how well it worked as a resetting spray because of its even spray application-it doesn’t spit out big blobs like many face sprays but provides a clean, even application. Last pro tip: I have also been using this to refresh the face gel while using my facial microcurrent device. It’s the perfect extra dose of skincare! Best Spray Serum!
