Want to add something to your routine that will benefit your skin immediately after cleansing? This serum helped my skin recover post-laser, and nearly a month later, I’m still impressed. As a professional skincare writer, I scrutinize ingredient lists. Everything in this serum worked for me during recovery, and here’s what you should know:+Super Soothing on Sensitized Skin – Even though I have normal skin, I recently had to switch skincare products to care for my freshly lasered face. This spray-on serum has artemisia extract (known to many K-beauty fans as mugwort). It’s a go-to in my routine because I usually use Retin A, and the Kosas serum calmed my inflammation and redness. If you have sensitive skin or a damaged moisture barrier, you’ll be able to use this without a problem. I began using it one week post-procedure, and there was no stinging or irritation, just pure bliss.+Top Notch Hydrator – If you’re not a fan of moisturizing toner, you can capture that “magic minute” post-cleanse by spritzing on this serum while your skin is still damp. The plumping peptides and balancing probiotics work best on damp skin, which helps your skin use those actives better. I applied one layer after cleansing and then another after applying my hyaluronic acid serum to boost it since lasered skin is incredibly dry. The fine mist atomizer won’t leave wet spots on your face, and the spray isn’t sticky. + Bonus Points for the Sensory Experience – On top of how plump and firm my skin feels, I adore the scent of the hibiscus extract. It reminds me of jasmine blossoms with hints of bee pollen/honey. There’s nothing added here or artificial, just beautiful ingredients that leave me feeling happy and loved. Truly Makes That “Magic Minute” Count
