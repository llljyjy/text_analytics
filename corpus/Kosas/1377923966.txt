Kosas Plump & Juicy Lip Booster Buttery Lip Buttery Treatment was created by someone ( Sheena Yaitanes ) who wanted makeup to feel comfy, looks beautiful and her belief that makeup is an opportunity to take care of your skin meaning that products are loaded with clean healthy effective ingredients. This Plump & Juicy Lip Booster Buttery Lip Buttery Treatment is packed with collagen boosting and fatty acids to hydrate and plump lips. This also has jojoba oil thus it moisturizes and nourishes dry lips. This is plumping, reparative and my lips definitely needed this. This was not sticky at all. No tingling with this one. It is clear. Kosas recommend using this ay night time and when you get out of bed but I use this all day long. I love it. My lips are more hydrated, and softer. Soft pillowy are the words I would use. You could have long wear with this and with the lip oil over it. I also use a tiny bit over certain lipstick that are drying and my lips look pillowy, live this product Love this juicy treatment
