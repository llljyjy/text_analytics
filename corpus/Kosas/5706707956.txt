Okay first things first. This smells bad. Like a women’s restroom bad. I do think it adds a nice plumping however, unless you have a long time between spraying this and doing the rest of your morning routine, it does weird stuff to your make up. I’ve resorting to just using it at night which is annoying for the price. Pass ($$, Smells Bad, Doesn't work under makeup)
