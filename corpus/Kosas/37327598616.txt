Kosas‚Äô newest product introduces us to a different way of applying serum and having our skin drink it up. The company claims this delivery system makes the product more bio available.  I love mists and spray on toners, this is my first spray-on serum and I‚Äôm all for this trend, especially this skin-changing one. I was tempted to use this all over and not just on my facial skin.  It‚Äôs refreshing and so hydrating. This was the perfect time for me to try this product, as we‚Äôre transitioning from heat to cooler weather. My skin quickly absorbed this blend of peptides (amino acids that plump and help protect the moisture barrier), probiotics to aid the flora on the skin),Artemis is flower extract (soothes), and hyaluronic acid (hydrates).  There are a lot of benefits packed into this clean, vegan formulation. I usually like a weightier serum fit my skin, but this was a lovely finish.  My skin felt plumper and stayed that way for hours, with or without follow-up products. I was lured by the comforting formula and wanted to spray it on throughout the day. It‚Äôs best on freshly cleansed skin, so I used it morning and night after cleansing and exfoliating. The major benefit I loved was calm skin and it was a cumulative effect. It took my redness right down. Look at the picture. No filter, no makeup!  I would normally never want my naked skin out there, but it looks normal!  The name Kosas comes from the philosophy of the five interconnected layers, or ‚Äúkosas‚Äù of the self: the physical, energetic, mental, intellectual and soul. This product is a beautiful fulfillment of this. I‚Äôve been an esthetician for almost  30 years and I love the discoveries I‚Äôm making for my and my client‚Äôs skin. Go get this for yourself! Latest and greatest serum from Kosas.üå∫
