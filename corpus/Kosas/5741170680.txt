As a beauty retail expert who has been in the industry for over 8 years, I am impressed by the quality of products Kosas has to offer. Their latest invention is the spray-on Vegan Collagen probiotic serum which provides intense hydration to your skin. It has active ingredients which help soothe any redness in your skin. The Collagen in the serum helps keep your skin looking plump and smooth. Let us talk about the packaging first because it stands out by itself. Kosas has some of the cutest packaging in the market for their products. The packaging captivates your eye and makes you want to take the product home. The spray is extremely convenient to use. In todayâ€™s world, a lot of times we skip on skincare rituals due to the amount of time and effort it requires. Kosas has made one step extremely easy for all of us by making a product in spray form. A few sprays all over your face and neck make the application super easy. It is great for all skin types as it is Hypoallergenic, non-acnegenic and dermatologist tested. Ninety-five percent of the ingredients used to make this serum are all naturally derived.
