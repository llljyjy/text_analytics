I really enjoyed using this spray serum for the last few weeks! I am seeing more companies are looking to advance their products by introducing prebiotics to the skin to respect the skins microbiome. Part of having healthy skin is having a healthy microbiome--that super thin but protective layer of good bacteria, lipid barrier and acid mantle that you can’t see with the human eye. When my clients have come in with a damaged barrier or microbiome, it usually tells me they can benefit from a product like this that offers prebiotics. When I fist started using this, I started with a mere 2-3 sprays, but eventually found that about 5-6 sprays was the perfect amount for me. I always chose to wear this on clean skin before my serum and moisturizer. My skin instantly felt comfortable—and being acneic I am always aware of how products are making my skin feel. I did not feel at any point my skin felt heavy or weighed down by this. It is super light, with soothing artemisiah flower extract and hydrating with our favorite hyaluronic acid! For this being labeled as a serum, I would consider this to be even lighter like a sprayable essence. I can’t see this as a stand-alone item because I feel like most people dry/combo/oily/acneic would need additional products afterwards to continue the comfort. I loved the color as it is the most vibrant of all my skincare at the moment! And it has that very familiar Kosas scent; think rosewater. Overall, I would rate this as a 3.5/4 star product because I loved how comfortable my skin felt while using it, but the comfort will go away in a few minutes if more hydration hasn’t been applied on top. Great for those who love facial mists
