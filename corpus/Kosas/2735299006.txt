Hello again beauties! The kosas plump and juicy vegan collagen spray on serum total skin reset is a super spray. This firming vegan collagen is delivered in an innovative, spritz spray. It is an exciting and useful product for anyone and is safe for those with sensitive skin. Probiotics in skin care is very trendy currently, and this total skin reset spray soothes, strengthens, and synthesizes hydrating and healthy skin.Overall, the product worked quickly and effectively at providing hydration to even my driest areas of skin. I tend to get really ashy and scaly on my shins. The spray is extremely convenient which is my favorite highlight from this Kosas product. The only drawback is that the spray on serum does have a strong, initial smell. The smell does fade within a couple of minutes as the serum absorbs into the skin.The directions do recommend that you shake the product well prior to spraying. So make sure to perform this step to avoid clumping. Overall: a four-star product that is innovative and effective at providing healthier looking skin with vegan ingredients A spectacular spray serum
