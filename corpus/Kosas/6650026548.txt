I was super excited about this product but sad to say it fell flat. As other reviewers have mentioned, it leaves a gross taste in your mouth after applying. I try to only apply it on the outer part of my lips to avoid it going in my mouth, but it still tends to happen after a while. If it weren’t for that, it’s a fine lip product that imparts a pretty, glossy look and has a good applicator. Does not noticeably plump my lips, but I liked the ingredients that are supposed to be in it. Considered returning it, but I’ll probably just keep it and not repurchase in the future. It's ok
