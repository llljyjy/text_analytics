I love the thought of a spray on serum. Its genius! The Kosas Plump + Juicy Vegan Collagen Spray-On Serum felt amazing morning and night. My skin feels instantly refreshed, soothed and so hydrated like I could skip the moisturizer, of course I don’t. But what a great product. Its vegan, cruelty free with amazing ingredients to firm, lift and plump. I can tell it rebalances by skin because I’m not as oily throughout the day. It comes in a nice size 100 ml/3.38 fl oz glass bottle! Its priced a little high for me but its well worth it. It’s out of stock for a reason! It mists perfectly and light - super lux packaging. You don’t need much. I give a couple of shakes and mist my entire face, neck and chest. The scent is natural and fresh. There’s no added fragrance. I love this clean brand! I’d recommend this serum for all skin types. I didn’t have any negative reactions, just lovely radiant skin. I have nothing bad to say about this product. Just go get yourself a bottle! I’ve been in the beauty industry for 30+ years. Within that time, I’ve worked for a handful of cosmetic and skincare brands. I worked as a cosmetologist for 7+ years, makeup and lash artist as well. I have mature, oily/combination skin. Spray serum!
