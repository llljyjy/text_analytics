Kosas has yet to disappoint me. As a cosmetologist with a special care service in skincare, it’s been great to see the evolution of clean beauty. Kosas is a young brand in the game, but they just get it. From the packaging to the ingredients, they’ve found a way to be inviting, healthy and clean in a sustainable manner. This spray is a multi-use collagen and probiotic serum that’s lightweight, feels refreshing and leaves your skin naturally glowing without feeling sticky. This spray serum is meant to hydrate, firm lift and plump the skin and it does just that. I use it in the morning after a light cleanse and before moisturizer. I’ve also used it as a refresher thorough out the day especially when I’m working long hours. Not only does it keep my skin looking good. It makes my makeup up come back to life. I genuinely love this spray and can’t say enough about it. I give this 5 stars. Juicy skin!
