This lip booster changed my lips for good. Life changing, indeed! My lips have always been very dry and cracked especially when I woke up in the morning. I carried 7 different chapsticks and glosses in the market but nothing could help save my dry and cracked lips. I use this before bed then I’d wake up with it around the corners of my mouth. I don’t have this problem now. This stuff gets absorbed into the skin. My lips are 100% smoother, plumper! and more hydrated, It smells amazing. I use Kosas Plump and Juicy Lip Collagen Booster every night because i love how it feels and noticeable changed on my lips the next day. I haven’t had a dry lip day since I decided to try this magical product from Kosas. I love it! It feels like a thick but soothing balm going on, not greasy in the slightest. It’s like instant spa for my lips. I no longer have peeling lips all the time which is a big turn-off for me. I no longer rely on other moisturizers or lip balms!Plus, I use so little each night that this tiny jar is going to last me months if not years. I wish I had discovered this lip mask ages ago. If you have problems with big chunks of dry skin peeling off your lips, buy this NOW. Plump your lips without injections
