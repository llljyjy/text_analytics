I was so excited to receive this product! I love Kosas and their makeup products, so I was excited to try out their first skincare product! I was actually looking for a product/serum like this that offered hydration. The ingredients in this are awesome, peptides and hyaluranic acid really caught my eye. I LOVE that you spray it on, I usually dislike the sticky hydration serums, and run to rinse off my hands after. The mist is fine but not too fine that I feel like it isnâ€™t covering the whole of my face. Within a few days of using this, my skin was so plump and hydrated! I use it morning and night after washing/rinsing while my skin is still damp. I did start using a retinol around the same time and I think that this product helped to keep my skin balanced and my barrier strong! I will be adding this to my permanent routine So inventive
