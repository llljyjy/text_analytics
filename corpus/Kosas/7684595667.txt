I really love this kosas treatment, I think it has a lot of beautiful hydrating ingredients and it lays on my lips nicely. One of my biggest gripes with lip masks and treatments is that they are too heavy, but I donâ€™t find that with this product at all. It is great as an overnight treatment as it helps soothe, plump, and hydrate my lips, but it also wears really nicely under makeup, or even as a lip topper. I think that this product is also great for all ages and genders as there is no inherit inhibitor present that would put someone off of this product. Overall, I really appreciated how beautiful this product was to wear and I look forward to continue to use this product and most likely repurchase this product as it is a truly a diamond in the rough. nan
