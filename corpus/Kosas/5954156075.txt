I want to start off by saying that I love Kosas and most of their products I have tried from them have been a hit, and this spray-on vegan collagen + probiotic serum did not miss! I love the ingredients behind Kosas products and how I can trust what I am putting on my skin. This spray-on serum truly makes my skin feel more supple and hydrated. Aside from that, it is supposed to soothe, firm, and lift your skin. I usually use this spray when my skin is cleansed, and it is my third step after my hyaluronic serum. The convenience of having it as a spray is truly innovating. I have never encountered a product like this. I would rather have a spray on serum vs a dropper or a pump- it just makes your life so much easier! It is unscented which is nice if you like no fragrance! I really, really enjoyed the convenience of this product along with the amazing benefits it provides to your skin. 100% would recommend to anyone! nan
