I purchased this item from Credo during their 20% off sale. I really like this spray-on serum, but I do not like the smell at all. It smells like nasal spray. I knocked off a star because of that nasal spray smell. For a product this pricey I think the smell cheapens the experience quite a bit. I can’t help but think of Afrin when I spray this on my face. I’ve only used this for two days, but I do like how fine a mist the bottle sprays and that the product itself is nourishing. Nourishing, but oddly smells like nasal spray
