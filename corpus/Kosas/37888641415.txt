Holy wow wow wow is this little spray magic the best most natural glowed Dewey amaingness I have ever put onto my 41 year old face!  I found it too watery at first and I wasn’t super pumped about the liquid water texture but the second or third crack I took I decided to spray less sparingly. WOW my face is amazing.   Im addicted! So natural you could practically eat it and I think the bottle is huge for the price given that its pure liquid gold.   Shake it up a bit and give it 5 or 6 sprays to start. I did not layer it with makeup and this is the first thing I have ever bought that I did not WANT to layer with makeup because you will feel so absolutely pretty it hurts! Almost no scent.  Wear it alone.  Don’t leave home without it. More then a little to go a long way
