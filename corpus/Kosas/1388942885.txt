When my clients tell me that they need something to step up their skincare routine, I usually suggest a toner. As an esthetician for over a decade, I am always looking for toners and usually have about half a dozen in my personal routine. (That’s excessive, I know). What stood out to me with the Kosas plump and juicy serum spray was the packaging. It’s very thoughtful and I love how the spray has not clogged or sputtered when utilizing. The aroma is light and clean and dissipates quickly. This product immediately gets the skin back into balance, especially after cleansing or exfoliating. It also allows additional products to glide across the skin and readily absorb as well. Although it is not a product for setting makeup, it really helps throughout the day to freshen up the skin while not trashing your makeup. I would highly recommend this product Lovely addition to everyone's routine
