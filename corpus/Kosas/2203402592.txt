I was really excited to try the Kosas Plump & Juicy Lip Booster Buttery Lip Buttery Treatment cause I have been trying to find a lip plumper that didnâ€™t sting or dry my lips out. I am happy to report that I had no problems with stinging, burning or dry lips after using the the plumper. Packed with rich fatty acids and peptides for soft, smooth lips and hyaluronic acid and oleoactif that plump the lips. My lips felt and looked great but there was one big issue that kept me from continuing to use it after a few times and that was the taste. It has an awful chemical taste to it that I just could not get passed. Other than the taste, it seems like a great lip plumper, hydrator and lip smoother. I hope that they maybe add a flavor to it like vanilla or something that would disguise or lessen the chemical taste because then I would definitely be using it all the time. Good but not great...
