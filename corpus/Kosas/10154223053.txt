This product is amazing! As a woman in my 40s now I love anything that is quick and easy but will help keep my skin from looking dull or dehydrated. This gets the job done. It is infused with collagen which naturally acts as a plumper. I love the packaging and application. I feel as if it is a skincare routine in a bottle. I used it at night as recommended after cleaning my face. I also used it in the morning on my days off when I knew I would not be wearing makeup. I did wish that it would have been recommended for use with makeup but it did not state so on the directions so I did not do so. Overall I give it a 8/10. Itâ€™s a great add on to skincare routine or also a replacement for people like me that sometimes just want to do one thing for skincare before bed. nan
