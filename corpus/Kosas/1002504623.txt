I truly enjoyed this product but my only gripes are that the fragrance is a bit too much for me and the shine does not last as long as I would have liked.  It does keep my lips moisturized and hydrated and I did notice a difference in the “plumping action“ of the product.  I use it AM/PM as part of my skincare routine. Plump and Juicy... INDEED
