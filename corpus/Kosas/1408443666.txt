Kosas is an awesome brand that combines science and art to create clean makeup for skincare freaks. They are all about beauty that’s revealing, expressing, and feeling comfortable in your skin. Their niche is makeup that is quick and easy to apply and is clinically proven to actually make your skin better. They specialize in products that plump, hydrate, firm, and soften. While Kosas is a brand known for its makeup, it recently launched its Plump + Juicy Vegan Collagen Spray-On Serum. Woo baby! Y’all, I am completely obsessed with this spray serum because as you know, I’m a serial spritzer. This spray-on serum is full of goodies to give your skin a total reset. Ingredients such as Vegan Collagen, Peptides, and Hyaluronic Acid work together to firm, lift, plump, and hydrate. To kick this spray up a few notches, Plant Probiotics, Artemesia Flower extract, and Proteins & Amino Acids were added to balance the microbiome of the skin, soothe, and strengthen. This spray-on serum is the bomb! It leaves my skin feeling so refreshed, plump, and juicy-looking with its ultra-fine spray. As one that lives in the desert, this has become a necessity for me as I spray my face, arms, and legs throughout the day. My skin looks so much better too. Y’all, definitely check this out! I have been a licensed Esthetician in the state of Nevada for the past eight years. Skincare is my passion. In my free time, you will find me working my magic as Beauty Influencer, NeteR of NeteReviews. Don’t forget to apply SPF, y’all! Obsessed
