I’m a bit obsessed with this product from Kosas. As a skincare specialist for over 8 years, I can honestly say I’ve tried into the high 100’s of different products. This one is something my skincare fridge was missing. I worked with a company that had a spray toner that I loved to keep in the fridge as well as in my purse to make sure I had something to refresh my skin and/or makeup. This one is a game changer being a spray-on collagen and probiotic serum that plumps, hydrates, soothes and visibly firms and lifts my skin. I use this probably 3 times a day on the modest side and would bathe in it if I could. It’s great for all skin types and tones and will help you achieve you skincare goals. It’s an easy step to add to any regimen and definitely recommend. Amazing
