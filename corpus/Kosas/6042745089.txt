i actually paid full price for this and didnt get given it for free for a review (which is why theres so many positive reviews). this was the biggest waste of 25.00. its not worth it at all. i have tried just about every lipgloss. i love a good thick high shine gloss. the packaging is pretty, but the product is terrible. its glossy which i like but its more on the oily thinner side which i dont mind but the problem is it leaves a ton of white goopy residue inside the lips which is super noticable when you talk. please do not buy this product and get the refy lipgloss instead (super high shine and not goopy). i usually love kosas but this was just terrible. i wouldnt even pay $10 for this. not worth $25, leaves white goopy residue
