Kosas Plump + Juicy Lip Collagen Booster is one of the best aging well skincare products I experienced so far. I cannot get enough of the scent and I would definitely wear it as a perfume. This lip product is so effective, it made me realize how much more I need to take care of my lips. Whenever I am feeling anxious, I have a bad habit of picking my dry and chapped lips. After applying this collagen booster, there was no temptation for me to pick my lips because there was no excess film as a result. I was excited to see Jojoba Oil and Pomegranate Extract on the ingredient list because my skin responds well to them. Not only did my lips feel hydrated but they also felt firm for the first time in a long time. The packaging is adorable and I love the pop of colors. I love the applicator even more because it prevents too much product from coming out. My name is Aakruti Sheth and as an up and coming Entrepreneur in the beauty industry for five years and a Content Creator on Instagram, this clean collagen lip product is a must as it will eliminate dryness and make your lips appear younger and fuller.
