A tad expensive for what is basically a glorified lip balm. That being said, with consistent use, this product is really good. It is conditioning, hydrating, subtly plumping, with a natural glossy sheen. I believe the negative reviews are from people who are applying too much. You need very little product as it is like Vaseline and will melt across your lips. Smells like a birthday cake, no taste. Perfect for those with chronically dry lips and want a little lip treat: Quality Lip Booster
