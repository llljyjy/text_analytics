I have been working in the skincare and medical aesthetic industry for 13+ years and enjoy products that are easy and comfortable for everyday use. I love that Kosas is a squeaky clean cosmetic make-up brand, the products are comfortable to wear and that it has real skin-benefiting ingredients that are clinically proven.I have been using the Plump and Juicy Vegan Collagen Spray-on Serum for 2 weeks now. With vegan collagen and peptides to firm the skin, plant probiotics to support the skin’s microbiome, soothing flower extracts, amino acids to strengthen and hyaluronic acid, why wouldn’t one want to use this easy to use spray on serum. I used it minimally once a day, but it can be used twice a day and throughout the day. Once my skin was cleansed I would spray it all over my face, 3 to 4 sprays, then while allowing it to absorb into my skin I applied my eye treatment. It absorbs extremely well into the skin without leaving a film or layer, making it great for all skin types and it didn’t affect the consistency or application of my usual skincare and make-up. My skin has been extremely dry and sensitive recently due to seasonal and hormonal changes. This was a great addition to my skin arsenal as it didn’t cause any sensitivity, added extra hydration and left my skin feeling smooth and plump. And, because it can be used over products, it was great to spray on during the day when my skin felt tight and needed a boost.A great product that compliments any skincare regime and is seamlessly incorporated into one’s routine.
