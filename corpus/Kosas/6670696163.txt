I really don’t understand all the hype for this product. While half of the reviews are incentivized I have been using it for a few days and I haven’t noticed a difference in my lips nor have I experienced any plumping. For the $25 price tag this is so not worth it. It feels like a regular lip balm. The only thing that I do like about this product is that it feels more like a lip oil than a lip balm. Overall I would not recommend this product as I have used better lip plumping products. I will definitely be returning. Not worth it
