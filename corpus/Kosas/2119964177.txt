I absolutely love this product. Not only am I overall a huge Kosas fan, but this product saved my lips while I was traveling. There is no tingle and the plump doesnâ€™t look unnatural. With continuous use I found it resembled a really hydrated plump rather than an over exaggerated inflamed appearance some other products give. I would recommend this treatment for anyone. I use it anytime my lips need some hydration. I like a thicker layer at night to absorb during my sleep cycle. It helps my lips from peeling and easily fills in dry spots. I recommend exfoliation prior to getting the best appearance. It has a light creamsicle scent which is perfect for summer and the formula has a slight shine so it can be worn on its own or to top a lip liner or tint. New favorite lip treatment
