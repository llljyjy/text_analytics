I have been in the beauty industry for over 6 years, and I have never tried a unique product like this one. It is a vegan spray that contains probiotics! Being a nutrition professional myself, I am aware of the benefits of probiotics when they are consumed, so I am amazed at the benefits of when it is applied on the skin. It also contains amazing ingredients like vegan collagen, peptides and hyaluronic acid. It helps with firming, lifting and plumping the skin and hydrates. I love that is also helps with the signs of aging and stress while also nourishing and supporting the skins pH. My favorite way to use this is after cleansing my skin, both morning and night time. It feels like my skin drank a glass of water. I also feel like it helps the rest of my products absorb better. My skin loves this product! It also doesn’t irritate my skin at all. I plan on continuing to use this product regularly when I run out. This has quickly become one of my “must have“ products. nan
