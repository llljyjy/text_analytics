Super sticky, my lips look the same just wet. I have to consciously think of the vitamins while I’m using it to feel like I’m not putting on some cheap lip gloss. I prefer burts bees retinol lip balm. Not terrible but nothing remarkable for me about it. 25 dollars can get me 3 of the burts bees and I get way more results plus it doesn’t feel as chemical to me. why isn’t this letting me post the review?
