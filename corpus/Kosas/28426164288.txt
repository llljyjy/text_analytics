I love Kosas products and super excited to have the opportunity to try this Kosas Plump & Juice Vegan Collagen Spray-On Serum.Firstly, the spray bottle is very sleek and heavy duty one. The formula is highly packed with amazing Vegan Collagen, Peptides, Plant Probiotics, Hyaluronic Acid, Botanical Flower Extracts and vegetable protein and Amino Acids.Secondly, I love the easy to use of the spray serum. It super convenient to use and easy to carry in my handbag wherever I go. The serum feels very lightweight and absorbs very well into the skin. It doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy or oily at all. It’s a non-sticky serum that leaves my skin feeling very comfortable, gentle and yet very soothing right after spraying. My skin looks very well nourished, hydrated and calm. The serum helps keep my skin soft and smooth, and less dull. I’ve been using this spray serum consistently every morning and night, and I can see how it changes my skin overall appearance. My skin looks a lot smoother, more elastic and of course very well balanced.Lastly, I wish the spray nozzle works a little bit better as I have a hard time spray the serum evenly on my skin. I can’t seem to get a fine mist from the spray bottle at all. It Feels Very Nice On The Skin
