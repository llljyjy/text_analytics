I am normally not a big fan of lip plumbing treatments, typically because the tingle and even sting sometimes to create the plumbing effect and since I have very sensitive skin, it almost feels like having a reaction. As a pro-makeup artist in the entertainment industry, I don’t stock plumbing treatments in my pro kit either for that reason since I don’t know if one of my clients has super sensitive skin and could have a reaction. That has all changed now! Kosas Plump & Juicy Lip Booster Buttery Lip Buttery Treatment is a game changer for me!!!It feels smooth, creamy and moisturizes the lips like the best chapstick. It has a wonderful shine to it, but isn’t sticky. And it does really plumb up the lips without any tingling or stinging feelings. It will be my new go to in my kit because I can trust that it will not create any issues for even my most sensitive clients. Kosas is truly cruelty-free. They don’t test finished products or ingredients on animals, and neither do their suppliers or any third-parties. They also don’t sell their products where animal testing is required by law.
