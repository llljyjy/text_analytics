I have the privilege of being in the beauty industry for 30+ years and the opportunity to experience hundreds of cosmetic products. This spray on serum is designed to give the skin a reset. A fast efficient vehicle spray to deliver collagen and probiotic ingredients into the skin to hydrate, soothe and support the skin microbiome. Itâ€™s formulated without oils, waxes, or emulsifiers. This nourishing formula acts as a great primer for the introduction of the rest of your skincare regime. I love that this product has no scent, the last thing I want is to spray my face (and eyes) with fragrance. I housed this product on my desk and sprayed it throughout the day (probably too much :), but it was the perfect treatment right before those video chats. I did notice a minimal reduction in redness in my skin which is always welcomed and I appreciate the product is gluten free for those of us with dietary restrictions. nan
