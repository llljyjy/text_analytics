Kosas Plump & Juicy Spray-On Serum is a great idea for someone who is on the go, not ready for the commitment of a full line skincare routine and doesn’t necessarily have any “ issues” the are trying to treat ( ie: environmental damage, acne, wrinkles etc). The packaging is geared towards a younger clientele and does not feel elegant in my opinion. The scent is overpowering in my opinion and probably the number one reason I discontinued use of this product. The floral scent comes from Artemis and hibiscus floral extract and if you’re a fan of those scents, perhaps it will not bother you. My skin did feel refreshed and moisturized after using post cleanse. In the evening, I cleansed in the shower and then used this spray serum which felt nice. I do love Kosas for their makeup line, but this attempt at skincare just didn’t work for me. Kosas Spray Serum
