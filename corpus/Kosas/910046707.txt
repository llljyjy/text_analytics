I have been in the beauty industry for over 25 years in the corporate side and retail side and so I have been exposed to numerous brands. I am familiar with Kosas because of the fact that I am using my buying power to promote change because I want to focus on companies that are clean and cruelty-free. I love their products - use their lip oil and tinted face oil foundation. I recently tried  Kosas Plump & Juicy Spray-On Serum and I could be wrong, but this is the first time I have came across a spray-on serum. What a novel idea. At first, I was reluctant because I fear the product getting into my eyes. I am an avid user of beauty mist to prep my skin and to set my makeup, but I wasnâ€™t used to spraying a serum onto my face. This product sprayed on evenly and it was a nice gentle mist. No products dripped into my eyes or ran down this face.This product helps with elasticity and skin suppleness and so no complaints here. Novel Idea that works!
