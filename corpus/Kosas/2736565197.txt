I absolutely love this product!  As a person with nut allergies it is extremely hard to find lip products that don’t have almond oil in it. Not only does it not have nut oils but it also plumps the lips! I am in awe of this product. As a Master Cosmetologist / Pro Makeup Artist for over 20+  years I have used so many lip products that don’t deliver what they promise. Kosas is a brand that you can count on. I love how they use products that normally would not be in a lip oil. They use pomegranate flower extract and peptides with hyaluronic acid with concentrated fatty acids with jojoba! Mind blown! I can honestly feel the difference in my lips. Before I used this product my lips felt thin and was not plumb like they use to be. Immediately after my first use I saw a difference. I am hooked on this oil!  Not only does it work but it also doesn’t leave my lips sticky. They feel soft and cushiony.  I didn’t feel any aggravation with is product.  This is a staple lip oil that should be in everyone’s makeup bag. This works incredible by its self but add the lipliner and the lip gloss, it will take your lips to a whole new level! I also love the fact that Kosas Plump Juicy Lip Booster Lip Treatment is Vegan. That is also important to me as well. I would highly recommend this product to everyone.
