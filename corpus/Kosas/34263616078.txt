I’ve never been one to fill my lips with filler because I just don’t like the way it looks so fake. So when I tried the Plump and juicy lip collagen booster by Kosas it plumped up my lips without having to go to the doctor to get filler . I always have to have something on my lips because they’re very dry . I really liked this gloss because it didn’t bleed all over and it kept my lips plump and juicy and people actually noticed out in the public. You can tell when you use the plump and juicy lips collagen booster you can actually feel the difference from a different lip gloss because it plumps them up so much . I was really pleasantly surprised how well this lipgloss lasted too . I feel like my lips are luscious when I wear this gloss.  I would highly recommend it along with the  Hotliner lipliner they have that has hyaluronic  acid in it so it  doesn’t bleed. So what a great combination to have the plump and juicy lips collagen booster lipgloss with their lip liner so I recommend both and I think you’ll love it! Plump and Juicy lip Collagen Booster
