I am an Entertainment Industry Makeup Artist with many years of experience with every skin type, and everyone including myself benefits from cleanly formulated products that are easy and pleasant to use, play well with others, and function beautifully. I don’t know anyone who wouldn’t enjoy Plump and Juicy skin and this Kosas Plump and Juicy Spray-On Serum delivers a powerful and clean product in an easy to use spray form that smells gorgeous but not overpowering, and though it can be used as a toner, is not drying to the skin at all. I love to apply to clean freshly washed skin to immediately soothe and prep for moisturizer and/or sunscreen. I also like to keep it handy as a later in the day refresher. It is definitely also rich enough to use as a night serum without leaving a sticky feel. Gorgeous versatile clean product
