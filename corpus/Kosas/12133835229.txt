I’m usually not a big fan on serums that you “spray” on. I would assume it’s usually just watered down skin care or so. However, Kosas definitely delivered an excellent product! This is really a product fit for all needs and skin types. If you are done with a workout session, or need a quick dose of hydration to your skin this really does the trick. Somedays after washing my face in the morning I just do a few sprays of this and follow with a moisturizer to test out if it’ll leave my skin hydrated enough. I’m pleased to say this does. I could even see this product work as a primer spray before makeup. I haven’t seen this be used as a setting spray but the spray quality is fine enough that it should not disturb your makeup but help it really melt into your skin for the skin like finish. Overall, solid product. Convenient!
