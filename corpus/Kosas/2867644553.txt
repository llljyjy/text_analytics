This is the ultimate lip gloss for everyday wear! It’s clear so you can wear it alone for a dash of gloss of over your favorite shade. It contains the perfect combination of ingredients to hydrate, plump, improve the look of fine lines and so much more. I am in love with all Kosas packaging, and this doesn’t disappoint. The pink to orange fade screams full on summer vibes, making it perfect for keeping or gifting to a friend! It feels moisturizing, nourishing and comfy on lips without a sticky or annoying after-feel. My lips tend to be especially drier during summer months, but I want something more than just your generic chapstick. This adds a rush of the hydration my pout craves and gives a fuller look in just a simple swipe. Keep it in your purse or back pocket and go! Super glossy!
