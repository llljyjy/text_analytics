Kosas Plump + Juicy Vegan Collagen + Probiotic Spray-On Serum, for me, collaborates with the saying, “Sounds too good to be true “. This serum states to be multi-beneficial by hydrating, firming, microbiome balancing, strengthening, lifting and plumping. With my experience and knowledge as a specialized skincare therapist, I sadly am not sold on this product. My first impression when misting this product onto my skin was the scent. While I am a fan that it does not contain added artificial fragrances, I did however pick up on some under notes of ’alcohol’. Then further to my surprise there is indeed alcohol listed in the beginning of it’s ingredient list. This feels conflicting for a product that claims to be hydrating, microbiome-balancing, and safe for sensitive skin. On a more upbeat endnote though, I do love this product’s vibrant and fun sustainable packaging. nan
