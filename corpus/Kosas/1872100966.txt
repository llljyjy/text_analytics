My name is Shannon and I am addicted tolip treatments.  I have them in my purse,  on my bedside table, in my makeup drawer… you get the idea. Therefore, I was more than happy to review the Kosas Plump & Juicy Lip Booster Buttery Lip Buttery Treatment.As a professional makeup artist, I am already very familiar with the brand and their stellar products.  I’m happy to report that this Lip Treatment was no exception.I happen to be extremely picky when it comes to the texture of lip products.  I’m actually one of those people that prefers a thicker consistency. (For example, lip oils are not my thing.)  I was so pleased with the texture of this Kosas product.   It feels thick enough to stay put, but not sticky enough to get caught in your hair in a windstorm.Moreover, it instantly feels like a treatment product vs. a lipgloss.  It’s kind of a hybrid actually; like a glossy conditioning treatment.  Hard to explain, but trust me, it’s awesome.As for the claims that it will turn my lips into ones that rival Angelina Jolie…I’m not sure just yet.  I can definitely see an improvement in texture; my lips are smoother, and the lines are less pronounced.  I would so far as to say that they do seem a bit fuller, enough that I intend to use this product until it’s empty.  I can easily update my review at that time. nan
