My name is Ashley and I am a licensed esthetician of 10 years. I am also a beauty tap verified Beauty expert and I have a background in both retail and  services working with various beauty companies. I love learning and trying new products to be able to recommend to my clients, family and friends.I absolutely love this and I use it every day. However I would say that I don’t feel that it plumps my lips but it definitely helps smooth them and make them more luscious. I usually don’t like things that can get sticky or tacky on my lips but this product feels great and doesn’t give me that sticky feeling. It makes my lips extremely soft and moisturized. I was told on a date that my lips looked kissable and I want to say it’s all because of because of this product. kissable
