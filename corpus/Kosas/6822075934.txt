The mist itself sprays so evenly, thoroughly and feels incredibly refreshing, cooling, hydrating, and it sinks into the skin instantly. It’s lightweight, and has helped to replenish my skin, as well as soothe and calm it overall reducing the look of my redness. It definitely helped with rebalancing my skins ph because I breakout a lot when it’s out of wack and this improved a lot of those problems for me. It’s overall helped strengthen and plump up my skin so it’s a lot softer and a lot healthier. Even though it has no added fragrance it just has a nice natural fresh scent and it’s so pleasant. This is a great product especially for this upcoming winter. Great for sensitive skin
