This serum is aaahhhmazing!  The spray is ultra-fine and immediately gives my skin: a healthy glow, hydration, and plumps it.  I love that it absorbs quickly and doesnâ€™t leave my skin tacky or sticky.  It also layers well with other skincare products which is definitely important to me as I hate pilling.  It has this light florally scent that reminds me of lilacs, but it dissipates quickly for those that are scent-sensitive. Bravo!
