I am very excited about the Kosas Plump and Juicy Vegan Collagen Spray-On Serum. I am always excited to try any new product with Collagen as it firms the skin,  with the addition of peptides to help lift and plump and one of my favorite ingredients Hyaluronic acid for hydration.  Perfect for sensitive skin as it contains artemisia flower extract that is very soothing and plant probiotics that supports the skins microbiome. Vegan, clean and Dermatologist tested without any emulsifiers, waxes or oils. As an esthetician for 20+years I am always learning about new products, ingredients and how these cutting edge formula’s can benefit our skin not only improving skin but also helps protect against signs of ageing. With the amount of products on the market I love when I try one that lives up to what it claims. The fact that it is a spray serum is a plus speeding up my morning and night skincare routine’s this hasn’t any greasy residue and penetrates quickly. I saw definite improvement in my skin after one week of using morning and night with a noontime spritz when I am going without makeup. I definitely recommend this results driven serum. Impressive Serum
