I am a big fan of lip sleeping masks. For most of my life I have had larger lips and with larger lips comes a larger surface area for dry, chapped lips, especially growing up in Michigan winters. The cold can wreak havoc on your skin and lips.  In the past, the only thing that could help would be vaseline but with new technology and ingredients, we now have wonderful products like Kosas Plump & Juicy Lip Booster Buttery Lip Buttery Treatment. This treatment is all about restoring natural moisture and adding plumpness over time without hurting. Most plumpers have some sort of ingredient that plumps the lips. by making them irritated. Yes, they work but they are uncomfortable. The Lip Buttery Treatment is soft, buttery, hydrating, and not sticky at all. It works great when sleeping or getting ready. Itâ€™s the perfect lip treatment to use before using a liquid matte lip or any lip product that can be drying. nan
