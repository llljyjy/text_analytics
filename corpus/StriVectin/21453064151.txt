Definitely noticed a change in skin texture and smoothness of the skin with regular use. The product is lightweight and goes on smooth. I like that it is not heavy and does not leave a white cast like a lot of sunscreens do. A big plus that it absorbs quickly as well. I like how it includes both spf and retinol, instead of having to use multiple different products to get full protection for your face. Nice
