This product is AMAZING, BUT there is a caveat. Often times when I buy this product it seems spoiled, like how vitamin C can go bad if not kept correctly. The product should be a light orangey color, but when it’s gone off it’s a darker orange. I’ve used this for years and return it before I even walk out of the store most times because I know to check to see if it is bad/old/whatever is going on with it. If you do get a good bottle, you’ll be writing a great review, trust me. But if I got my first bottle or two and it was sticky and smelled odd, and didn’t do what others claimed it would, of course I would be skeptical too. 75% of the bottles I buy, whether Sephora or Ulta, are always bad. Why keep buying it? Because the good product is life changing and everyone notices how great my skin looks. So buyer beware, but also this product can be amazing. Hopefully this helps! I want everyone to know this..
