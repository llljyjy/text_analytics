I’ve been using the StriVectin Peptight twice daily for 10 days and I’m pleasantly surprised to say that I have noticed some results! I’m 30 years old with some creases on my neck and no sagging skin. After using this serum I noticed that many of my small wrinkles /creases have disappeared and my skin looks more plumped and moisturized. The deeper creases remain, but I’m hopeful that with time and continued use of this product that those too will improve. I’m hoping this serum will help prevent sagging skin in the future. I did love the packing on this. The roller is cool to the touch and I like the locking feature a lot because it means that I won’t accidentally waste product when I’m traveling. It has a very light aloe scent. Definitely recommend! Loving this at 30!
