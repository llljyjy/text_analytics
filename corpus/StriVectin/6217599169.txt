I love the idea of including retinol and spf in a product you can use daily. It has a lightweight texture that absorbs easily. I’m dark skin and it doesn’t leave a white AT ALL. If you don’t like fragrance you might not enjoy this, I don’t mind fragrance so I’m really enjoying the scent ! I’m really enjoying this product but I hate how pricey it is. nan
