I have really been loving this eye serum. It’s very light but surprisingly hydrating. No scent, no pilling, and I’ve already started to see some results after a few weeks. I just generally look less tired in the mornings and my dark circles don’t seem as bad. It also really helps with puffiness, so I really appreciate that. It’s a good product overall. nan
