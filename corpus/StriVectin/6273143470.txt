I love this daily moisturizer with Retinol and SPF.  It definitely hydrates my skin leaving it smooth, tight and luminous.   I like that it has SPF already in it so I donâ€™t need to worry about using a separate SPF product to protect my face.  Having used it for only a couple of weeks, I noticed modest tightening of the skin as the Retinol works well to make even the fine lines disappear.  I recommend this advanced moisturizer. An Excellent Moisturizer!
