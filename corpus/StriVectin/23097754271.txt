This had great reviews so I was so excited to try it. I loved the idea of having a Vitamin C & Retinol in one product! Unfortunately, it turned out to be too good to be true for me. The smell is unpleasant, the texture is sticky, and it did nothing for fine lines or wrinkles after 3 months of daily use. Eventually, I was only using it on targeted problem areas because it was causing breakouts. Disappointing, I wanted to love it
