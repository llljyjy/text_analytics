I received this product complimentary from Strivectin. The packaging is just gorgeous with the bright colors. This eye serum is really effective for the skin around my eyes that is showing some lines and wrinkles and I have occasional puffiness and dark circles. I use this serum on my clean skin and apply it onto the eye area and tap it lightly into my skin for absorption. It has a beautiful lightweight texture that absorbs fast into my skin and does not leave my skin sticky. It feels hydrating and soothing on application. It makes my skin feel hydrated, soft and smooth and I can already see an improvement in my eye are since using this serum. It looks brighter, less tired, hydrated and more youthful. Canâ€™t wait to see the long-term results! Lightweight, very hydrating
