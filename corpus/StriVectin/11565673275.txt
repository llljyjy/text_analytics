I’ve been using this a little over 6 months and feel like starting to see restyles. My upper lids look much better, tightened in a lasting form. I’m docking one star because this absolutely pills, so I’m only able to wear it at night. I don’t even wear a lot of eye makeup, but even on a bare eye it becomes a pill-y mess. Unfortunate, because I am happy with the results, but can’t help but wonder if they took twice as long due to missing morning application.That said, this is absolutely my go to night eye product moving forward. The applicator is amazing, the product itself doesn’t sting at all. Price is steep, but a little goes a long way and I’d estimate that after daily use this will last me 8 or so months. Tighter lids (with patience)
