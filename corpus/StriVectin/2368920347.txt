I am very pleased with this moisturizer with SPF 30. I have sensitive, acne prone/ extremely oily skin type, it didnâ€™t irritate my skin but it does make my skin feels a bit greasy. It has such a nice smooth texture, it seriously makes my skin feels much healthier even after a week of using it. Absolutely recommend this to combo and dry skin folks. Recommend this to combo/ dry skin!
