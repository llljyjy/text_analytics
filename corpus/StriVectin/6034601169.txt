I got this cream as part of a Caroline Hirons kit and while I can’t say I’ve noticed a massive difference in fine lines, I’ve been using this for a few months now and I do think it’s a really nice, hydrating eye cream. I can get dryness under my eyes and I haven’t had any since using this daily. It sits well under makeup and SPF also - one thing that’s put me off eye creams in the past is that they can make the under eye area prone to smudging mascara, however I’ve been using this every morning and it hasn’t affected that. Overall I think this is a lovely cream and has made a subtle improvement to my under eye lines and a noticeable improvement to hydration. A nice eye cream
