When I open the container it was very nicely put together packaging was great. The contents of the product is very thick creamy and almost like silk. I applied twice daily once in the morning and once at night. I could feel my face tightening when I use this, but not in a uncomfortable way. I did have to use a moisturizer after. And after about five days I started to see noticeable results.My jowls and my turkey neck has shrunk. It was kind of lightweight and I did get a mild plumping sensation from it. Overall it is worth a try! Tightens The second is after pic!
