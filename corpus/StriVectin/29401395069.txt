Iâ€™ve enjoyed using this eye serum. I have dark circles, and this serum has helped correct the look of stressed, and discolored areas. I use it in the morning and evening and over time it has visibly brightened my skin. The results can be seen in four weeks with regular use. I appreciate that the formula is lightweight, ophthalmologist tested and fragrance free. I love this and other Strivectin products and really see results with this brand. Would recommend! Love this product!
