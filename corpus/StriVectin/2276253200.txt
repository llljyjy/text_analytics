It is an anti-aging cream with SPF all in one. Excited to try it out. The sunscreen is easy to blend and absorbing fast. Retinol is generally not recommended to use at day time, but the optimized surfaced release retinol delivers the retinol more evenly and continuously onto skin without irritation. I am glad that I can use retinol both during the day and night. nan
