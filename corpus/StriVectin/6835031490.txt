Great product! Love that it is lightweight and easily absorbed into the skin! It goes perfectly with my Super-C serum that I use on the rest of my face daily! I think my eyes look brighter and I no longer can tell that I have dark circles as often as I did before. I think my undereyes feel moisturized after use of this serum and I am excited to see the long term results after continuing to use this product! Great addition to my routine!
