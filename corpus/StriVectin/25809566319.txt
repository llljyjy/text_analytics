I noticed some short, slightly itchy, reddish-brownish marks on one side of my torso. They developed slowly and knowing they could be stretch marks, I tried moisturizing better. But a couple of weeks later, they still came and after a couple of hours of crying, I figured that they were young, and I am young so this was worth a shot. I also once got a sample of this. I remember seeing the price and saying nahh but it’s worth every cent and more. My extremely young stretch marks vanished without a trace. I used it once daily for about three weeks. The best part: they have not returned. Even if they do, then I’ll use this again. And you don’t have to use a lot either so I think it lasts a reasonable amount of time. I have about half the tube left. I’m going to use it to tackle some extremely fine lines on the left side of my smile. Hopefully, they stay gone, and I’ll start sleeping on my back as well.But I digress. This product is a new holy grail. This is what high-end beauty should be. Not slightly above average products in nice packaging, but innovation that fixes real cosmetic problems, and makes THE difference.Sidenotes: - do NOT mix or layer this why glycolic acid. Probably applies to other aha’s and chemical exfoliants as well. I used glycolic acid on my body, and applied this, and developed a rash. Good thing the skin on the body is resilient.- in my experience, it has limited efficacy on old stretch marks sadly, but I can deal with them, especially since they’re quite faded- consistency is essential Miraculous
