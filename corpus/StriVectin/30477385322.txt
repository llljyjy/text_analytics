I’m a huge Strivectin fan and was delighted to be gifted this eye serum by Strivectin, especially since I have always struggled with dark under eye circles. I used this for two weeks, and though I loved the texture and feel of the gel serum, I didn’t notice any improvement in my dark circles. I’m planning to continue using it to see if longer use might return any results. nan
