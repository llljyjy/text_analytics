I was skeptical about buying this because almost all the recommended reviews were incentivized, and I feel like often times products really don’t do much. It’s only been a week and the fading is noticeable. My lighter ones are practically all gone. Obviously, the textures still there a bit but wow is it better. My more recent ones are much lighter as well and I expect them to be practically gone by the end of the month. Really Impressed
