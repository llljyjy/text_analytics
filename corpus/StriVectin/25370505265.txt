I liked this cream a lot.  I’ve only just started using it so I’m not sure how well it works on smoothing out wrinkles or stretch marks.  It is unscented, which I don’t mind but other Strivectin products I’ve tried have had a nice scent to them so I was hoping this would be something similar.  The cream is thick so you do not need very much.  It’s one of the most hydrating moisturizers I’ve ever used.  I highly recommend it!  The only thing I can’t recommend is the price tag… it’s a $45 cream at best! Very Moisturizing!
