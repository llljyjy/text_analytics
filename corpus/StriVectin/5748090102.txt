I LOVE this serum.  I just turned 30 and have been struggling with noticeable creases/wrinkles and after using this for almost 2 months, not only are my wrinkles much less prominent, my skin tone and complexion have greatly improved.  I get compliments all the time on how great my skin looks.  I did not find the smell overwhelming like some other people have, and I am usually pretty sensitive to that stuff.  Also, I have pretty sensitive skin just in general and am prone to redness and I have had no irritation at all from this! Amazing Serum
