I have oily, acne prone skin and this moisturizer has been working perfectly for me! It’s lightweight and wears nicely under makeup. As someone with a history of skin cancer I appreciate that it’s spf 30 as well! Since switching to this moisturizer my skin has felt hydrated and smooth. I’m still fairly new to retinol but my skin has taken to this very well (my skin is not typically sensitive) Works great for my oily skin
