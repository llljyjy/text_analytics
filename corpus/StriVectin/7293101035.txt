I am 30 so I don’t really have wrinkles yet lol but I was in the market for a cream to help keep them at bay for as long as possible. I did like the feeling of the cream, has no scent to it, and it’s not oily or sticky. I like that it blends well with my perfume. But the jar is too small. I think I don’t see major results because I have no wrinkles in my neck area yet. so I switched to Mario Buscano’s neck cream as it’s larger and affordable and more for preventative care. too tiny
