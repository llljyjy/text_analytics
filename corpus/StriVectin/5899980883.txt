I was sent a deluxe sample size of this eye cream in exchange for a review. I’ve been using it for a couple of months now and do like it, but I’m not sure I would repurchase. I’m in my 20s and don’t have eye wrinkles yet. So it might be working for prevention more than I realize. But personally I like an eye cream that’s really hydrating. And this dries down to be more on the matte side. Overall not bad, but not my favorite. Pretty Good
