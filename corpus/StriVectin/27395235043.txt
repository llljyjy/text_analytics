This face cream is looks thick, but it feels pretty lightweight on the skin and absorbs so beautifully! My skin does feel plumper after using it for just a few days! It is nourishing for a few hours, but I donâ€™t feel like it is moisturizing enough to last all day. I feel that by mid-day that my face feels dry and I need to reapply more moisturizer. It is also heavily fragranced, which slightly irritates my skin. It feels slightly tingly when I apply it, but it goes away pretty quickly. I think if this was reformulated without as much fragrance and essential oils, that it would be a winner! Fragrance irritates my skin
