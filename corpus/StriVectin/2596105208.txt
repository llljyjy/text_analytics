I’m in my mid 30s , with some light dark circling and fine line concerns . The c-dark eye brightening applies well when lightly blotted under my eyes and it definitely helps brighten my under eyes . Texture itself is creamy and bright so little light tapping goes along ways . Doesn’t crepe either so nice and smooth under my eyes. Great at brightening my under eyes
