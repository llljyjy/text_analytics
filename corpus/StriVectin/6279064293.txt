This is a watery/ gel like consistency. It quickly absorbs. No heavy feeling, but a very slightly sticky feeling after use. The sticky feeling is very slight and does fade. It has no scent. Layers well  with my skincare and makeup without pilling. I experienced no irritation after using. I like the pump application and bright packaging. I love that this tackles both cool and warm toned dark circles. I notice a slight difference after just a few days of use, I can also see my sun spot by the corner of my eye has lightened. So I can expect that a few weeks of consistency will produce great results. Light weight and non irritating!
