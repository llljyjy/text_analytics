I love this brand but new to this product. And as a busy, tired momma I am always looking for something good to help with dark circles! After trying this Super C Dark Circle Brightening Eye Serumâ€¦so far so good! I use it in my morning and night routine. It layers perfectly under my moisturizer and make up. It absorbs nicely and I love how lightweight it feels! And as of now, I can see that my under eye is brighter and my skin overall looks better. This product did not take away all of my dark circles, but definitely helps to improve them! And I plan on continuing to use it and see how good it can get! nan
