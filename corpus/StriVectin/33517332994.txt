This is such a great product. I love the idea of having something that focuses on the neck, and this build-it roller is amazing. It’s metallic so it feels cold when massaging which is really nice and I’m sure helps it work better. The serum itself is lightweight, absorbs well and smells nice. Great serum with the massager
