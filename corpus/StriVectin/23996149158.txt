I’m a lifelong Strivectin fan. Their tightening eye serum and neck cream are two products that I’ve been using for a long time and cannot recommend enough. I was super psyched to see them release this contouring moisturizer because their formulas clearly work. I haven’t used this long enough to see a difference yet, but from my experience with this brand, it won’t be long before I start seeing results nan
