This is the best product I have ever put on my skin!  I’m 22, and it completely got rid of my acne and brightened my skin.  It does have a scent, but it doesn’t irritate my super sensitive skin so that’s helpful.  I only use this at night, and during the day I used barrier protecting products, it is definitely possible to use too much and get retinol burn (I’ve never met a lesson I didn’t learn the hard way) but I find it fits well into a routine. nan
