I’ve been trying this neck tightening serum for about 12 days now. Application is super easy - the roller method attached to the bottle is convenient and I don’t have to get any product on my hands. The serum is non sticky and soaks in nicely, plus the cooling from the roller feels really nice.I haven’t noticed a lot of change, I figure that takes some time - but my necks has felt smoother, but not necessarily tighter yet. Easy to Use
