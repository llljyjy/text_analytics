Surprised to see so many poor reviews, this has transformed my neck and décolleté in a couple months of using. Postpartum and nursing made my skin crepey with fine lines.. I used coconut oil, bio oil, and silicone sheet masks which didn’t do much.  Got the small size and loved it that I purchased the larger in the VIB sale. Will continue to use and is now a daily skin care staple — only need the smallest amount, so a little really does go a long way. HG status
