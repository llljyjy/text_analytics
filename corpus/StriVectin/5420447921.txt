I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion, as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador.  I was hesitant about this product at first. It wasn’t until I used it for a couple of weeks where I could feel and see a difference on my neck.  As someone in their 30s I am trying to help tighten my neck and prevent anymore fine lines and wrinkles. This serum with the roller is great at tightening the area but works even better when you use the neck cream on top daily. I haven’t seen any new lines forming and it’s helping the lines I have now not get any worse. Must try
