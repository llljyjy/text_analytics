I think the Strivetin Contour Restore Tightening & Sculpting Face Cream is quite good. It feels creamy and lightweight. Spreads easily and feels instantly hydrating and moisturizing. Though I do need to layer a bit for lasting moisture. It absorbs fairly quickly and I do feel a slight tightening sensation. It makes my skin feel and look more plump. And in the short amount of time I’ve used it (two weeks), I’ve definitely noticed firmer and more toned skin. nan
