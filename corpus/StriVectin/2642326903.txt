I received this product complimentary of Strivectin. I was super excited to see a retinol moisturizer as I am starting to add more anti aging items to my skincare routine. Just a heads up if you have sensitive acne prone skin like me, this may cause breaks out (based on some of the ingredients). Unfortunately, it did not work for me  (acne). However, I shared this with my mom who loved it. She advised that it was quite moisturizing and helped with fine wrinkles. Not for sensitive skin, but overall works well
