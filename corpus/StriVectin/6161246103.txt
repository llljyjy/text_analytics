I’ve been using this product for almost 2 weeks now. So far I really love the formula, it’s very lightweight and you don’t need much to cover the whole area, so it’ll last for a long time. It has this kind of unique massager which I now use intend of my guasha. My neck seems to be more toned and I can’t wait to see the results after a whole month of using! Love it!
