I’ve had the chance to try this out for a while and so far I’ve been liking it! Very light taste ( not super flavorful but tastes good and probably would be good to mix into something like a smoothie or seltzer!). I haven’t noticed any external change because of it but with consistent use I’ll be able to see if it does impact. nan
