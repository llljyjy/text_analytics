I absolutely LOVE the way this lip butter makes my lips feel. With that said, I do have to say that I am not a fan of the scent. It was definitely not the scent I expected. I was also rather disappointed in how much product you get. I was surprised when I realized I had hit the end. I enjoyed it while it lasted, but $18 is a little steep for the amount you get. I will not be purchasing this again, but if you can justify the price, I say go for it! Picture is empty and rolled all the way down. nan
