I love lip balms, and this one is now one of my favourite! I did not expect it to be so big!!! Compare to the average chapsticks, this one is x2 the size. I’ve read reviews saying how it smells like the bum bum cream but it doesn’t smell as sweet as the cream. The only downside is how much product is actually in the bottle, it might be because it is physically bigger but still a great product for what it is! Worth it!!!
