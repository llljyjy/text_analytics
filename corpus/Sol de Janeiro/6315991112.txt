I’ve been using this lip balm for years! it’s always been the one I come back to! So moisturizing and smells amazing! To me the price isn’t that bad compared to alot of other brands out there, it’s also going to last forever! I love the packaging as it’s easy to spot in my purse! Sol de Janeiro please don’t ever discontinue this! Holy Grail lip balm!!
