OH MY GOD the scent. Cheirosa 62… who??? This is not the same scent. I thought I loved Cheirosa 62 but once I opened this and smelled it I never wanna smell anything else as long as I live. It is a dessert on your lips but with no weird taste in your mouth. Wow. I wish I could describe it but I can’t. Maybe it’ll come to me and I can edit this review… Cheirosa 62 Who??
