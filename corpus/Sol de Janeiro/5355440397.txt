love this lip balm. It smells great and it keeps my lips moisturized. my ONLY issue with it is that you get so little product for the price. $24 for such a small amount of product is ridiculous. The tube is very deceiving, it’s not like a glue stick where it goes all the way down. the full stick of balm is maybe the length from the top of the tube to the line above “Brazilian Kiss”If you’re going to charge that much at least give me $24 with of product, then it would be more worth it (lip balm in picture has already been used for a while, but the full amount is a little more than that) great balm, not enough product for the price
