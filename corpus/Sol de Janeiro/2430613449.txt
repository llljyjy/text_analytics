It smells good like the bum bum cream annnd that’s the only good thing I have to say. I find it doesn’t moisturize very well, and while the tube is big like a glue stick, there is hardly any product in it. I twisted it all the way up when I opened it and was so disappointed for the price and the size of the tube. It’s big and deceiving. I wouldn’t buy this again. not a win
