I have super dry lips and I was hoping it can help with it. But apparently it does not. I feel it’s only on the surface of my lips without hydrating it inside. Plus, although the fragrance is pleasant, it’s a bit too strong for something on your lips. Overall, I think it’s not worth the price. Good smell but not that effective
