I received this as a gift will let me tell you what it really feels like silk on your lips and this is a huge tube which probably explains the high price, because this will last you a LONG time.  It does not smell like their original bumbum formula but it does have a pleasant vanilla scent to it.  However it gives you a glossy finish that makes you natural lip color stand out so this could double as a moisturizing gloss nan
