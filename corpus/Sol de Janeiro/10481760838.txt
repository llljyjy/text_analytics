I am an avid Sol de Janeiro user. I use the body wash, lotion, deodorant and hand sanitizer. So I figured I would love the chapstick. Unfortunately this chapstick is literally a sample size when you roll it up to show all the product and it also only moisturized my lips for maybe 5 mins. The smell is amazing as expected and I would 100% repurchase if it was 8-9$. But for the price it is, this is a rip off. If I use 2 times a day it might last me a month TOPS. Another downside is the size, it’s about twice the size of a normal chapstick so it doesn’t quite sit well in my bag. nan
