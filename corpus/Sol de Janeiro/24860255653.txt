I’m... obsessed!! I’ve seen a few reviews saying that it’s too big for a lip chap but I think it’s great value! for the price, it makes sense to me.. the feeling is so smooth I can smother it on and it feels so good! the scent is classic and amazing.. very happy with Sol De Janeiro products, especially this lip chap and the hair mask! great value!
