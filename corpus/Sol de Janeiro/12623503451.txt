If you are a fan of Sol De Janeiro products this is a must-try. The first thing that will surprise you is it’s size. Forget standard size balms; this is closer to a glue stick. Some have complained about the length of balm in the tube, but you must take circumference into account. This is twice as wide as a standard balm. A standard chapstick is 4 grams and this is 6.2. The second thing that will hit you is it’s smell. It smells absolutely amazing. Glides right on. Good longevity and leaves lips very soft. This can repair damage to dry lips. After buying one I immediately purchased another as I wanted one for my work desk and another for my bag. I’m sure going forward I will never be without one of these. Love this. nan
