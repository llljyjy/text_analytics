These patches are fun to have on because of the glitter, but….the glitter comes off which I think is a bad idea so close to the eyes, the patches are already starting to dry out in the container and I only opened it a few weeks ago, they don’t really seem to do much-I don’t notice any kind of change once I take them off. nan
