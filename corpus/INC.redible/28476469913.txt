Honestly, I decided to give these a chance because they’re not crazy overpriced and they come with a lot of positive feedback. First, if you have sensitive skin the cooling sensation might be to much; I can see why some individual describe it as “burning”. However if you can get past that then you’re absolutely going to love the benefits. My eyes felt amazing! I wish effects lasted a bit longer but for getting rid of puffy eyes in the morning it worked wonderfully. I would have given it more stars but they do not stay still! If you can manage to keep them in place for the 20-30mins just know you probably won’t be doing alot of moving. Be Still!!
