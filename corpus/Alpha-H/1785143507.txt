This cleanser has a subtle pleasant scent and it is gentle. It doesn’t strip out all the moisture and natural oil from your face like many other cleansers, but still does a good job cleansing. I personally don’t like that squeaky clean feeling because that means the cleanser is too harsh and stripped out your skin. This cleanser does not do that! Plus it comes in a big tube! Very impressed!
