I wrongly assumed this was just glorified water, glycolic acid and licorice in a bottle - it is a VERY basic ingredients list, however, this small combination of ingredients all seems to work together somehow. I use this on an evening straight after my toner has dried, by applying with a cotton pad and then once dried I skip the night cream and just leave this on to work. Yes it does tingle, for me I managed to reduce this by gently patting the liquid on instead of swiping it over my face and neck. It isn’t magic, if your skin is used to stronger concentrations of glycolic you could probably give this a miss (it’s only 5%). I find it just sufficient to refine my skin texture and give a subtle brightening effect yet without any kind of irritation. I have to stress the results were not overnight, it did take a full 1 week before I could visibly see a difference but considering how gentle it was on my skin, the wait was not an issue. Also very good as an acne treatment. I just apply a drop to any (non-cystic) bump that appears and it flattens it literally overnight! Long term I wouldn’t want to use this daily, due to the high alcohol content, but every now and again this is perfect for a quick brightening and refining ’reset’ between using other products. ~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~(My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)1.
