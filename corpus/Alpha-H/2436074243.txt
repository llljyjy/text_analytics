I’ve been loving Alpha H products and wanted to try this one and add it to my regime if I liked it. I had tried their other liquid gold serum and definitely prefer this one. I like that it is thicker and smoother it feels very soothing after I wash my face for bed. It is comfortable to go to sleep in and I love products where you still feel it on your skin when you wake up, which I do with this one. The fact you only need to put it on every few days is nice too because it’ll last longer. I do feel like I’ve seen results from it in just making my skin look and feel more even toned as well. I do recommend this product! Great addition to your skin care regime
