Surprisingly gentle and non-stinging, even around my nose and chin which are more sensitive than the rest of my face. I have only gone halfway through my first bottle but already see results. My skin is noticeably smoother in the morning and brighter. I also incorporate retinol and vitamin C in my routine, as well as the occasional treatment with alpha arbutin and tranexamic acid, so for me to notice any brightening on top of that is remarkable. Highly recomend trying it out. I almost didnâ€™t due to the alcohol in it but really I had nothing to worry about. Drunk Elephant products sting so much more than this does. Worth a try, the hype is real for me
