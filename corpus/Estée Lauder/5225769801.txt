I received a small “tester” size of this essence to test for my honest review. I was initially concerned that it would be fragranced and my skin can be sensitive. Thankfully, there is no scent, at least from what I can tell. In my opinion, this essence did not stand out to me. The packaging needs to be improved, it was very hard to control how much dispenses from the container. It essentially just has a screw on lid and you can pour out the product. A dropper spout would be an improvement. For the small amount I received, it felt very wasteful every time I tried to use it, even when I was trying to be careful. I didn’t notice any negative effects on my skin, but I also did not notice any positive or noticeable differences either. For the cost of this essence, I would say pass on it. I’m a true skincare junkie and I was intrigued to add an essence to my routine, but this one did not impress me. Maybe with prolonged use it would show some results, but the size I was given was just too small to say! Take it or leave it
