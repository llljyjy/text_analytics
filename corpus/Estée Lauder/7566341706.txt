I received a sample of this complimentary from Influenster & I’m so glad I did!  Yall I think I’m in love with this face cream!  It has some of the most powerful Anti-Aging ingredients in it tht ESTEE LAUDER has ever discovered!  Moringa Plant also know as the “tree of life” is one of them.  In just4 weeks they claim it will give y more radiant skin, skin will feel nourished & lines & wrinkles will look reduced!  I’ve used a dime size amount spread over my entire face every night for about 3 weeks now.  I love the high end luxurious skincare scent it has!  & it feels luxurious every time I apply it to my face!  It immediately makes my skin feel soft, smooth, & hydrated!  I absolutely love it!  My face hasn’t gotten dry & flakey due to the cold winter temperatures & the sharp bite of the winter winds! My face does feel & look more firm!  & I definitely have noticed my fine lines looking softer & softer to the point I can barely see them!  This cream is a win win in my book! It’s a face cream for all skin types that want younger looking skin & it really does live up to all it’s claims! In Love With This Face Cream!
