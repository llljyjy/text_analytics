I received this product in exchange for an honest review. I like the pleasant light smell. It is thick and luxurious feeling and absorbs into the skin quickly without leaving a greasy residue. It did not give me any issues when I applied my concealer over it which sometimes happens. I would overall recommend it, but for the price I will stick with my no 7 face cream. Luxurious and super moisturizerizing!
