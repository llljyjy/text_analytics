I received this in exchange for a review. Unfortunately, I can’t tell if it’s a winner or not because the sample was so small. I think it was supposed to be for a week, but it barely lasted that long. The toner smells great and did make my skin feel soft, but it wasn’t very moisturizing enough. And again, I didn’t use it enough to see a difference.  Maybe for someone with oily skin it would be better Sample too small to tell
