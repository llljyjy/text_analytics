I was blessed to be able to try this brand for FREE from influenster and esteelauder. I was happy to use it and give them my honest opinion on it.So here it is. It goes on so smoothly and feels really silky on the skin. It seems like it would be great for dry skin. My issue is that it smells like flowers and it gives me a migraine. So I will not be able to use it. But I will pass it on to my mom to try. Thank you. Wish I loved it.
