I received a sample size of this for an honest review.   I’ve been using it for a about a week now and here are my observations. -it doesn’t leave a very heavy film on my face like some moisture cremes.  It really blends in well.-the creme doesn’t have a strong smell at all.-while I haven’t been using it long, I’ve noticed some of the lines in my face look less severe. Overall I really like this creme.  I’ll probably purchase it in the future. Supreme+ Creme
