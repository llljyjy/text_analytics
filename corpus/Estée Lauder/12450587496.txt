I loved how this was more of a gel consistency. The gel consistency helped it stay put exactly where you put it. It was smooth and it made my skin feel great. I also noticed my dark circles significantly diminished and definitely looked more awake. I have only been applying it once at night. It can be applied morning and night, but I don’t necessarily feel that is needed. I have noticed some more pimples popping up but I’m not sure they are related to the eye cream. I did receive this product complementary from Influenster for testing purposes. No more dark circles
