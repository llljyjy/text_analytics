I received this product for free an exchange for my honest review. I have more mature skin that’s dry and sensitive and in menopause which has caused such a change in my skin. I’m a big fan of the Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair which I use several times a week. I incorporated this cream into my evening routine due to its rich and creamy texture and thought it would be a bit too heavy for daytime use. It glides on to the skin smoothly and sinks in quickly without leaving any greasiness behind and it didn’t cause any irritation on my skin. It is very moisturizing so a little bit goes a long way! The sample I received was small so I was only able to use it for a short time so though I didn’t see major results, it did make my skin feel soft, supple, refreshed with a nice glow. Very moisturizing!
