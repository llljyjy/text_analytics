I received a sample for my honest review. After using this for about 3 weeks, I honestly haven’t seen much improvement on my under eye circles. I would say that maaaaybe they have gotten a tiny bit lighter, but on some nights that I would apply this it would leave kind of a burning sensation. Not extremely bad, just red and irritating. It may be tolerable to some but for ppl with more sensitive skin like mine I don’t recommend. In my opinion, I don’t think it lightened my dark circles enough to put up with the irritation it caused. Estée Lauder actually has another eye cream formula that works much better. Other crème formula is better than this gel one
