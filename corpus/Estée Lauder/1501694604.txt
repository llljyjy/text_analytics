It’s so hard to tell how effective a face cream is without prolonged use, but after a few weeks of use this cream is going strong for the most part. I received a sample size from Influener in exchange for a review. For me, pros include: a light but luxurious gel-like consistency that absorbs well, immediate lifting and tightening effect, a light and unobtrusive fragrance that’s only detectable upon application, and the list of natural ingredients - all at fairly high percentage levels - hibiscus morning bloom, moringa, cactus extract. The only real con is that it’s difficult to ascertain what long term results might be like. I 100% recommend getting a sample if you can to test on your own skin! Great consistency for those who like gel creams
