I’m a big fan of Estée Lauder creams and serums. This was a nice consistency and made my under eyes feel hydrated. It didn’t do much for my dark circles but certainly left my under eyes less dry than they’ve been in the past. Only needed to use a small amount at a time so it will last awhile. Good hydration
