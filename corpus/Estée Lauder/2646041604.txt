I received this as a free sample for my honest review. I have fair & sensitive skin and recently started noticing some light eye lines. I started using this along with my usual skincare routine each night. I noticed a difference with the eye lines and my skin’s feel within 2 days. My skin look firmer, skin tone was brighter & it feels so incredibly soft. I haven’t had any breakouts or irritations at all. I’ve already started recommending this moisturizer to a few of my friends. Definitely give this one a try!! Hydrating, Firmer & Softer
