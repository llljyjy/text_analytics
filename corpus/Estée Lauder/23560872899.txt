I used this morning and night after cleansing in lieu of my regular moisturizer.  It has a very subtle fragrance that is pleasant, and a few dabs of the moisturizer will go along way so apply small amounts and work that in before adding more. It does moisturize my face and once absorbed leaves a velvety matte like finish. Due to the sample size, I canâ€™t attest to any long term effects, but I did truly love the way it left my skin feeling after applying it. Velvety matte finish
