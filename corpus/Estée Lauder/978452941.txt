For the moisturizer, I am torn. It’s nice - it’s rich and thick yet feels lightweight and melts quickly into your skin. It leaves it feeling fresh, plumped, and hydrated for quite some time. However, the scent is a stronger floral scent - and while I think it’s nice, I would prefer it had been dialed back by about 80%.  I can get whiffs of it for the first few hours after applying, and thanks to my perfume obsession, I’d rather smell my fragrance of the day vs my skincare. The cream is supposed to revitalize your skin, help with dry patches, firmness, and elasticity. It’s too soon to tell, but it’s nice and plays well under makeup. Thanks to influenster and Estée Lauder for the sample to test! It’s a strong like!
