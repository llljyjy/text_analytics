I received this product for free for honest review. This is a nice eye cream. It has a gel texture, which at first I could definitely feel, but it soaked into the skin very fast. It made my under eye area feel very moisturized and nice. It wasn’t too much for my skin, it didn’t cause any problems. I like it. I like it!
