I absolutely love this daywear moisturizer. It leaves your face feeling moisturized which is a must in the unpredictable weather without feeling greasy. It works great under a full face or wear it alone. It really makes your skin few rehydrated and fresh without the gloss that some moisturizer leave behind. I also love that a little goes a long way. One of the most have moisturizer of 2022
