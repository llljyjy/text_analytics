I liked it so much that I used it completely in a week.  I liked how it left my face soft and hydrated.  It has a super soft texture that does not leave the skin greasy.  its aroma is also super light.  Too bad it was a very small sample.  but I am happy to have tried it for sure I will buy it later.  highly recommended.  I really liked the packaging, both the material and its color make it look very elegant. Great sample
