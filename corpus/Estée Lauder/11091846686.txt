I had received this product from Influenser and Estée Lauder for my honest review. After incorporating this in my routine for 2 weeks I can say I love the consistency! It’s nice and thick but not sticky at all. It leaves my skin feeling plump, soft, and hydrated. I have acne prone skin and I didn’t notice any extra irritation at all. I applied with my fingers and worked like a charm. The scent was a bit much for me but I personally don’t like the rose like scent. Just not my cup of tea. It’s not too strong or anything like that, it’s just a preference. I would recommend this product because it does feel luxury but the price tag is a big luxury as well. nan
