I’ve been using the Estée LauderSoft Clean Infusion Hydrating Treatment Lotion daily in place of my regular toner and I really enjoy it! My skin is usually normal/dry and this has definitely been helping my dry areas! I like the somewhat thicker consistency and I really enjoy the scent even though it’s pretty fragrant and to be honest, smells a lot like fabric softener. This treatment lotion really hydrates on contact and it feels amazing! My skin just looks and feels so refreshed after application. I would definitely repurchase this! So hydrating!
