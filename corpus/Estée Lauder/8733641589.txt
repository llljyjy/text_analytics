From the very first time I tried this, I’ve been wowed by how it leaves my skin noticeably softer, smoother & all without that typical greasy feeling other moisturizers leave. I’m so very pleased with the immediate results and the supple velvety finish that it gives my skin. It’s never heavy feeling and smells divine. I’m adding this into my regular routine ASAP! Holy WOW Found My New Fave!
