This is Estēe Lauder’s newest skincare creation. I’ve always personally enjoyed the quality of the products I’ve historically tried from Estēe Lauder, so this was exciting! This creme features pioneering ingredients to instantly hydrate the skin, as well as provide a subtle glow. With consistency, it evidently increases the skin’s firmness, strength, and lift. The texture of the creme is very rich and plush. As for its consistency - it’s a structured product that doesn’t run when placed in position. It has a particularly strong fragrance, one that is characteristic of other Estēe Lauder moisturizers. I applied this creme by applying small hunks directly to several areas of my face, and then fully spread it out and rubbed it in with my hands. Immediately, it felt sumptuous and distinctive of a higher-end skincare product. I experienced no issues awaiting the creme to absorb. It did not take long for it to fully dry-down, and I was unquestionably left with a beautiful glow to my skin. It doesn’t further leave any residue, which could become a conflict for potential makeup application. I believe that if you are of a normal, combination, or dry skin-type - you would benefit the most from this product. There is NOTHING to report regarding factors that I didn’t enjoy. Great Product - Normal/Combo/Dry Skin
