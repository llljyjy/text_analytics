I was so excited to receive this product free for testing through Influenster. I was completely unimpressed after trying the product. It has a very strong perfume scent that is quite overpowering on your face. Additionally, it states super hydrating and it is completely not. I had to apply additional moisturizer after application. Overall, I was sadly disappointed which shocked me because I love so many of their other products. Completely Unimpressed
