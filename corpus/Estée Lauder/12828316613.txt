I really enjoyed this cream. It soaked in well and did not leave my skin feeling oily. Which is a big thing for me because most creams leave me feeling like an oily mess. I did not break out from this at all. Now I did only put it on my problem areas and not all over , but I would still definitely recommend this. Nice surprise
