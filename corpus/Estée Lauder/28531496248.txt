I received a complimentary sample of this cream from Estée Lauder & Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I’ve always loved EL products and nearly every product I’ve tried has been worth it. Immediately after using this cream, I did notice a slight improvement in my dark under eye circles. After using it for nearly a month, I haven’t seen any major changes to my skin & face. Underwhelming eye cream
