I received a sample of this lotion free from INFLUENSTER  and I was overall pleased. It does have a strong fragrance however I love how it made my skin feel. It’s a pretty thin liquid type lotion so it absorbed quickly and left my skin with a shiny/satin finish. I feel there is better lotion for combination skin however it worked pretty well. it’s ok
