I received a complimentary sample from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Light barely noticeable scented moisturizer that quickly absorbed into my skin. I felt a little sticky afterwards but it wasn’t that bad. I didn’t feel the moisture level lasted as long as other similar products but might be sufficient for someone who doesn’t have a high intensity job. nan
