I received this product to test out for free from @influenster and @esteelauder in exchange for my honest review.  The Estee Lauder Revitalizing Supreme +youth power creme moisturizer is a nice one.  It goes on smoothly, makes skin feel great and has a nice smell to it as well.  It doesn’t leave my skin oily and didn’t have any breakouts.  The small sample received I don’t believe was enough to use long enough to see results in firming or anything, but I would buy this product to use as a daily and nighlty moisturizer. Great moisturizer
