I really liked this product, I received it complimentary for my honest review. Provides good hydration to my skin. The product is awesome. Itâ€™s clean and not too thick which makes it a breeze to apply. It is somewhat unscented and I appreciate that. Price is a bit high for the size and results but you cant go wrong using estee lauder. Great! A bit expensive
