Used it in my Korean 9 steps skin care. The scent smells great (like rose water), very subtle not too over powering. I leaves my skin hydrated, light. The product is fast-absorbing.Overall, I liked it. But it’s hard to say whether it has made a difference, I was given a really small amount to try, maybe 3 days supply, so I’m not going to comment on the effectiveness. But the texture is good, smells nice and didn’t have ay breakout. nan
