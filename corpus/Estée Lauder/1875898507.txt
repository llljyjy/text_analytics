This is the most luxurious and thick moisturizer I have used in a while. I love their products across-the-board for skin care so I had really high hopes that this would perform well and it did. It is not highly fragrant so perfect for someone who is sensitive to smells but it does have a pleasant smell to it that isn’t overwhelming. I’ve been using it primarily at night before bed because it is a thicker consistency and I find that when I wake up in the morning my skin is plump and bright. Perfect for Dry Skin!
