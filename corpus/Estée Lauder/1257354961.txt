I received this sample from Estee Lauder & Influenster in exchange for my honest review.  Being 100% honest here, this stuff makes my skin feel so soft! I sometimes use Vaseline overtop moisturizer before bed (the kids these days are calling this “slugging“, wasn’t even aware there was a name for it or that it was trending) - however, with this stuff, I don’t feel the need to use Vaseline over it. It’s so thick, silky, & moisturizing.  I do have to wash my face like normal the next morning - I don’t think I could get away with not doing that, but my fave afterwards is so soft! This doesn’t break me out either. A little bit of this stuff goes a long way, but adding a little more doesn’t hurt either! I wouldn’t be able to wear this during the day under my make-up,  but it is seriously perfect as my last step before bed. I’ll be splurging on this for myself for sure. Super soft skin!
