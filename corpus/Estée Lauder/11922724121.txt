I received this complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I wasn’t really a fan. It felt heavy on my skin. I think if you have very dry skin it may work for you. I also wasn’t a huge fan of the scent but I’m sure plenty of people would be. I have combo skin and occasionally have acne so I don’t think it’s the right product for my skin Not my favorite
