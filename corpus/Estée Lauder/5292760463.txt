This is a good nighttime moisturizer, and especially on dry areas. I have combo skin and only apply it to my cheeks where I have dryness issues. I like the smell most days--smells like aloe mixed with sunscreen--but some days it can be kind of overwhelming. Something to keep in mind for my babes out there with scent sensitivities. It’s a solid moisturizer, but for the price point, I don’t think I would purchase this myself (got it for free thru influenster) once I run out; if i wear it during the day, my skin feels heavy and greasy by the end of it, so I feel like I can only use this when I’m about to go to bed. It’s great under foundation though, provides a really nice moisture barrier and is very helpful for days after you’ve slept in your makeup (don’t judge me--we’ve all had those days) and your face looks  r o u g h  afterwards. Smells good, leaves me feeling kind of greasy
