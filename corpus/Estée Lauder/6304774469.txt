I am familiar with this eye cream because I’ve used it in the pass. But life happened and I for got about it along the way. I’m so glad I was reintroduce back into using this eye cream. Now with kids, good night sleep or even full sleep in nearly impossible.  So I have bags and the mom tired face, I’ve been looking for something to help me with all that. Since using this I’ve noticed my eyes don’t look as tired and I feel and can see noticeable improvement.  I’ve used it for few weeks straight and it helping me. The texture is nice and light. Over really happy with it. nan
