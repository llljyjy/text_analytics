I received a sample of Estée Lauder’s new Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme free to try for my honest opinion. I love it! It is a bit thicker than some other products I have used so it takes a little more. It has a very nice scent to it. It is very hydrating to my dry skin so that is a huge plus! You can feel the instant hydration as soon as it is applied. It doesn’t leave my skin feeling ‘greasy’ after use either. I noticed a ‘glow’ to my face after applying as well. By the time I finished the sample size bottle I started noticing firmer skin on my face which is nice. I will definitely be purchasing a full size bottle to continue use & I do recommend! Very nice
