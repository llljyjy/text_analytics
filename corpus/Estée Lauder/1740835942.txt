I wanted to like this product, however, I did not notice any difference on my skin, after using this product. I did also not like the gel/cream consistency of this cream. It seemed to me that after I applied this cream on my face, it did not soak into the epidermis of skin; instead, it felt it sat on top of my skin like a blanket. The scent also was not appealing. nan
