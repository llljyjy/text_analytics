I received a sample of this product. I tried during a heavy winter month,  where I had recently spent a larger amount of time out in the elements in a large city.I did notice a lingering light scent which I believe was from the exclusive Mornings Extract & New Hibiscus Morning Bloom Extract. When I added my layer of foundation & powder,  the light scent basically resolved the slight annoyance. My skin did feel dewy for a longer duration during my day when used then my usual cream/firming lotion.  I am very fond of my previous creme but may switch over in the next coming month , after I utilize the rest of my sample. Left a Dewy feeling
