The consistency of this product is great, very lightweight and smooth which makes it easy to wear overnight. A lot of other night creams feel super heavy and I don’t like waking up and feeling like my eyes are heavy. I’ve been using this product for about a month and not sure if I see results really. It might just be subtle. It’s worth a try if you are looking for eye cream. nan
