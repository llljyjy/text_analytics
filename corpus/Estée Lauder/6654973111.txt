First of all, this gel-crème is the cleanest formula I’ve found that brightens dark circles and it has the best and quickest results!  It took only 1 week to notice my under-eyes (and corners) changed from dark circle city to bright and popping!  I do not have fine lines or wrinkles, so I cannot speak to that.  There is no scent to it, the texture is like a velvet gel and a nice dab will do ya…I love this and have replaced my eye previous product with this one! Love this!  Brightens like a dream!
