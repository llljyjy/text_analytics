I’ve been using this eye cream for a few weeks, and I think my under eye circles are a bit lighter, but I don’t think it reduced the puffiness at all. My under eye area does seem moisturized, but for the price, I would like to see a more noticeable change. I like the formula consistency; it’s thick and goes on super smoothly, and it’s a clear color so it doesn’t look weird. Overall, I think it’s a good product, I’m just not blown away by it. nan
