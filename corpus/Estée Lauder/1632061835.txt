I cry a lot. Like, a lot a lot. I’m just a big sensitive marshmallow, okay? And as the brilliant singer-songwriter Bonnie Whitmore said, no one really wants to **** with sad girls. Do I like that it’s the way it is? No. Is that how things work, because We Live In A Society? Yes. Anyways, I was maybe mildly skeptical of this cream, because I’ve never used an eye cream in my life. It felt nice upon applying, though, so I was intrigued. And then, one day, after a slight mental breakdown (I don’t remember what it was about, and wouldn’t tell the whole internet anyway), I applied it before bed. And boom. It immediately soothed my eyes. Reduced the puffiness, took the post-sad burning feeling away immediately, and made me almost forget that I’d been crying at all. It felt like sorcery. 10/10, will definitely make this both a part of my regular routine and part of trying to turn my frowns upside down in future. Fancy cream for sad people
