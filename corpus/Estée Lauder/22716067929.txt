Upon opening the bottle, I noticed the strong scent, which after having this product on my face for a while became almost nauseating. I used this after cleansing and exfoliating my face. I did not use a serum or cream before applying this because it was so thick. It takes about 5 min to completely absorb into the skin. My skin felt moisturized and soft but it became greasy after running some errands. I also noticed small whiteheads on my sensitive skin. I only was able to get 4 uses out of the small sample size I received so I wasnâ€™t able to notice any benefit. I received this product as a complimentary sample in return for my honest review. JUST OK
