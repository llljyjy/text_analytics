I find this eye cream to be very hydrating. It applies on nicely with no tugging or pulling and doesn’t irritate the sensitive skin around my eyes. I don’t notice any over the top amazing results from using it and it is pretty pricey for the amount of product you get. But A+ for hydration. Very Hydrating
