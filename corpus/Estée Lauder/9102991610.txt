I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Ester Lauder for review with my honest feedback.I’ve enjoyed this - it seems like it’s been good for my dry skin. I’ve found I reach for it in days I’m not wearing makeup since it helps tone down my redness and makes my skin feel smoother. Pretty good!
