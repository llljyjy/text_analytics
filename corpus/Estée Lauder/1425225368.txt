When I first opened it the fragrance was subtle and I didn’t mind it. The creme was bouncy and thick but not too thick. I applied my toner and serum first. I only needed a small amount for each side of my face. The application was very smooth and it felt like silk on my face. After application I immediately noticed that my skin was and appeared bright and hydrated, and the fine lines around my mouth and between my brows were reduced. I have combination oily skin and I didn’t have a problem with oily skin during the day. For the entirety of the day I felt hydrated. I can’t say that this made my skin feel stronger because I’ve only used it one time. I always wear moisturizer and I was eager to try this one and was glad I did! This is definitely a product that I would purchase. Radiant skin
