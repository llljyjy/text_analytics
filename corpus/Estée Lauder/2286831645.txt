I have oily skin and as I’ve gotten older I have noticed more lines and wrinkles. I have been using this product for the last weeks and it’s a great moisturizer. It’s lightweight and non sticky.  It absorbs into my skin and my makeup glides right over. It’s very nourishing and I have noticed my fine lines around my eyes have decreased slightly. Try it, you'll love it
