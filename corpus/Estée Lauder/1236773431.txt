I received this compliments of Influenster for my honest review and sadly I was not overly impressed. It was a nice thick moisturizer but as far as helping improve texture, Tone and fine lines...I saw no difference of course I only had a mini size so maybe over a very long period of time rather than 3 weeks that I’ve tried it, there may have been a difference but I wouldn’t have high hopes. It also had a strong floral smell that I did not find appealing. Feels Luxurious But No Results
