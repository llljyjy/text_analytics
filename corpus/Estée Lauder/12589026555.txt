I was gifted this as part of a mini campaign. Love the size of it as it’s perfect for travel but also a little of this goes a long way. I have normal skin and I love a thick cream which I think this is pretty rich. The smell is strong but enjoyable. Definitely will be keeping this in my morning regimen during winter time. My only concern is that the 25 SPF isn’t enough for summertime and I don’t really want to layer a second sunscreen over this. I think this will be a winter staple when I don’t really go outside much and need the extra hydration Smells great
