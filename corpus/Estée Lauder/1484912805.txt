I recieved this product free from influenster for my honest review. This moisturizer smells and feels good. There is a fragrance  but not overwhelming. I used it in tbe morning under makeup with no issues with it affecting the wear time of foundation. My skin is dry and it did help the look and feel after applying. I had a small sample so I did not have any dramatic skin transformation, I think with time it would improve skin texture. nan
