This eye cream was pretty good I did feel it moisturizing, but didn’t have enough product to test it for longer time. A little goes a long way and if you are looking for an eye creme that moisturizes then it isn’t bad to give it a try. It wasn’t the best for my skin personally since my skin is very sensitive so I couldn’t use it every day more like every other day. I don’t think I’d buy it again due to my skin but if you don’t have sensitive skin it’s worth trying. nan
