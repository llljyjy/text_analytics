I received  a free sample from Influenster and Est√©e Lauder for my honest opinion. Pros:forehead linereduction, fine line reduction, skin looks firmer and plumper, option to purchase product refills for the jar!  Con: felt a bit heavy on my skin. I might have just needed to use it a bit longer than the 2-3 weeks for my skin to get used to it more.  Overall my skin looked great so I do recommend it go the pros! Works well but is a bit heavy
