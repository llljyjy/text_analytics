I have been searching for a solid eye cream. From drug store brands to brands you’d find in a MedSpa/dermatology office. Nothing really wowed me. But THIS…I love the gel cream texture. It has a cooling effect that feels amazing. It absorbs so well and doesn’t get sticky or caky under the eye. This is definitely a must. Favorite Eye Cream
