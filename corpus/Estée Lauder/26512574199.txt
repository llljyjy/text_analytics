I have combination skin. My oily spots tend to get more greasy with this moisturizer but it’s really hydrating. It goes on pretty thick. I really haven’t noticed any long term effects of this moisturizer. It is pretty heavily scented, which I wasn’t a fan of. I probably wouldn’t buy it again. It was just okay.
