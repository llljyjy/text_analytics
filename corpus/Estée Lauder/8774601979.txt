This is lovely!! I have medium toned skin, and first of: thereâ€™s no whitecast! It smooths over your face like a light buttery cream, and blends in so good, it feels so luxurious! It has a super fresh scent, to me, it smells like cucumbers and cantaloupe. The smell is faint, but it reminds me of being in a healthy upscale spa. This feels so good on! After a few hours, it still feels good. The only only only reason I took off a star is because I would like the SPF to be higher. What is 15 SPF gonna do? Please make this into a higher SPF! Smells good, feels good, no whitecast
