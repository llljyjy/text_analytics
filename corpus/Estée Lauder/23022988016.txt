I received this product complimentary from Influenster for my honest opinion. This cream was really moisturizing and absorbed into my skin quickly. My skin felt soft and hydrated, but I noticed some blemishes after a few days in acne prone areas on my face. The formula is heavy and a little goes a long way. The fragrance is a bit strong at first, but doesnâ€™t last. nan
