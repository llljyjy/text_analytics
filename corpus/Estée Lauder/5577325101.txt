I received this product for free from Estée Lauder and Influenster to review. All opinions are my own. I really enjoyed this crème! As a mom to a toddler, expecting one, and a busy nurse, my skin definitely takes a toll. I have fine lines and winkles in my smile area, between my eyes and near the corner of my eyes. At 32 I am very self conscious about this. I love the fact that this crème is easy on my sensitive skin and that it leaves me looking awake, hydrated, and alive. I would absolutely recommend this to friends! nan
