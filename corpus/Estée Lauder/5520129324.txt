I received this product from Influenster in exchange for an honest review.  I loved the texture of this eye cream and it works really nicely.  All you need is a drop and it smooths fine lines.  It is very smooth, silky and hydrating.  Although it is a little pricey and I wish it came in a dropper style instead of a jar, I would definitely buy it again because it works well and a little goes a long way. nan
