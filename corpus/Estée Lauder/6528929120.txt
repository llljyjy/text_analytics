I received a sample size from Influenster in exchange for a review. I enjoyed using this moisturizer! It’s lightweight and silky. Didn’t leave my skin feeling greasy but also didn’t leave it feeling dry. I normally use a thicker moisturizer but this moisturized just as well. It soaks right in. It has a nice light scent. Left my face feeling fresh and gave me a nice youthful glow. I recommend it! Lightweight moisturizer!
