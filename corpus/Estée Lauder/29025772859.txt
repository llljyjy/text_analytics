I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. The size was very small, so I didn’t get a lot of use out of it. However, the scent is amazing and it’s a very soft feel. It’s not greasy at all, it spreads well and it was gentle on my sensitive skin. I took one star off because I didn’t notice any change in my skin, but perhaps it needed to be used longer with a larger sample. I did enjoy it! Smells great!
