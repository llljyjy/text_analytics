I recieved Estée LauderAdvanced Night Repair Eye Gel-Cream for free in exchange for my honest review from Influenster and Sephora. This eye gel cream has a very light texture. It’s very good at hydrating around the eye area. I have very dark circles that I have been struggling with since I was young. Within a few days of using this eye gel they started to fade considerably. I also really love that it contains hyaluronic acid. This product is a win for me. I’ve been spreading the word out about it to friends and family! Wonderful for dark circles!!
