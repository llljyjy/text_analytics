This cream is nice and moisturizing, it has a gel-like texture without being oily, which is an automatic deal breaker for me, as my face is already on the oily side normally. I like unscented facial products but love when they actually smell nice-- which this one does. It also contains all the ingredients that are all the rage right now: (hibiscus flower, moringa extract, hyaluronic acid, and cactus cells), which basically all target things like youth preserving, collagen boosting, moisturizing, and strengthening so I can see why this product is so popular. It’s also been my best friend’s mom’s go-to in her routine for years. My sample size is perfect for travel and I noticed a suppleness and less dullness during my use as well. All in all, would recommend! The Supreme creme
