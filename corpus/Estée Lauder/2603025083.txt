My skin instantly looked refreshed and dewy after just one use. I didn’t notice a firming effect as it says the cream does but I am hoping with prolonged use that that will eventually happen. The only downside to this cream is the $89 price tag. I really loved this sample but don’t know if I can justify spending $89 on it. If you don’t mind that price tag then I would highly recommend this cream. I certainly immediately noticed is a change in texture and hydration. My skin absorbs this easily without any greasy or cakey feeling. It immediately feels velvety smooth and hydrated. Overall a great night cream. Good night cream
