Got this product for free from Influenster. I tried this product on and off for 2 weeks at night. I like the texture of the product  it goes on easily and doesn’t have a heavy feel. After it’s applied there is no annoying stickiness. I don’t like the smell of the product and in fact, don’t know why companies keep putting fragrance in facial products. Really annoying. This product broke me out every single time I used it. This is the only different product I added, so I know it was from this. For that reason, I need to discontinue use Holy Breakouts!
