I got a sample size of this and used it up for 3 weeks. I love that it didn’t give me small bumps or little acne on my face. It does have a fragrance, but not too overwhelming. I actually love the smell, it’s sophisticated but not flowery or citrus-y. It actually moisturized my face and I live in MN where it’s mostly in the single digit weather and air is super dry. I didn’t see any firming on my skin since I only had it for 3 weeks. Lastly I’m not familiar with the ingredients so I can’t say it has benefits aside from giving moisture. Im just taking a star off because of the price. Good moisturizer
