I received a 0.17oz sample in exchange for an honest review. The sample only lasted a few days, so I can’t share an opinion on the long-term benefits. During the short period I used it, my skin stayed hydrated and I didn’t have any reactions.  It had a pleasant, clean smell and went on smoothly. Test sample; seems solid
