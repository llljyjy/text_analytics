I received this from influenster and have been using it for a few weeks now. It has an interesting texture, it looks and feels thinner than it applies. When you apply to skin it gets thicker. I find the scent to be strong and stays around for you to continue to smell it for awhile. Very floral. I feel like the cream sat on my face vs absorbed - which I think would make it a better night cream than night/day cream. I havenâ€™t seen any noticeable results and not sure that I would. Heavily Fragranced
