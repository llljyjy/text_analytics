I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. This moisturizer feels like luxury.  Really creamy and thick without being too heavy or greasy.  It’s great for my combination skin. It makes my skin feel really soft. I’ve preferred using it as a part of my nighttime skin care regimen.  When I wake up my skin feels really smooth and moisturized.  I would recommend it. Great part of my nighttime routine
