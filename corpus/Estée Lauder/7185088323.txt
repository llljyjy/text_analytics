I received a free sample of this product in an Influenster campaign. To be honest, I was initially disappointed because I have used an Estée Lauder toner in the past which left my skin burning and irritated. So my hopes for this we’re not very high. In fact, I was hesitant to even try it. However, once I mustered up the courage to try the product I was very pleasantly surprised! Unlike the previous toner I’d tried, this one was not in the least bit irritating to my sensitive skin. There was no burning, or even tingling sensation. In fact, it left my skin feeling mildly moisturized. There was no sticky film, or feeling of heavy residue at all. It even removed trace amounts of dirt/makeup that was left behind from the wash phase. Over all, I would recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin like mine! Surprisingly gentle!
