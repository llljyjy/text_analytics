I first used this during my mid twenties when ANR was still the original formula - before it underwent god knows how many reincarnations. Back then I used to find it would help a little with the odd acne mark that would appear every few weeks but did little else for my skin concerns. I was primarily using it in the hopes of some sort of defense against future ageing, but I can’t say whether or not it achieved anything, as once the bottle ran out I started using other products and then recently thought why not give it another go?So onto the latest version ’Synchronized Recovery Complex’ which I tried earlier this year. I don’t know if it’s the fact that ’Tocopherol Acetate’ (Vitamin E) has been pushed down to 30th place on ingredients list (used to be 13th), or whether it’s because ’Retinyl Palmitate (an ester of Vitamin A) has been completely removed from the new version, but this one didn’t do anything for acne marks whatsoever and I used it for over a month. It makes sense as both of those ingredients, especially Vitamin A in any form, are known to help fade marks. Add to that a whole host of new and unpronounceable ingredients and that probably explains why if anything I’d experienced even more breakouts when using this...although which one (or more) of the many new ingredients is the culprit I couldn’t say! Not sure why they just couldn’t let a good thing be and have to change/ruin it?~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~(My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)1.
