I received this complimentary product in exchange for my free and honest review. I have been using this for the past three weeks. First impression, I love the simple design of the packaging. While the container is small, it does not take a lot of the product to use. The eye cream itself leaves my eyes feeling soft. It does not leave an oily feeling like others I have used. I did notice the dark circles under my eyes has decreased. My “smile lines” have decreased as well. I would get this again. Nice eye cream
