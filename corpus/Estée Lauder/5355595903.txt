I received this product complementary for my honest review and opinion. I’ve really been enjoying this eye cream. It’s thick and feels very nice and moisturizing. I definitely notice a tightening sensation after application which I really look for in an under eye cream. I’m a 26 year old new momma and have been using this as a preventive step for wrinkles and to help with under eye discoloration from lack of sleep! Great overnight eye cream!
