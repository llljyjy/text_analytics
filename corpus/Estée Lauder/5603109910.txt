I received this product for free I’m exchange for a honest review. I was disappointed with this toner. I have dry skin and applied it generously and patted it in. It has a strong floral scent, so if you don’t use scented skincare be aware. It did not provide lasting hydration through the day, towards the evening my skin looked quite dry. Maybe with multiple layers it would work, but I was not given much of this product to try. This may be good for oily skin but not dry. nan
