This cream was such a pleasant surprise. I received a sample of this to test, and I just wish it was a bigger one! It is a thicker texture but doesnâ€™t clog the pores, and there is a noticeable difference in moisture when you put it on. When I wake up in the morning, my face is glowy and still so moisturized. The scent is light, and I only wish I had a full-sized sample!! Excellent new cream
