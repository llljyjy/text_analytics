Disclaimer: I did receive this eye creme sample for free from Influenster and Estee Lauder in exchange for my honest review.I’ve been using this eye cream for a few weeks now, and I can definitely see and feel a difference under my eyes. The lines aren’t gone but I can’t see them as much as before, which is LOVELY! It’s easy to apply and you really don’t need a lot to see results. My biggest issue is that since I received a sample, it was very small and the box did not include instructions for use. I’m well versed in skincare but every product can be different so it’d be nice to include that so people know for sure they’re using it correctly. There is minimal scent, and it’s a pleasure to use. Definitely recommend if you are looking for a good anti-aging eye creme! nan
