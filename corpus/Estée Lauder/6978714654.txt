I received this product as a sample from Influenster. I’ve been using this for a few weeks now. I use it once every three days or so as I found that using it every day broke my skin out a little. It is very thick and a little goes a long way. It is very moisturizing and leaves a beautiful look to the skin. It has a very pleasant, but strong scent, so if you don’t like scented skincare products, this is not for you. Very moisturizing
