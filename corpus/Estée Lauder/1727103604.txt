The Revitalizing Supreme+ MoisturizerYouth Power Creme is a really nice addition to my skincare routine. The cream feels rich and thick and a little does go a long way. I don’t know that my skin looks any different to the outside world but it does feel softer and smoother to me. I received this from Influenster in exchange for a review thats’s honest and true. Nice addition to my skincare routine!
