The sample I got from Influenster for my honest review was sort of small. It’s hard to gauge effectiveness when I didn’t really use it for that long. But here’s my two cents: The consistency is nice, the gel smooths out well and dries relatively quickly. Also, the gel feels refreshing, especially in the morning. It’s nice to use a metal ball applicator to dab it on gently. It doesn’t do much for me in terms of PUFFINESS, but it did make under my eyes seem BRIGHTER. I also notice smoother surface, and fine lines noticeable. It’s not bad
