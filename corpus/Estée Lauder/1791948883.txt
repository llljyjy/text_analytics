This cream is pretty good in some ways. It is hydrating without being oily. Other than that, I am not confident that I can speak to its other youth revitalizing capabilities which is its chief strategic purpose. The small sample didn’t allow for enough uses to notice a change. Or perhaps in other words— I can confirm that you wont find the fountain of youth in this jar after just a few uses! nan
