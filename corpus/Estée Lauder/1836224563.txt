This is an okay product. The sample I received was too small to really know if the product works. But I donâ€™t think I would purchase the full size anyway. I have normal skin, but I sweat a lot. This cream is just too thick for me. As soon as I put it on it felt like I was wearing a face mask. The smell is really nice if you are into scented Moisturizers. It is a thick and creamy feel, probably perfect for more drier skin. As for results? I did not notice any significant change in my skin. Meh.
