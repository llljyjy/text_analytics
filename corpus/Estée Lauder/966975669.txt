I received a deluxe sample of Estee Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion with Bio-Ferment for free from influenster to try, and I really like it. I have dry, sensitive skin with rosacea and allergies, and this added extra hydration to my skin and did not irritate my face at all. The product feels like a thin, watery toner and it made my skin feel softer. I like that it is paraben-free, sulfate-free, phthalate-free, oil-free, and synthetic fragranceâ€“free - I feel comfortable using it while pregnant. nan
