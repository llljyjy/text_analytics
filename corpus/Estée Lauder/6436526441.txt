This is a super hydrating moisturizer - it is on the heavier side, which I enjoy in my winter PM routine so this was a welcomed experience! This cream makes my skin so soooooo SOFT! It does give skin a shimmery sheen and my skin did feel plumper, but itâ€™s hard to speak to the true efficacy when it comes to firmness since this was such a teensy sample. I would need more time with the product to be able to truly comment on that aspect. Lovely cream
