I have extremely oily skin and I was a bit weary of trying out this product since it is supposed to be moisturizing. It doesn’t have an oily residue but was not long lasting on my skin. The plumping effects seemed to wear off rather quickly. I know that the brand is premium but the price is just too much for me. I don’t like this product and do not intend to purchase the full size because it did not seem to mix well with my oily skin. I received this product as a complementary sample in exchange for my honest review. nan
