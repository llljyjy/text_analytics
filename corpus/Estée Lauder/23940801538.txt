I received Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ in exchange for my honest review. I have combination skin but I have noticed that has changed over the last year. Now I have dry to very dry skin primarily on my face. The first thing I noticed immediately is that this has an amazing scent! It isn’t overwhelming and dissipates shortly after applying. The second thing that I noticed was that it has a rich creamy texture.This goes on smoothly and doesn’t pill underneath makeup. I have noticed that my skin is much softer and the dryness has improved quite a bit. I am encouraged that with continued use I could potentially see a reduction in fine lines and wrinkles. I love most Estée Lauder products and this is no different. It feels luxurious and like it is very high quality. If you want to pamper yourself and have your skin look younger and more supple, I highly recommend this. nan
