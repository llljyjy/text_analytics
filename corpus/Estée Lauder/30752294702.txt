Love a moisturizer with spf, that is always a plus. This was light and creamy. It has a slight floral scent which wasn’t overwhelming at all, but there for those that prefer unscented this isn’t for you. It went on smoothly and didn’t leave my face feeling weighted down. Overall, really liked this moisturizer. nan
