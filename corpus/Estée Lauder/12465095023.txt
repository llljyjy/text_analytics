I received this product free in exchange for my honest review. I was honestly a little disappointed in this product. If you expect/want a toner that feels more light and absorbent then this may not be for you. However, it might be a good product for someone with dry skin and a minimal skincare routine. This product just feels a lot more like a “end of routine” lotion to me and not something you would use before other products. It didn’t seem to absorb well enough to me when using other products on top of it More like a lotion
