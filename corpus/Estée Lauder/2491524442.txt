I received a sample of this product for my honest review, and I have to say that I love it! I’ve been using this for a couple weeks now. This gel-like creme is thick but goes on nice and smooth, and it doesn’t feel sticky! It has a very subtle scent to it but it’s not bad. I haven’t seen too much of a difference in my fine lines around my eyes.. however, my eyes do look more refreshed and brighter since I started using this. Once I’m finished with my sample size, I’ll definitely be purchasing a full version. Love this!
