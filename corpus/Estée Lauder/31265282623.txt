I received this product as a free sample And sadly so far I’m not impressed. Typically I love Estée Lauder products but this one is not my favorite. The moisturizer is thick but doesn’t go on smooth like most moisturizers. I feel like I have to cake it on before my skin feels soft. It just doesn’t go on amazingly well like you’d expect. Just okay
