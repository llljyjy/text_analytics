Estee Lauder Revitalizing Supreme plus Moisturizer is soft and silky and goes on smooth, not heavy or greasy, and not sticky. It has a very light scent that I canâ€™t place. The product feels lovely on my skin. I notice an instant difference in the texture of my skin and the noticeability of my wrinkles. I used it once a day, every day until it ran out. nan
