It’s still a little to early to give a full detailed review since this product takes a couple weeks to see the full benefits of it but I can say I love the texture, it’s smooth and creamy not over powering with smell and absorbs into my skin flawlessly without any left behind greasy ness. I’ve got super oily skin and that’s always my biggest fear it added extra oils even below my eyes, but this product didn’t make my under eye area anymore oily than what’s already there. I’ll be back in couple weeks with a full detailed review. Stay tuned! To early to tell!
