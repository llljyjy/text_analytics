I have a combination skin and I always use moisturizer on my daily and night skincare regimen. I have tried the Estee Lauder night cream and they never disappointment me. I love this brand because they have amazing products. This Estee Lauder Revitalizing Youth Creme is very rich but lightweight. My skin looks lifted and firm especially when I wake up in the morning. This cream made my skin soft and glowing. I love the scent it smells fancy and really smells like Estee Lauder because of the other products I have used before. I love it. My favorite cream
