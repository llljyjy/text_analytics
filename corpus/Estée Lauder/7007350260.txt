I have combination skin that can be a little dry right after washing at night. My new favorite step is applying this creme. I have used many different types of cremes in the past but this one is just different, better. It doesn’t leave my skin feeling smothered like it can’t breathe or greasy. It soaks in and leave it feeling soft and supple. My skin feels plump and hydrated. I reach for this morning and night over any other moisturizer that I own. By far one of the best I have ever used. I feel like it has started to smooth my over all skin texture and has left my skin looking more youthful. My new favorite step.
