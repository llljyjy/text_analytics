I received this product as a free sample to try, but it did really exceed my expectations. I’m always hesitant to try new skincare products because I have extremely sensitive skin. This one didn’t cause my skin to react poorly....+1. It also has had a visible improvement in my skins texture in the short time I’ve been using this product...+2. Would highly recommend trying this out Exceeded expectations
