I tested a free sample that I received as part of an Influenster campaign. I have dry, very sensitive, acne-prone, eczema-prone skin. Although this product has fragrance, it did not irritate my skin. It was an excellent moisturizer, and felt luxurious when I put it on. I was sad when the sample ran out, and I would consider buying this product in the future. Luxurious moisturizer
