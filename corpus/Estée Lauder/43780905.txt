I received a sample of this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. The creme is quite rich but absorbs very quickly. It definitely kept my usually dry areas around my nose very nicely hydrated and my skin was fresh and dewy in the morning after using at night. It does have a bit of a scent but not strong enough to  linger. Left skin hydrated and dewy!
