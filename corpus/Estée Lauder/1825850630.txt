I received Estée Lauder moisturizer for free from Influencer and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review. I got the trial size and when I initially used I noticed the creamy texture. It’s a very thick moisturizer and I’m usually on the dry side so if I don’t put moisturizer after showering/washing my face, I feel the dryness right away. This felt nice and very moisturizing, even more so than my Clinique moisturizer. I can’t really review on the firmness and lift that it claims but will continue to use it and see! Thick consistency
