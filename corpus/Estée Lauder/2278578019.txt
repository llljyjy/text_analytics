This moisturizer definitely gives my skin a radiant glow. After applying in the morning (a little goes a long way) I usually don’t put on any face makeup. My skin looks great, firm and glowing. It doesn’t make my skin oily even over time and never feels heavy (although it still does a great job at moisturizing). The only reason I took one star off is because I really don’t notice a difference in fine lines. As I continue to use it I hope that will improve. Overall, it’s a win. Face Glow!
