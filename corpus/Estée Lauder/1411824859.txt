This is a watery ferment-based hydrating essence meant to hydrate and provide anti-aging benefits similar to the popular SK-ll essence (in my opinion, anyway). Itâ€™s fine. There are so many better options on the market that are wayyyyy less expensive. This is so overpriced (just like SK-ll!) I am an esthetician and while this type of essence can be beneficial for a lot of skin types, it is also easily duped in lower price ranges and can be irritating for people dealing with certain types of acne. Two stars because it does hydrate and calm my skin a bit. Not a miracle. I'll pass.
