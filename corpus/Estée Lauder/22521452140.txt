I received a sample of this from influenster and Estee Lauder to try for my honest review. I used this eye cream every night for about 3 weeks. It went on smooth and a little goes a long way! It did have a slight tingle to it, so I might not recommend it to someone with very sensitive skin. It made me look more refreshed in the mornings and my dark circles started to look better after the 2nd week of using this. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a new eye cream! Great eye cream
