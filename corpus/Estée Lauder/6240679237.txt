I received a free sample of this product in exchange for my honest review. The consistency of this is more of a gel than lotion so I was worried about absorption, but it does absorb well. I was sent a very small sample for I was able to test this product for approx. 8 days. That is not enough time to notice any real results, the claim on the product is results after 2 weeks of use.  I did like the feeling of moisturized skin under my eyes. I don’t have any wrinkles yet so I can’t comment on it reducing the appearance. I would buy this if I got a good discount bc it is very expensive. Estée Lauder night eye cream
