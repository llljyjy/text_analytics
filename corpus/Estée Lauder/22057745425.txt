I’ve used this for about 3 weeks now while studying for my board exams and it really does make a difference. I have some fine lines and dark circles and after using it for about 3 weeks, I’ve noticed a difference under my eyes. The skin around my eyes look less tired and more supple. The eye cream goes on smoothly but does have a slight tingle so I don’t recommend it for people with super sensitive skin. I recommend slowly building up to it if anything. Like starting off with one application every other night and then build up to every night. I received this sample to try from Influenster and it’s by far one of my favorite products. 4 stars because of that slight tingle. Reduces the dark circle appearance
