I received a sample of this product from Influenster and really enjoyed using it.I have normal/combo skin, and for me it feels super hydrating and leaves my skin very soft and smooth. It has pretty thick texture, but doesn’t feel greasy. I don’t think there are any long term benefits, it’s just a good hydrating step in your routine.The only thing I don’t like is smell. It’s too strong and just smells like soap. Great hydration
