I received a sample of this lotion from Influenster. The sample size was pretty small, so it’s impossible to speak to long-term use of this product. I can, however, give some first impressions and use of about a week. First- it has a nice scent that dissipates pretty quickly. The texture is luxurious. It’s thick, but warms up to the skin rather easily. It reminds me a little of a really good pore-filling primer, how it makes the skin baby soft. I really enjoy it. I personally wouldn’t use in the morning under makeup, as I go for a completely different look/feel with my foundation, but I found myself excited to apply it before bed. As I said- I’m not sure if it lives up to it’s claims, but it’s definitely enjoyable enough that I would purchase and try it out for real! nan
