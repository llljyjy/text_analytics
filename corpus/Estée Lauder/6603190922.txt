I received this cream as a complementary gift. I have used Estée Lauder products in the past so I was very excited to get this. As I am now 40, I have been buying more anti-aging products. I am definitely purchasing the full size of this. It has a gel cream consistency and made my face feel so soft without an oily residue. I used it under my Estée Lauder Futurist Hydra foundation.  My makeup did not settle in my fine lines and my complexion looked amazing. I highly recommend this. Love This!
