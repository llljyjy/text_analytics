This was a great moisturizer! A little went a surprisingly long way on my skin. The smell was nice, and the product was thick and creamy, though not aggressively. My skin was noticeably softer in the mornings after applying before bed. I have super sensitive skin and this did not cause any irritation or breakouts. I plan to add this to my regular rotation, over the BeautyCounter and Drunk Elephant moisturizers. Great moisturizer
