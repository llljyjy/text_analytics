*I received this sample product from influenster in exchange for my honest review* A little goes a long way with this product. So when I received a small sample sized I was a bit surprised it last me a couple weeks. I initially tried this in the morning after washing my face but I didnâ€™t like how sticky it made my skin feel. I switched to using it in the evening and when I woke up the next morning my skin felt hydrated and soft. This product does have a floral fragrance and if using a lot can be overwhelming but a small amount was tolerable for me. I would definitely use during the winter months when my skin tends to be drier. Hydrating
