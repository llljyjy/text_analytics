I received this sample from Influenster. Contrary to other reviews, I like the smell. It smells refreshing and like spf.  I was worried it would be too heavy for my sensitive skin, especially under foundation. This is not the case. It doesn’t make my skin appear oily, but I use it sparingly in the mornings. I use more at night but still haven’t found it to be too oily. It makes my face very soft. I will finish my .5 oz sample and will consider purchasing the full size when it runs out. Nice!
