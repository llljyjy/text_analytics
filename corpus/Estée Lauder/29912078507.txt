I received a complementary sample of this product in exchange for my honest review. This cream is excellent and I plan on purchasing a full size jar. I applied it to clean, damp skin morning and night. My skin was immediately supple and hydrated. It was moisturizing, which I love, because I have normal to dry skin and usually prefer products for dry skin. While this gave me the moisture I was looking for, it was not greasy. I applied the product at night when I first received this sample and in the morning the skin around my eyes looked plumper and tighter. My fine lines were less noticeable. My skin was smooth and my Double Wear foundation wore well over the top. I definitely recommend A must have!!
