I got a sample of this and I was firstly thrown by the miniature size of the product. Skincare takes time to make change, so I’m not sure that the size was conducive to me forming an actual opinion on the efficacy. For the length of time I used it, I saw no noticeable change, but my skin did always feel moisturized after using. The scent is a no for me though. Way too strong and definitely gives “grandmas vanity in the 80’s” vibes. Not bad, not great
