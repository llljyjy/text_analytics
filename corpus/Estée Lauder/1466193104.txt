This Est√©e Lauder Revitalizing Supreme + Youth Eye Balm did nothing for my eyes. Even worst - after just few minutes my eye area felt dry and had zero moisture. Sometimes I had to wake up at night and apply it one more time. When I wake up there is no cream at all. Another interesting thing - this eye cream has a shimmer in it. If you look closely in light, you will notice how nice shimmer it adds. I do not recommend this cream to anyone. I bought it because I absolutely loved their diamond eye cream, and naively thought this would be similar. It shines and is very drying
