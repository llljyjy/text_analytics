I have tried Estée Lauder in the past and wanted to sample this hydrating emulsion. It is super light in texture and very Hydrating to my skin, which badly needed it as I tend to be on the dry side. It doesn’t have an overpowering scent which was important to me as well.  It’s makes my skin silky smooth and applies evenly. I absolutely would recommend this!! nan
