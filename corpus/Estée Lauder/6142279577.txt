I received this product for free from Influenster and Estee Lauder in exchange for my honest review. I received a sample size and was only enough for a few times so I couldn’t tell the result. I have sensitive skin and didn’t have any bad reactions with the product. It didn’t stand out among other similar products, but could be because of short time trying. nan
