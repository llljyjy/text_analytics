I received a free sample of this product in exchange for my honest review. I have a combination skin type, so it’s important to me that my facial lotion can help me balance the dry and oily parts. I love the light, velvety texture of this facial lotion. It goes on extremely smoothly and light that I can’t feel it on my skin at all. It has helped my dry areas stay hydrated without increasing the oiliness of the other  parts of my face. Goes on very light!
