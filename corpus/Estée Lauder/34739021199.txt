I was able to try Estée LauderRevitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme Moisturizer free from influenster. I really liked the light fragrance of this cream and also how it made my face feel silky smooth and not greasy at all. It was a little thin so I was worried it would be hard to rub in fully and that wasn’t the case at all. It soaked right in and was light like a feather. I also liked how it made my face look smooth after applying. This is definitely a Moisturizer worth using if you like light, smooth and easy to use. Silky smooth
