Nicely moisturizing without leaving me feeling oily. I have combo skin & sometimes thicker moisturizers leave more forehead an oil slick. It feels rather thick on 1st contact but almost melts as it warms up. It absorbs well & feels lightweight once itâ€™s on but afterward it feels like you used a heavier cream. I received this from Influenster to review but may well rebuy it after my mini runs out. Just the right weight for combo skin
