A light and hydrating moisturizer. It feels smooth on the skin with a very light scent. The SPF 15 provides a great base skin protection, though I still like to use a higher SPF on top of the moisturizer. My mom sctually tried it while visiting, and so I ended up purchasing a full size for her. Great for any age. The SPF is a plus.
