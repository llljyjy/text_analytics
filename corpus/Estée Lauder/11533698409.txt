I’ll preface by saying I like to invest in my skincare. I’m a pseudo-loyalist to a specific brand whose name involves alcohol and animals but I’m always open to expanding my routine so I was looking forward to trying this moisturizer. I really like the texture, but I didn’t realize how badly it would pill under makeup. It feels like a thick primer and dries down like one, meaning it’s smooth and not heavy, feeling like it absorbs/melts into my skin well. However, for the price of this moisturizer, I would expect the active ingredients to be higher on the ingredient list. The reason it feels so nice is because it’s mostly silicones. Overall, this didn’t do anything for my skin so I can’t recommend a purchase. nan
