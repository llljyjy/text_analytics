I received a deluxe sample of the @esteelauder Micro Essence from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. The essence contains bio-active lactobacillus ferment and helps strengthen the skin’s barrier.  It’s a thin, watery consistency, and I didn’t expect it to do much, but I was really surprised. My skin felt super soft, smooth, and hydrated afterward and had a bit of a glow. You can layer this under serums or a moisturizer, but you almost don’t need anything after you apply this. Once again, Estee Lauder does not disappoint! Makes skin SO soft
