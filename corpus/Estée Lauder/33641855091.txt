This is an excellent moisturizer! I noticed an immediate difference after just 1 use. It has a very thick consistency that goes on silky smooth with no greasiness. It has a very subtle scent that is lovely. Itâ€™s a clean scent that reminds me of freshly shampooed/conditioned hair. I would 100% recommend for its moisturizing ability. I feel I would need a few more weeks of use to give a review on the wrinkle/fine line smoothing properties. Great Peoduct!
