Im having a hard time reviewing this product. I did receive a sample size for free from Influenster but the sample was the size of my pinky so I only was able to use it 3 times. That did not gave me enough time to really see a difference in my skin. I did knock off a start for that and I also knocked another one off because as soon as I opened it I can smell a lot of fragrance. Fragrance is not good for anyones skin at all so Iâ€™m not sure why companies still try to add any type of fragrance in skincare. I would not recommend especially if you have sensitive skin. At the same time I am glad I received a sample size because if I would have had a full size bottle I probably would have thrown it out or gave it to someone. Also on Influenster a ton of people were discussing how upsetting it was because we all received a medium sized box of a package for the smallest sample ever. I also agree, It really was a waste. Next time it should be shipped out in a bubbly envelope. It was a waste. Not impressed
