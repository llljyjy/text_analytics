I received this product as a free sample. I was very excited to test out this higher end moisturizer. The first thing I noticed was how creamy and thick it was and how good it felt going on my face. I preferred to use it in the evening. I only received a sample size so I didnâ€™t notice any longer effects of the product but it did leave my skin soft and moisturized. I would recommend this product! nan
