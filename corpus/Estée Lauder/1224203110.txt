I received a sample that I used day and night for about a week. The first thing I noticed was a strong powdery fragrance. Second, it’s a thick cream which I thought would be great for winter. Unfortunately it doesn’t absorb well. It sits on my face and feels sticky, like a sunscreen. It also didn’t provide long-lasting moisture for extremely dry spots on my nose and forehead. Is it a good cream? Yes, but only if you don’t mind the scent and don’t need super hydration like I do. Not for Extreme Hydration
