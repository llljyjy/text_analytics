I received this product free for my honest unbiased review. Love this! I have combo sensitive skin, but I’m 38 so I can’t avoid using moisturizer anymore! Just about everything makes me break out. This stuff didn’t leave me oily, or make me break out. Only thing I didn’t like was it’s perfume scented. It’s not overwhelming, but it’s there. Love!
