I’ll start my review by saying I received a small sample jar of this cream, enough to last me 10 days using it day and night. That said, the product itself has a lovely texture. It’s thick but feels satiny as it’s applied and absorbs quickly. The scent is light, a bit floral but nothing overpowering. My skin felt hydrated and smooth. I got lucky in the genetics department, I am in my mid 30s and have no wrinkles, 11 lines or marionette lines on my face. Therefore, whether or not it helps diminish wrinkles I cannot vouch for. For those who enjoy a high end face cream, I would recommend this. It feels luxurious and does a good job keeping the skin hydrated and supple. nan
