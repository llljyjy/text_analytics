I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This product claims to make skin appear more lifted, firmer, reduce lines/wrinkles, and make skin feel hydrated.  I did find that my skin felt former and definitely more hydrated when using this crème.  I may need to use it longer to see other effects.  I was a little worried it would break me out because Estée Lauder products tend to do that, but I have not noticed any issues with that and skin sensitivity.  It does have a perfume scent which I minded a little bit, so I’m not sure if I would spend the money it costs to continue using it because it does carry a hefty price tag! I would need to use it longer to really know how great it is, but as far as hydrating and making skin more radiant, it did do that! Hydrating and Maybe More…
