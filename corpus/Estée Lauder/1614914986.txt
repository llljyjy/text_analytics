I received a free sample size of this product from Influenster am leaving my honest review. I didn’t read the claims beforehand, so I had no expectations for this product when I added it to my skincare routine. The directions suggested adding it after applying a serum I did not own. I just decided to replace the moisturizer step in my normal routine with this product for two days, and I saw visible firmness, radiance, and a more lifted look. I previously had pronounced smile lines and wrinkles under eye, but started to notice after a few days that my skin looked very smooth and my makeup application was even more flawless. Now I can’t wait to grab a full size. Where’d this product come from?
