I received the Est√©e Lauder New revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme for my honest review. For the sample I was able to try things were nice. The creme itself is a thicker consistency. Having a slight smell of that classic moisturizer, a mature smell. My face felt instantly moisturized. Leaving it plump and supple. Could not really tell what the full effects would be as I only used it for a short while. Hydration
