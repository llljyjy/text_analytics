I received a sample size of this product in exchange for my honest opinion.This was my first time using Este Lauder skincare so I wasn’t sure what to expect. Overall I think this is a great eye product. It absorbs quickly and is super moisturizing. The only reason I won’t be purchasing it myself is only because of price - I think there are other eye creams that deliver the same results. The one I usually use is vegan as well! Great eye cream!
