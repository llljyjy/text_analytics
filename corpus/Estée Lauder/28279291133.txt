I don’t ALWAYS use a moisturizer evn tho I should, but since I got this product I’ve been using it almost every day, sometimes 2x. I couldn’t believe how After only a few days I was actually abl2 notice a difference in my parenthesis! It really smoothed them out &plumped my skin up a bit. It has a kind of sticky feel to it, so don’t Kno if I was using too much or too little, almost afraid I was rubbing it right off my skin, although I wasn’t rubbing, but it’s def. Worth the results. nan
