I’ve been using for about a week. I have very sensitive skin that easily irritates with most products that have a a fragrance. This did not irritate my skin and I did notice a difference on how much smoother my skin felt. It’s a thin watery consistency with no scent and absorbs quickly into the skin. I recommend trying this product. I did receive this complimentary from Influenster. Great product
