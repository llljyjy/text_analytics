So the pros to this: did not irritate my sensitive skin, has a nice texture, and pleasant smell (not too overpowering). However, I canâ€™t say this did anything fantastic for my skin. It just seemed like a very average cream. I received a small sample size of this for free in exchange for my opinion. After seeing the retail price, I would look elsewhere for a product that is better than just average. Just Okay
