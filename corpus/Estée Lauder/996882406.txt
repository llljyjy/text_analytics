This is the one of the thickest moisturizers that I have used in some time.Pros- Lovely Scent. Could possibly be a 5 star if used with a serum prior to application.Cons- So thick that at this price point, you would definitely need to use a separate serum, eye, and neck product.I did not see the results I was so hopeful for. I am a side sleeper and primarily used this on that area, no results. I use my moisturizers from neck to forehead. This requires so much product for dry skin, I would definitely need to buy a huge amount to attempt to have full coverage, twice a day as directed. Not worth the cost and effort
