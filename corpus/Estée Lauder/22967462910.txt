This is a very thick cream - a little does *not* go a long way. That said, it absorbs well and does not feel sticky all day. I could probably wear it under makeup just fine, although it felt most like a night cream. The smell was not overbearing and was quite pleasant overall. I can see myself buying a full size of this lotion for dry, winter months. I received a sample of this complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. Pleasantly surprised
