To start since we all know it’s important: this product actually sets into the skin and not on it. The best way to describe the texture is lubricant, but creamy. It’s so lightweight it almost fits into my natural oils and makes them usable with my makeup, however I felt no need to even use makeup by day 5. Dark circles were nearly gone and my overall eye appearance was improved. I plan on buying this again, for myself and my mother! Skin in a bottle.
