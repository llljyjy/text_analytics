Let me preface this by saying that I live in Texas and received this as a free sample from Influenster in AUGUST, when our daily temperature was at or over 100 degrees. I do not think this was the right time of year to try this. I have medium-to-dry skin, sensitive, and found this product way too heavy for use in our summer climate. It is very rich and never seemed to absorb into my skin. If you like a very dewy (shiny) finish, this may be great for you. I do not. It is extremely moisturizing and would possibly be an option for me in the winter. nan
