My normally very oily skin has been on the dryer side lately.  Partially due to strange weather, partially due to retinol, so I figured this slightly heavier moisturizer than I normally use would be great.  First, there is a scent, but it was light and fresh and didn’t bother me. This sank in beautifully, wore well under makeup and didn’t seem to make me super greasy later.  It did however seem to break me out... In odd places I never break out, like my cheeks.  I stopped using it and the breakous stopped.  Too bad, I would have loved this otherwise! My skin didn't seem to like it
