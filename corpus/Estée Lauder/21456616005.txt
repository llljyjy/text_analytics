This bottle of essence is really good for skin that needs more moisture. It is a bit too pricey and doesn’t have the most evident results. However, it does make your skin a little more plump and moisturized than other essences. Also, it is not too thick nor is it too thin, so it feels really good when applied to your skin. Additionally, a little goes a long way, so one bottle will last a long time. I like to mix my toners and essences so I can apply a few at the same time, which extends the usage of a bottle even more. Furthermore, this essence is supposed to help you have smoother skin. I didn’t see any large changes to my skin’s texture after using this essence over a few weeks. All in all, you should get this essence if you want to splurge on something that will make your skin better by a little and feels good when you apply it. However, if you are looking for a fast-working product, this may not be it for you. Good Essence
