I received this product for free from Influenster and Ester Lauder in exchange for my honest review. The sample size I received was good for a few tries. I have very dry skin and it made my skin feel hydrated and soft. It has a strong scent but it smells good so it wasnâ€™t an issue. Would definitely recommend. Enjoyed it
