I received this complimentary in exchange for my review. It’s a very lightweight gel cream and feels nice if you don’t have any dryness or sensitivity. I accidentally used too much retinol near my eyes and the area got very dry. The cream stung very bad that time and I had to wash it off. Every other time using it was fine. nan
