like that this product is thick and definitely a must use during my nightime routine  It helped out with a bit of puffiness and dryness that I usaly get under my eye area I realy don’t have  dark circles but i did hear it can lighten  dark circles not for me tho i have combination oily skin  more oily tho so I wouldn’t recommend to use this during the day or under makeup overall it’s a great product Estee lauder
