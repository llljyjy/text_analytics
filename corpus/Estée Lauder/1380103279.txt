I love this cream! It goes on so smoothly. I use it as a night cream and apply as my last step of my routine before bed. The fragrance isn’t too floral which is great because I tend to dislike using heavily scented products. I’ve only been able to use it a few times but my skin does have a glow in the morning so I will continue to use it and update! Great face cream
