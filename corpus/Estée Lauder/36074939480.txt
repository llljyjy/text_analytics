I have very sensitive skin and rosacea, so I was a little nervous to try a new product. I found this one to have a pleasant scent, and it went on very smoothly. I found my skin to feel very smooth and soft after putting it on. During the first few applications, I did have a couple of breakouts, which I am prone to when trying new skin products. The breakouts stopped after about 4 applications. It did not irritate my rosacea, which was a surprise, as most products with a scent do. I would definitely recommend this! nan
