For the first few days, I really enjoyed using this moisturizer. Itâ€™s thick but sinks in quickly, the smell is light, floral, and reminiscent of days past, shopping wiith my mother at department stores. However, I found that it somehow made my skin even drier, and I woke up every morning with severe flaky dry patches around my chin and mouth. Now, I am a Tretinoin user and that does make my face drier, but my normal moisturizer helps prevent that - this product did not. Ultimately not worth the price tag for me. Underwhelmed
