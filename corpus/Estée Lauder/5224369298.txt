I received this product complementary from influenster and Estée Lauder for my honest review. This eye cream is very nice! It has a lightweight gel texture. You don’t need a lot so it last quite a while. It makes my eyes feel very hydrated and doesn’t irritate or burn my sensitive skin. It’s helped with the dryness I had around my eyes. I don’t really have any wrinkles under my eyes yet so I can’t really speak to the tightening of under eye wrinkles. I would definitely buy this eye cream though! Great Eye Cream
