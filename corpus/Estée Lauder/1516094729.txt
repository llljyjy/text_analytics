I received a sample of this product free from Estée Lauder and Influenster. The lotion has a slight floral/musty scent to it that reminds me of old age. The product did not play nicely with my retinoid cream (maybe bc of the acids) and I didn’t try using it in the AM. Overall felt moisturizing when I used it on my hands but no immediate effects seen.
