It’s a nice average moisturizer. The cons are that my skin is oily and after a few hrs, my face was an oily mess. I decreased the amount and had the same reaction. I’m also not pleased with the sunscreen, it is not strong enough. I would rather use a 70spf separately. The pros are that I used it in the morning and night for 3 weeks and it made my skin very soft; it also even out my texture. I’m pleased with the scent and how it goes well under makeup. Too oily during the day but nice for night care
