I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Estee Lauder in exchange for my honest review. I have mature skin with dry patches so I love a good moisturizer. This creme feels thick, it smells good and made my skin feel soft and as a plus, it felt good under foundation. I cannot speak of its claims of firmer skin and lifted look because I received a small sample and I believe these results require long term use. All in all, I like the product and would recommend it to friends and family. nan
