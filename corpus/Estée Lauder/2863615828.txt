As others have said, this moisturizer is THICK. In a good way. It’s a bit much for daytime but perfect for my bedtime skin routine. It does have a fragrance that’s somewhat strong, so if that isn’t your preference I would avoid this product. The texture really is great though, and I’d use it again. I received a free sample in exchange for this review, so can’t speak to long term effects. nan
