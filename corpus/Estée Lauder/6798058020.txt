I received the Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Gel-Creme Synchronized Multi-Recovery from Influenster and Estee Lauder for my honest review. First, I love the texture of this gel cream, it feels so smooth as you apply it. You only need a tiny bit, so even the travel size I received has a good amount. The gel-creme has a brightening look to it once applied, which really does help the eye are appear more awake. The Estee Lauder Gel-creme does smooth the eye area, helping with lines and wrinkles. Even when I wake up, still very smooth. This is also great for added hydration. I do suffer from fairly bad dark circles, but I do find that this has helped diminish the look somewhat, but nothing is perfect for with that. This product is also lightweight, and barely has any scent. I really like the way this gel-creme makes my under eye area look and feel, and I will continue to use this. nan
