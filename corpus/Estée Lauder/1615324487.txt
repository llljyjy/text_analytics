I have really enjoyed this cream by Estée Lauder. It has a very light scent that I truly enjoy but at the same time don’t find over powering. So far it has helped smooth out my skin and diminish the fine lines around my eyes.  Overall I’m reallly impressed with this cream and how natural it feels despite it being so powerful. I would most definitely recommend it to friends and family. Smooth Skin
