I’ve used the Estèe Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme Moisturizer around my eyes and forehead for the last month. The thick crème really passed the test! I have seen improvement in the delicate under eye skin and fine line near my brows. The scent isn’t overpowering and the crème lasted all night long. I recommend this for dry skin and a little goes a long way. Must have!
