I received these products for free from Influenster and Est√©e Lauder in exchange for my honest review. I will say that this moisturizer is very helpful in the dry seasons and a little goes a lot way. I especially appreciate the natural ingredients, which is one of the main things I look for in skincare. Within 3 or 4 days I noticed my skin was more moisturizer and soft. nan
