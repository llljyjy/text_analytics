I liked the floral scent of this moisturizer, and it wasnâ€™t too overpowering. The moisturizer seemed heavy at first, but applied light. It kept my skin feeling moisturized being dry from winter. I also like the SPF that it has. I received this product in return for my honest review. Nice moisturizer
