I received this product for free from Influenster and Estée Lauder.I have had dry problematic under eyes since the pandemic started. This magic cream has completely erased the crepe and I look like I’m in my 20’s again.  I am literally on this site to buy it.  I had been using drug store creams (cerave to name one) and they just can’t stack up against this. The texture is dreamy and a little goes a long way.  I’m now a believer in Estēe Lauder.
