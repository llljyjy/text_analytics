Very surprised with this product. After about a week of using it I noticed a difference in my undereye dark circles. The consistency is almost like a silicone primer, it felt really nice under the eyes! It also absorbed nicely into the skin and didn’t leave any residue after wearing it overnight. I would definitely recommend however I wish the price tag was a little cheaper considering you don’t get alot of product. However a little bit goes a long way with this product. nan
