I currently use another eye cream product so I tried to come into this review with an open mind. The little sample was adorable but it was a small amount of product to really make any noticeable differences. However, the feel of the product was nice on my eyes and the texture of the product was nice as well. I would recommend this product to others although I do not think I would replace my current product with this one. nan
