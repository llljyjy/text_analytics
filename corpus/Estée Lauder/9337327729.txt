I received a sample of this product complimentary of Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review. I’m 29 and have been using this eye cream every night for about 2-3 weeks, and I love the silky gel-cream texture. It is lightweight but very hydrating, and a little goes a long way. It’s also not greasy like other eye gels/creams tend to be. I have visible blue/purple/green blood vessels under my eyes, and I do think this product helps to brighten that area and makes my eyes look more awake in general. I haven’t noticed a significant difference as far as fine lines are concerned, but I do notice a slight “plumping” effect the next morning after applying at night. It’s not a miracle product, but it’s definitely a high quality eye cream I would invest in with confidence! Luxurious and silky
