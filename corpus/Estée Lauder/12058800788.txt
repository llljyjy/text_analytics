I’ve been on the hunt for an eye cream that I could trust that’s why I got excited when I received a sample of this eye cream from influenster. It’s moisturizing, and does not give me milia ( i am very prone ) anyway, I can’t speak for it getting rid of wrinkles or eye bags since I don’t think that I have used it enough to make a judgement. So far, so good, though. nan
