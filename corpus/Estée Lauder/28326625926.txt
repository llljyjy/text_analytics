I received this free from Influenster and Estée Lauder.Unfortunately the sample was small so I can’t tell you how it worked on my skin in the long run it lasted me about 6 days. I can say it’s a thicker moisturizer, that feels good and leaves my skin feeling hydrated all day. I have combo/dry/oily skin. My skin seriously felt great. The downside is the scent is heavy. I would not purchase due to that. If you can handle the scent it’s a great moisturizer. I didn’t break me out. Application was easy. Heavy Scent
