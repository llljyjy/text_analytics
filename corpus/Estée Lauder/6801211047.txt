I received a sample of this product for free through Influenster for my honest review. I didn’t love this product as much as I expected. The packaging was pretty and it was light on my face but the fragrance was a little bit strong (even as somebody who doesn’t mind fragrance). It was a little bit sticky at first but that went away. I did think it kept my face looking hydrated, bright and plump, which is why I’m giving it four stars. I took this on a camping trip in dry Colorado and it was incredibly convenient. nan
