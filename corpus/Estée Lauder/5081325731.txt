First off I received this product for free for my honest opinion from Influenster. That being said, I really like this cream. The packaging is very sleek which is nice. It does have a scent to it so if you don’t like scented skincare you probably won’t like this. It’s a soft scent but still noticeable. As for the product itself, it’s a thick cream, it’s not going anywhere until you rub it in. It melts into the skin. I have combo skin so I love that this doesn’t make me look oily in my t zone. You really don’t need a lot either so it will last you a while. nan
