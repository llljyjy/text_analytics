This product left my skin feeling hydrated all day and noticked a difference in the appearanceof my skin after only a couple days. Soaks in quickly and No sticky residue or anything. However. I am not a fan of the smell. Hence the 4 star. If the fragrance was a little less flowery Iâ€™d love it. nan
