I received a free sample of this product in exchange for my honest review. I don’t have anything bad to say about this product. It moisturizes, it absorbs just fine. The scent is mild. But it didn’t seem any different than any other nice, basic moisturizer. My skin was fine with it but I didn’t notice any changes for the better--no extra glow or softness, no blurring of fine lines, just...fine. I do think that what works just ok for one person might be a holy grail for another, and the ingredient list on this is quite good, so if you like a light but nourishing moisturizer, you will definitely get that. And maybe you will find your new favorite product. This one was fine but definitely not my new fave
