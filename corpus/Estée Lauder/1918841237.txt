Influenster sent me a sample of this eye cream in exchange for a review and I don’t know that I was able to use it enough to really notice a difference. It’s very moisturizing and I like that there’s no scent, so no extra irritation. I noticed a slight difference in lines, but my eczema did flare up during use. I’m not sure if this was due to the product or other allergies. nan
