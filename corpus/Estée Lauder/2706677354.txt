I received this product complimentary from influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review. This product has a gooey texture. You don’t need a lot as a little goes a long way. This eye cream is moisturizing immediately upon application. I use this during my night routine. It does have a slight fragrance which I love but unfortunately it makes my eyes water. Because of that I cannot not use too close to my eyes. A bit pricey but a really good product if you are not sensitive to fragrance. Pretty good but pricey
