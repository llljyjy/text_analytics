I received a deluxe sized sample of Estée Lauder’s Micro Essence Treatment Lotion with Bio-Ferment in exchange for my honest review a couple of weeks ago, so I can’t speak on long-term impact, but will say I’m a big fan of this so far. Bit of background - late 30’s, light-medium oily and acne prone skin (yes, still, in my thirties - I won the genetic lottery!). So I use a lot of powerful stuff with active ingredients on my face twice daily. It’s like Teflon. But I also deal with a lot of redness those products cause, trying to get rid of and disguise it. I was looking forward to trying this! Did it totally eliminate the redness? No. But it made a pretty impressive dent, and that is coming from someone who’s tried A LOT of different products that claim to help neutralize redness. It’s more of a hydrating essence / toner than what you may think of when you read the word “lotion”, and it hasn’t caused any breaking out for me whatsoever. It’s simple, easy to apply, quick to absorb and plays really nicely with the rest of my routine. Until that impossible, single, holy grail universal redness vanishing product is made, this is exactly what I needed. I highly recommend giving it a try. Exactly what I needed.
