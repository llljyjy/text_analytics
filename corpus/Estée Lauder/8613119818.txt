I received this eye cream complementary from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest opinion. The cream has a very gentle and rich texture on skin, but it doesn’t feel oily. I’m currently still using the cream. After using it regularly for a couple of weeks, I noticed the improvement on the dark circles and the firmness of my under eye. It’s overpriced, but the results are great. nan
