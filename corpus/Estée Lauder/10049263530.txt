This Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Gel Cream works incredibly well!! I have very dry skin, and especially my under eyes. This keeps my under eyes hydrated all day! A little bit of this goes a long way, so you only need a small amount. It goes on like a gel, but dries down like a cream. Doesn’t leave my under eyes feeling sticky or anything. The only thing I don’t care for is the size of the container. I would perfer it to come in a way bigger size. Even though a little bit does go a long ways, I personally don’t care for the smaller sizes. It didn’t last very long even with only needing a little bit. Other than that, this is great! I haven’t had any issues with breaking out or it irritating my skin. Plus, it has some really great benefits! It makes dark circles look brighter after 2 weeks. Reduces the signs of under eye aging, and lines, and more! I will say after a week of using I’m impressed! It’s definitely helping the dark circles, and signs of aging really well! My under eye area feels and looks so much better!! I can definitely see a difference from before, and now. If you’re looking for a good eye gel cream, I most definitely recommend giving this a try! Excellent for dry skin!
