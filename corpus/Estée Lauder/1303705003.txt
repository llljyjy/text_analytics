I got this as part of a Vox Box campaign and I wasn’t super-impressed. This is just OK. The ingredients aren’t ground breaking, the dimethicones are what give the appearance of smoothing away fine lines. The mica gives it brightness but once you wash this off you’ll see it hasn’t really done much. Save your money for better products. If you’ve got sensitive eyes or skin steer clear. It has fragrance added save your money
