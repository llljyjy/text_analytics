Effective and sensitive enough for my temperamental skin. The dry patches I typically have were not noticeable at all- and it definitely lives up to the hydrating claim. My only gripe is the sample provided was not generous enough to last more than 2 days/uses. Itâ€™s difficult to formulate a fair opinion for a skincare product especially with such little product to judge. That said I can assume the toner is a good one based on the results I experienced. This product was received complimentary for review. Works well
