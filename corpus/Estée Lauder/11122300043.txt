When I get this eye gel cream I was a bit skeptical, it advertised itself for reducing fine lines and looking brighter/ healthier. However, after using for almost a month, I can really see the results! It did reduce the fine lines and make your under eye look plumper, but does not really help with dark circles. Another thing I really like about it is the texture is ‘gel’ instead of cream, so it it not greasy and comfortable Amazed
