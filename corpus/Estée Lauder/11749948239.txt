I did not expect to like this as much as I do! I’m super picky about creams but this one checks all the boxes! The texture is rich and luxurious and feels thick before application and then soaks right in when you do. The smell is clean, fresh and light. I just had a small sample so can’t speak to long term improvement, but my skin was noticeably more supple, moist and radiant after just a week of use. Love it! Unexpectedly fantastic!
