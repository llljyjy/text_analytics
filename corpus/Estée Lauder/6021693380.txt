I received a complimentary trial size of this product in exchange for my honest review. This eye cream is similar to Estée Lauder’s other eye creams in consistency and performance. It is thick, yet silky. Not sticky. Absorbs into the skin quickly and hydrates the under eye area. I saw improvement in my fine lines around areas I used this product. Silky Smooth and Hydrating
