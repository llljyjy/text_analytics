I currently use a drugstore eye cream. This eye creamâ€™s texture is nice and creamy. It took a bit longer to absorb, though. My eye area felt really nice, not greasy at all. The results were immediate. The results over time were even better. I would definitely recommend this eye cream to others! nan
