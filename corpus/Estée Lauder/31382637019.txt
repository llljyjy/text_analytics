I really like the feel of this product.  It gives me great moisture with out any oiliness.  I can’t say I’ve really noticed any huge changes over the 2 weeks I’ve been using it. But I do feel like my skin is plumper, not as dry and hanging.  I don’t mind the smell.  I am hoping the longer I use it the more I will really see results.  As I edge closer to 50, I expect things to take some time. Feels really nice!!
