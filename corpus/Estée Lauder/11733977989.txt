I got a sample for FREE from Influenster and Estee lauder for my honest opinion and review. When applied to my skin it felt nice and hydrating. The product can be a little thick if applied too much. Overall it worked out well with my other skincare products and makeup. I can’t really say if it had any benefits to my skin since the sample was too small to actually see the change on my skin. It’s a nice product Nice
