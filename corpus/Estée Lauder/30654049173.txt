*Part of an incentized campaign. I received this Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair Eye Creme for free in exchange for my honest review.*I was SUPER impressed with this product. Eye creams are, in general a big hit or miss, but this baddie was a BIG hit. It did a great job reducing puffiness, fine lines, and general darkness. I wouldn’t say it removed any of them, but reduced them it did. I saw results after about 2.5 weeks. The small sample size lasted roughly 1.5 months. Social Media: @sarcastapist Superb
