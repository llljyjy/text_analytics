I received this complimentary via Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I love the formula of the face cream. It’s not too heavy, and doesn’t leave my skin looking or feeling oily, while still hydrating. It hydrates without leaving my skin feeling heavy or oily like some creams, as well. It’s a more scented cream than I usually go for, but it’s not unpleasant, and it is effective, as I have noticed a reduction in some fine lines. I will be purchasing a full size! nan
