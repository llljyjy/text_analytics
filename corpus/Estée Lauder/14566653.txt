I received a sample of this product free for review. I used this cream nightly for about a week and a half. I did not like the scent. Directions say to use this morning and night but I felt as if this was a little too thick for a day cream. I also felt like the price point was a little high given my results. I felt as though this cream just fell a little bit short. Maybe using it longer would produce results. Not sure. nan
