I am a university student. When I tell you I have a lot of all nighters and nights where I only sleep 2 hrs a night, you would not believe me. This stuff is good! I also have eczema under my eyes year round and this has helped out a lot with dry patches. At first I thought I would not like the texture because it feels like silicone, but I donâ€™t mind it anymore. Great stuff
