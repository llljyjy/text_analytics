I enjoyed trying this moisturizer, I can’t say if it really helps with wrinkles because I didn’t have enough product,but if I felt the difference in hydration, the skin looked very nice after applying it, it does not leave a greasy feeling and it is absorbed very well.  I didn’t find it to have a strong scent, it disappears almost immediately afterwards.“I received this product as a free sample,” Nice!
