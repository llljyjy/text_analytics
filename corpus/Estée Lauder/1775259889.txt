I received a sample of this serum from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. The sample size was quite small, however, I used it nightly until it ran out. I didnâ€™t notice any differences to the quality of my skin around my eye or any of the results it markets it delivers. I am giving it 3 stars because it is very hydrating and did make my under eyes feel soft & I also  do not feel the sample size was large enough to get it an adequate review smooth
