Estée Lauder always makes amazing products and the advanced night repair eye cream does not disappoint. I’ve been using the product morning and night and have seen a difference in my under eyes and skin overall. My dark circles have been less pigmented, eyes feel hydrated and plump as well as noticing any fine lines I have around my eyes appear less visible. A great product to add to your daily skin care routine. I received this product free from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest opinion. hydrate !
