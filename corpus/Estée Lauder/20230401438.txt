I received a sample size of this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.  The product is thick, it only takes a little, and there is relatively no scent. My skin looked instantly brighter upon application.  However,  I could see no difference in dark circles or fine lines,  even with repeated use.  This is not a product that I would spend money on. Not impressed
