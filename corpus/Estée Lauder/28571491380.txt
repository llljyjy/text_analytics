I’m not super affluent on eye creams. The closest I’ve ever used to an eye cream is an eye primer. This stuff smelled nice and the viscosity was pleasing enough when applied to the skin. Skin care is a long term thing, especially to get results. The sample I received from Influenster was relatively small, not really big enough to use for very long which is kind of necessary in testing out skin care. But I think it was nice for the time I could use it. Good
