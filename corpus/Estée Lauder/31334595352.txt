This is a beautiful moisturizer for my combination skin. Itâ€™s silly smooth and absorbs quickly, it is scented, in a lovely way. I found this extremely moisturizing it did not give a lovely or greasy or really look it just looks beautiful. It played well with other products including my sunscreen and my liquid foundation. I only wish I had received more of the product so I could test it over time a little longer! This is my honest review for a product I received on Influenster! Holy Grail beautiful cream
