I think this product is over all great. The texture is nice on the skin and feels great. The smell is gentle and isn’t too overwhelming. I like the color and the texture of the packaging, but I don’t love the access and the use of the product. Having long nails, I can make it difficult to use. I had to use a Q-tip for it to be easier to apply. I’m still using it to see the effect over long-term, but I think that initial use is easy for me to tell that I do think it’s a lovely product. I don’t think I would purchase it, because overall I would prefer other brands and a cheaper price, and I think there are other products that are equally as good and effective. But if you want some thing that is name brand and sounds bougie, that still works great, this is for you. Good option but comparable to other products
