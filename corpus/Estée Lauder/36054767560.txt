Received this for free in exchange for my honest review. I am loving this day wear moisturizer! I was skeptical at first, most creams with SPF are not moisturizing enough for me. This one actually moisturizers my face, I do not feel dry and itchy throughout the day. My combination skin gives me trouble. I also love that it does not leave my skin shiny or oily looking. A little goes a long way which is great because the price point is high for my liking. I would consider purchasing again though. Cause my skin enjoys this. Highly recommend. Great day wear cream
