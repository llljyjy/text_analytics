I recieved this product for free in exchange for my honest  review. I wasnâ€™t  too sure about this product at first as I have fairly sensitive under eyes, but I have bad dark circles so I gave it a try and absolutely love it. I work in the skincare industry and I really wish we carried this where I work. It gives a really nice instant brightening effect with extended results! It also does a great job with firming and bags as well! The consistency is more that of a gel-balm in my opinion but feels great regardless! Totally recommend
