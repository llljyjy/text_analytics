I received this Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Gel-CremeSynchronized Multi-Recovery Eye Cream sample from Influenster and Estee Lauder in exchange for my review. I have been looking for a new eye cream and I’ve found it! I love the gel-cream consistency. It feels luxurious and feels very hydrating. I use this at night and in the morning, my under eyes are soft and less dry. I have very dry under eyes. This cream helps this issue. I am still using it, so I haven’t seen yet any changes in the few wrinkles that I have. I will be purchasing a larger size to continue using the cream. nan
