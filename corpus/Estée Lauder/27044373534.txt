I received this product complimentary in return for my honest review from Influenster. I was really excited to see that I got it, although it is quite small. I gotta say, it is really creamy and feels nice on the skin. It does have a scent, but it’s not an overpowering one. I do think it feels nice, but sadly, because my sample is so small, I wasn’t able to see any real effects of it. I would be interested to see how it does effect my skin long term though. I personally think the price is a bit too high. But all in all a good product. Pretty good moisturizer
