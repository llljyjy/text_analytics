I got this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I love this cream. It has a pretty thick texture for an eye cream. It helps to diminish fine lines, and puffiness. It also helps to firm up the gentle under eye area. It works! It is very gentle, I didn’t experience any irritation after using it. There is also zero to no scent to it. At least not that I noticed. This little jar is pretty expensive, but I got it for free, which is why I don’t think I would purchase it. Amazing eye cream!
