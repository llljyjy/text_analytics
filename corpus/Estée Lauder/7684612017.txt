I really enjoyed this product. It’s a really nice, thick consistency that I really makes me feel like it’s locking in the hydration. It doesn’t dry immediately down and initially feels a little heavy, but that’s not something I personally mind. I’m not sure I really saw significant results but it did keep my under eyes hydrated over night. Locks In Hydration
