The moisturizer itself has a very smooth consistency and is very light weight. It’s almost like a gel or water cream in that it absorbs quickly into your skin after applying. It didn’t break me out or make my skin purge, which is a definite bonus. You don’t need to use much, in regular weather, a little goes a long way. With it being so lightweight, it doesn’t leave behind a heaviness or weird feeling on your skin. It also didn’t have an adverse reactions with my other products, which is always a good thing. Once the weather turned colder, however, I noticed it wasn’t nearly as effective. I definitely needed a heavier moisturizer as this one did not cut it then. I added a face oil for my last couple days using it, but it didn’t help that much. If you live in a colder and dryer area, you’ll probably need something heavier or a couple different products to offset what the cold does to your skin.In all honesty, while this is a good moisturizer, I’d say it’s not much different from my other go to moisturizers that are significantly cheaper. Price doesn’t always equate a better performing product and this is no exception.However! Is there a certain experience that goes along with using a high end skin cream on your face? Absolutely!
