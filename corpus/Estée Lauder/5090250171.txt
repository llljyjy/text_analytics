I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. I started using this as part of my daily routine for one week now before I wanted to review on both no makeup and makeup days. I firstly love that it contains spf-super important to me. For having spf, I was surprised light light and not greasy it was. It sat okay under my makeup, a different feel slightly more oily than normal but k also felt super hydrated. Testing product
