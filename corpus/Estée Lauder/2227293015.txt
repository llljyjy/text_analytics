I received this free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Upon opening the box, I was impressed by the sleek luxurious box Estee is known for. I felt super fancy. I used this eye cream for only two weeks and my very dark circle have been visibly reduced and my eye area is hydrated. I did not see much difference in my minimal lines but my main concerns are dark circles and hydration. I have used so many eye gels and creams with no results so I did not have high hopes but this is a holy grail for me. I donâ€™t even have to use concealer everyday anymore!! The texture is a silky gel, a little goes a long way, it spreads easily and absorbs pretty quick. The high price tag is literally the only negative I can think of. I would highly highly recommend this product! HG Eye Cream!
