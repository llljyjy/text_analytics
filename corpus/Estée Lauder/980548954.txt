I received a sample from Influenster for my honest review. First off, this seems to be an excellent cream. I used the entire sample, which lasted about 3 weeks and with continued use, I think I would see nice benefits. I couldn’t give 5 starts because the length of time I had to try it, and because of the smell. It’s not a BAD smell, but if you have a sensitive sniffer, it’s with mentioning. nan
