This is a mid-weight, creamy product. I haven’t been in the sun much, so not sure how well the SPF15 holds up. I have a bit drier t-zone, and it’s ok for keeping my cheeks feeling good. I usually put a bit of extra moisturizer on my forehead. A little does go a long way. There’s a hint of fragrance to it, so it might not be for you if you’re sensitive to smells. Overall, decent for daytime wear!  I received this product for free for testing purposes. nan
