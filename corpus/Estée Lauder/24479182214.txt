Okay so this moisturizer is okay. Yes, it does hydrate the skin, but since I have not been able to try it for a longer amount of time I can’t say it does anything else. I gave it only 3 stars because for the amount that this item costs, I expected a little more from it. The fragrance isn’t extreme so that was a plus and my skin didn’t seem to mind it. Unfortunately I have other moisturizers that are hydrating and moisturize much better. I expected more from this product
