I received this as a sample on Influenster. The texture is gel-like and feels luxurious on your skin. It has a very smooth application. It feels great on my skin and doesnâ€™t feel oily or sticky. Makes me feel refreshed and not dried out or oily in the mornings. Would definitely recommend as a good eye cream. Only used a week but I see my under eye bags not as dark as usual Eye gel/cream to keep skin around eyes hydrated
