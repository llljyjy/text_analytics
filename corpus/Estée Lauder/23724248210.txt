I received a sample of this product for free from Influenster and Ester Lauder in exchange for my honest review.  Full disclosure I have been a fan of Ester Lauder skincare for years. The Daywear cream is a staple in my routine so I was excited to try this eye gel/cream. It definitely is more of a gel than cream consistency. It goes on smoothly and has a pleasant light fragrance. Upon application, it feels hydrating and absorbs quickly into my skin. After 2 weeks of nightly use I can see a difference. My fine lines have soften bit and the overall appearance of my under eye area is plumper  and brighter. I really like it and highly recommend! Super Hydrating!!
