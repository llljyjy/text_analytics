I like how the gel-cream feels immediately soothing & hydrating on my under eyes. I haven’t noticed any other effects after about 2 weeks or so of use—which I would’ve continued, but I ran out of sample product. I still have visible fine lines. Perhaps my puffiness has gone down a little bit? But I can’t 100% credit that it’s from using this eye cream as my eye puffiness comes and goes. I wish I could’ve gotten at least 3-4 weeks use out of the product to get more definitive & conclusive results. But I still would recommend to others for the soothing and hydrating properties. nan
