This is a decent product. It’s not a total miss but it’s not a wow factor for me. I got a sample size to try courtesy of Influenster. I’ve used it up now and I don’t really miss it in my routine. I think it feels nice on my dry skin but other than that, it’s nothing I truly miss in my regimen. But it does have a nice feel to it. On the fence
