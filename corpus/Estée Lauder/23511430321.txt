This Advanced Night Repair Eye Cream is great! The consistency is smooth and smells wonderful. My eye area hasnâ€™t felt this soft and smooth in a long time! Most eye creams leave my under eye are feeling greasey in the morning, but this definitely did not. Feels light weight on the skin and is great at keeping everything hydrated and moisturized. Great product!
