I recently had the pleasure to meet the Estee Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme thanks to & . I have been reading good things about this product so I was overzealous to give this a try.I absolutely love the pretty gold jar. It was gorgeous which I have come to expect from Estee Lauder. When you open the jar, it has this fresh scent. It was very mild but pleasant. Next, I applied the creme. It was luxurious and creamy. The creme was silky smooth and applied to my skin flawlessly. I noticed how bright and youthful my skin looked after the very first application. My skin felt rejuvenated and refreshed.Benefits Firms StrengthenedRadiantNourishesLiftingMoisturizesCollagen BoostingDermatologist-testedOphthalmologist-testedDoesn’t cause BreakoutsWon’t Clog Pores (non-acnegenic)Suitable for the neck areaIngredientsHibiscus Morning Bloom Extract -- holds high Collagen boosting activity.Moringa Extract -- referred to as the “miracle tree“.
