This is a good hydrating essence. My skin felt supple and had a glow after I applied it however, It took a minute for this to soak into my skin and left a bit of a sticky texture. The biggest issue I had with this is that the scent so incredibly strong. I’m not a fan of highly scented facial products. If you love scented products and are in the market for a hydrating essence/serum for your routine then maybe you should try it, but I didn’t find it to be mind blowing. Heavily Fragranced
