I’ve been using this daily for about two months and I’ve noticed a definite improvement in my under eye texture and general bagginess. My eyes look better looked after in general. I love the gel texture because it really stays were you apply it and doesn’t move if you apply product on top of it. The eye cream has a very slight scent that is unnoticeable upon application and does not irritate my skin or eyes at all. nan
