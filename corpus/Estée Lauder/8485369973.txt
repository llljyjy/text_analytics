**I received the Estee Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ for free from Influenster for my honest review.**This is a nice moisturizer. I have been using this product for 8 days. My skin feels hydrated. I like the light floral fragrance. The creme is not thick and greasy. I only gave this 4 stars because I do not feel like it is any different from my usual moisturizer. I do not feel increased firmness or see a more lifted look. I might feel different if I continue to use this product longer. Nice moisturizer
