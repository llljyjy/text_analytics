Who don’t love Estée Lauder? I have been a part of their trials many times!!! I have never been let down by any product! You his review is incentivized as well. This crème is thick and stays on, and I swear you can feel it immediately getting absorbed into your skin!! It has a terrific smell, so it relaxes you as you are applying it. I wish they had a little more for a sample because you only get to use it 5 times which you won’t see any long term benefits but the short term was immediate. It got rid of my little crows feet around my eyes and my skin felt tighter. I would recommend this highly if you are debating about purchasing this. Just remember you get what you pay for!! A must have for aging akin
