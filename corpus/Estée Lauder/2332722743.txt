I received a sample size in exchange for my honest review. I don’t think that it added any moisture to my skin but it didn’t dry my skin out which is a huge plus. I have very sensitive skin and I’m happy that my skin didn’t react to this. I would buy a full size product to see what benefits continued use would provide. Decent Toner
