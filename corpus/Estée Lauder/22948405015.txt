I’ve been using this Advanced Night repair eye gel-cream for weeks now and so far I haven’t noticed a difference in my eye area. The texture is no thick which I kinda like it and dries up easily. I like it because you can use it underneath your make up and it’s actually moisturized my eye area and gives me that great result and smooth finish make up look. I will keep on using this product until I see better results. Not greasy and tacky
