My first impression was that the eye cream went on velvety smooth.  It made my eye area so soft and i couldnt stop touching it. The texture feels like a hybrid of serum and cream. Dimethicone listed as the second ingredient might be concerning for some. The scent is aligned with the rest of the line and it doesn’t linger which is a bonus. The moisturized feel didn’t last as long as I hoped it would. At this point I’ve already used up all the eye cream that was sent to me without seeing result. The eye cream also feels a bit irritating when apply near the waterline. There are better options out there
