I really enjoyed this as is the case with most Estee Lauder skin care. I love how smooth and soft it made my skin feel as well as how fast it soaked in without leaving any overly sticky residue. I received a small sample but felt it lasted longer than I thought. My reason for only giving 4 stars is the price compared to effect. While a little goes a long way, the price is a bit above what I would expect. If price is no issue, definitely give it a try. I received this to try for free from influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. I enjoyed it.
