I received a complimentary sample and I have been using this fabulous moisturizer for a week. This product has left my skin so hydrated. It’s  pleasantly scented, soaks into my skin quickly and leaves it dewy but not greasy thus making it a great base for my makeup application. Although it’s a thicker cream, a little goes a long way. I would gladly purchase this again A Dewy Glow
