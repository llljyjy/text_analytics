I wasn’t wow-ed by this product but it also was not terrible. My skin doesn’t look or feel particularly hydrated/glowy after the 1st 10 minutes. My skin does feel soft though. The product absorbed easily and had a decent amount of slip once I used a good amount of the moisturizer. This isn’t one of those “a little goes a long way” ones. I am neutral on the fragrance. I do see/feel some of the firming. nan
