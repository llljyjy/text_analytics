I guess I was expecting a little bit more based on everything it promised. The texture reminded me of a night cream, or a thicker consistency of a well-known oatmeal body moisturizer. I found that it was not not hydrating at all, if I put it on without any serums or treatments. It’s possible that the second ingredient, dimethicone, helps seal in some of your other products but then, if that’s the case, I can just use makeup primer instead of moisturizer however, I cannot, and do require the moisture. Based on my experience, I don’t believe I could recommend this to anyone for the purpose of moisture and if you need a decent make up primer well then maybe you should buy that instead. I hate leaving bad reviews, but I also want to be honest. Decent makeup primer alternative at best
