I received a sample of this product free for my honest review.   Has a pleasant,  light scent.  This is a nice, light moisturizer.   For my skin type, especially in the winter months, I would only use this as a daytime moisturizer as I need something richer and more emollient at night.  It actually seemed to dry me out slightly.  When i would use it at night, i woke up with flakes on my nose and around my mouth. Good daytime moisturizer
