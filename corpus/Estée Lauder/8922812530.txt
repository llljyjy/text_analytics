I would not say this is an instant fix, but it’s definitely showing results. It has the feel of Vaseline and is kind of like a peach matte version of that. But I can definitely see that it feels smooth and moisturized after application. I’ve been using for almost a month and I do t want to not use it… Results are on the way
