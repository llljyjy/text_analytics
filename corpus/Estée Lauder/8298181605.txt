To be honest, the sample I received was not enough to really evaluate the product. However, my first impressions are:+ smells nice but not overbearing+ feels smooth and moisturizing+ looks like a luxury product For how expensive it is, I don’t think I will be buying this product. If cost wasn’t an issue, I probably would buy it. nan
