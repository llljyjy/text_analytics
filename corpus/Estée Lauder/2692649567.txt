I am very impressed by this advanced night repair eye gel cream. The texture is so smooth and soft but it actually feels hydrated after using without feeling heavy without feeling oily without feeling sticky or without feeling like there’s a residue left in your under eye area, like normal moisturizing eye creams do. This formula just felt silky smooth and absorbed into your under eye area very quickly. When I woke up my eyes look refreshed and supple. I really love this product I haven’t seen a huge significance in dark circles yet but I don’t think I have been using it long enough to determine that but everything else looks and feels great after using and that is where to find in a formula that actually works. Love this
