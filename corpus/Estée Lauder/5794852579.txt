I really have zero complaints about this moisturizer and would very much recommend to those who like their moisturizer to be more on the thick side. Usually, thick moisturizers would leave your face greasy, but not this one, so for this alone I’ll give this product 5 stars. It also did not cause me to breakout, despite its dense texture. No fragrance, which is nice too. This was the first Estée Lauder skincare I used and it didn’t disappoint! I received this product complimentary from influenster in exchange for my honest review. Dense texture, no greasiness!
