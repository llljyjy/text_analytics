I have combination to slightly dry skin and typically use a serum, moisturizer, and sunscreen every morning, and replace the sunscreen with an oil in the evening.  I used the entire sample I received from Influenster of Estee Lauder’s Revitalizing Supreme+ Moisturizer Youth Power Crème.  The crème’s texture is similar to a thick gel and the scent is fairly light vs. other Estee Lauder products, just a slight fresh, floral hint.  The crème absorbed quickly and left my skin feeling plump and moisturized, but without any greasiness.  My sunscreen and makeup went on smoothly after just a few minutes and my skin remained soft and supple throughout the day.  This is a good option for a day crème, and I appreciated the mild scent, rich texture, and absorbability. Good option for normal to combination skin
