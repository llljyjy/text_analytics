I received a complimentary sample from Influenster and Estée Lauder for my honest review. I liked the smell of the toner however I normally prefer to not have scented products for my face. It was very hydrating and left my skin feeling smooth. The sample was small so I can’t say long term how it helped my skin but while using it, it was hydrating and I enjoyed using it after face washing and after shower. Hydrating and Toning
