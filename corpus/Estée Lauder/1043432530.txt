This moisturizer comes in a beautiful glass jar with a shiny gold cover and would look nice on any vanity. Revitalizing Supreme+ feels soft and silky to the touch. It absorbed right into my skin and made it feel so soft and hydrated! I was able to easily apply makeup after using this moisturizer. I have combination T-zone skin and so far Revitalizing Supreme+ hasnâ€™t made my face look oily! Amazing new moisturizer.
