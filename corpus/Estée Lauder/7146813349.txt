I do enjoy Est√©e Lauder cosmetics and was excited to try their new Advanced Night repair eye supercharged gel-cream. First of all, it does work! It does helped me with my dark circles and under eye puffiness. I had some cooling effect after applying. Eyes definitely look more rested. But after just a week of using it I got some irritation under one of my eyes. I tried stop using it and restarted again in a week, but same thing happened. I really want to use it, but seems it is not for me :( nan
