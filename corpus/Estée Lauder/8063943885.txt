I consider it to be a medium weight moisturizer, somewhere between a gel and a cream. It’s not enough for night time (for my dry skin) but good for daytime use. It has a scent but I didn’t find it to be overly perfumed, which is what I’ve come to expect from a brand like this. This is definitely pricey though, $95 for 1.69 ozs. It did leave my skin feeling soft but otherwise just don’t think there’s anything special about this to justify that kind of price. Not worth the price
