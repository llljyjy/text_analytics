I received this as a complimentary sample.  This cream has really helped my aging skin more supple and smooth. I am almost 50 with combination skin.  The cream has a medium-thick consistancy with a light scent that smells nice. It absorbs well without leaving a greasy/oily feel.  I only needed to use a small amount to apply to my face and neck.  My skin feels really soft after each use.  It gives my skin a slight glow also.  I am very happy at how well this has worked on my skin. Great for all skin types
