The sample size wasn’t large enough for me to use for a long period of time to see how this product would affect my skin. I have applied it in the evening after a shower a couple of times now. My skin does feel nice when I put it on and it looks nice in the morning when I get up. The product itself is a nice gel texture and feels really creamy going on the skin. It feels thick at first but then it smoothed over the skin. I’m not sure what the long-term benefits of this product would be because the sample size only allowed for a couple of applications. I usually use the Dermalogica skin care line and I’m very happy with it. But for now I’m going to stick with Dermalogica because I’ve used that line for 20+ years and I know it works long-term. If I’m able to try the revitalizing serum plus moisturizer for longer term I’ll be sure to update my review. Nice for a few applications
