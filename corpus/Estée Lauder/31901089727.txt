This is a five star product. First I love that it does not have a strong fragrance! It barely has a scent at all. Second, my face feels very hydrated and it has reduced the redness I often experience. I plan to continue to use this product! This hydrated my face without leaving it greasy feeling. It was so easy to apply. I did use a cotton ball to apply. Very Hydrating!
