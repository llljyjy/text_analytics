•Results•I used this product several times over the course of a week. The amount provided in this deluxe sample probably would not have lasted an entire week morning and evening, however, I had to spread out my use due to a reaction. I was not sure initially that this product was causing the reaction, but I am fairly certain now. After two uses, my skin began to peel. The peeling was not painful, but was worrisome since I did not anticipate any peeling from this crème. I have used peels and chemical exfoliants - this is not that. I wanted to like this. It sits nicely on the skin and is luxurious feeling. My skin felt good while using it. The unexplained peeling, though, made me hesitate to use this product. Additionally, it is highly fragranced, if you are sensitive or would prefer to go without.I did not change any other products from my usual routine besides substituting morning and evening moisturizer for the Supreme+ Youth Power Crème. The peeling lasted two days and there was no irritation. However, I didn’t want to be peeling in my Christmas photographs, so I interrupted use midway through the week and tried again, post festivities. Same reaction.Verdict:I wanted to like this product, but it did not agree with my skin. I have combination-dry skin, that is generally resilient (non-sensitive.) The size was not really big enough to test properly against the products claims (if I had not had the peeling reaction and ceased use.) I think that it is still worth a try for someone else. I did enjoy the texture and feel of the product on my skin, but unfortunately it is not for me.2/5 ⭐️ Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Crème
