I received a complimentary sample of Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Moisturizing Crème in exchange for my honest review. My skin is usually very dry and scaly. After using it for two weeks, I can already see and feel a difference in my skin.  I really like the way that my skin feels after putting this moisturizer on. It feels soft, silky and hydrated. It made my foundation look smoother, as well. It has a light, pleasant scent that I like. I recently had a birthday, and someone actually mentioned how smooth my skin looked! Softer Skin
