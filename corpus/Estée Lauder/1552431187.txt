I received this product in a Vix Nix from Influenster. I was able to test this product for some time to see the full effects. My skin is more smooth and hydrated. I have problem areas with super dry patches mainly around my nose and around corners of mouth. Those areas are more hydrated than usual allowing for a smoother more airbrushed finish to my foundation application. Essence in a Bottle
