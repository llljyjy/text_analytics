I was excited to receive this product because where I live the weather was fluctuating like crazy and my skin was not pleased.  This product will not replace my normal sunscreen because SPF15 is not enough (I’m often compared to a vampire for good reasons)! I added it to my morning routine right before I applied my sunscreen and my skin felt like velvet. I didn’t expect immediate results so I was surprised to feel like it actually made such a difference so quickly. My skin felt and looked healthier! I don’t see this as being a “Year Round“ product but for the colder months I think it could be a nice addition to really help boost my skin hydration.  I was even comfortable enough to pull other hydrating products from my routine because I didn’t think they were needed. The product does have a fragrance but it’s not overpowering and I personally find it to be quite pleasant. I Possible New Addition to Winter Routine
