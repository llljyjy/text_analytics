I received this product for free in exchange for a honest review. I have combo skin but I am starting to see fine lines at 35 years old. I focused on my whole face but paid special attention to my eyes as that is where the fine lines are appearing. I didn’t se a dramatic difference after using the cream for a few days however my fave felt extremely moisturized. The product is thick but it really seems to absorb into your skin without leaving a greasing feeling. I’m fact my face felt soft almost as if I placed powder on my face. It has been especially hot in my state but I didn’t notice my face feeling oily or my makeup running off with this product on. I did notice a very faint scent while applying. All in all I would say it’s a great moisturizer. I’m not sure it’s a fix all for all fine lines but having moisturized skin will help with those to some degree. I definitely like this product and am considering adding it to my normal beauty regimen. Thanks Influenster for the free sample! Great moisturizer!
