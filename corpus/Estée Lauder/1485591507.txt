I received a delux sample in exchange for a review through Influenster. This product is okay. It’s heavily silicone based which is nice under makeup, but not really my preference. I didn’t really see any long term benefits. It’s not bad, but it’s so expensive for what it does. If you want an eye cream for under makeup, and you have the money, you’ll like it. Just okay
