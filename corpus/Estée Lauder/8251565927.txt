I’m all about texture when it comes to skincare and I love how this smooth gel cream feels. It absorbs really well, and leaves a silky finish. My skin feels instantly refreshed and hydrated. I’m not sure that this product made much difference in my dark circles yet, but it did make my eyes look less tired and I look forward to continue to use it! nan
