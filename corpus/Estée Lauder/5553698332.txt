I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange of review. I have dry skin and this moisturizer felt so nice at night. For me, it was slightly too heavy to wear during the day under my makeup. I loved how hydrating it was and my skin looked really lovely in the morning. Unfortunately, I can’t attest to the anti aging and long term effects because I got a deluxe sample size, but I would definitely consider buying a full size as we’re moving into fall and winter. Luxurious feeling
