I received this Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Gel-Creme from Estee Lauder and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. First let me just tell you how much I love Estee Lauder! I have always been a fan of their products and this one has been one of the best eye gel-cremes that I’ve used. It is very light weight and doesn’t peel or bunch up when dried like a lot of eye creams do. I’ve been using it for a little over two weeks now and I can see a major difference in the dark circles and fine lines under my eyes. You only need a little bit of the product because it goes a long way. If you or anyone you know are looking for a good under eye product that works this is it! I would highly recommend this product and will continue to purchase it! The Best!
