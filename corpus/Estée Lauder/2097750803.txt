This product has a good amount of moisturizer for your skin without the sticky/heavy feeling. I didn’t particularly like the smell, but it seems to fade with some time. This is good to layer under foundation. The price point is not that great for the amount. I didn’t feel like it was magical enough for me to buy on my own for $55. Estée Lauder daywear
