First and foremost, I want to disclose that I got this product complementary for my honest review, so here it goesâ€¦I honestly loved  this product. There was no fragrance, it felt amazing under the eyes, and sank into my skin really well so it left things soft and lovely. It was a dream to blend makeup over it and I really liked it more than the cream. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product! Amazing!!!!
