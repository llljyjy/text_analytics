I received this complimentary from Estée Lauder and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Three stars for the texture, it is a gel cream that feels both light and substantial. It spreads easily and a little goes a long way. I did not see drastic differences after a week of use, but will keep using to see results. Pros: didn’t irritate my skin, which eye creams can do. Cons: the price point is a deterrent, I’m not sure this would outperform more affordable options. nan
