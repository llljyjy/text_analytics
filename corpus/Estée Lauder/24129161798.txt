I got this product for free from influenster and Estee Lauder, in exchange for my honest opinion  At first, I wasn’t sure about this product. It doesn’t have a smell and doesn’t look particularly appealing. However, after using it a few times, I could tell it was making a difference. My skin looks clearer and more evenly toned. The dark circles and fine lines seem less harsh. Definitely a keeper
