I received this product as a free sample from Influenster for exchange of my honest review. This is the first time of me trying something from Estee Lauder, so I was excited. First impression, it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin, it barley has scent. A little goes a long way! It’s not too thick and it blends right into the skin. I haven’t seen a major difference yet, but am willing to test and see! So far I like it and I do recommend. nan
