I received this product for free in exchange for giving my honest opinion about it.This product worked really well with my skin.  It’s an amino acid moisturizing infusion with waterlily, and while I don’t really know if this combination is the best, I have applied it to my skin and it leaves it very hydrated and soft. I know  drinking water helps to have hydrated skin, but I feel that by pairing good habits like drinking water with this product, more hydrated healthy skin is very achievable. Lastly, I really liked how the bottle looked, and overall, I really liked this product. Soft Clean Infusion
