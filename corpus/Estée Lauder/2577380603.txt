I am almost 50 and have started noticing fine lines, loss of elasticity and uneven skintone so I had high hopes for this moisturizer.  I have combination skin and found this product to be wonderfully creamy. I was able to get about a week of use from this sample and saw improvements to my skin issues. Unfortunately I also ended up with dry, red, flaky patches on my cheek and jawline.  For this reason I am unable to use this long term. Works we....but....
