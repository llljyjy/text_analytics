I thought this moisturizer did a great job at hydrating my skin. I think it is also improving the texture. And does make the skin feel smoother and more hydrated. It is a little thicker than I usually prefer but I am very sensitive to feeling anything on my skin and think for most people it would not be an issue. The cream itself is very smooth and, well, creamy and pleasant to put on. Not sure how much it actually helps with fine lines since this is much more of a long term results observation. I do think it is very expensive though for how much you get and do find some less expensive products do work better. Pretty good but expensive
