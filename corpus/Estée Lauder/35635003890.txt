I received this product as a free sample to review and give my honest opinion of it. I love that just a little goes a long way. The packaging is cute and the gel doesn’t give me any bad reactions. I do have to say after a month of using I really haven’t seen a difference but its a great nightly routine. I’ll continue to use until I run out and see if I see any differences. Gel eye cream
