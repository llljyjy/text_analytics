I hated this product. I used it for about two weeks and I hoped it would moisturize my dry flaky skin, but it did nothing to improve the condition of my skin. It was heavy and greasy, but not hydrating at all. It did however clog my pores and cause a breakout. I will not use this product again. Disliked
