I love Estee Lauder, it works perfectly for my skin, I never had any problems or issues with this brand. The moisturizer is great, now that the air got soooo dry in Texas, I must have a good moisturizer. I apply it ok face and neck, in the morning and at night. The skin feels good, as it feels very dry after washing it. Great one!
