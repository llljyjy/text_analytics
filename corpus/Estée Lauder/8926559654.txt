I received a sample of Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Moisturizer Youth Power Creme free in exchange for my honest review. Turning 30 this year has really started making me think about how I can preserve my youth! I have used this cream every morning for 14 days now, and I really have notified some subtle changes already which is kinda nuts. I noticed that some of the finer wrinkle lines around my eyes seem to be less pronounced and I feel like my cheeks and forehead skin are more firm and slightly tightened. I am pretty confident that with continued use, I would get some pretty notable improvements. I didn’t have any problems with skin sensitivity despite having some dryness around my eyes when I started using this and I also didn’t have any worsening of my preexisting acne battle. Keep Me Young!
