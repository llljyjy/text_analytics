Estée Lauder is a brand I associated with my mother or grandmother, so it’s not the type of brand I would typically seek out on my own. However, I got a sample via Influenster and figured I’d try it out. I was pleasantly surprised as to how much I liked this moisturizer. The consistency was thick but went on smoothly, which gives it a luxurious feel when applying. It’s heavier than many other moisturizers, so I’m not sure I would recommend it to someone with an oily face, but since my face is often quite dry and especially so in the middle of the winter, this has really helped to keep it from drying out all day. nan
