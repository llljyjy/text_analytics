I received this free for my honest opinion from Influenster. First off I must say that the sample was not large enough to give a good review. The smell is also very off putting. The texture was nice and it went in my skin smoothly and it absorbed well. I just can’t tell if it made much of a difference especially for that price. I don’t think I would buy it to find out. Meh
