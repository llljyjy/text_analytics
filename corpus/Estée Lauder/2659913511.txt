I was offered to test the Estée Lauder Revitalizing+ Supreme Moisturizer Power Creame complimentary in exchange for my honest review. I was sent a sample size to test and honestly, the cream is so thick and emollient that a little goes a long way. Even the small size will last me about two weeks using it morning and night. The cream has a very nice soft aroma that isn’t overpowering.The texture is perfect, not oily, not too thin, but also not too thick. Even though I’m in Texas and it’s super hot in August, I can use the cream morning and night with no issues. I have combination skin, but it tends to be more on the dry side. I haven’t noticed any visual differences in my skin yet, but I’ve only been using the product for one week, so I look forward to using it more Fantastic for dry skin!
