I received a sample free from Influenster and had not previously used toner in my skincare routine. I started using this after washing my face in the shower, and I just pour a little on my hands and pat it on my face and a little goes a long way. I like the way it hydrates my skin when I get out of the shower, before I moisturize. After 3 days I noticed myself grabbing for it and will definitely repurchase. I noticed my skin felt more hydrated throughout the day and I liked adding it to my skincare routine Great toner
