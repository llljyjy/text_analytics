Thanks to Influenster I was gifted a jar of this product in exchange for my honest thoughts and review. Typically, I’m not very impressed with skincare products as I feel many make extravagant claims but usually don’t live up to the hype. In the case of this Estee Lauder day cream, however, I feel they under advertise the product! I was actually quite impressed with it. It smells like a light cucumber melon scent and feels cool as it glides on your skin. The only thing I would like to see it do more of is plumping. That being said, my skin felt plumped and hydrated, I just didn’t notice a visible difference. In addition, one of the best qualities about this is that it feels like you wouldn’t need a primer along with it.  It makes your skin feel so even and smooth that it already feels primed! Also, it doesn’t give that film like feeling that many SPFs leave your skin with. I happily use this everyday now and am grateful for having received this opportunity. No primer needed?
