This product is very hydrating and the texture is AMAZING. It feels cooling too. I received a small sample size , so in about two weeks I did not notice any difference in fine lines or appearance of my under eyes. I did like the gel-cream formulation, but that wouldnâ€™t be enough for me to spend 70 on it. lovely but pricey
