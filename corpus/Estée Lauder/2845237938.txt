I originally received this product I. Exchange for my honest review through Influenster. Since then, this has become a staple in my nighttime skin routine! I don’t avoid the mirror in the morning anymore! My skin is soft, subtle, and glowy. My husband has even complimented my skin lately. It’s a thick moisturizer that goes on smooth but does feel heavy. It’s definitely not a daytime moisturizer, but is perfect for an overnight routine. It does have a fragrance, but it’s VERY subtle, fresh, and luxurious smelling. The way my skin looks feels after using this for a little over a month has me hooked. I don’t think I could use another nighttime moisturizer again! That Morning Glow
