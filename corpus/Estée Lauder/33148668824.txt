I think the quality of this estee lauder youth power creme moisturizer is fantastic. Unfortunately, I think the value just isn’t there, I could just apply this all day long and it is much too expensive for that kind of use. The formula is super hydrating and my skin was plump and super velvety soft, but it took a lot of product to cover my face and even so much more to saturate my neck and cleavage area. Thanks for the sample but there’s no way I could justify over a hundred bucks a month to moisturize my face. Great product!
