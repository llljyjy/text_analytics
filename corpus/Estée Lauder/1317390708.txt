I got this product complimentary from Influenster and Estee Lauder in exchange for my honest review. I have combination skin, very oily t-zone, and this product made my skin even oiler. I woke up a giant greaseball every time I used this product. It also has a scent, not too overpowering, but rather old lady-ish and mature. I did use this product on my hands (because they are super dry from all the hand washing and sanitizing) and it did leave my hands soft and silky smooth. If it wasnt for the price point, I might consider buying this to use as a hand cream at night. The cream is thick and silky, so this product might work really well for those that have dry skin (like it did on my hands), more so than combo or oily skin types. I also didn’t see any improvements in lifting or firmness, but since I did receive a sample size, I’m not sure I was able to test the product long enough to see if there are any long term benefits and results. nan
