(Received Complimentary In Exchange For My Honest Review)While I didn’t notice any major changes in my skin while using, there was plenty about this moisturizer that I did love, for starters one of my faves, is just how lightweight it is while remaining quite hydrating. Its soft smooth texture is def one to love, and the scent, very pretty, very soft & quite subtle. Everyone’s skin is different, I say give it a try perhaps purchase the smaller size before fully committing though. Great Texture
