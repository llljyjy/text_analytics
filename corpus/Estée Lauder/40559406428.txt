I received a sample through Influenster and I have used this product for about a week and I absolutely love it. It’s so smooth and creamy and makes my skin so soft. I have noticed a little firming under my chin/neck which is where I have the most issues. I also noticed between my eyebrows was a little tighter.  I have pretty normal skin and it didn’t make my skin feel greasy, it didn’t have much scent which I like. I am definitely going to keep using. Love this moisturizer!
