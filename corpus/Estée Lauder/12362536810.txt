Ive been including decided to include this in my nightly routine, and its provided skin nice hydration.This does a wonderful job of locking the moisture in, which makes me skin feels soft and supple  in the morning. A little bit goes a long way. I love the light and cooling feel and texture of the lotion. I like my facial products to have zero to very light fragrance and this product is a little more than what it like.I havenâ€™t used this for more than a month to see full results but I do like the hydration results I see so far.
