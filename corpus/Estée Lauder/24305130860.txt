I love this product! The sample size I received was enough for 2 weeks day and night. It feels very hydrating when you put it on. I wouldn’t say it’s a toner, it’s and essence treatment lotion, to be used after toners. It’s softens and hydrates my skin. I usually use SKII essence but have switched over to Estée Lauder bc of the price. I like this just as much. You can’t tell a huge difference when you start using it, only when you stop using the product do you notice the big difference. When I stop using it, I tend to break out even more. I loved it so much, I bought a full sized bottle after I finished the free sample. Thank you Influenster, this was a hit for me!! Hydrating essence
