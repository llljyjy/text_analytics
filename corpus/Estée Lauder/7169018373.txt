I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Est√©e Lauder in exchange for my honest opinion of the product. I absolutely loved this for nighttime! I loved the way it felt when I put it on my face, I loved they way my skin felt afterwards, and I loved that I could definitely see an improvement in my skin after using it.I used it in conjunction with the Estee Lauder Revitalizing Serum. I think it would be too heavy for me to use during the day but I love it for night. I give it a 10 out of 10! 5 Stars
