This moisturizer is nice and light my husband loved it too,although the smell is a little overpowering it did mellow out after about 10 minutes.  The fragrance is nice just a bit overpowering at first. Time will tell if this actually works but so far itâ€™s nice and has not made me break out.  I did receive a sample size of this product to test in exchange for my honest review Give it a shot
