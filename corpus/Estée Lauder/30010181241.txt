I have been using Estée Lauder serum for years and now it’s my favorite skin care brand, they always makes amazing products and the advanced night repair eye cream does not disappoint. I’ve been using the product morning and night and have seen a difference in my under eyes and skin overall. My dark circles have been less pigmented, eyes feel hydrated and plump as well as noticing any fine lines I have around my eyes appear less visible. A great product to add to your daily skin care routine. I Love this brand
