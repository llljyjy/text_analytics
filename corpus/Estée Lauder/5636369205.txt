This moisturizer is lightweight, not greasy, or sticky. It sinks into skin well and leaves it moisturized all day! I love that it has sunscreen in it, because we should all wear more sunscreen! There is not strong scent, but a light “clean” scent. I had trouble telling if it the spf was chemical or mineral, but it didn’t leave a white cast! I have normal/sometimes dry skin. I would wear in winter and summer, although I might need to layer more spf for summer. A wonderful, all day moisturizer!
