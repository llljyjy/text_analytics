I received a complimentary sample of Estee Lauder Supreme+ Youth Power cream from Influenster. I have dry skin and this moisturizer does a good job of keeping my skin plump and moisturized. I haven’t noticed dramatic results for fine lines and wrinkles but it does make your skin youthful and gives you the glow from within. My only con for this product is the scent is too strong, but if you don’t mind the strong fragrance I highly recommend! Moisturizing and glow from within!
