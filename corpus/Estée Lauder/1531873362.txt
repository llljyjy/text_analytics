My skin was predominantly combo before I started using Tretinoin. I received a sample size of this to review, and it honestly came at the perfect time. My skin barrier was suffering, and after a few nights of applying this over my Tret, my skin is smooth, soft, and hydrated again. I was shocked by how hydrating this cream was. I will definitely be purchasing. Incredible for dry skin
