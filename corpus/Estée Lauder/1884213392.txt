I received this product initially by Influenster for free to provide a review of my honest opinion .  I then bought some from Estée Lauder because I love the product it makes my skin so soft and nice. The price isn’t bad because you don’t use a ton of it . It sinks into the skin and just feels so nice, not greasy or heavy at all. Must have!!
