This cleanser works so well! It makes my skin feel sparkling clean! It’s a bit drying, but not much. I was halfway thru the tube when I noticed that this cleanser is not for the eye area. It hadn’t bothered my eyes so far, and it seemed odd that it isn’t supposed to be used to remove eye makeup. Granted, I always double cleanse with a balm first, but I still expect my night cleanser to remove eye makeup safely. I also found out this cleanser is made from animal products. I won’t be purchasing it again. Avoid Eye Area
