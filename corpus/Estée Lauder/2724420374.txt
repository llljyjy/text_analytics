In terms of skincare, when it comes to eye creams, I tend to be a bit more particular and specific about what I’m looking for and what I like to use for my under eyes. I was always taught that when it comes to your under eyes, to be as gentle and take extra care. I started using eye creams here and there when I was in my 20s and only recently started using them routinely and for targeted reasons. For me, my biggest concern when it comes to my under eyes is the dark circles. I’m no stranger to Estée Lauder skincare and was able to sample their night cream some time ago. I wasn’t crazy about the cream and found it to be a bit too “mature” for me personally so I was curious to see if this repair eye cream would leave me with a similar impression… boy was I wrong! I loved this eye cream that I got to try complimentary for my review. My biggest concern was that this eye cream would be heavily scented. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that this eye cream barely had a scent(I get bad headaches and prefer to steer clear of products with heavy scents). I also loved that this repair cream works its magic almost instantly but when you use it consistently, it really helps repair your under eyes! I wear a lot of makeup regularly as well as lash extensions so I’m constantly focusing on my under eye area specifically. When I applied this cream at night the first time, it immediately brightened my under eyes! The texture and feel of the cream is light and smooth like water which I also really loved(versus a heavy/thick cream). Overtime as I continued to use this repair eye cream nightly I noticed a good improvement in my dark circles brightening. I also looked more rested and awake and looked more “youtful”. Honestly, I’m so glad I got to sample this repair eye cream! I love it and would definitely recommend it, I have no complaints and think it works great for all skin types and “EYE” LOVE THIS CREAM
