I have combination skin, mostly dry throughout the day, especially in the morning. I have to use a skin moisturizer. I don’t use it everyday, but sometimes my skin is in need of a miracle, even my eyelids feel dry. After using the moisturizer it left my face looking very refreshed. My face felt hydrated and it didn’t have that tightness feeling that comes with dry skin. I also was complemented that I looked younger after apply this product to my face. Refreshed Face
