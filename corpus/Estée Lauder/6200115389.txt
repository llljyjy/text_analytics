I love estee lauder products and this one is definately a hit.  It works wonderfully ans had made me rethink my “goto“ moisturizer since this one is so much more silly and absorbs quickly with no sticky feel.  Its lightweight, but packs a big punch in the moisture department.  My skin felt smoother and foundation went on beautifully over this product. The only issue I have is the scent is more obvious than I like with my skin care, but this goes away quickly. Silky and lightweight
