My review will have to be more of a first impression,  since what I received was only a travel size. The moisturizer is a thicker formula that I had to use a little more than what I’d normally use. It didn’t spread easily or absorb fast. The scent was minimal but pleasant. I can’t attest to long term benefits yet. I will incorporate this more with my nighttime routine. It did however, pair nicely with my other skin care products & makeup. nan
