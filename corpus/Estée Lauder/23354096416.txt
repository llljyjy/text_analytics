I usually LOVE estee Lauder products. This one I am not too sure yet. I have used it a few times and I feel like its a little bit to greasy for my taste. I have combination skin so I need something thats not heavy and greasy it caused me to break out. I am continuing to use it as I know some products do that at first because its new to my skin, so I will change my review if it changes. The packaging was cute. I really wanted this to work because it smells amazing but if you have oily or combination skin just be careful because it did cause me to break out. However it did make my skin feel soft and smooth, i do like that but the very first use scared me with the breakout the next day. I am going to give it one more week and will follow up if it changes.I feel like this is for woman who have more dryer skin. if you have dry skin this would be great for you. I got this for free for testing purposes. Not for oily skin.
