After using this product I feel like I could tell that my face was more hydrated by feel, but no obvious visible differences. The feeling of hydration was immediate, but again, visibly I just didn’t see a difference. The texture of the cream was nice, smooth, almost gel-like, and I could tell it was hydrating. I can recommend for the hydrating gel, if you’re goal is to feel hydrated, but if you are hoping to see visible hydrating results, I can’t guarantee it will do that based on my experience.Would you recommend it to others? Why? Why not? Good for the hydrating feel but...
