I received a free sample of this miracle creme from Influenster, and I can say without a doubt that this creme will stay on my vanity. It’s just perfect. My skin is so incredibly soft and supple. I feel like my smile lines around my eyes have diminished. The scent: it’s a perfect nostalgic light cosmetic scent that makes me happy. I clean my face and pat this creme around my eyes, on my face, neck, and décolletage before bed and when I wake up. SOOO SMOOTH! Love love love  .. pssst.. I’m 40 YESSSSS
