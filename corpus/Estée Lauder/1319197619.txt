I’m sorry to say this eye cream did nothing for me...I’ve used many different eye creams, and this one seemed to just moisturize the eye area. I noticed no difference in puffiness, dark circles, sagging, etc. I think for the price point there are probably more effective eye creams with more dramatic results. Didn't really see a difference...
