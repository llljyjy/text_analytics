I love Estee Lauder, so I was pleased when I received a sample of this moisturizer from Influenster in return for an honest opinion. This moisturizer feels light on the skin, not greasy or heavy, which is exactly what Iâ€™m looking for (especially in this warm weather). I pair this with an Estee Lauder eye cream as part of my night routine. I love it and would absolutely recommend! Another great EL product!
