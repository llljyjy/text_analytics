Eh it’s just okay. It hasn’t turned my head from my regular Korean skincare daily moisturizer and mineral sunscreen from Target that cost less than this product combined. Don’t get me wrong, it’s perfectly nice. It has some great ingredients in it and has a nice crème finish. It has a cucumber-y scent which is nice but unnecessary. A few hours into wear, I’m personally tired of any perfumey smell on my face. I wouldn’t trust the SPF on its own lol. It’s a also chemical sunscreen which isn’t the healthiest option. It’s a lovely texture too, but I’m sticking with my regular products. My impression is that it’s nothing special. Nothing special
