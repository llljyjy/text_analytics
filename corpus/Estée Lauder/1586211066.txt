I used this for about a year and it made absolutely no difference at all. Now at night I use a retinoid (Algenist Repairing oil), argan oil and Lancome absolue cream and I wake up with the most luxurious, plump, nourished, healthy perfect skin w no pores, wrinkles or dark spots or acne scars. This promised to repair at night and did nothing at all. Made no difference for me
