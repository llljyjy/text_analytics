This cream was ok. I did like that it felt light yet rich at the same time. It didn’t apply sticky or tacky and absorbed nicely. But, I didn’t think it did much for my skin. I didn’t notice any major improvement (or, really, even minor) and for the price, I would have liked to see better results. However, I also just received a sample size so perhaps I’d see better results if used for a longer period of time. This product is scented (as all Estée Lauder products are) but isn’t as strong as others I’ve tried. Ok but nothing special.
