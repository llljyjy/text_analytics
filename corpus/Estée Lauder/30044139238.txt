I took two stars off this product solely due to the packaging. I received this item for free from Influenster and Estee Lauder in exchange for my honest review. The product itself is solid. I’m not saying it’s revolutionary or anything but it’s a decent quality skincare item. I didn’t see any changes in my skin with it, but it did feel good on the skin and it didn’t have any ill effects either. The BOTTLE however. Open it and it’s just a big gaping hole there with no means of application unless you wanna put it on a cotton round and waste half the product. I wasted half of it anyway just trying to get it out in a productive manner.If this were put in a spray container or even a small squeeze container I would give it another shot. You're gonna make a mess
