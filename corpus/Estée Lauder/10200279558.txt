This product for me was 50/50. I do feel it is actually moisturizing my skin and I always love when products have SPF on it. On the other side, It feels a little bit heavy on the skin upon application and the fragrance, although not unpleasant, takes a while to fade. No breakouts so far thought. I will use it until I run out of it but still not sure I will restock on it. Pros and Cons for me
