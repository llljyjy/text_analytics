I received this product as a free sample. This is a nice daytime facial moisturizer that has SPF in it. I like that it has a light, cucumber melon scent rather than the usual sunscreen scent (coconut?). It’s fairly thick, but feels fairly lightweight. I don’t feel like this facial moisturizer keeps my skin as moisturized as my usual facial moisturizer which is why I didn’t give it five stars. nan
