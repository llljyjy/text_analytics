I received this product complimentary for testing purposes through Influenster. I did find the texture of this eye cream to be particularly unique. It is slightly heavier than a typical gel texture and feels incredibly creamy and soft when applied. A word of caution: if your skin is more sensitive/reactive like mine is, I recommend trying a sample first if you are able to get your hands on one. I noticed some breakouts on my cheeks near my undereye area after I began using this eye cream which quickly went away after I discontinued use. For me, while this product is unique, the price point is too far outside of my budget for me to justify. Unique texture but expensive
