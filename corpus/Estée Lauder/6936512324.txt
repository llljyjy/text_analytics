I recieved a free sample of this product from #influenster in exchange for my honest review.  Packaging: pretty,  nice quality container, easy to access product, no waste d/t container shape. Product: creamy,  smooth,  light texture leaves skin feeling moisturized but not oily or greasy. Hard to assess anti-aging benefits d/t size of sample.  Cons: cost - itâ€™s a high end moisturizer which is reflected in the price point. Nice quality product
