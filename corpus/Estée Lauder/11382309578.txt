The texture of this Advanced Night Repair Eye Gel-Creme is great because it’s soft and adheres to your skin well. Unfortunately, I experienced a burning sensation when I applied it to my face. The feeling lingered later on.Apparently, the gel-creme contains barley extract, along with other ingredients made from wheat, so it isn’t gluten-free. I think these ingredients may have something to do with the irritation I experienced.As for results, the fine lines around my eyes slightly improved and my skin wasn’t quite as dry, but there were no noticeable changes to the area otherwise. Overall, I’m very disappointed in this product. Great texture, but caused burning sensation
