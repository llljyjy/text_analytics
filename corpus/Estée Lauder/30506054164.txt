My skin felt oily and I didn’t notice any difference in my skin other then a few minor pimples. I saw no immediate results either. I didn’t notice it to make difference with fine lines. The texture of the cream was nice and silky feeling. Personally I don’t think this was a good fit for my skin. I  wouldn’t recommend it only because it made my skin break out and feel oily. Not a fan
