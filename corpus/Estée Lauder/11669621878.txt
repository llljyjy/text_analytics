I received this product complementary from influenster and Estee Lauder for my honest review. The revitalizing supreme plus youth power cream has moringa extract and hibiscus bloom extract. I somewhat enjoyed trying this product out. My skin felt replenished and felt very hydrated. I used this right after I washed my face , morning and night. I feel as if it gave me more of a firmer skin and tightness. The only thing I did not care for in this product is the smell. Itâ€™s very strong and if you are sensitive to the smell, try a sample of it and see if you would continue to use it. I thought it was nice and a good product but I cant stand the smell and for that reason I will not replenish this product. It's nice but strong scent
