I received this product free to try from Influencer in exchange for my honest review. I love trying new skin care products and this one did not disappoint. I found it to be light and creamy with a light, pleasant scent. I have the beginning stages of maturing skin, age 49, and I found this to really moisturize my skin as well as leave it looking bright and glowing. I donâ€™t wear a full face of makeup every day and this moisturizer left my skin feeling and looking luminent. Will definitely recommend and purchase if it goes on sale. A little higher priced than I can usually afford. Perfect addition to my skin care routine!
