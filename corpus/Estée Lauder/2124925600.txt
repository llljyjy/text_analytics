I have the mini version of this and have been using it for almost 3 weeks now…I actually really like it! My skin is normally very dry/combo and I have rosacea. I apply this shortly after cleansing and wait for it to fully absorb before moisturizing. It’s a watery consistency. I’m not sure how the full-size spout looks but in the mini, it’s an open mouth which makes applying a bit messy. I pour a little into my palm and dip my finger to apply to different areas of my face. I feel like this is definitely a liquid moisturizer but not enough to wear alone, but a great option for super dry folks to reinforce their moisturizer. Since using it I’ve had far less dry spotting! It’s quite expensive though for a full-size - not sure how this wears long term so I can’t say if I think the price is worth it. I’d love to try this during peak winter though! 4 stars for tricky packaging. Great moisturizer reinforcement
