I received a deluxe sample and was able to use for a little over a week.  Did I see any of the benefits that they claim?  Not really.  The only thing I can say about it is that itâ€™s a really nice moisturizer and a little too much for me to use in the morning.  I used it at night and I did notice my skin was softer.  I would like to buy a bigger size and give it more time. nan
