I received this product for free from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review. The eye gel-crème has a soothing and cooling texture. It left my undereyes feeling nicely hydrated and skin feeling smoother. No odd scents or perfumes which I like. Did not see a huge difference in dark circles but perhaps after continued use I would. Enjoyed this from Influenster
