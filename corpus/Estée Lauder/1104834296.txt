I received a sample of this to try. The texture of it is very thick, although it does smooth onto the skin very well. I didn’t find it soaked in very well. It almost felt like a moisturizing mask to me. I have dry skin, but as something to use every night it was too much. My skin couldn’t take it. I got blemishes. My under eyes and fine lines looked great, but not worth the trouble. Good for dry and mature skin
