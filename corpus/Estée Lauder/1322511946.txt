I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using this cream for the past two weeks (you only need a small amount!). It’s a really beautiful cream, particularly for dry skin. I found that it just melted into my skin, without any of the heaviness or greasiness that thick creams sometimes have. It has the lightest, loveliest scent, but doesn’t feel like a heavy fragranced cream either, in case that bothers you. It moisturizes my skin so nicely with only a small amount, and lasts all day. Also works great as a night cream! Gorgeous cream, especially for dry skin!
