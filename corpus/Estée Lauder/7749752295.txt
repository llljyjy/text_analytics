If Hydration is what you’re after, thus is it; however, after 3 weeks of continuous use, I didn’t see a change in my fine lines, and it seemed to migrate into my eyes after I worry it overnight, causing some irritation. I probably won’t buy it again based on price and because I’ve used other brands that also work well. nan
