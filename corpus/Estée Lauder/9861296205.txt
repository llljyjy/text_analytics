This has a serum feel but it’s not greasy. I have very dry skin and this sank in beautifully. I haven’t seen any anti aging but it’s a great moisturizer. It’s nice at night before bed and in the morning under makeup. It’s not something I feel like I’d buy but it’s nice all the same. I recieved this free from Influenster for my honest review. Nice
