I love a moisturizer with SPF! I have dry skin, this is a lightweight creme that leaves your skin feeling super hydrated. The creme absorbed well into the skin and didn’t feel greasy afterwards. My skin definitely looked less dull. I didn’t like the fragrance, it’s like a cucumber clay scent, not a fan. I will still use a separate SPF for added protection, but otherwise this is a great daytime moisturizer. Great daytime moisturizer!
