Itâ€™s lightweight and after using it for a couple weeks, I can tell the difference in regards to how moisturized the skin around my eyes is. I have not noticed a difference with my dark circles and I still have fine lines. But the make up around my eyes does lay better since using this product which is a plus. Good for moisturizing.
