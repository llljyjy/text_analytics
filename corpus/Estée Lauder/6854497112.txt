I’ve been testing it twice a day faithfully and can say with confidence that it works really well. Sometimes eye creams get a bad rep for basically being overpriced lotions. And, well, many of them are. I’ve only tested a few that really stood out, and I can honestly say that this is one of the few. It feels soothing to the eye area immediately upon application and, with continued use, produces results - brightens and smoothes the under eye area. It feels incredible on the skin and is a great way to pamper yourself! Great product!
