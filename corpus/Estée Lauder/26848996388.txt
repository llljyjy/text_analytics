I received this product complimentary.It moisturized my dry skin. This glides on smoothly, absorbs nicely, & is not greasy. My skin feels hydrated & looked nourished & plump with use. Unfortunately, the sample I received only lasted for a few days, so I cannot say how my skin would look with continuous use. I love Estee Lauder products. They are always nourishing to my skin. However, I would not purchase this product due to the fragrance. It is very perfumy. And I would prefer a light soft scent. Great Moisturizing Creme
