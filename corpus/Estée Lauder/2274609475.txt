I received this product free as a sample from Influenster. I will say that it was a nice product to receive free but I don’t think I would purchase it myself. Pros: it smelled nice, a small amount went a long way, it didn’t leave any residue, and the water/creme consistency made it easy to spread after the rest of my skin care routine. I feel moisturizers heavier than this will slip on your skin unless you dry your skin completely. I appreciated the SPF component. Cons: I don’t think it was anything special but it was a nice product to try out. I don’t think there was enough of the sample to experience any of the anti-aging component it is advertised for. Basically, I would use it again if it was given to me for free but I wouldn’t go out of my way to purchase it on my own. nan
