(This product was complimentary for testing purposes) this product is a good day time moisturizer with needed SPF coverage. The product seem very light when applied. Depending on what you like- it has a silky feel to it on the skin once applied. For me it’s a bit too light, I don’t feel as though it is absorbed enough, but it did make my skin feel soft. Has a very light cucumber fragrance to it- pleasant, but i am weary of fragrances due to sensitive skin. Was pleasantly surprised however that it didn’t break me out after using. Would recommend for a light non-greasy moisturizer. Good light Moisturizer
