First time trying Estée Lauder skincare products and I’m hooked! I resented a sample of this product, my only regret is that it wasn’t a larger size! This product is lightly scented and it dissipated quickly. It is a thicker moisturizer and it absorbed well on my dry skin. My skin also felt more firm and hydrated after application which lasted throughout the day. I had no pilling after I applied makeup and I think my makeup actually looked better. Price is a little steep but you get what you pay for and I will be buying a full size jar. I’ll post any updates to my review after longer use. Definitely Feel Revitalized!
