Got this as a free sample and I absolutely love the way it FEELS on my skin. The cream doesn’t really have a fragrance to it so that’s also a plus. I’ve been using it for a few weeks now and I’ve noticed that my eyes are less puffy and dark when I wake up. I think this cream looks good under makeup as well. The matte feel worried me at first but luckily it leaves my skin super soft and hydrated Soft eye cream
