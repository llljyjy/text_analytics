While I did enjoy the scent and the feel of this product, I wasn’t sure that it did anything different to my skin. I have been spending a lot of time outside and my skin is very dry, but this did nothing to help moisturize it. I don’t think I would spend the money on a full-size bottle. I received this product free for my honest opinion. nan
