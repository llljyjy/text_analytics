I recieved a free sample from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest opinion. I deal with hormonal acne on a regular basis. I gave this moisturizer 3 stars because it really irritated my face causing me to break out really bad with some deep acne on my chin and forehead. So I don’t think it’s for people with oily or acne prone skin. Its very moisturizing and it was a little too much (oily/heavy) for my skin. That being said if you have dry skin I think you may really like this. It does have a scent to it but it smells really good flowery and clean and I could smell it when I first applied it but the scent soon dissipated and never bothered me. It’s pretty thick so a little goes far with the amount you need to use. It absorbs fairly quickly. I did like the instant glow it gave me and how soft my skin felt and it worked well under my makeup. But by the second use I was breaking out pretty bad. The sample I got was about 5 uses and I didn’t see any dramatic results of looking younger, but I think it takes more than 5 uses to see major results. I personally would not use this product due to my acne issues but I think for anyone with dry skin or older/aging skin this would be a good option. Not for acne prone skin
