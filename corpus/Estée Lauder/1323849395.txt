I received Revitalizing Supreme+ Moisturizer from Influenster and Est√©e Lauder for my honest review. My skin has a mind of its own ad is quite judgmental immediately. I used this product for a full 3 weeks on my changing skin and it was not mad at all! The cream has a rich luxurious feel but did not feel heavy or oily in my face. I loved the light scent that it has as well. The absorption was long lasting and I truly feel like my skin is improving. It is very hard to truly say that with todays products. I will be adding this to my daily routine. Maturing gracefully with help
