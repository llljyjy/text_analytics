I received this product complimentary from Influenster. This review is based solely off my own opinion. First let me start off by saying how cute the packaging is. It’s the traditional brown and gold Estée Lauder container which I love. The product feels amazing under the eyes. It doesn’t necessarily feel like a gel or a cream. It almost feels like smooth butter when applied. I didn’t notice any fragrance which is good as that can sometimes irritate my skin. I have been applying this gel every night before bed but I feel like it’s too soon to see any results. Overall I am very happy with the product because my under eyes feels so hydrated without the sticky feeling. Gel Creme
