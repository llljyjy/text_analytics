Overall this product is amazing. I have sensitive, dry combination skin and it’s hard for me to find products that absorb nicely but moisturize deeply. This product feels like a combination between a cream and a gel, doesn’t feel heavy, and not only moisturizes effectively, but improves the texture of my skin. The only reason I wouldn’t rate this 5 stars is because of the fragrance. It’s kind of strong and seems targeted towards older, female consumers. I received this sample complimentary from Influenster for my honest review. Effective moisturizer, great texture
