I received a sample of this product from Influenster in exchange for a review. Is this moisturizing? Yes, it is. For myself - I would only use it as a night cream because I found it moderately heavy for daytime use. As to it’s other benefits - it’s difficult to speak to those when you receive a sample size and don’t use a product exclusively for months to gauge its impact. The issue I generally have with Estée Lauder is the perfumey nature of their products. The scent isn’t intolerable in this and I will say out of ALL the Estée Lauder products I have tried, I liked this one much better - but would I purchase it? No, I have other products I prefer in terms of efficacy, scent, texture, and more. Moisturizing for sure
