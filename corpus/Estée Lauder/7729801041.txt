Another estee lauder night repair all star! Even tho i was sent this complimentary my reviews are honest and i have been a fan of the estee lauder night repair Serum for many years now. I was super excited to see they released this eye cream. It really is all could ever want in an eye cream. U will see results with continued use. It did take me a couple of weeks to acclimate as it must contain a retinol/retinoid and did make my under eyes a little dry at first. But once acclimated i had a great experience using this eye cream. The consistency is a gel cream texture. Its hydrating and emollient but not greasy and heavy. Highly recommend!
