Estée Lauder’s new Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Cream is love at first use for me in the new year. Immediately nourishing, this has ingredients my skin enjoys, such as Moringa Plant Extract. I could actually see a change within the first week. It leaves behind a soft, satiny, hydrated feel. My skin looks balanced and now my makeup foundation glides across my face. Best of all, I don’t get to mid-day sensing that I need a top up of anything further. I really believe a quality moisturizer should give you the satisfaction of feeling that you are using a product which is simple and effective. I was kindly gifted this product and I’ve used it as my daytime moisturizer every day since…and now I purchased a jar myself because it’s that good! Exceptionally Good
