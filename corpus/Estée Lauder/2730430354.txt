I received a very small sample so I donâ€™t know if I will be able to use it long enough to see results. However, as someone who lives in CO and uses moisturizer in the winter, this was a fairly ideal product for my skin. It went on thick, and took a little bit to absorb, but did not irritate my face or feel as oily as some moisturizers do. I would like to try it for longer, but $89 for a small amount is out of my budget for now. nan
