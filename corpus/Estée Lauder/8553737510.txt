I received this product free from Influenster. I tried it for the first time last night and used it again this morning before applying a full face of makeup. It left my face feeling very hydrated and smooth without making my oily areas more oily. I skipped the primer this morning and only used this and my foundation looks great and I didnâ€™t get oily during the day. I typically use MAC mineralizing moisturizing lotion but would definitely consider switching to this. I will continue to use the product and see how it does after more time but I certainly like it after trying  only once! Great moisturizer - combination skin
