I was very excited to try this product when I received it to try. My eyes are one of my trouble spots. The instructions received said to either use at night, or for better results use AM and PM. So I used twice daily. The cream is thick but spreads nice and absorbs well. I was worried about how it would be under makeup, but it didn’t pill and was great for my dry underwear area. There was more than enough in the sample size to use twice daily. I’ve notice my underlying area is much more hydrated and fine lines seem to be less noticeable. I have an intricate undereye routine, but for the trial I uses only this. I wasn’t blown away by the results but I was pleasantly surprised. If you have oily skin, it may be better to use only at night. Overall, im very pleased with this cream and would definitely purchase. I have even noticed a slight difference in the undereye darkness and bags. I’ve tried many creams and serums for the area, but I believe this has provided the best results of any I’ve tried, whether expensive or drugstore. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this to my friends! I tried to add before and after pics, but for some reason I couldn’t get them to download. Great for fine lines under eyes
