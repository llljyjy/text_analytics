I received this product through influencer. Let me just say this sample was very classy. Great size, great packaging. The people at Estée Lauder know how to treat a lady. The product itself was great. It wasn’t too greasy or heavy. Great for under makeup or just on bare face days. My only minus is, it isn’t full coverage, it’s only 15 SPF.
