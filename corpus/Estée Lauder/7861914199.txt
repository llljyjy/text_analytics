I recieved this product complimentary and at first when I tried this product I wasn’t too sure because I have very sensitive skin and anything with a scent usually irritates my skin but this however did not and I was very happy with that and I could notice results within the first week. My skin looked refreshed and glowy. Would definitely recommend trying out. Although the scent didn’t bother my skin I do wish it was unscented that’s my only thing I have against it. Worth trying
