Overall, I really like this eye cream. I feel that it is hydrating. The eye cream is also great for sensitive skin. Most eye creams burn on me burn this one does not. I have not noticed any anti aging differences. I personally will not purchase because the price tag is not justified. I received this eye cream sample complimentary from Influenster for review purposes. Not bad
