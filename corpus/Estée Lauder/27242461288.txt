I’m always down to try an eye cream, so when I was sent this from one of my favorite brands, Estee Lauder, I had to try - and boy do I like it! I can’t say it completely erases the look of dark circles, but the texture is really creamy and it really moisturizes my skin. Truly feels silky and luxurious on my eyes, the cooling gel formula feels wonderful on puffy or tired eyes, and a little goes a long way. I would definitely recommend! Really solid product!
