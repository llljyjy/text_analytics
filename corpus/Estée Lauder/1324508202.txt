This was very gentle on my eyes. I don’t have much of a dark eye nor as many wrinkles around the area, therefore I haven’t noticed much of a difference. It didn’t break me out and I liked how the gel like consistency applied like a silicone and absorbed really well into my skin. Not much of a scent. You only need a dab to cover both eyes top and bottom. I would recommend this product to friends and family. nan
