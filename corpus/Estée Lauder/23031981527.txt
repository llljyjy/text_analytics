I absolutely loved this moisturizer. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. After using the sample I received from Influencer and Estée Lauder I ran out to pick up the full size. It made my skin feel so hydrated and moisturized. I have combo skin that’s a little more on the dry side and this really helped with any dry spots. It does have a strong fragrance so if you have sensitive skin this may not be the product for you. Love this powerful moisturizer!
