Great for hydration, but nothing else to report! **Complementary sample from Influenster and Estée Lauder** This is great for hydration, and creating soft and smooth skin. Unfortunately after using this for a couple weeks, my fine lines and dark circles are still prominent and have, noticeably, no change. The silky consistency is lovely, but yet, I wouldn’t buy this product at full price. Silky hydration, but no change in dark circles.
