I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I received a sample size which consisted of about four uses of the product. I felt it was not quite a lotion but not quite a toner. It was a little bit thicker than a typical toner. It states it is meant for dry skin and I would say this is true. However I do feel like this product left a film on my face; it didn’t sink in fully. I didn’t like the way this felt or smelled. I truthfully would not recommend or purchase this product. Not a fan
