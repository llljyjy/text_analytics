I received a sample of this from influenster.I have incorporated this into me nightly routine, and so far I like it. I apply it over another moisturizer as more of a sleep mask. It locks in the hydration, and makes my face feel soft and full in the morning. I haven’t used it long enough to see  much of a difference in texture or fine lines. This goes on smoothly, and a little goes a long way. It has a nice scent that isn’t over powering. I will keep this in my nightly routines to see how it effects my skin long term. Wonderful night time cream
