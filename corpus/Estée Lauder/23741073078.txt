I like Estee Lauder products and this is a good cream, thick consistency but also very light on the skin. I only tried sample and couldn’t really get to enjoy a bit more to feel real difference. A bit pricey for me as a day moisturizer, probably would use at night occasionally. I have sensitive skin and this cream is not irritating, has a “signature” scent. Love it and would recommend to a friend. Nourishing, balmy moisturizer, quite pricey
