It was a very hydrating product that left my skin feeling amazing and soft. No oily residue or greasy feel after. It did have a slight fragrance to it that I stopped noticing after using it for a week which was good because I prefer products that are fragrance free or very light smells. I tend to get bad headaches if products have fragrances that are too strong. The sample I got was small but lasted a long time. I recommend this product for people looking for something hydrating! nan
