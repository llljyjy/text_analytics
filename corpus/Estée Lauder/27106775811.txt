I love this cream. It’s thick but absorbs fast. It doesn’t leave my face feeling oily or like there is residue. It has a very light almost blossom fragrance that you can barely smell. Which I like. I have sensitive skin, so finding things that do not irritate my face is huge. My skin soaked this cream up. I will definitely be buying more. Loved it
