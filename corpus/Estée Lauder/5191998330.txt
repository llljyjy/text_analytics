Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme Moisturizer was very creamy and not greasy. It absorbs well into the skin and does not have a strong scent. It is a very nice cream but I can not speak to the long term benefits as I was sent a 1 oz sample to try. It did not break me out or clog my pores which is a big plus for me. Nice cream
