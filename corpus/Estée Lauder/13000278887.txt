I never tried eye cream before. I have dry eyes so anything that gives me soothing effect I would love to try it! I received this from Influenster for free. This is my honest review. The cream is easy to apply, not greasy and gives a cooling effect. Skin around my eyes has wrinkles (very light!) and I see them fade (again, very light) after started using this cream. May be I need to use it continuously to see the full effect. Overall, my review is average. I feel the price is high. Liked it.
