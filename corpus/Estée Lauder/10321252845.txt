I received this product for free for my honest review from Influenster Voxbox. The formula is thick but felt very lightweight on my skin. I would say it was very hydrating, and made my skin very soft. The sample was small, but I really liked it so I splurged and bought a larger size. I have been using it for about 3 weeks and I love it. Highly recommend for smoothing out lines around the eyes and morturizing entire face. Very Moisturizing and soft on skin.
