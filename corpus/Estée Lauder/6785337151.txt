This is a nice eye cream. It’s very hydrating but not greasy. It soaks in quickly and didn’t burn or sting my eyes. I love the gel-cream consistency, it feels really nice when applying it. It even worked well under my full coverage makeup without any piling. Unfortunately I didn’t notice much of a difference with my dark circles which is my main concern when looking for eye creams. But overall still a nice eye cream and I would use it for some extra hydration. Nice Eye Cream
