I received this product for free as a sample from Influencter her and Estee Lauder  In exchange for my honest review. I liked this product a lot. A small amount seemed to go a long way. And my skin felt really healthy after using it. My biggest concern when trying new products is how it affects my makeup. I tend most days to wear a full face to make up and and this one did not seem to make my make up shift or come off early. This is always a huge win for me.I also really like a lot of the natural benefits that are in this product. And will most likely continue to use it and and purchase it when my sample runs out. nan
