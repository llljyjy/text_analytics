I have naturally dark circles for as long as I can remember and honestly this cream did not improve the appearance of them. I didn’t notice any brightening. I do have to admit that the skin around my eyes feels very moisturized and leaves it feeling refreshed. I wouldn’t recommend this product based off what it claims to do. But it is not a bad product overall. nan
