I received this complimentary to test and review from Influenster.  This moisturizer is thick and is very moisturizing, almost silky feeling, BUT it is heavily perfumed.  The scent is like a floral powdery scent and it does not dissipate quickly.  I did not notice any considerable changes in my skin and fine lines. Heavy Scent
