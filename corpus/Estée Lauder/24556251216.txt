This cream was really different for me. It was a “love/hate“ relationship.  I gave this cream 4 stars due to the Thickness and initial heaviness. For me, the cream was initially difficult to spread.  It seemed as if it had to warm up to my skin temp and “melt“ before I could smooth it out, but once it did- it was such a wonderful feel on my skin. I did notice a “Filling in“ of fine lines and a dewy, not greasy finish. The scent is heavenly and it smelled lavish and made me feel special! I have but a couple of smears left in the jar, not enough for an application,  but not throwing it out until I can replace it with a new jar!! Definitely recommend,  just need a little patience,  lol! Hate to Love
