My dry skin really loves this! This was less a lotion, and more a liquid, but my skin loved it. Itâ€™s super hydrating and absorbs quickly. It left my skin feeling smooth and softer to the touch. I think the scent is a bit too strong, but it was pleasant. I definitely see this added to my routine, especially during the winter months. My dry patches are gone when using this treatment. Very Moisturizing
