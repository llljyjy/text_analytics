Love this product. Smooth and silky and feels like it really firms your skin. Nice smell to it. Lightweight and oil free. It’s definitely pricey but I’ve never had a bad experience with Estée Lauder product. It claims to to reveal a bright, hydrated, visibly revived look with comprehensive benefits for the eye area.and I think it does! Great item
