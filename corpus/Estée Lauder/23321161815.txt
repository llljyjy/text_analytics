I received a trial version of this eye cream for free, from Estée Lauder and Influenster, in exchange for my honest review. When first applied,  it is a bit of a heavy cream, however, a little goes a long way and it’s easily bendable. It has a soothing, cooling feeling and leaves my skin feeling smooth. I could smell a faint smell to it, which I did not find bothersome, at all. I sampled both at night and during day hoursand under makeup, and although I was able to use during the day, I did prefer only using it during the night. I normally do suffer from puffy, tired- looking undereyes, with slight aging and wrinkles, which I did not observe a difference with the wrinkles, after use compared to before using, however, it did improve the puffy, redness. I’m sure with continued use, they would show greater benefits and I will continue using, hoping for those benefits to continue and would recommend this product to others! Love the feeling of this!
