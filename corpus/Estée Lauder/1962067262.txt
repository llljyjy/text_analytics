I have tried so many other eye creams, high dollar to budget. I love that this one is so moisturizing. It’s very cooling and feels so smooth and soft on my skin. It’s not sticky or messy. Very easy to apply. I try to keep mine in the coolest part of my bathroom(closet), so that when I use it, I get that extra soothing effects! I do feel like my eyes look brighter, less tired, and that my fine lines are less evident. I super excited to keep using it and see even better results!! If the skin under and around your eyes are tired or dehydrated, I would recommend this! Great for hydration
