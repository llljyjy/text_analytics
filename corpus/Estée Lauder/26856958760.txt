I received a sample of this from influenster and Estee Lauder in exchange for an honest review. I used this eye cream every night until I finished my sample. It lasted about 3 weeks so a little goes a long way! I have very sensitive skin, but I did not experience any irritation. The cream went on very smoothly and felt nice aB light. I donâ€™t expect to see any noticeable changes to my skin after using for such a short period of time, but I definitely think that the appearance of my under eyes has improved. I would recommend this to anyone looking to try a new eye cream! nan
