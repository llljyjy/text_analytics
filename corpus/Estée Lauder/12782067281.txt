I received a small sample of Revitalizing Supreme+ Moisturizer Youth Power Creme complimentary in exchange for my honest review. I loved using this moisturizer! It’s thick and luxurious and felt great on my oily skin. My skin felt so soft and smooth after using this moisturizer. I used this mostly in the AM for a little over a week. It is lightly scented but that didn’t bother me. I can’t speak to the long-term benefits since I only used this for a short time but I would love to continue using this moisturizer! Love it!
