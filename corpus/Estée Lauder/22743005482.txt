I received this sample sizemoisturizer from influencer as a complimentary in exchange for my honest review. I have combination skin that leans on the dryer side. The texture of this moisturizer is thick and creamy. It has a very light subtle scent that I find to be pleasant. This contains cactus stem cell which is rich in antioxidants & vitamin C and gives you a bright radiant complexion. I couldn’t tell the benefits on wrinkles because the amount I had only lasted me for five night skincare routines and thats not enough to notice any change. However, this moisturizer also contains moringa and the collagen boosting benefits of vitamin A made my skin look plumped when I woke up in the morning in addition to looking hydrated thanks to the  benefits of hibiscus which enhances moisture. All in all this moisturizer is amazing and my 50 yr old skin loves it. I already put it in my Sephora wish list to make a future full size  purchase once I get through the products I’m currently using. I love this moisturizer!
