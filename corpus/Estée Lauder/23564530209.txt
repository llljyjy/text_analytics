I got a generous complimentary sample from Influenster, so I was able to use this long enough to form an opinion. it feels great going and and absorbs well. Not heavily fragranced but pleasant. I did notice that as I used it, my skin tended to get more greasy and would feel kinda dirty. This might be better as an under eye for me rather than all over. Not the best for my skin
