I received a sample of this to try for my honest review. This is a very thick luxurious moisturizer. It goes on nice, I feel like it doesn’t spread out as much as I expected which led me to using more than I anticipated every time.  While it seemed to absorb well I could feel it through the day any time I touched my face. I think this moisturizer was a bit heavy for me, around my nose especially. I liked it as a night cream and I imagine it would be great in the winter. I liked that it didn’t have a strong scent, it wasn’t noticeable to me even when I was trying to smell it. I would recommend it to someone who needs a more intense moisturizer. Pleasant and thick
