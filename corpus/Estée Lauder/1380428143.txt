I received this product in exchange for my honest review, and I absolutely loved it! I have the beginnings of aging skin, and I found this product to be hydrating without feeling heavy or oily, and I noticed an almost immediate improvement in the texture and softness of my skin upon using this consistently for about 10 days. I would absolutely recommend it to others and would gladly incorporate it into my daily skincare routine. Luxurious and balancing hydration
