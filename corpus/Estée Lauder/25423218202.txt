I did receive this sample product for free for my honest  my opinion. I did like this eye gel, it’s semi thick in consistency and did actually add moisture to my under eye after using it. I did use for a full week before reviewing and I did notice a slight change in a under eye sun spot I have. It did Slightly fade. I do think with continued use it will fully (as much as possible) go away. I believe if u use this product with the night repair face cream you will see beautiful results. Now do I think it’s worth the price tag , unfortunately no but if u. An get it on sale definitely worth trying this eye cream. Especially if u already use the face serum. Good eye gel
