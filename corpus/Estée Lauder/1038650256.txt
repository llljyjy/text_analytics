This is yet another quality product from Estée Lauder. I’ve used it for a little over a week now, morning and evening after I’ve washed my face and before putting on face cream. It shines my face right up, pulling extra skin and dirt away easily using a few cotton balls. I’m not yet seeing any age-defying effects, but it’s only been a week, but I imagine I’ll see some of those benefits soon too! Great product, reputable brand
