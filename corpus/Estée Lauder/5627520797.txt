It’s okay, works great for smoothing the area but I don’t think it did much for my dark circles. I’m fairly young so I can’t really comment on its effectiveness with wrinkles. Might have to use long term to start seeing some drastic changes. I really like the texture as it’s not heavy and applies smoothly. It's okay
