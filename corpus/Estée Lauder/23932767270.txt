I received a sample in exchange for my honest review and have been using it for more than 2 weeks already. Honestly, this is not enough time to determine if the product actually even does what it claims to do or not. My sample size is almost gone though and based on the price, I probably would not buy it again. Starting off with the texture of the product, it is different compared to the other eye creams I’ve used. The gel is thick and reminds me of snail cream, which is cool and I quite like it. The product applies on easily. There is a slight scent which isn’t overpowering. This product claims to help with dark circles and make them look better in as little as 2 weeks and I cannot accurately determine if it has helped me. I could wake up one day with little to no dark circles but come home from work with dark circles. It does keep the area around my eyes nice and moisturized though, which is nice. The product isn’t greasy on my face and did not cause any complications. To test if the product actually does work would probably take closer to several months of religious use. Hard to tell if it works or not
