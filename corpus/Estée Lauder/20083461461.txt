I’ve enjoyed trying out this product. It is super easy to apply and doesn’t take a ton of product. It just glides right in the skin. I haven’t had any issues with reactions or acne after trying this out, so that’s nice too. I like smell of the product too. It’s a nice fresher scent without being overpowering. The one downside is I didn’t see a real”glow” on my skin. However, I only tested this out for about two weeks. I’d of been interested to try it out longer to see the affects but I ran out of product. Nice product
