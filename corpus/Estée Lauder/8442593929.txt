I love Estée Lauder but I felt this product missed the mark. The scent was a bit overwhelming- a mixture of baby powder and rose. Is did leaving my skin feeling a bit hydrated and supple- but it was hard to get past the smell. I did like the consistency. The size I was given to try had about 8 uses in it so I can’t tell you if it has long term effects. Missed the mark
