This eye cream came at exactly the right time. I was just recovering from covid and my eyes looked tired. After using this day and night for a few weeks, I’m excited to say that my crow’s feet are looking much smoother, the dark circles under my eyes are lighter, and overall my eyes look brighter and younger. This stuff goes on smooth, doesn’t smell, and you can see it smooth out little lines almost immediately.  It does make it difficult to apply eye make up so definitely wait a while before attempting to put makeup on, but overall I definitely recommend this eye cream, especially for tired aging eyes like mine. great eye cream for tired aging eyes
