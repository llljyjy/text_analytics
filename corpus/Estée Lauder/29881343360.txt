I received a sample of this moisturizer and I am blown away. The moisturizer is thick and creamy but blends effortlessly into the skin. The smell is light. It layers under makeup super well but is also great as a night cream. My sample lasted about 10 days of used twice a day. It didnâ€™t cause any breakouts or irritations. My skin felt amazing and I was truly disappointed when it ran out! nan
