I received this product free from Influenster for my honest review. Let me start with the fact that I have very finicky skin-sensitive doesn’t really capture it. I think this is a nice cream, but it wasn’t the best fit for me. When I put it on it had a cooling and almost tightening sensation…maybe from the product or because of my skin’s hypersensitivity. I felt like it firmed my skin, but it also stayed tacky for a bit longer than I prefer. Overall-worth trying for sure. I’m just not sure it’s for me. The scent was very light and didn’t bother me. nan
