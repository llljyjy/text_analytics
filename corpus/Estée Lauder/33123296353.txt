I recieved this product complimentary for testing purposes.  Also, to give my honest opinion.  I enjoyed trying this product.  At first, I noticed my skin having alittle redness and was stinging. But, that went away as the days went on.  When using this product, my skin is soft and have a brightness or glow to it.  I like how it make my face look moisturized.  I will continue to use this in my daily skincare routine because I want to continue to have that radiance look.  I recommend this to others to try. Estee Lauder Micro Essence  Treatment Lotion
