I have tried many an eye cream and I really like the gel formula; it sinks in pretty quickly. I have been using it for the past several weeks and my undereye circles donâ€™t seem as dark as before. My eyes also look more hydrated and less tired which is something I need as a 40 year old mom of two.It is pricey but worth the splurge in my opinion. nan
