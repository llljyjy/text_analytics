I received this free to try and review. It was one of the smallest skin care items I’ve received to test and that made it some what hard to “try“. I got 2-3 uses from the sample bottle they sent. From those time I got to try the product, I felt it was very soft, smoothe, and lovely in texture. It has a wonderful smell too, very clean and healthy feeling. I would have loved to continued to use for a week and see how my skin changed, but nothing really changed at all in 3 days. Nice from what I tried
