The product texture I thought would be more like a lotion but it is liquid like water. Not a deal breaker though. I did not notice instantly brighter completion after the first application I used it for a week straight and I did notice an over all bright if to my completion and hydration to my skin. I would recommend this product it is gentle in the skin and easy to apply. However, I have products in my own current regimen that I do favor more. Not a game changer for me but you have to try it out for yourself! Itâ€™s Ok
