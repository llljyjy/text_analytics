This stuff works wonders for hydration! After applying my toner, I use the micro essence followed by the rest of my serums. I usually have dry skin by the end of the day, but I did notice that the dryness had disappeared when using this. The box says “lotion” but it’s liquid. There is a very subtle and light floral scent that you would really have to be focusing on in order to smell it:) I enjoyed this product! nan
