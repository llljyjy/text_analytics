I received this in exchange for a review in an Influenster box from Influenster and Estee Lauder I’m always thrilled to receive high end skincare products because at 46, I’m always on the hunt for anything to manage my dry sensitive skin. This was very moisturizing which is great for Colorado winters and lasted overnight nicely, so I wasn’t dry and itchy in the morning. The only downside noticed was the fragrance was very strong, so it probably won’t go into my repertoire as a regular product sadly. nan
