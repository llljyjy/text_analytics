I really liked this night eye cream. I like the gel consistency. It feels really hydrating under the eyes. I feel like a little goes a long way. I noticed my under eyes felt soft after applying it, but as to results I would have to keep wearing it for a longer period of time. From the time I used it, I really enjoyed it. I received a complimentary sample of this in exchange for my honest review. nan
