I use a moisturizer because my skin is combination dry/normal. I received this product from influenster for an honest review.   This moisturizer is good for people that have dry dry skin. It leaves your skin soft and moisturized but also makes it feel heavy and greasy. It is not for people with combination skin. Daywear moisturizer
