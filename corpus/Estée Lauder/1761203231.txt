I haven’t used Estée Lauder products in years but I received this from Influenster and was pleasantly surprised with this! I have dry skin and this kept my skin moisturized all day. It’s nice that is contains some SPF in it, too. I love to add some of Drunk Elephant’s bronzi drops and skip foundation. It has a light fragrance that isn’t overpowering and wears off pretty quickly. The ingredients aren’t as “clean” as I typically use, though, and that’s my biggest complaint. Overall though it’s a good daytime moisturizer. nan
