I have been absolutely loving this moisturizer.  I use at night as it is a richer moisturizer and when I wake up my skin feels so soft.  There is a slight fragrance but it doesnâ€™t bother me and dissipates quickly.  This is definitely a moisturizer that I would repurchase.  It works seamlessly with the Advanced Night Repair serum. Great Moisturizer
