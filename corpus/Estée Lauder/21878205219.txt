I love Estee lauder eye products. I’ve used the advanced nighttime eye cream for a while now so I was excited to try the newer version of it. I only recieves a sample size so I didn’t have enough to really see full extra results, but the area around my eyes did seem to feel a little more hydrated and plumper. The only downside is the price. I just wish it was a little more affordable. Even still I will probably be adding it to my routine. Love it!
