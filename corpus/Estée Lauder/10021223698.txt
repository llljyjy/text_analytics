I use this toner in the morning as it feels very refreshing, especially in the summer. I’m not crazy about the scent as it’s very floral, not really my vibe. But eventually it does wear off during the day. I received this product for free from Estee Lauder and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Refreshing, but very floral.
