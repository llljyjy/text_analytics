I was really excited to sample this product in exchange for my honest feedback. Looking at the ingredients, I was slightly nerveous that one of the first ingredients was glycerin but there were some wonderful ingredients like moringa and hyaluronic acid so I was looking forward to seeing the results. I have dry skin that is starting to show signs of age, so the texture really suits me. Due to the sample size I haven’t had enough time with the product to see dramatic results, but my skin feels nice and happy. The scent is a bit old fashioned for my taste, but it doesn’t linger. I would happily continue to try the product to see the long term results. Great for dry skin
