In a word: unimpressed. I felt rather neutral about this eye cream. I pretty much live and die by my eyes creams, and this one was just “ok.“ I didn’t love it, I didn’t hate it. But I certainly was unhappy with the value. I can’t imagine anyone spending what this is priced at to just feel “eh“ about the product. I was also only given a tiny sample, so if this is supposed to work miracles, then maybe a full-size product is what it takes to show that. Pros: nice texture, absorbs quickly, doesn’t irritate eyes, little or no smellCons: no noticeable difference, price $$$*I received this product complimentary Unimpressed
