This review is incentivized but honest.  I got my complimentary jar from Influenters.  Immediately, I smelled the fragrance upon opening the jar.  It does have somewhat of a floral smell to it, which I didn’t care for.  The formula is rich and balmy, glides on easily.  I have combination skin at the moment, and this did a great job at balancing it without feeling heavy or greasy.  It dried down well after about 15, and I was able to preserve my makeup look.  Some moisturizers can really change the way a foundation appears or apply on the face.  This didn’t.  I didn’t notice anything in the 3.5 weeks I spent trying it either that impressed me, other than it moisturized well.  For the higher price point, I would have wanted to feel either firmness or somewhat of a brightening effect to my skin.  I still would recommend it to try, though.  It’s a decent product that worked well with my sensitive acne prone skin. Decent, But Not Impressive
