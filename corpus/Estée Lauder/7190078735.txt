I normally use Olay a trusted brand for several generations of my family but this creme was a nice addition. The scent is light and fresh almost like a cucumber melon scent but very light. It felt thick going on but melts and disappears into your skin in minutes. I did notice a few more clogged pores with daily use but after giving a little break then using it everywhere day worked well. I am very happy with the spf in it. Overall this would not be my canâ€™t live without cause I looking for one with skin tightening and vitamin c for glow but it was a good creme. Absorbing
