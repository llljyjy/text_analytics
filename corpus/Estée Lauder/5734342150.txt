I received this from Influenster for an honest review. I’ve been using this at night for the past month and it’s a nice night cream for the eyes. It makes your eyes feel hydrated, which is great for someone like me who can get dry under eyes. My under eyes seem slightly softer and smoother when I use this, though I haven’t noticed any change in dark circles. I would have to test it longer to see if it had an effect on that. The consistency is very nice, it feels like a thicker gel than most gel eye creams and actually stays on the skin longer than others I’ve tried previously. It’s a bit pricey for the amount of product you get but this is a nice one overall. moisturizing gel
