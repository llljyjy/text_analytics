I will give this night cream an above average rating. It is good, but not excellent. I most liked the texture- it was thick enough to feel good on my skin, but not so thick to feel sticky, and was fully absorbed overnight. My least favorite part was that it burns for a bit- like a vitamin c serum. It felt odd that a night cream would burn, but it went away quick enough, and I never had any sort of reaction to it. It didnâ€™t have a perfume or odor to it. I have only been using this (off and on) for a couple weeks and havent notice a whole lot of difference in the mornings in the way my eyes look- just slight decrease in puffiness and my eyelid skin felt a bit smoother. Could be better
