This eye cream has a great texture. It goes on smooth and feels cool and refreshing, but not at all sticky.I enjoyed testing the product for free from Influenster, but probably wouldn’t buy it myself. I didn’t notice any change to my dark eye circles even after a few weeks of regular use. Great texture
