I received the Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Gel-Creme for free from Estēe Lauder and influenster in exchange for my complete and honest review. First off I am no stranger when it comes to eye creams. So I was super excited to have received this. The texture and application was smooth. I loved the immediate cooling sensation I felt under my eyes when applying the cream. That feeling goes away pretty quickly but it’s really really nice. I didn’t notice immediate results. But I noticed my under eye area was brightened after about a month of continuous use.  One fact I absolutely adore about this cream is that it’s protects against uv rays and blue light (so for those who are on their phones a lot) this cream is the magical solution for tired/over worked eyes.  I would definitely recommend this cream to others as not only does it feel super luxurious. But it honestly feels so good under the eye, and the results speak for themselves. I’ll be purchasing more once I run out! “Eye”’m loving this!
