I received a complimentary sample of Estee Lauder Supreme+Youth Power cream from influenster. It wasn’t oily or feel heavy on my face. It had a nice texture and pleasant smell. It left my skin feeling soft and moisturized. However, I haven’t used it long enough to see any results on my wrinkles or fine lines. I would however recommend this product and will be purchasing the full size Great moisturizer
