I don’t have much experience with this brand so I wasn’t sure what to expect, but now I understand why in a casual conversation there was excitement when I mentioned this product! It is the golden egg of skincare!!! My face looks SO awakened and toned after using which is ALOT for me (I’m a bartender). I can’t look like the lack of sleep I get. I also had a deep forehead wrinkle coming in and it is just about gone! My skin has this even and snatched look, I’m in love! I love this because it doesn’t overwhelm with smell or texture and absorbs so quickly and well that I can apply it under my foundation and a little goes a long way. I definitely will be considering purchasing in the future as I was given this by influenster for my honest review. Prime queen!
