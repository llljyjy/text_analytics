I received a sample from Influenster. I did definitely notice a difference in my skin after using this. My skin texture was improved and so were my fine lines. It does a great job of hydrating your skin. It’s a rich cream that isn’t heavy. It absorbs fairly quickly and isn’t sticky. The scent is fairly light. I’d definitely recommend trying it. Wonderful product!
