I was excited to try this youth moisturizer because I’ve hit that age where my face is starting to age. I heard many good things about this product so i had high hopes. I did receive a sample size one and so far the scent did smell like purfume. But only while applying it after it is on your face you don’t smell it anymore which is great! It didn’t irritate my skin at all and i did need a little more to get a moisturizering feel(dry, combination skin). My skin feels great, and looks good. I don’t see any lifted results yet but my guess is you have to use it longer. I’d love to keep using but at that price i don’t think I can. nan
