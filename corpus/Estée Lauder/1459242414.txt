Despite the small sample size, I feel like this lasted me a good amount of time. It’s a thicker formula so I didn’t need to apply too much product. It does have a gel-like consistency so it’s easy to pat onto your skin. I did notice that it made my under eyes feel/look more moisturized and plumped. I felt like it also helped color correct the area under my eye. I’m just starting to notice fine lines so this did help diminish them a little. I’m not sure how it would work with more profound or seasoned wrinkles. It is scented and it can be strong but it doesn’t last long after application but if you’re extra sensitive to scents I wouldn’t recommend. Nice product
