Thanks to Influenster and Estée Lauder, I received a sample size of this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I loved the texture of this eye cream! It’s a silky, gel formula that sinks in and does a really good job of hydrating my under eye area. I used this before bed for about a month and noticed that when I woke up in the morning my eyes didn’t look as tired as normal. My fine lines also appeared less noticeable over the next few weeks and my under eye area seemed much more hydrated than normal. I didn’t see a lot of improvement in my dark circles but overall the amount of hydration this provided along with minimizing my fine lines was enough to make me want to continue using this. hydrating night eye cream
