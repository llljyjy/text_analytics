I was pleasantly surprise with this face cream. It was thick and creamy but went on nice and smooth and a little goes a long way. I used it on my face and neck for about 2 weeks (had 2 sample sizes) and my skin felt smoother with each application. My only issue is that i wasn’t crazy about the smell, however the smell doesn’t last long nan
