I don’t get the positive reviews. This is the worst eye cream I’ve  ever used, and I’ve tried many. Zero improvements. In fact, during the time in which I used this my fine lines turned into deep, dry,crows feet. I look like an old hag. People used to think I was in my late 20s, I’m 42, now everyone asks if I’m sick, and says I look tired. I received this free from #influenster in exchange for my honest opinion nan
