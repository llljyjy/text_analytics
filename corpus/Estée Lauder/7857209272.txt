This gel-creme feels nice and glides on the skin without tugging. It absorbs quickly enough that I can’t feel it sitting on top of my skin and it doesn’t feel tacky against my pillowcase. It definitely has a smoothing effect on my undereyes. My biggest issue is I wish it wasn’t in a jar because I get product stuck under my fingernails plus jars are less sanitary than a tube or pump nan
