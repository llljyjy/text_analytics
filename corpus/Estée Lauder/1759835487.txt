This new soft clean infusion toner is hydrating and leaves skin with a nice glow. I have sensitive skin with mild rosacea. I did find the fragrance to lightly flare my rosacea. Otherwise, I enjoyed this new step to my skincare routine.  I received a sample for review purposes. All opinions are my own. nan
