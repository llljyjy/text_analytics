I received this sample in exchange for an honest review. A wonderful cream, just an incomparable smell, the skin after the cream is like velvet, very soft and pleasant to the touch. The only thing I didnâ€™t like was that my fingers are greasy from this cream, even after washing.  But I definitely recommend this cream to buy. I like it
