I received a sample size of this product free from influenster for my honest review. When I first saw the sample I was like how can I do a proper review when it’s only a few days worth in there. Well I was wrong. Big things come in tiny packages! I used thus every night for about a week or so(then i ran out) by the 4th day I could see my dark circles fading and my undereyes looked rested and felt so smooth and hydrated. The only reason i gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because of the price point. Its good but expensive.  With that said I’m on my to checkout to buy the full size now! New night time fave
