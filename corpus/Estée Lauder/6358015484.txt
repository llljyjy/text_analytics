It didn’t do anything for me. But it felt nice to put on the eyes. EL claims this gel targets dark circles, brighten and reduce the visible intensity of dark circles. They also claim that this gel targets eye lines and the look of initial signs of aging. I often look tired , and would say I have mild dark circles. I don’t have eye lines. After 2 weeks of ever night use, I didn’t see the results and improvement that is advertised. I do like that this eye gel is free of synthetic fragrance, parabens, phthalates, sulfites, sulfate, drying alcohol, mineral oil, paraffin. It has a cooling effect and feels nice upon application. Ehh. It’s alright
