I received the Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Cream from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my review. I used this face cream every night for two weeks in the place of my normal face cream for my nighttime skin routine. This face cream does a great job of living up to the respected Estée Lauder name! When using this cream I felt a slight tightening of the skin which helps with my fine lines and wrinkles. The cream leaves my skin looking radiant and more youthful. It is a nice thick, rich consistency that goes on smooth and leaves skin glowing after it is massaged in. I have combination skin and this cream did not trigger any breakouts or irritation. I was super happy with the results and recommend this cream! Fabulous Face Cream
