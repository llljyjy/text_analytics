This product was very rich and moisturizing. I have oily skin so this was not a good match as a morning cream. If I used it at night it felt nice and in the morning my face looked more plump and glowing but only until I washed my face. It does feel nice and didn’t give me any breakout but this just isn’t a good match for my skin tipe. Rich, but not for oily skin
