I received this product from Influenster and Estee Lauder in exchange for my fair and honest review. Unfortunately, while I love the light, silky texture of this cream, it irritated my skin after several days of use and I had to discontinue it. Thatâ€™s the risk you run with actives. It would probably be great for someone with less sensitive skin. Silky texture, too strong of actives for me
