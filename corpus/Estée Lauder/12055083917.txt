This is a great moisturizer for sure. It absorbs into the skin fast although it has a fairly thick consistency. It does feel pretty luxurious. It is unscented in my opinion, or maybe Iâ€™m just used to much stronger fragrances in beauty products. Meanwhile, I have seen no finelines improvement. I received this as a small jar (10mL) sample in exchange of my honest review so maybe one just needs to use it for much longer to see a visible effect on the fine lines. But it is a nice product and it is hydrating. Great but not exceptional
