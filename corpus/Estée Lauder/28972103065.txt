I received this product complimentary to test and review. I found it to be extremely moisturizing. It went on smooth, spread easily and seemed to absorb into my skin without leaving any sort of film on my skin. At one point, I had gotten Sun burnt and this left my face feeling very soothed and moisturized & I think it helped it from peeling. The only real negative comment I have is that the initial smell can be overwhelming- it does leave quickly though. I would purchase this in the future for my daily skin care regimen. Wonderfully Moisturizer!
