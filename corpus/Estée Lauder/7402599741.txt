This cream is quite light, it absorbs very well into the skin, I have been using it for two weeks and it has kept my skin very hydrated and soft, I have not seen a major change in my wrinkles, but it is too early. The scent is quite soft and pleasant and can be used under makeup for its light consistency. nan
