This cream feels so light on my skin! Usually when I do a daily treatment, the creams either don’t penetrate down into the skin like they should, or it does but leaves my skin feeling “greasy“; a feeling like I put too much on but I’ve barely used any.It also has a nice light, fresh scent. Nothing with a fragrance added, which I absolutely love!I’m leaving off a star only because I haven’t used it long enough to see visible results, but it’s hitting every mark so far! May Be A New Part of My Daily Routine!
