I was gifted a small sample size from influenster and estee lauder. While the sample wasn’t large enough for me to comment on long term results, it was a very nice product! I was able to use it for about two weeks and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I have quite dry skin and early signs of aging, this cream felt beautiful on my skin. Very thick and moisturizing, with a gentle scent. The one and only downside of this product is the price, which kind of prevents many from using it, but it’s normal for this kind of brand! Lovely cream
