First off I only got a tiny sample of this product to review it which is very difficult to get any true results or experience what this product claims to achieve. With that being said I will share what I DID like about it, to be frank there was nothing I DIDN’T like.I love this texture of this moisturizer. It’s lush and thick and when I put it on both in the evening and before I put on my makeup in the morning it feels really good.I don’t like when moisturizers immediately rub in and disappear I feel like they aren’t doing anything where I can feel this on my skin. The smell is lovely as well, it reminds me of my mom in a way that Estée Lauder has been around forever and there’s a reason and it’s a tried and true brand, I like that I’ve smelled this scent throughout my life. It’s very nostalgic.I think if I were given a larger size I could attest to its anti aging properties but alas it’s too difficult to know any real results after only using a week.I will say it sits well under my makeup and I do feel very moisturized after I use it so in that sense it’s a win.For the price though, not sure which is the reason I deduct a star. Thick & Lush
