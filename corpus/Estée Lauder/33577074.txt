I received a complimentary sample in exchange for my honest review. My skin is combination but leans towards dry except for the T-Zone. Moisturizer is part of my facial routine. The Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme has a thicker consistency, which I really enjoy. It absorbs well and leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated. The scent is minimal and doesn’t leave me feeling sticky. This product is just what I’ve been looking for. Other moisturizers have felt too heavy or left me too dry. This product is excellent for skin that tends to be dry. The price point is just a little high for my taste. Just What I was Looking For!
