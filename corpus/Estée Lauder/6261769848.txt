I received this sample size product for free from Influenster and Estee Lauder in exchange for my honest review. Unfortunately, I had a reaction after the initial use and suffered from a horrible breakout!  I can say that the creme had a nice velvety feel and slip, with a subtle floral/spa like scent. I would recommend this product simply because EL has some amazing products, but Iâ€™d advise doing a patch test before slathering over your entire face. nan
