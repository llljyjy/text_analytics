I received “ Advanced Night Repair Eye Cream“ as a free sample from Influenster and  Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review.I like this eye cream, it has a fresh water consistency (I love skincare with this consistency), gets absorbed easily, is not greasy, lightweight, very hydrating, and doesn’t irritate my skin. I got a sample and I think it’s not enough product to see big and real results. IT doesn’t instantly reduce the look of puffy eyes in my case, but I notice a bright, hydrated and visibly revived look. It’s an eye cream I could definitely buy. Good Product
