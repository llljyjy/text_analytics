I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.  I am a huge fan of Estée Lauder products and use them regularly.  The Revitalizing Supreme Youth Power Crème did help tighten up my under eye area.  I received a small sample so I wasn’t able to try the product for a long time.  The one thing I didn’t like about the product was that it didn’t seem to absorb into my skin.  That’s very unusual for Estée Lauder products that I’ve used over the years.  When I would use this at night, I felt I had to let it dry for a long time before I could use my pillow.  I would like to see if there are long term benefits to this moisturizer, however.  I didn’t really notice any other benefits immediately other than the tightening on my face.  Maybe it needs more time. nan
