The Advanced Night Repair Eye Gel-Cream worked well for my eye area. I really like the texture and how it applied. The gel-cream absorbs quickly and didn’t cause any problems, I sometimes experience Mila with eye moisturizers and this one didn’t cause any problems. Skin around eyes looks firmer and well hydrated. More youthful eyes!
