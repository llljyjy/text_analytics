I was so excited to try this product but unfortunately I wasn’t impressed. It feels great applied and a little goes a long way. You can feel how hydrating it is. It’s not too thick or heavy and it absorbs quickly. The gel consistency is nice. However, I don’t think this did anything for the eye area other than keep it hydrated. I don’t see any benefits. That being said, I have very dry skin around my eyes so it being hydrating is good enough for me for what I’m looking for. Unfortunately, after about two weeks, this product started irritating the skin on my eyelids causing them to be red and itchy. I experience this with a lot of eye creams and am not sure what causes it. My eyelids are very sensitive so I wouldn’t worry about this unless you also have sensitive eyes. If you have sensitive skin around your eyes, watch out for irritation and test it in a small area before using all over. Overall it’s an average eye cream, but nothing impressive. If you’re looking for hydration and nothing more, this is a decent option. Average Hydrating Eye Cream
