This goes on nicely, and it absorbs well while leaving my skin feeling smooth, not greasy..a little goes a long way too.I felt like this brightened my complexion and helped lighten my post acne marks and dark spots, it also didnâ€™t break me out which is a huge plus. Good product quality without side effects
