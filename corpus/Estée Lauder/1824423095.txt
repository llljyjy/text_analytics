I received a sample of this for my honest review. I have been trying eye creams for about 5 years now, ever since what I call “mommy lines“ started to form after my first child. This product has a creamy texture which I would say is medium weight. I have tried applying it immediately after washing my face and also after my face has dried for a few minutes. I prefer applying when my face is still fresh right after washing when my skin is still “dewy“. It sinks it better and leaves my face smoother. If I wait until my skin is completely dry, it tends to feel a bit sticky well after applying. As far as smoothing out fine lines, I did not notice a difference after 3 weeks of consecutive application but I did see a difference in brightness around my eyes. For that reason I would recommend this cream. If you are solely looking for wrinkle reduction I would not recommend. I have pretty sensitive skin and this did not cause irritation or a breakout at all and found the texture pretty pleasant. It was ok
