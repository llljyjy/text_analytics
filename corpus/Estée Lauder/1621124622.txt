I received this product from influenster in exchange for my honest review. It actually came at a great time because my old eye cream was running low & just not doing what I needed it to. I’ve been suffering from some horrible allergies and my skin and puffy under eyes have felt it. This really helps soothe my poor skin. It’s a great consistency & really soaks in over night. I don’t use it during the day, but a little went a long way for me at night and seemed to help with my puffiness. I actually may make this a staple in my routine. I like it!
