I received this in a very small sample. However after using it I did start to like it as part of my routine. It is very hydrating and feels like a lotion but is liquid. This lasted longer than I anticipated which is great. I feel like even buying the bigger size can last a long while which is great! It felt hydrating on the face and wasnâ€™t sticky which is my favorite part. Good!
