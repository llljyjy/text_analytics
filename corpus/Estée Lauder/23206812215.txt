I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I really do like this moisturizer I think itâ€™s a very good consistency not too thick but not to thin. It provides a lot of moisture for my skin which is really nice during the dry winter months. However the price tag that come along with this product is quite expensive and I have moisturizers that do the same things for less money. Good but expensive
