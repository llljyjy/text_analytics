I received this for free to try through Influenster. I really wanted to love this because I generally like Estée Lauder skincare products, but this didn’t work for me. Initially it felt amazing on my skin which has been drying out during the winter, there was notable hydration and even some plumpness in areas where I’ve seen some fine lines forming. Unfortunately, my skin didn’t love this moisturizer because after using it for a couple days I started breaking out, particularly in areas where I’m usually oily. I’m not sure what’s in it that caused this reaction on my skin, but it sucks that it didn’t work for my skin. Hopefully it does work for others without causing breakouts. I wanted to love it
