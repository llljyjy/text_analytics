Omg y’all, this stuff is so good! I was super lucky to receive this through Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Estee Lauders’ Micro Essence treatment lotion with bio-ferment is pretty impressive with its double barrier power and fast penetrating ingredients. This essence contains postbiotic and 98.9 percent bio-active lactobacillus ferment to optimize the skins barrier (even after just one use) and lock in moisture. Well hydrated skin smoothes out those pores and wrinkles, you know! Bio essence feels wonderful, its not oily, I have no extra breakouts, it’s not sticky, my redness is nearly gone, and it’s easy to layer with other products and makeup! A little goes a long way, so you can use less product and spend less money. My wrinkles are less noticeable and my acne scaring has gone down quite a bit. My skin looks youthful and radiant compared to a few weeks ago, and I started noticing the difference instantly. I am a firm believer in this product and would recommend it to everyone! Better believe the hype!
