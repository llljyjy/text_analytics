This moisturizer is amazing! I am definitely starting to see a difference in just a couple of weeks, my skin feels plump and fine lines seem a little less visible. My skin is more on the combination to oily side so I use it as part of my night regimen due to its richness. Absolutely worth a try regardless of cost! A must-try moisturizer!
