First off I received this product complimentary from influenster to test out and give my honest review. I have used many estee lauder skincare produts and haven’t had any issues and would see amazing results. Well with this it didnt work for me  I started developing dry spots on around my eyes which weren’t there before. I used it for two weeks and discontinued use cause the dry spots kept getting worse. It might just be something that just doesn’t work for my skin. Not for me
