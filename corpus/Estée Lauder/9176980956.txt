I wasn’t sure what to expect from this eye cream, since my biggest concern is with my under eyes always looking puffy, even when i get a good amount of sleep! As with any skin care it takes a while to see any lasting changes, but after using it for a few weeks I’d say I see a small difference in how my eyes look! They feel really smooth, and that crease that forms from them being puffy seems to be less pronounced! I don’t have much in the way of wrinkles, but hopefully this product keeps working to prevent them! I noticed there wasn’t really a strong smell to the cream, and it has a smooth, gel like texture. A little goes a long way since it could spread out thinly and evenly across the skin where you apply it. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review! Seems to be working pretty well!
