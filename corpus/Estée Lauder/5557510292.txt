This moisturizer is very rich and creamy, but it does absorb into my skin pretty well. I have combination skin, and I found this was a little too heavy for daily wear. However, it’s a good option to use overnight or on dry days where I need extra moisturizing because it is very moisturizing! I also noticed that it has a fairly strong fragrance to it. It’s pleasant and feels like a slightly more mature fragrance. While I do like fragrant skincare, I would have preferred it to be a bit more subtle. Note: I received a small sample of this in exchange for my honest review, so I was unable to see much in the way of long-term benefits. nan
