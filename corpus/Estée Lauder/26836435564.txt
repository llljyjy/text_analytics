I have a love/hate relationship with this moisturizer. On one hand, I think that the hydration it offers is really nice. On the other, it sits too heavy and greasy on top of my skin. I’ve used it in combination with the Estee lauder serum and I do think it makes my skin look nicer, but I honestly can’t stand to have it sitting on top of my skin. For reference, I have combination skin that sometimes leans more towards oily. I wouldn’t recommend it to skin like mine, but someone with dry skin may have better results. nan
