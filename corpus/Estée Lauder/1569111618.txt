I was sent this product complimentary for review purposes from Influenster and I really enjoyed it! The texture is very thick and almost velvety so I really enjoyed it as a a night time under eye moisturizer. The only thing that keeps me from giving this 5 stars is the price. I have used a lot of under eye moisturizes that perform great for a fraction of the cost. But nonetheless, I loved this and will continue to use it until Iâ€™m out. Super hydrating for night time
