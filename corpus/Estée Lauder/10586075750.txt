I received a free sample from Influenster to try and review. I have been using it for about 2 weeks and am very happy with it. It has a nice subtle scent and goes on smoothly. It feels good on my skin and provides great moisture. I love that it has SPF to help protect my fair skin. I feel like I have already noticed results, my skin  is definitely more moisturized and has a healthy glow. I would recommend it and will continue to use it. Loving it so far!
