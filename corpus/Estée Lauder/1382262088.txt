After using this product for the last few weeks I have come to the conclusion that it is just an okay moisturizer.  It is a quick absorbing lightweight crème that leaves the skin with a slight radiance.  I personally do not love the fragrance it irritates my eyes but fragrances do if they are in my skincare.  I haven’t noticed many changes to my fine lines.  I received this product in exchange for my honest review. Too strong of a fragrance
