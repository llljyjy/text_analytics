I received this item from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I’ve also tried this product before so I’m basing my experience on that as well.This is a lightly fragranced moisturizer that’s made up with fruit/vegetable/flower oils and other ingredients that are well known to have skincare benefits such as squalene,caffeine,whey protein,algae extract,st Paul’s wort,and more. It works well as both a daytime and nighttime moisturizer and absorbs fairly quickly into your skin leaving it soft and supple with no tackiness or stickiness left behind. It hydrates skin well and doesn’t leave it oily so it works well both under makeup or in your evening skincare routine. I noticed my fine lines and wrinkles decreased after about 2 weeks of using this moisturizer. During the first few weeks of use I noticed my usually dry skin was much more hydrated and it was softer and smoother to the touch. I’m over 50 but that doesn’t mean I have to look it so I depend on skincare products that produce results. I’m happy to report this is one of those products. My skin not only felt more hydrated it also was smoother in appearance and had a bit more glow to it too. If you are looking for a product that works well and shows results you definitely should give this one a try. I’m on my 3rd jar and have used this brand on and off for over 25 years. It’s a brand who’s products I know I can trust and count on! Next time I’m definitely getting the largest size of this because it works great for both daytime and night and for all kinds of weather seasons too. I’m giving this a solid 5 star rating!
