I received Estee Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme for free from @influenster and @esteelauder in exchange for my honest reviewI’ve used Estée Lauder products before and I extremely love their skin (especially night) care products. This crème is my new love. I used it as it was suggested in the morning and in the evening daily until it ended (I’ve received a sample size product) and I noticed changes. My skin feels hydrated. It looks silky and moisturized. The crème has a good texture and good absorbing quality. Highly recommend. Good hydrating crème
