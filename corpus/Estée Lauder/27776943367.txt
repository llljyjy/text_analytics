I received a free trial size version of this product. This product has a strong scent and I am sensitive to scents and quickly had a reaction to the smell when I put the product on my face. I did use this product on my neck and décolleté, the product helped keep my skin moisturized but due to this being a small trial size, I don’t think I am able to give it the best review since it takes skin around 30 days to start to show improvement (if there is an improvement). nan
