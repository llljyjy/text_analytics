I received this product free to try from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest feedback. I was excited to have the chance to try this product, but unfortunately, it didn’t work for me. The smell was a little too strong, and it clogged my pores. It wasn’t a good match for my sensitive skin. It might work well for someone else, but it just didn’t work for me. Didn’t work for me
