I received a complimentary sample of Estee Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion with Bio-Ferment in exchange for my honest review. I am a huge fan of Estée Lauder products and this was not a disappointment. I like that it doesn’t feel greasy after applying on my face. After several usages I can feel that my face hydrated and doesn’t feel dry. I will definitely add this into my daily skin care night routine. Yes, yes and yes!
