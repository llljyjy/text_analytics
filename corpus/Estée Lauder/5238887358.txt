This is an amazing, super thin, lightweight gel formula. It leaves the under eye/application area a little sticky, but itâ€™s not too bothersome, and it goes away after a moisturizer or other products are applied on top of it! The eye cream seemed to smooth out my eye area and keep it hydrated and even minimized some fine lines! nan
