I’m really satisfied with the level of hydration I got from this, and I love how it absorbs well enough to apply makeup pretty soon after applying.  I don’t have a lot of time in the mornings and hate waiting on a moisturizer to settle in. I did receive this for free in exchange for my honest review. Love it!
