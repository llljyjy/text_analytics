I have combo skin and I use moisturizer regularly. I mainly used this on my neck and chest as these are places I tend to forget in my regular moist user routine. I liked the smell - very clean and fresh but not overpowering. I noticed my skin was softer and it did feel more hydrated. While I liked this product, it was difficult to see results with the amount of product I had to sample but I would consider buying due to my skin feeling more moisturized! I was incentivized to leave my honest review by receiving a free sample of this product. Good moisturizer
