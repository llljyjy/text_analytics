I got this from influenster to try and I wasn’t wowed by it. It did leave my skin feeling hydrated but I didn’t see any noticable changes of fine line or any pumping effects from it. The moisturizing affect didn’t seem to last vey long either, maybe about 2 hours at the most. It did absorb quickly into my skin. Hydrating moisturizer
