I’m not going to lie, I received the sample size of this and it allowed me to use the product about 3 times. So I don’t feel like I can give a 100% review. But more like 95%. From what I can tell when I used it, my skin felt very hydrated and refreshed. It was thick and creamy but not to the point where you felt like you had crap all over your face! It’s creamy!
