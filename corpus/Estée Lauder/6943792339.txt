Absolutely love this product. I’ve used many different crimes and serums. I love how light this feels after using it, no greasy or stickiness to it after using it. I really really love the smell. I’m particular about such things and don’t mind chemical smell but noticed I will use a product that had a fresh clean smell more so. I love how after I use it my skin feels hydrated and has a subtle glow to it. I can tell it has helped my skin look and feel refreshed after using it vs others that say that but their products don’t live up to what they say. I do have combination type skin too and noticed the weather can play havic on it as well. A must have in my beauty routine
