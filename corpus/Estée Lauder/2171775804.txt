I have used various skin care moisturizing products from Estee Lauder over the years, and this is a new one which I like a lot. It goes on smoothly, and makes my skin feel nice and soft without a greasy feel to it. The cream absorbs well, and I donâ€™t feel like I need to reapply it. A winner! Smooth as silk
