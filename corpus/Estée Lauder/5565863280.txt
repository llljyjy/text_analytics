I received a sample of this product. For such a small sample, it did last a few weeks because this moisturizer is so rich you do not need a lot of product per use. I only used it as night and it did not break me out. During the day I need a moisturizer with SPF and to use both would be too heavy for my skin. The price is high, but it is a good product and would recommend it. nan
