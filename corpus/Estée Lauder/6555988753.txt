I received this product from Estee Lauder and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using the product daily for about two months. It works very well. I haven’t experienced any irritation or milia, which is something I have gotten from other products. And I still have some left in the container, so I would say it lasts a long time, because I received a sample size. I have oily, acne-prone skin, and I’ve had no issues. Pretty good
