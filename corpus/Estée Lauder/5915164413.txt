I received a tiny little bottle of this toner to test, so it’s hard to give a full review just because I couldn’t test it for long. From what I did notice, it did add hydration and made my skin feel nice. The scent is very strong so if that bothers you this is not something I’d try. Overall, I didn’t notice anything extraordinary in the short time I tested this but I didn’t hate it. nan
