I really liked the cooling effect of this gel, esp after a long day. It has a great texture and spread easily. It was a little thicker so had to be worked in, but it felt good. I received this complimentary in a deluxe sample size so it is hard for me to say the total effects when talking about wrinkles, but I think it would definitely be something I would consider purchasing!
