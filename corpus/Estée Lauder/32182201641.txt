I received this product as a free sample. I’m 38 and have been moisturizing and using anti aging products since I was about 30. It’s essential to take care of your skin if you are trying to prevent fine lines and wrinkles and keep your skin firm and glowing. Using a trusted brand and having a good skin care regimen is important as we start getting up in years especially. I felt like I’d be young forever lol but now I invest money in myself by buying quality anti aging products. Fortunately I tried Estée Lauder’s Revitalizing Supreme + Global Anti-Aging Cell Power Creme for free and it’s extremely moisturizing. It feels really good on my face and gives me a youthful glow. Moisturizing daily is the easiest way to reduce fine lines and wrinkles. This creme smells fresh too! I definitely recommend it! Thanks Amazing Creme I could pass for 10 years younger!
