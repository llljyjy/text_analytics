This eye cream feels a bit silicony on the skin so it works with skin texture very good. I feel that it is very moisturizing (I have normal skin type). I have been using this cream for a couple of weeks and noticed moisturizing effect only when cream was on the skin, when it disappears I don’t feel any effect of this product. For me it is just basic moisturizing eye night cream. Nothing special. So don’t wait from this product any skin improvement. Does nothing with my dark circles nan
