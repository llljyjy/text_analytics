This stuff is a miracle in a jar. I was using a different brand eye cream and received this as part of a promotion and in exchange for my honest review. Well, Iâ€™m never going back. The texture of this product is so smooth and glides on. Absorbs quickly so leaves a good base for make up if you use in the morning. No smell, which is nice. I have noticed a big difference in the skin around my eyes which tells me how much better it works. A little goes a long way so this product will last a long time. Love
