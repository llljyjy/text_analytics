*I received this product complimentary for review purposes.* I’ve been using this eye cream for over 4 weeks, day and night, and have not noticed any improvement with dark circles or fine lines. There was maybe a little brightening of the area. Included is a before and after image, although the lighting isn’t good in the before picture. The texture is silky and unique to any other eye cream I have tried. It does need some time to sink in before makeup application, but I did not experience any reaction or sensitivity. I wish it worked! No Noticeable Difference
