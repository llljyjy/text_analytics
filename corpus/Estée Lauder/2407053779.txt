Highly rated for a reason, I received this to review for free as part of a campaign. I was given a sample size to test for my honest review. The creme is light and great for those that easily clogged pores. This duration of time isn’t enough where I can test if I can truly brighten my dark eye circles. I love how the scent doesn’t linger afterwards after application. nan
