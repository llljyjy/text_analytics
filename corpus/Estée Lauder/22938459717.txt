I loved how elegant the packaging looked and felt. The creme is the right consistency not to thick or thin. It does soften my skin and leaves it feel a little plumper. I only had a small sample so didnt get to use it for very long. Iâ€™m not sure I would pay the expensive price for this product. Nice creme and lovely packaging.
