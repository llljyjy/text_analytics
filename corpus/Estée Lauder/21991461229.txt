I received a complimentary deluxe sample of this product from Influenster. The sample last me a few weeks. All it takes is a couple drops. It’s very lightweight and absorbs quickly. There is a very faint “vinegar“ scent but it’s hardly noticeable and doesn’t linger. I really didn’t notice much in the way of results. My skin was a little more hydrated and a touch softer. For the price point I was expecting more. If I could have used it longer I may have seen more results. If you have the money then go ahead and give it a try. nan
