I love this thick, non-greasy gel formula. You only need a touch each night so it ends up lasting a while. When I woke up, I felt like I looked fresher and more relaxed. Iâ€™ll continuing using it in hopes that it can work its magic on fine lines. In my experience, Estee Lauder products feel luxurious and are easy to use, this is no exception and a night part of an evening routine. nan
