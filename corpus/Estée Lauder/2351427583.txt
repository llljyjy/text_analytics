I received this to test and I ended up really liking it! Works just like a toner. My skin feels so soft after using it. My skin feels hydrated and stronger after using for a little over two weeks. No notable scent. Soaks into the skin without any residue. The only thing I donâ€™t like is the price. I recommend this product. Gave me softer skin
