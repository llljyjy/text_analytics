I received a sample of this from Influenster to review. While I normally love thicker moisturizers as they are great for hydrating my dry skin, I am on the fence with this one. It’s thick, but doesn’t feel greasy on the skin. Using it as a night moisturizer, my skin felt soft and hydrated when I woke up. But, I can’t get over the strong fragrance. Fragrance typically doesn’t bother me, but this products scent was way too strong. What’s worse is it reminded me of a perfume my grandmother would wear. A pity, because the formula is pretty good! Overwhelming Fragrance
