I was obsessed with this eye cream for the texture alone. It has a a smooth, thick consistency that felt so pleasant to spread but wasnâ€™t greasy or too heavy. It was a joy to use this each night! It did also help with the texture around my eyes, something I very much appreciate. I only wish I had a bigger jar! nan
