I received this moisturizer in my Influenster voxbox and I absolutely love it!!! I’m not just saying that either, I am very particular about what I put on my face. This product goes very well under my makeup. It doesn’t seem through or make me too oily which is what I love. I have combination/oily skin and it still works for me. I would definitely recommend trying this product out. I have even worn it as just a daily moisturizer without makeup, but I like it for under my makeup. Will be purchasing one soon, once this one runs out. Great Moisturizer
