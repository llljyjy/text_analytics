This is a rich moisturizer, however, it has a strong fragrance that takes a long time to dissipate. If you’re sensitive to fragrance, this is not a good choice for you. I have mature, drying combo skin. This moisturizer left my skin soft and well moisturized. It felt nice to apply and absorbed well. I’d recommend it to those not sensitive to fragrance. Rich but fragrant moisturizer
