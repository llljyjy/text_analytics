I really like this moisturizer.  My skin showed improvement overnight on the first night which is always something I want to see in a night cream although this is for day and nighttime use.  I only received a small sample so I used it at night. It’s a bit heavy but for fall and winter I like a heavier cream even for day time use because I have dry skin.  It has a very light fragrance that’s a bit flowery I’d say, but pleasant and not at all overpowering.  The container is typical although more attractive than others.  I can’t think of any cons.Overnight my skin was softer, clearer and brighter.  I only had enough in the sample to try it for about ten nights - it doesn’t go as far as other lighter creams, so I can’t speak to how it would be on wrinkles but I imagine with longer use you could see good results.  I had no irritation - even around my eyes.  I would recommend this to others with dry and uneven skin or someone who wants brighter younger looking skin. Overnight  results
