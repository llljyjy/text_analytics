I did receive this as a sample to test for my honest review - and as usual I wanted to use it all to really try it out and see the results if any After two weeks I was really surprised I hadn’t used it all - a tiny bit goes a long way with this.  No heavy scent and the gel crème is a fantastic texture that goes on smoothly before soaking in. It also very obviously works - I have worn contacts for most of my life and the skin under my eyes has been pulled down a lot.  But this gave definite improvement to firmness under my eyes. Will be added to my rotation 100% Fantastic Texture
