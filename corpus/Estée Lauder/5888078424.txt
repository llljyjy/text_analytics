I consistently use eye cream and found the texture to be like a gel that turns into an almost powdery feeling cream when you spread it. I noticed the hydration it gave my eye area right away and could definitely see this product softening any fine lines with more time. I would have to use the product for longer to see if it holds up to its other anti-aging claims, but I would recommend it for being a non-greasy, hydrating under eye cream filled with great ingredients! Good experience overall
