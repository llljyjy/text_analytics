I received this item in exchange for an honest review. And honest review you shall receive!I was excited when I saw this at my doorstep, I have heard great things about this moisturizer and was dying to try it out. I have an issue with facial/eye creams causing milia beneath my eyes, so I was skeptical about trying this product out to begin with. I was concerned it would be heavy for my skin. The morning after the first night, I was pleasantly surprised to see my eye area was moisturized without feeling greasy or weighed down. I have also been dealing with under eye wrinkles, and I felt this helped “fill” those in with the healthy dose of moisture it was giving me. After a week of use, I had friends complimenting how awake I looked—the only thing I had changed was adding this into my routine!Is it magic in a bottle? No, but it definitely goes quite a long way as far as moisturizers go!I am crazy about this stuff and after my first week, ran out to purchase a full size. My search for an eye cream has pleasantly come to an end! (I have combo/dryer skin) Moisturizing & great for under eye wrinkles!
