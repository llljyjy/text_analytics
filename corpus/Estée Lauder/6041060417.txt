I tried this product for about 7 days at night time. It was a good product. I canâ€™t say that I saw any difference in my face probably more glimmery but not something to say oh my face feels different. Definitely smooth cream and very hydrating . Worth to try definitely but honestly I was expecting something specific. Recommend it and worth to try maybe is not made for my skin type Estee
