I received this product complimentary for my honest review. To me, this was just okay. It was hydrating and smelled really nice, but considering how much it is I just wouldn’t be able to justify it for how it worked. I have drugstore products that work just as well for a fraction of the price. I thoroughly enjoyed using the sample and again, loved the smell of it! If I’m ever feeling like really treating myself to a skincare splurge, I would absolutely consider this. nan
