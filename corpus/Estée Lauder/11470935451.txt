I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. I really enjoyed this product. I have dry to normal skin and it’s a nice thick cream, but soaks in the skin really well. It’s not greasy and wears well under makeup. I would recommend this product to someone with similar skin type. Nice moisturizer for dry skin
