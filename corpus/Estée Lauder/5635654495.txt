I received this product to try complimentary and I really liked it. At first I thought it would be a very thick cream, but as I applied it, it was so smooth and lightweight. My skin wasn’t irritated by any ingredients, however, if you’re sensitive to smell it might be strong. I enjoyed the scent, and didn’t notice perfume added which is a bonus. Great texture
