I received a sample size of this product for my honest review. First, there is a scent to this cream. It is not noticeable after it soaks in. The cream has a nice consistency, almost thick. It absorbs very quickly without any heavy oily feeling. I like it most around my eye area. I canâ€™t say how this performs in the long run from this small sample but it does feel nice on my face. Good for eye area lines
