I received this in a sample size from influenster in exchange for my honest review.Heavily fragranced, in true Estee Lauder style, but it didnâ€™t irritate my sensitive skin so that was nice. It was very moisturizing and lovely feeling on my skin but that was really the only noticeable difference after finishing the .17 oz jar. Probably would not purchase Moisturizing but.. that's about all.
