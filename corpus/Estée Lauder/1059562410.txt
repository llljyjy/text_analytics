I received a sample of this product in exchange for my honest review. Though the sample was small, it accommodated four generous uses of the product. I used this product in place of my toner in my morning routine. This product is exceptionally moisturizing, moreso than other similar prestige hydrating toners. This brought my skin to a balanced condition, soft and supple. I love this lotion and will keep a bottle in my product arsenal for whenever dryness strikes. A must have!
