I really like this Estee Lauder DayWear Advanced Multiprotection antioxidant moisturizer. There’s not a strong scent to it, you can somewhat smell the sunscreen but it isn’t noticeable after putting it on. I feel like my skin is hydrated but not too oily like other moisturizers with spf in them. I usually use a basic lotion moisturizer during the winter months when I’m not outside so I’m enjoying trying this one before the sun is really coming out. I try to always wear a moisturizer with spf during the spring and summer when I’m outdoor more so this one is working very well for me so far. Light and hydrating
