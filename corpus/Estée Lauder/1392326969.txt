I received a sample size of the Youth Power Creme though Influenster and it kept my combination skin well hydrated this week as I’ve been trying it out. The hyaluronic acid plus glycerin and dimethicone instantly smooth my skin while the peptides firm over every long haul plus my makeup glides on over this. I’m not a huge fan of the fragrance though it isn’t terrible and I wish the ingredients were pared down, the list is fairly lengthy. hydrating & wears well under makeup
