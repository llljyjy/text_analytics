Too soon to tell the effects but the texture is nice. I prefer keeping it in a beauty fridge so it’s cold when applied. What I appreciate the most is that it’s a gel-like texture that is easily absorbed. I don’t see any immediate effects but it is moisturizing to the area. Wonderful texture, easily absorbed
