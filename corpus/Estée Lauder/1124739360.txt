Penetrates deeper than most moisturizers. I use this creme as a final step in my night routine. It’s thick but not greasy and leaves my skin feeling light. In the morning I notice that my skin is hydrated yet didn’t have a filmy residue. I like that the product is easily portable as I tend to need all my products when on travel. I have combination to oily dark skin. This gives me exactly what’s needed during these cold winter months. nan
