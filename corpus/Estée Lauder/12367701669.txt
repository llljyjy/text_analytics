I received this product free for review from influencer but all opinions are my own. I do love Estee lauder, however I am not a fan of this moisturizer. For one it is not enough product to give a good review as the bottle is very tiny. After I put this product on my skin it leaves a greasy film which takes some time to absorb into the skin which I do not like. Also the fragrance is a no for me. It is not very loud in sent it is a light smell however I am not fond of it I personally do not recommend this product. nan
