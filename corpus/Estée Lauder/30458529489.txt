This was gifted to me by influenster and Estee lauder. I really did like the cream but it was hard to judge any lasting benefits or results in a sample size.  It feels great and is super moisturizing without leaving my skin oily in the morning.  Many creams irritate my eyes and this did not. If it wasnâ€™t for the price, I would probably add to my regular routine! nan
