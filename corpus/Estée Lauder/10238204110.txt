I received a sample of this from Influenster to review. It was not great for me. It is heavily fragranced which doesn’t always bother me but it’s more floral which gives me a headache. This also made me break out in small bumps the next morning. I have skin that leans towards sensitive. On top of that, I just didn’t feel like it did anything for me- I didn’t feel more plump or hydrated. I wouldn’t recommend. nan
