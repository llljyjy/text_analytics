I used this product for about a week, night and day, until it ran out. It goes on smoothly, and absorbs in quickly, even  with a thick application. I will say it has a perfume smell to it. It’s not horribly strong, and in my experience goes away after it dries. but it’s there. I always thought it was weird when I put it on. Not sure why it needed such a prominent smell.   I have combination skin that need regular exfoliation. I still needed that exfoliation, but this stuff still kept my skin nice and hydrated, without creating a greasy mess in my oily spots. I would recommend it to someone to try out for themselves, for sure. Ultimately, though, I don’t  plan to keep using it myself. I prefer the cost and scent of my current products.
