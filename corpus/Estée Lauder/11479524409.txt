I received a complimentary sample from Influenster in exchange for a review. This toner was just okay to me. Its most noticeable feature is the fragrance, while not overpowering it is still strong and is floral/soapy. The texture is watery, not too thick. I felt it absorbed quickly but also left some sort of tackiness or soapy feel on my skin. The packaging states that it is recommended for dry skin, but I would recommend other hydrating/milky toners over this one instead. nan
