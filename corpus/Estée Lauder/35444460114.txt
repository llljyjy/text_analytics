I surprised at how great my skin felt after just one use!! It’s very smooth, but not too watery or thick. It’s a perfect formula that provides multiple benefits to your skin! In general, I love Estée Lauder Products! And was super excited to try this Soft Clean Infusion! It definitely adds a nice hydrating extra layer to your skin and instantly diminishes lines. I look for products with amino acids as we know are essential for healthy, moisturized skin! So I love that they added Amino Acid15 complex into this formula. I could definitely see a difference In my skins texture, and helped with locking in moisture before putting on makeup, Plus it made my skin glow! I highly recommend adding this product to your skin routine! Your skin feels instantly moisturized, and clean!
