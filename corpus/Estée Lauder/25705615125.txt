This product felt amazing on my dry skin. It wasn’t too greasy to wear all day under my makeup or at night. I’m 45 with very dry skin. During the day under makeup it gives a dewy look, I personally like that look and feel for myself.  This product from packaging to feel was luxurious.  The only reason I didn’t give the full 5 stars is because the sample I received to give my review wasn’t large enough to wear long enough to see real results.  If it works like it feels then we have a winner! Luxurious
