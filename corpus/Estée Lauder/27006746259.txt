I received this product for free from Influenster and Estee Lauder in exchange got my honest opinion. Honestly... I LOVE it! I was a little hesitant to try this because I haven’t found a moisturizer that I have liked but this is the one. I really like the light feel that it leaves on my face and it doesn’t clog my pores. The SPF is an added bonus knowing that I have that base  protection! This is perfect for combination and oily skin. Don’t sleep on this product, you won’t be disappointed. This stuff is legit
