I love the silky texture and how easily this cream absorbs into my skin. It also doesn’t irritate my eyes like other eye creams I’ve tried. But after over a month of using this, I don’t see much improvement in fine lines….I don’t have dark circles so maybe it helps more for that. I do think it helps my eyes look somehow more awake, but not any kind of miracle cream. nan
