I’ve been using this mostly around my eye area. It went into my skin easily, and felt light weight. I did have something that irritates my skin for a few days, and everything I applied to my face stung. If you have sensitive skin, I could see this stinging from time to time. Other than that, I’ve enjoyed adding this to my skincare routine. Decent moisturizer
