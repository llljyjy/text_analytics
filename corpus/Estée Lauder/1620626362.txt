I was sent this by Influenster to try for my honest opinion. I used this sample size moisturizer by Estée Lauder morning and night for two weeks until I ran out of it. I have to say I like the consistency of this cream. It’s good for all skin types because, it’s so light weight and it sinks into the skin quickly, the cream has no scent which is good for people with very sensitive skin. It plays well with other skincare and under makeup as well. I noticed my skin felt very soft and visibly plump. I will be purchasing the full size for sure! I’m honestly impressed.
