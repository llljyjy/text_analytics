It’s okay. I was able to sample this free with a small sample. It is pretty watery just a little thicker than water though. It has a pretty heavy floral  scent I barely tolerate. I can’t say much for only a small sample how longer use is for my skin. I did like it felt quick to dry after application. Think it does have small hydration. It’s okay.
