I am in love with this cream! Its thick and luxurious but absorbs quickly and nicely. I noticed some people complain about the scent but the scent is very light and smells just like other luxury cream brands that I have tried. My skin immediately feels bouncey and hydrated. I have super dry skin so I like to apply this before I put on makeup. It makes it to where my makeup sits nice and doesnâ€™t dry my skin out even more (if you know, you know). I have not tried it long enough to notice any long term effects but if the immediate results are this good I can only imagine that the long term benefits are even better. Also as a side note- I have very sensitive and acne prone skin and this product did not aggravate my skin nor cause any breakouts. I highly reccomend this luxurious feeling cream! Luxurious feels.
