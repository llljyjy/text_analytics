Estee Lauder has some of the best moisturizers and this one is no exception! It’s not too thick, not too thin, not too heavy, not too light. It’s actually perfect. It hydrates my skin and leaves it moist and supple. It’s very soft and just feels amazing. I will say that if I had to choose between this one or the anti-aging cream that I would pick the anti-aging cream. Mainly because I like the texture of it a little better. But this one is still great. There’s not very much difference between the two in my opinion, however, overall I still give it 5 out 5 stars. It’s a great cream moisturizer. Period. The Perfect Cream Moisturizer!
