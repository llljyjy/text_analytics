I received this for free from Influenster and Est√©e Lauder in exchange for my opinion. I was already using another eye cream but it has been replaced by this!! I love how cool and moisturized my under eye area feels after I apply it. But not sticky. It has a nice pleasant scent but not overwhelming. I noticed results within the first few days of using it and definitely see results now. It has caused some fine lines and the puffiness to go away. I would absolutely recommend this to a friend! I love it!! very nice
