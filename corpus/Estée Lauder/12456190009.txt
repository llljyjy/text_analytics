I’ve been using this product for a couple weeks and really liking it! It is a rich and creamy formula, it goes on silky smooth, and it absorbs into skin quickly without leaving greasy residue. It has a very light scent that is fresh but hardly noticeable which I like because I wear perfume daily. It’s definitely worth a try if you are looking for deep hydration! Thanks Sephora and Influenster!
