The sample I received only lasted a week, so I cannot say how well it works long term. However, in the short term is was a fantastic moisturizer! If left my skin looking very glowy & healthy. It wasnâ€™t too thick or runny. Perfect consistency, and the scent was light & not overpowering. Great Moisturizer!
