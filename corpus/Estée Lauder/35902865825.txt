This eye gel was great it moisturized my eyes they were very dry lately the fine lines did fade away that i ss getting bc i never have used an eye cream before and my dark circles and puffiness did reduce i wouldn’t recommend you splurge unless you got the money there’s other more affordable options out there. I did enjoy it though. No scent very light and long lasting. Nice eye cream
