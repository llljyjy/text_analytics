I received this cream free to try from Influenster. It’s a nice light cream that doesn’t feel greasy or tacky, and absorbs into skin fairly quick. It does leave you face feeling soft, but I didn’t see any major improvements to my skin. The one thing I really dislike about Estée Lauder’s products is how perfumey they are, and that’s what I didn’t like about this cream such a strong sent Just a basic nice cream don’t expect Miracles!
