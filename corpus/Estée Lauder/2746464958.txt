This product made my skin feel moisturized. I have combination skin and use a moisturizer daily so I require a hydrating cream. I like that it is water based, lightly scented, has collagen and hyaluronic acid. Though I didnâ€™t see any firming or lifting while using this cream, I still enjoyed it. Good moisturizer, light scent
