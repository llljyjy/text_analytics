I received this as a sample to give an unbiased review.I really liked the consistency of this product and how it performed on my skin. However, the scent is very strong and very mature. It did dissipate after a while, but using it before bed was a bit jarring. I did notice my skin was hydrated and I have sensitive skin and did not have any negative reaction. If the scent was lighter, or an unscented option was available I would give this a higher rating. Great Moisturizer, Strong Scent
