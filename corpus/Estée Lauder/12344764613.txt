I received this item in exchange for an honest review. This is a good eye cream that goes melts into your skin. It also didn’t irritate my eyes like some creams do since I have sensitive skin! I didn’t see a noticeable difference on my wrinkles I need to try it for a longer time. My skin around my eyes does feel more hydrated. I did enjoy using the product! Eye gel-creme
