I received this eye cream complimentary to try out.  I really like it! I can’t say for sure I noticed any immediate results because There wasn’t enough in the sample to use long enough to see results. What little bit I did use it, ut was great! The texture was amazing and felt great on my skin, I did feel like it was really hydrating and it did not have a strong fragrance to it. I would definitely give this eye cream another chance! nan
