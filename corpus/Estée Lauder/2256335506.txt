Ester Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Cr√®me Moisturizer is easy to apply, smooth, lightweight, and has a pleasant smell. I applied it over my retinol night cream. It is a nice light weight moisturizer especially on hot, summer nights. I also used it alone and felt it was good moisturizer.  Though during winter months when my skin gets dry due to the cold air, it might too light of a moisturizer.  Overall I liked it and find it to be an overall good lightweight moisturizer for normal skin. Great lightweight moisturizer!
