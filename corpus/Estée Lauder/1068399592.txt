I love the feel of this eye cream. The texture is kind of gel-like with some nice bounce and really thick so it feels like itâ€™s locking all that good moisture in. So far the results seem pretty comparable to other high-Eve eye creams. I received this product free from Influenster and Estee Lauder in exchange for my honest review. texture is fabulous!
