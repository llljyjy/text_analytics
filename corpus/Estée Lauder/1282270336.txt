The consistency is cool, clear, and in between a gel and serum. There is a slight scent. I tested it on the back of my hand and my skin became warm and tingly. The sample I received was small, about the size of a quarter, so I am unable to comment on results. A lot of the ingredients are synthetic so overall this is not a product I will use because I have sensitive skin. Sensitive Skin
