Wonderful plumping and blurring of imperfections effect on my skin. I applied product with a reusable cotton pad and saw an immediate glow and difference in the size of my pores, specifically around my nose. I was tempted to rate 4 stars because of the astronomical price and application of the way product comes out could be better, but truth be told, the product did work excellent on my combination skin. It actually works!
