I received a complimentary sample of this product in exchange for my review. I have dry skin, thus using a moisturizer is essential. I liked the feel of the eye cream. However it didn’t sit well under makeup. I noticed a lot more creasing even when using a setting powder.  Overall, this product works well, but I would only use at night. I wouldn’t purchase due to how expensive it is. Definitely a nightmare eye cream
