This cream is actually really nice! It’s a little on the thicker side but kind of just melts as you’re rubbing so it’s ok. It has a nice creamy texture to it. It definitely hydrated my skin! And when I wake up in the morning my face feels smooth. I don’t see any results yet but I’ve only been using it a week and my skin feels better so I know it will get better! nan
