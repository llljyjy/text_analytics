If you’re ok with scents, this is a great option for after cleansing. It’s not sticky, and absorbs into the skin quickly. I have dry & sensitive skin, and it made my skin feel moisturized and fresh. The texture is a bit runny, and you don’t need a lot. Would recommend to a friend who is looking for a moisturizing toner! Nice toner, strong scent
