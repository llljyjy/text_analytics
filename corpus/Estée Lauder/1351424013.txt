The texture of this is pretty thick and very zinc spf looking but has no cast left on the skin from the SPF. It smells like SPF tho but with no other intense added fragrance that other high end brands add which I am very happy it didn’t have overbearing fragrance. I generally am very acne reactive so I was a bit nervous about using the chemical sunscreen that’s in this but it didn’t seem to break my skin out so that’s a big plus. It’s just a decent daily moisturizer. The only reason why I didn’t give it 5 stars is because it’s extremely basic feeling and just not the perfect formula for my very oily skin. I would of loved to try their matte version of this cream. I think it would be way better with the matte because I’m extremely oily and this I used under my makeup and I was just a bit too oily too soon all day long. But if you are looking for a good daily SPF that’s chemical and have normal to dry skin I think you would really like this. My skin usually loves Estee lauder serums and the advanced recovery line, but this wasn’t really at that level for me personally. Better for normal/dry skin
