I received this Estēe Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Crème for free to test and review. I found it to be lightweight and the scent is not overpowering. However, there just isn’t enough in the sample size to really get an idea if it’s working. My skin isn’t noticeably different but it’s not irritated by it, either. YMMV No noticeable improvement
