If you want my honest opinion, yeah...I saw results from using this product. But is it worth $70, for me, I’d have to say no. Would I buy it in smaller amounts for a lesser price? Probably! Because it does last a long time.As for results: I can’t say I saw improvements in every area it claims, however, I do think it diminished my fine lines a bit, DEFINITELY hydrates and gives you a more rested appearance, and it helps with dark circles slightly.Disclaimer that I only used this at night, despite it suggesting to use morning and night. Good. But for the price? Meh.
