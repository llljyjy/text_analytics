My skin has been craving hydration this winter, and applying this Power Crème makes it feel great.  the crème is not heavy or oily, but it’s substantial. It has a bit of a shimmer and an elegant scent.  Most importantly, it definitely smooths fine lines.  I apply it to my face and neck, and they feel smoother and healthier. The only thing I would prefer about this product is if it would include SPF to simplify my morning routine, but I do see that Estée Lauder sells a version with SPF. I’d highly recommend this product. Effective in reducing fine lines and feels great!
