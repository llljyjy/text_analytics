I can honestly say, 100%, that this is the best overnight eye cream I have ever tried! It is thick and luscious. Only a tiny bit of gel is needed for both eyes. It’s hydrating and pumps the undereye so you wake up looking refreshed. I would highly recommend this especially if you’re dealing with your undereye skin becoming thin and wrinkly. I received this product for testing purposes. You need this!
