I honestly think this should be called a mist rather than a lotion. I would have preferred to have had a spray top, because using a cotton round basically absorbs all the product and irritates sensitive skin. I didnâ€™t see any change from using this product, but I only have a sample size tester to work with so it could be that. My face had no change in terms of moisture or soothing red skin. It just felt and looked like I applied water to my face. Even when sprayed on my face, I still had no change. Would I pay over a hundred dollars for this? NO Would I pay $5? Nope. This being said, you may like this product. You may have skin that would thrive with this... But it didnt do anything for me. If you can find a sample, try that first. Meh Product for Me
