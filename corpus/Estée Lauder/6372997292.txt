I’m kind of on the fence about this moisturizer. I have combination skin, dry patches with an oily t-zone, so I use moisturizer every day. This one had an odd feel when applying it, almost like a firmness to it. It didn’t melt into my skin or go on super smooth, and I also felt like I had to use more of the product to apply it to my entire face. It is lightly scented not overpowering so that was nice. It was a sample size that only lasted a few applications so I can’t say that I truly noticed any difference that it made other than helping to alleviate some of the dryness. I will probably buy a full size jar so I can give it a thorough test, so definitely not a bad product.I received the Estee Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Moisturizer Youth Power Creme complimentary in return for my honest opinion. nan
