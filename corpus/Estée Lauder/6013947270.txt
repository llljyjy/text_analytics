I have to say that I really enjoyed this product. It went on smooth and made my skin feel so hydrated and plump. I tried this for day use and for me itâ€™s not that great under makeup, though I do have really oily skin. I found this to work best for me for night time use after cleansing my skin. This is definitely a product I would use again. nan
