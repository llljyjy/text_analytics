I received a sample of this in exchange for review. The sample was only enough for about a week of use so I cannot speak to any long term results. It has a fairly strong fragrance which dissipated quickly. It applied nicely, sunk in quickly and did not leave any residue. Unfortunately that is really all I can say without a longer sampling period. Need a Longer Sample Period
