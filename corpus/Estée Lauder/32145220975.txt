I received a small jar of this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I was astonished at how long my small jar lasted. A little goes a long way, and the cream itself is very thick and moisturizing. I definitely noticed an increased radiance in my skin while using this product. It is (pleasantly) scented, but if you have a reaction to scents, you may want to take a pass. 4 stars only because of the price; I donâ€™t know that I can justify spending over $100 for this product as a staple in my night-time routine. Excellent (albeit pricey) nighttime cream
