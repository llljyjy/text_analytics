I received this from moisturizer for free from EstÄ“e Lauder and Influenster. Unfortunately when I began to use it I broke out. It has a light fragrance that dissipates fairly quickly. It has a creamy texture that goes onto the skin beautifully. I would have to try it again to see if it continues to cause breakouts. May give this a second chance.
