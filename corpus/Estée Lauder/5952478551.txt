I received a sample from Estée Lauder and Influenster to try it and I can say so far I like it. My skin looks more even and smooth after applying it, and the pores look less visible. I cannot attest to how it helps with wrinkles since I’ve received a small sample and didn’t have enough time to see the difference. It’s scented, not heavily but still the scent presents. It dissipates quickly but if you’re sensitive, it might be a minus. I took 1 star off because I didn’t like the texture of the cream. It does not spread easily even though the cream itself is not very thick. Smooth and pore refining
