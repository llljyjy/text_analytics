This cream has a very rich and thick texture, the scent of it is pleasant and light. I think it’s mostly suitable for normal to dry skin types. My skin type is oily and I’m really enjoying this cream now during winter, but I can tell that it would feel too sticky during summer. It sure makes skin look and feel super hydrated and plumped. All of the dry areas are healed right away. If you prefer thicker face cream, then you should definitely try this one! Great for winter
