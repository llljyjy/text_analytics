This is a good eye cream. I use it at night time. It’s easily absorbs, no fragrance which is really good and what I am always looking for when purchasing skin care products. It leaves your eyes area very plump and soft and refreshed. It’s not sticky and very gentle on skin. I will definitely continue using this product snd recommend it to my friends too. Great eye cream
