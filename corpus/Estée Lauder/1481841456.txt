This is a nice cream but I like using it only on my neck. It’s moisturizing and goes on very smoothly. It feels nice on my skin and makes it look a little bit brighter. I haven’t used it long enough to see if it will do anything for my neck lines, but I’m not expecting it to do much for those. It has a fairly benign smell that’s slightly floral. Overall, I would recommend this to others as a neck cream. I received this product complimentary. nan
