I received this as a complimentary product from Estee lauder and influenster for my honest opinion. I did like the way it felt on my face it didn’t make it greasy or anything and my skin felt soft after use. I’m just not sure I’d purchase it for some reason I broke out like it was clogging my pores I’m not sure. Maybe my skin is more sensitive than I thought so that makes me sad. I did really enjoy the way it made my skin feel till I started breaking out. I would still recommend it though because not everyone has sensitive skin like me. nan
