I received this product free for my review from Influenster. I have used it for 2 weeks and the Revitalizing Supreme+ MoisturizerYouth Power Creme has a nice light scent and a cute package. The only complaint I have is that it feels greasy on my face and takes a while to soak into the skin. Not a bad cream
