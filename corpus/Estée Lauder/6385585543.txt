I received this product for free for reviewing purposes. I love the formula, it is very creamy and has a small fragrance to it. Which I really prefer on my face. My skin absorbed it well. I have noticed some improvements under my eyes but not much in firming. But I will give it more time because so far I feel its doing an excellent job on my skin. Also alittle goes a long way with this formula. So far I love it...
