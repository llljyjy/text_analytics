After trying Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair Eye Gel-Cream for a month, I can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised by the results. I was so astonished that after just the first week, I saw a reduction in fine lines and wrinkles. By the second week I actually saw a reduction in my dark under eye circles. From there it only got better. The texture of this eye cream was lightweight, dried down quickly, and never left a greasy residue. It also played well under makeup, and never pilled or caused my concealer to separate. As someone who has super sensitive eyes, I’m pleased to report I never once had any irritation, just perfectly plump and well-hydrated under eyes. If you have some disposable income, I highly recommend giving this luxurious and effective eye cream a try. Luxurious & Effective Eye Cream!
