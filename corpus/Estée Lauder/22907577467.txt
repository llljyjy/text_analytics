I received a sample of this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.  I have dry aging skin and this moisturizer cream applied smoothly. I has a light pleasant scent.  It is a heavy cream and seemed to sit on top of my skin but after waiting it did soak in and left my skin soft and smooth. I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a heavier moisture.  I would use this primarily in the winter when my skin needs a little extra moisture. Rich moisture
