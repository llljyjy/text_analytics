I received this product for free from influenster in exchange for an honest review. I just started using moisturizer about a year ago. I have combination type skin and this Estée Lauder moisturizer leaves my skin too greasy. That said, it didn’t stop me from using it and it is about gone. I won’t buy it myself, but I don’t regret using it. My foundation still went on over top of it just fine. It smells good. It’s better than nothing for sure. And probably better than a lot of brands out there. It’s probably the spf in it that does it and that’s worth it right? It might be amazing for you! It’s just not for me. Not For Me
