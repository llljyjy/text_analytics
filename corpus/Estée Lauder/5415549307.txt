I recommend the Estēe Lauder youth power creme to all skin types. I have a combination type skin and this worked great on me! It melts into your skin and feels so good on application. It has properties to promote skin cell turnover and support skin elasticity! I personally feel this is a good product for all ages as well. It will help support aging skin if you’re older and also a great preventative for someone in their 20s. Love it!
