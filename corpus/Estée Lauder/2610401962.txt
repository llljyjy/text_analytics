I received a sample to test in exchange for my review. It’s a very heavy moisturizer, probably best for winter or for folks with dry skin. While my skin did feel soft after using it, I noticed that if I didn’t use a watery serum first, I had a lot of trouble getting it to spread across my skin and rub in. The smell is also quite strong and smells like products I associate with “older“ women, so I was grateful that it faded quickly after it absorbed. nan
