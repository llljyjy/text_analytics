I received a free sample of this from Influesnter /Sephora/Este Lauder to try and was so excited to use this luxurious facial cream but immediately noticed the overpowering perfume scent which is a total turn off for me. I don’t mind facial products that have a natural or botanical scent but this one is fully perfume and you can even see in their ingredient list that they add “fragrance” which is completely unnecessary for something you put on your face. I liked the silky thick texture of the cream and how it instantly makes your skin feel smooth and moisturized but didn’t notice it having any other of the benefits it claims. It didn’t feel like to fully absorbs into your skin so is not something I would use in the morning because it would effect my makeup wear. One good thing was that I didn’t have any issue using it only sensitive skin, not redness or breakouts which often happens from fragranced products. Overall I liked this but for the price and the fact that I couldn’t stand the smell I would definitely not be buying or recommending it. There are so many great skincare products that cost less and don’t add fragrance and have the same results and I will be sticking to those. Fragranced face products are not for me.
