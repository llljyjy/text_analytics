I absolutely love the smell of this moisturizer. It has a thick texture but it is not that moist. If you’re looking something for daily use, this would be good. If you have a dry skin, then you probably need a moisturizer that’s more hydrating than this one. I received this product as a sample soo the quantity was not as much for me to be able to tell a noticeable difference. Smells Great!!
