I’m a huge fan of the doublewear line so I was so excited to get to try this for around my eyes. The packaging looks so high end with the gold detailing. I expected to see a moisturizer cream texture but this is actually more of a gel with fluidity. I was thrilled that there was no scent.  As some skincare lines are too heavily perfumed for the face. The down side is the oily/greasy  texture when first applied. I personally don’t like that so I rubbed it back off. However, where it had been applied then removed was left with a silky feeling. I wish it had felt like that with out having to run it back off. Eye Repair
