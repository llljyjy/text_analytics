This cream is great! I am obsessed with the texture - so smooth. It soaks perfectly in my skin with no weird residue or feeling after application. I also thought the scent was pleasant! Best of all I did notice a change in the skin around my eyes after a week of use. More hydration, and a slight reduction in the dark circles. I would recommend this product! Great!
