I received a trial size of this product, and I really enjoyed it. I have quite sensitive skin, and it made my face feel instantly smoother and hydrated without that icky greasy feeling. The scent is lovely and not overwhelming. Unfortunately, the trial size is not enough for me to notice any other major differences, but overall I do enjoy this product a lot. Great moisturizer
