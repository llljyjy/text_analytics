This Revitalizing Youth creme is exactly that - it took my dry 31 yr old skin and gave it a smooth youthful glow. The product is medium to thick density and feels super hydrating on the skin — a morning application lasted the entire day. I was able to use it successfully under makeup, which gave me a smooth canvas without any pilling and it managed to keep my desert dry face well moisturized over night when reapplied before bed. I only had a travel sized sample to try out so I can’t comment on possible long term effects but I was very impressed with its short term ability to visually smooth out most of my fine lines & wrinkles, including crows feet - though it didn’t completely disappear the deep, stagnant wrinkles on my forehead, it made them much less noticeable. I’d say it’s the perfect hydrating moisturizer, especially during fall-winter, for those of us in the 30-45 age range w/dry-very dry skin.However, it would serve well as a heavy nighttime anti-aging crème for those w/dry skin under 30 to help prevent the onset of those dreaded fine lines. Those with super oily skin may find this product to be too much for them. If “30 flirty and thriving” was a skin product
