I am liking the Est√©e Lauder Revitaling Supreme moisturizer so far.  I have dry skin and I love it hydrates my skin.  It is a thick cream and smells nice.  It did make me have a couple small breakouts the first couple of times I used it.  I am excited to keep using it to get some firmness. I did notice my skin seemed a bit more luminated.  I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. Hydration and shine
