I received this complimentary in exchange for my review, courtesy of Sephora, Estee Lauder and Influenster.  This product was a complete surprise and so pleasant!!  I am very particular about my skin care and open to trying new things.  I will say this (sample) has been a wonderful product and I will even say-- it rivals Augustine Bader- The Cream and my Cle de Peau creams.  I absolutely would not have tried this if it was not sent to me but my goodness, I will absolutely purchase this and use it in place of my other high priced creams!!!  This absorbs well and does not leave a residue, it does leave my face and neck feeling soft/supple.  I really like the ingredients and I do think that Estee Lauder has been around and known for skin care for a long time.  I am in my early 50s, have minimal lines/wrinkles, I do have larger pores and this seemed to really smooth my skin in all the right ways.  I tend to have combination skin and this did not create any challenges with the T zone.  I did not break out and have in the past when trying/changing products.  I cannot say enough good about this and the price point is fabulous.  A little goes a long way.  VERY HAPPY to have tested this product!!!! Exceptional Hydration
