I received this product Complementary.I have very dry skin. I use a moisturizer every single day as you part of nightly routine. This cream is very thick and hydrating. My face lock refreshed and dewy after using is moisturizer. My skin was so soft after using it. I think this is the perfect cream especially for the drier weather that is coming. Great for dry skin and the winter months!
