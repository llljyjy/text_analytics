I received this product for free from Influenster  in exchange for my honest review. Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme Moisturizer    Is a beautiful product. The texture is soft almost leaves a velvet like feel on the skin. I have combo oily skin. I liked how I could use a small amount during the day, foundation wore beautiful on top. Or at night I could use a bit more to really layer on the moisturizer.    While I greatly appreciate receiving this to try, it was a sample size. All I can say is yes, it left the skin soft and moisturized. It did not have any bad reaction with my skin. Since it was a sample I can not speak on the lasting effect from this product. It is quite pricey, if I saw it on a good sale I would purchase it. I’m giving it 3 stars mostly because of the price. Enjoyed the sample
