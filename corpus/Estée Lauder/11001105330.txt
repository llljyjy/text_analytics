Let me start by telling you a bit about my skin: it’s not sensitive, I don’t have dark circles and a few fine lines (I’m 42), I do have sagging eyelids that started sagging about 10 yrs ago but I believe it’s genetic.  This eye cream is very luxurious, I got a very small sample so I can’t attest for any long term results but I can see how this could yield some long term benefits.  The texture is one of my favorite features,  it is thick, gel-like, similar to petroleum jelly but doesn’t feel heavy or uncomfortable on the skin. It did sting the first few times I used it but I didn’t experience any redness nor further irritation.  I chose to use this in my nightly routine only because I was afraid it was too thick for morning use and I’m glad I did, my immediate results was plump, hydrated skin.  I recommend this if your skin isn’t sensitive, if you’re an older gal like me and need help with wrinkles, dryness and saggy skin. Luxurious and hydrating
