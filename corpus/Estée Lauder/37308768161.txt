I liked the texture of this product a lot. It’s like a really thick gel cream and works really well paired with reusable silicone I masks. However, I was able to make this sample stretch out for a month (a little goes a long way) and I didn’t really notice a difference. I have pretty bad dark circles and a few fine lines, and other than just some added hydration, this didn’t really do much. And for the price? I can’t say this is worth it. Nice, but not worth the money
