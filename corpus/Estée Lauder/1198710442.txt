I received a sample from Influenster. Because it was only a sample, I’m cannot really gauge on the long term affects. However, the cream is beautiful. I initially thought this would be a thick heavy cream, which I don’t mind since I have dry skin but it was incredibly  light yet moisturizing. My skin felt soft and supple after each use. It is lightly scented, I personally don’t mind. I wouldn’t mind buying a full jar of this. Very moisturizing
