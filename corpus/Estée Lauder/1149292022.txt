I normally don’t care for EL products due to the overwhelming scent but this was nice! Very light scent that goes away quickly and I liked the crème more than I thought I would! Absorbed nicely but didn’t make me feel greasy or sticky or worse, dry. I found that it wore well under makeup as well. I’m not sure I’d purchase it on my own as I have a moisturizer and sunscreen combo I love that offers higher SPF and costs less than just this one product, but I definitely recommend it regardless! nan
