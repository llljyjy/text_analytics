I m not a big fan of Estée Lauder but I have to say I did enjoy the feel of this lotion. However, I would say the word lotion in the title is a bit deceiving as you still need to use serum and moisturizer after this product. I’m typically more red and dry in the winter and while it’s very liquid more like a toner it does dry and provide hydration and a smoothing effect. My skin felt very nice after the product. Nice smoothing and hydrating effect.
