After consistent use I can say I wouldnâ€™t recommend this. I saw almost no improvement. At best, it semi helped with some dry skin under my eyes. It also felt a bit greasy so when I rubbed my eyes later in the night it burned a little in my eyes. I received this for free in exchange for my honest opinion from Influenster. Not worth the price tag
