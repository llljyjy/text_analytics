I used Estee Lauder Vitalizing Supreme Moisturizer youth power creme for five days.  I have combination skin and the first thing that grabbed me was the healthy ingredients including but not limited to Hibiscus Morning Bloom and Moringa Extracts.  The second was the amazing but not overpowering scent. The third was how well it moisturizer without any greasiness. In the morning I woke up looking refreshed and hydrated.  I canâ€™t say what the long term results are but I can say I enjoyed using this product for five days!! Loved it!!
