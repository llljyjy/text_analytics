I received this deluxexsample size product free to test in exchange for my honest review.  I am 50 with normal to dry skin. My main skin care concerns are fine lines, dark circles and discoloration from sun danage.The first thing I learned was less is more. This is a very thick, heavy cream. It does absorb quickly, but the skin still feels heavy afterwards. My skin also felt hydrated and slightly silky. I have tried using it with other skin care products and it does not work well. It pilled up and left my skin looking very bad. It also doesn’t work well under powder makeup products. I don’t wear foundation so I have no opinion on that. I finally decided that this works for me as a nighttime moisturizer only. I wish it had been full size so I would have better thoughts on its skincare benefits. A good moisturizer
