I don’t know what’s in this serum but I’ve told friends it’s literally magic in a bottle.  I just turned 40 and I have pretty good skin but over the last year I’ve noticed a few fine lines in between my brows (the dreaded 11s).  I added this serum at night and within a month they were gone.  I’m skeptical of any “counter” brands like Clinique, Clarins, Lauder, etc but this really works.  Lightweight and not sticky either It actually works
