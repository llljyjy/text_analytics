Love this cream! Got it in mini size  from Influenster for honest review; it was a surprise for me as I already  have it in 1.7oz  size and got it by myself to replace my EL Pomegranate night cream mask. So I can say : “It works for me!” I have combination skin with some sign of wrinkles and I value feeling of comfort the most. I usually use this cream before going to sleep after my serum to add more hydration. It’s very creamy. My skin is soft and hydrated when I wake up. I would say it’s better for dry skin than for an oily. And maybe better for winter, but it’s not heavy, not greasy, absorbs well. So Yes, I recommend! Love it!
