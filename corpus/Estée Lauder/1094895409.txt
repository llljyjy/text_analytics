I was given a sample of this product to try out and give my honest review afterwards. This Estée Lauder Revitalizing Crème has helped my combination skin tremendously. It has quenched the super dry areas while not causing and breakouts in the oily zones. I love all the flower derived ingredients as well as the advanced acids and other vitamins that are proven to help skin fight the signs of aging while leaving my skin feeling so soft and smooth. I very much so recommend that you give it a try and see how good your skin can look and feel with its use. Amazingly Moisturizing
