I regularly use eye cream and the texture of this gel-cream to me was pretty interesting. It definitely right away made the area under my eye less sunken in and moist. I feel like it smoothed out any fine lines but didn’t really help with my dark circles even over time which was my major concern. To be fair I’ve used a lot of eye creams and they’ve never helped my dark circles since they’re so bad so I still feel ok with the product overall. nan
