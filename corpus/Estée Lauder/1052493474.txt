This cream is very thick but easy to use. It sank into my skin and took a bit of time to fully absorb. it has been a few weeks of using the eye cream and i didnt see too much of a difference over the weeks.. It is a nice product and I did enjoy using it. There was no strange smells and it didnâ€™t irritate my eyes. nan
