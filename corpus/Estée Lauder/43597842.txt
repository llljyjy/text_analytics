I received this product for free from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review. I was impressed for the get go. I am a skincare enthusiast so I am only impressed by a moisturizer that makes a difference in my skin. The consistency of this product is thick but doesn’t feel heavy on skin. My skin felt strong, protected, and hydrated after using on my skin. One more plus, the scent of the moisturizer is amazing. Love this product and definitely recommend. A must have!
