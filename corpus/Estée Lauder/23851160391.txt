This is surprisingly thick and heavy for a gel cream. It goes on sticky and takes a while to absorb. For me this is definitely a night time cream only because of that. I can’t say I really noticed it it did anything particularly exciting but it was pleasant enough. Overall I didn’t like it better than my drugstore favorites and don’t think I can recommend it given the cost. Surprisingly Thick for a Gel Cream
