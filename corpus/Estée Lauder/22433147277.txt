I received this as a  complementary sample to try in exchange for my honest review.In the description it states “A moringa-infused moisturizer with a supremely indulgent texture for skin that has it all: visible firmness, strength, radiance, and a more lifted look.“ I’ve used this product since I received it in December and I used it all. It is a great moisturizer,  it really helped with the winter dryness around my nose and under my eyes. It also give a radiant glow. I didn’t notice much “lifting or firming “, I didn’t use it that long. Would i buy this again and recommend it? Yes, I would Great Moisturizer
