I really like the texture of this cream and I love the way it slowly absorbs into the skin. It did help to make my eye skin look more hydrated which helped with dark circles. It didn’t do too much for my crows feet, which I didn’t really expect anyway.I received this product for free from Influenster for review. I love the gel cream formula
