This product is great for hydrating the skin. It regards to that a little goes a long way.  It smells citrusy but isn’t too strong. I haven’t noticed any firming but I would be give it more time before saying it doesn’t firm. I have sensitive skin and it doesn’t aggrevate me skin. I really enjoy this product but not sure it’s worth the cost. Expensive but Good
