I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for honest review. I received a sample size that I got about 2 weeks of use out of. It has a great silky smooth texture,  and soaks in well on my face. My skin feels hydrated and smooth with no greasy or sticky sensation. I took away a star for the scent, as its very perfumey. Not a fan of that. Very nice moisturizer
