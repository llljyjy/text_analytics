I received this Estee Lauder moisturizer complimentary from influenster in return for an honest review I like this moisturizer I don’t love this moisturizer it’s good it feels very good on my skin it goes on great makeup goes over it great I can’t say that I saw much of a difference in my skin texture or elasticity but it was a good moisturizer I don’t think it warrants the price tag that it has but it is a good moisturizer I would recommend it if you’re on the market for something however I do think that there are other products that are just as good that aren’t quite as expensive Very good moisturizer
