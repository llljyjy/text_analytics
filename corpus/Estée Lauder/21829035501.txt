I received this product complimentary for review from influenster.  I’ve been using the Tatcha essence and when this was gone I started using pink drink, and my skin misses this product after one week of not using.  I’m definitely going to be adding this to my routine. I love that the full size has a pump, you can control how much you use.  With the travel size it had no plastic piece to slow down the essence coming out of the bottle.  This leaves my skin plumped,  hydrated, and I noticed some decrease in my hyper pigmentation. Again,  stellar pro6 Stellar essence with no weird scent
