Received this in exchange for my honest opinion from Influenster.  I like the way the moisturizer smells and feels; this is a rich, thick consistency.  What I do not like is that regardless of the small amount I use, my face becomes super oily midday.  I would say this is more for those who have dry skin and not combination, like I do. Rich, thick consistency
