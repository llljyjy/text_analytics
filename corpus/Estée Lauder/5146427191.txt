I have oily but pretty acne free skin with a sensitive skin barrier. This product felt nice going on my skin and was slightly more viscous than water without being too thick or goopy. I can see what others mean when they say it feels filmy - I don’t typically use toner but this felt a little thicker than the kind of toners I’ve used in the past and could almost pass as a serum. Personally I feel like this product didn’t do much for me and is an extraneous skincare product. It also has a very strong floral scent that was too strong for my sensitive nose. I don’t think it hurts to try this product if you have dry skin and money to spare but it doesn’t seem essential and there are probably better in scented hydrating products out there. nan
