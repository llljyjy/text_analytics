This is a very rich and creamy moisturizer!  A little goes a long way.  The cream is thick but absorbs completely and well.  My skin felt incredibly hydrated after using it, and the product had a pleasant, but not overpowering, scent.  To me, this felt more like a night cream than a day moisturizer; that said, your preferences may vary!Because I only used a sample, I not not able to evaluate the anti-aging claims fully. That said, this is a very effective and luxurious feeling moisturizer. Great moisturizer!
