I have a dry skin and usually struggle to find products that keep my skin hydrated. I came across Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Treatment Lotion from Est√©e Lauder and my struggle has ended. Although it says it is a lotion it has a watery consistency and is more like a toner than lotion. It absorbs in my skin immediately with instant hydration. It does not last longer than 4 hours in my opinion. Pleasant and mild fragrance with a dewy look is what it is. Watery lotion
