This eye cream lives up to the claims. I look five years younger. This applies under and in the outer corner of my eyes and helps reduce the dark circles and fine lines. I love the creamy gel consistency, it feels so good upon application. This takes a few days to really see the best results, but they can start to be seen the next morning after first application! I received this complementary, but I don’t know how I’m going to live without it now. I’ll continue to purchase Lives up to the claims!
