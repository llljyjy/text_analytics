I received this product complimentary through Est√©e Lauder and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. The texture of this moisturizer is so nice! I want to love it but unfortunately my skin is fairly sensitive to fragrance so this is not an ideal product for me. It has a good weight without feeling greasy and absorbs well but I did find I got a bit itchy/irritated shortly after application. I gave the remainder of the sample to my mom and she is definitely impressed. If your skin does well with fragrance you may have better luck. Great texture, unfortunately not for me
