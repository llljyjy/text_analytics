I received a sample of this product from Influenster in the Estée Lauder voxbox in exchange for an honest review. The sample I received was rather small, and generally I like to test a skincare product for at least a month before I’m confident I’ve experienced the results I can come to expect with it. However, on initial trial, the product smells really nice. Normally, I’m not one for fragranced skincare products because I just feel that it’s unnecessary and can lead to breakouts. But the scent was really subtle. It was almost kind of floral and delicate. When applying to my face, it was thicker than i assumed it would be. It was almost like the consistency of a snail mucin. Even on the first trial, it did make my skin feel really soft. As for any other results, I was only able to get about four uses from the sample bottle before it ran out, so I didn’t notice any significant changes to my skin. It did not break me out, and it didn’t make my skin feel oily. Even though it had a heavier consistency, it didn’t feel heavy on my skin, and played nicely with all of my other skincare products. I would be willing to try this product again. I do wish that I would have gotten a little bigger of a sample to be able to assess it’s more long term results, but i did get a good first impression from this product. Soft skin that smells good
