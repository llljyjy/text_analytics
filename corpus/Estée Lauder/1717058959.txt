I used this on my face a few times (right now I donâ€™t have to many spots that needs it) and it worked to moisturize my skin. My only issue with it is it is a little stronger scented than I like but thankfully it is not so strong that I can still stand it and use it. I did find a different way to use it, I found that it helped out they dry skin on my knuckles. Once I saw it helped my knuckles I tried it on my daughters elbows and it has been helping quite a bit. nan
