I’m really digging this product so far! I haven’t used it long enough to know if there are any dramatic differences, but I’ve used it for two weeks now & my crows feet seem to be less harsh and my undereye makeup goes on smoother. My undereyes actually felt smoother than the remainder of my skin. I also love that this is a gel like consistency and feels kind of cool going on, which is refreshing, especially in this summer heat! And that it’s easy to distribute rather than tugging my skin like some other products can. Thumbs up from me! Liking it so far!
