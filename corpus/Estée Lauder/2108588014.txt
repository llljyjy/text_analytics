The Advanced Night Repair eye gel-creme is designed to help with dullness, dryness, puffiness, eye lines and dark circles. I do not currently use eye cream consistently but I enjoy how lightweight and quick absorbing this gel creme is. The consistency of the gel creme is silky. There is a light scent that goes away when applied. The gel creme leaves skin feeling soft. I would recommend this eye cream to those that have eye skin concerns and would like additional hydration.	I received the product complimentary from Influenster and Est√©e Lauder for my review. nan
