I received this product free from Influenster as a promotion in which I would try out the product in exchange for an honest review. I can’t say that I had many benefits from this product. My skin does have a slight glow, but nothing else really happened. I do have to say, however, that the scent reminded me of my late Nana. I didn’t notice any difference in texture or firmness. As a 31 year old, I personally wouldn’t purchase this. nan
