This is a thick and rich cream. It feels luxurious on the skin and makes it feel super soft on my combination skin. My face feels hydrated and I do see an improvement in those pesky dry spots. I’m not sure if my skin looks more radiant or firm, but overall I do like this product. The smell is pleasant, but it may be overpowering to those who don’t like strong fragrances. nan
