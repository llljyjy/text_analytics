I received this product from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest opinion. To be honest, my skin felt soft for a while, but I did not notice any lasting difference. I would recommend this to someone with really dry skin and see if they notice a change. It just didn’t make a lasting impression on me. It’s Okay
