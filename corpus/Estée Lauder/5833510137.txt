I was sent this product to review from Influenster. The first thing I noticed upon trying this was the light scent of cucumber, which was pleasant. The cream is nice and thick without feeling heavy. I did enjoy the way it went on, it absorbed well and didn’t leave me feeling greasy. I however do have oily skin and after trying it a few times, I found that it just doesn’t work with my skin type. It makes me so much more oilier throughout the day. I do think someone with more dryer skin would really enjoy this so I do recommend it for them. nan
