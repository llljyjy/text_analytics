sample from Influenster and Estee Lauder in exchange for my honest review. I loved this product. My skin felt hydrated all day. It absorbs well and did wear it under my makeup. There wasnâ€™t a big scent which was nice. The was really a creamy moisturizer I really enjoyed it. I wish I had a more. nan
