This eye cream feels very moisturizing but it’s not for me. The formula is on the thicker side and doesn’t “sit right“ on my skin. Even using the tiniest amount and the product still beaded up on my skin. I would only reccomend this if you prefer heavier eye cream. *I received this product for free in exchange for honest review via Influenster* Not for me
