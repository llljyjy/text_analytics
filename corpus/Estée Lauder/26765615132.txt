I use eye cream morning and night. I also use a caffeine serum. All of my eye products (3) combined don’t cost much more than this ONE THING from Estée Lauder. I stopped using my regular pm cream but continued with the serum and my normal am cream while testing this product. I didn’t notice a change at all - good or bad - which tells me that it maintained the same level of skin care as my regular (cheaper) eye cream. I did like the texture though. It felt really nice on my under eye area. I received a free sample of this product in exchange for an honest review. Good - but not game changing
