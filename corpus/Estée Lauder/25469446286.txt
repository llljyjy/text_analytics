*RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FROM INFLUENSTER IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST OPINION*** I have tested this product out for the last few weeks. While it is hydrating to the under eye area, i would say that was the most benefit that I noticed from the product. It did take a few days for my skin to adjust to it, in the long run I can see it helping my under eyes look more youthful. nan
