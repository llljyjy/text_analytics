I have used better moisturizers that cost half of the price of this one. I also dislike the strong perfume smell. It also makes my skin very greasy because it is so thick and caused me to breakout. The one positive I did have was after a few weeks of usage my skin felt softer to the touch. Less expensive moisturizers work better
