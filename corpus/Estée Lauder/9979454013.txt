This eye cream is so nice. It is a gel/cream like consistency that glides on smoothly but absorbs quickly unlike some gel formulas. It has a very faint scent, but nothing I would notice unless I was actively smelling the product closely. I get milia under my eyes with some eye creams that are too dense, but have not found that with this. Really enjoy it! Nice eye cream!
