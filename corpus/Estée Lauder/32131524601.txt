I liked this! Estée Lauder is already on my faves list so I was excited to try something new. I usually don’t use toner so wasn’t sure I needed to but it definitely left my face feeling good after use. It shipped in a super tiny sample size so I was thinking it wouldn’t last long enough to judge fairly, but a little bit seriously goes a long way and I have plenty left.. even after applying it with cotton balls. For that reason I would definitely purchase the large size because I know it will last. It also has a slight scent that I didn’t mind and I didn’t think it lingered too long. Love this
