I’ve been on the hunt for an eye cream as the last one I used increased the amount of milia around my eyes. The texture of this eye cream is a gel but it’s a heavy gel, almost as thick as a cream. It is easy to blend in but also feels incredibly hydrating. You really get the best of both worlds with regards to texture and application. I can’t say if I noticed any brightening per say but I saw less fine lines when using this eye creme. Incredibly luxurious eye creme
