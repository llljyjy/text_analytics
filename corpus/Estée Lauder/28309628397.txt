This is great. Adds suppleness, decreases dark circles and puffiness while reducing appearance of wrinkles. Definitely would recommend! I know fragrance is a personal preference but I didn’t like the smell of this creme, which was my only drawback. No stickiness after application, absorbed well, and didn’t feel greasy either. Definitely works!
