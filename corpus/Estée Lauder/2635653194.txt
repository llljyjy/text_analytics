I received a sample from Influenster, all I can say is I wish it was bigger bottle! I used this at night after my skincare routine. It was light, non-greasy(huge bonus) and light fragrant to it. I’ve also used it on my lips as they’ve been extra dry this winter. My face feels smooth, young and healthy after use. Plus side, a little goes a long way. So if worried about the price, this should last a long time!! Worth it!!! My only reason for the four stars is just price, but then again it’s worth it!! Give it a try!
