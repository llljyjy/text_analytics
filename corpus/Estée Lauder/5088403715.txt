This product didn’t do anything for me. I used twice a day for three weeks and it didn’t make my skin look fresher or reduce under eye circles. Maybe I should apply more generously? I did appreciate the product texture though, and that after applying the cream melted into my skin so I couldn’t feel it. Didn’t Work for Me
