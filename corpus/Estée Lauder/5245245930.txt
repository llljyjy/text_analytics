This moisturizer didn’t really work for me. I didn’t notice any difference in my skin after using it for a few weeks. It is nice and light weight and doesn’t leave the skin feeling greasy. It also doesn’t have a fragrance which is nice for people with sensitive skin. I received this complimentary for testing purposes. nan
