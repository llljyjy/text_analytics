So far I love it.  I was looking for a cream to focus mostly under my eyes.  I do not have any wrinkles or anything but I am a firm believer in being PREVENTATIVE.  This cream doesn’t have a strong smell, which I like.  It also doesn’t feel oily when applied.  The price is a little high however a little does seem to go a long way.  I am going to keep applying until I run out of the sample and will update if anything changes.  So far I can see this product being a staple in my routine.  I would recommend you give this a try. So far so good
