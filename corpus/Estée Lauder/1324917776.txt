I’ve used the Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Complex for years and love it, so I wanted to try something new. This formula didn’t work as well for me. The applicator felt nice but you need to use your fingers anyway to apply it properly. And the product ended up causing irritation and a bunch of tiny dark red dots on my skin, oddly weeks after I started using it. I’ve never had issues with Estée Lauder before but my skin is very sensitive so who knows. I’d stick with the classic eye cream formula if you’re concerned about reactions. Avoid if you have ultra sensitive skin
