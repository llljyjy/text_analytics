I recieved this as a free sample, and I have to say, I can’t believe I love it. In the two weeks I’ve tried this, I have seen an improvement in my skin. There is a slight fragrance that doesn’t bother my allergies or does not irritate my sensitive skin. It’s nice, light weight and sinks into the skin right away. nan
