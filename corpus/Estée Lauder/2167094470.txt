I absolutely love the way this eye gel goes on,soft and smoothly. It dries within seconds and there is no stickiness thankfully. After using it for a good four weeks I can honestly say that that my crows feet which had just started to appear,it went away. My under eye bags have lightened so much and the puffiness is gone. I love everything about it! This does it all for my eyes!
