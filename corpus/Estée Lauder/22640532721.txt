I got this item as a free sample and though I really did like the cream there wasn’t enough in the sample to really tell if it had any effect on my skin. The consistency and scent were both pleasant and I would use it again just don’t know if it lives up to it’s claims or not so I would be hesitant to spend the money on it. Seems good
