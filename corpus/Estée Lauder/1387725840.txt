I received this product free from Estēe Lauder and Influenster for my honest review. This gel-crème has a great texture that easily absorbs into the delicate under eye area.  It also has a slight cooling effect because it is a gel.  I only received a sample size to test so I can’t speak on the longevity, but this gel-crème did moisture and visibly remove wrinkles.  It felt smooth and refreshing going on.  I would recommend trying this and adding to your nighttime routine. Luxurious Gel-Crème
