This was a really nice product. I was pleasantly surprised. I have oily skin and was concerned that a rich moisturizer would cause me to be oily during the day. I wasn’t sure that it would layer well under makeup. However, I had no problems with this. I would say that this is definitely not light weight so if that is something you are concerned about then this product isn’t for you. Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a heavier moisturizer that will also worn under makeup and that is good for oily skin as well. My skin felt soft and moisturized after I used it. Good for oily skin
