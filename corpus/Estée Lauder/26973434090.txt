I was given the Estee Lauder DayWear free to try in exchange for my honest review. I am impressed that this cream has SPF protection because it doesn’t have the feel of a sunscreen. It soaks into the skin and leaves behind a dewy feel instead of a greasy one that typically comes with sunscreen, it also has a soft cucumbery scent. It keeps my face moisturized all day and a little goes a long way so one container will last quite a while. The downsides - I have experienced a few sporadic tiny white heads since using this cream, but my skin is already breakout prone so this isn’t really surprising to me. I also wish the packaging was more eco friendly. So much unnecessary plastic (at least on my small half oz, maybe the larger jars are glass). You wouldn't know this was SPF!
