I received this product free for my honest review from Influenster. I love Estée Lauder products. This cream has a light scent which I like. It’s not a thin moisturizer but not super thick. It feels nice on my face. It adds hydration that my skin sometimes lacks. The sample size is small so I didn’t have enough product to test it out fully. I don’t know all the benefits but I’m sure they are great. The hydration was an instant benefit for me. I only got about four days worth of product. Good cream
