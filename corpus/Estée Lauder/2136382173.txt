It doesn’t foam or lather much for me so I’m not sure if it’s fully cleansing my skin as much as it makes it look shiny and plump after use. It’s a milky gel consistency. I noticed it shrinks my pores which is great. However, this takes a good amount to work up to cover your whole face…probably a quarter size worth. The scent is milky aquatic fresh and doesn’t linger. I wouldn’t use this for makeup removal or deep cleansing at the end of the day unless you use it with multistep cleansing like an oil or balm first. This is something I would rather use in the shower or in the morning to cleanse. This isn’t the deepest clean, but it makes my skin feel good. Milky and freshening
