This eye cream feels so nice and hydrating going on. Not sticky at all and I bet it would be even better refrigerated. It’s very soothing and I have the darkest circles so I welcome any product that helps in that department. I’m still using it to see final results but so far it has reduced the dark, puffy circles under my eyes pretty significantly. Would recommend. Bye Bye Dark Circles
