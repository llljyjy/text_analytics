A little goes a long way! This eye cream is more of like a serum. It is light and absorbs well into the skin. I use a little dab and gently pat it in at night. It is super moisturizing, yet does not have have a tacky residue. My under eyes feel more plump and revitalized in the AM! A little goes a long way
