I received a sample size of this to review.  It is super hydrating.  My skin felt nice and soft.  I wish the sample had been a little larger so I could test it when the temperature s really dropped here.  It has a nice fragrance.  If you don’t like fragrance in your skin care or are sensitive to it, this probably isn’t for you.  I’m sensitive to fragrances and it did NOT bother me.  It worth trying out! Thick moisturizing formula
