I was able to sample this in a mini that lasted me about 2 wks applying once daily. It feels lightweight and gives the skin a soft, silky feel. It has an almost masculine fragrance that faded away after a few minutes. In the time i used it, i didnt see as much results as i had expected aside from the eay my make up seems to work well with this moisturizer.   minutesminutes nan
