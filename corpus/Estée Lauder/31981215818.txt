The first thing I noticed was how lightly scented this is. This is good if you are sensitive to strong smells or have sensitive skin. The creme goes on smoothly and has a thick feel to it. Iâ€™m not sure if it made my skin more youthful, but it did give it great hydration and a softer feel. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to help with their aging skin. Supreme Youth
