I received this complimentary from Estee Lauder and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have dry skin and typically use a hydrating toner and essence in my skincare routine. This has a floral scent. It made my skin feel plump and hydrated. I can’t speak on long term results because it was a mini product but the short term were great. I definitely recommend this especially if you have dry skin. I love that I could replace my toner and essence with 1 product. Give it a try. You won’t be disappointed. Hydrating Toner Essence
