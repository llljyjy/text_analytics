I received a sample size for free from Influenster in exchange for this review. This eye super charged gel crème feels really nice going on. It is a bit thick but doesn’t feel too sticky when applied under the eye area. I used it only in the PM and in the morning the area under my eyes would feel a bit tighter and my little eye wrinkles from squinting were less prominent. It has a strong scent like oranges in the tub, but not on the skin. This eye cream does not have a long shelf life after opening only 6 months, and the price is expensive for the quantity. A little does go a long way, but I don’t think I could commit to ever buying the full size for the price. If your concern is wrinkles though this may be worth it. I think with consistent use you could definitely see a difference. The packaging is recyclable as well as the packaging of the full size sold here which is nice. It definitely brightened my dark circles, but it wasn’t an extremely dramatic difference. I recently had a very bad reaction to an eye cream with retinol in it and so I was nervous to try any other eye product, but this one gave me no irritation at all and kept my under eye area hydrated enough. I don’t know if this would work really well under concealer though since it is working on those lines and wrinkles I would recommend only using it at night as a more intense eye treatment personally. Overall if you can snag a sample size and try it for yourself before buying the full size I’d recommend it! Good for wrinkles
