I absolutely love the texture of this eye cream it is like no other eye product I have tried before. Over the past few weeks of using I have definitely noticed a difference in the dark circles under my eyes which is great. The only down fall is if you have sensitive eyes this may cause them to tear up upon application. Otherwise I liked the product! Be careful
