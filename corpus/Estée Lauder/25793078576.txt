This is the first time using an eye cream. I have always just used a facial lotion on my face and my eyes. I received this product to try and why have I never used an eye cream or heard how very different it is compared to a regular lotion. It was lovely so very smooth and delicate. I loved how it softened my eye area and how it plumped up my skin where I unfortunately have a bit of crows feet starting. Within a week I noticed my little fine lines softening and not looking so deep. Iâ€™m going to keep applying it nightly and wait to see the results of using long term. I also was concerned the eye cream was going to melt into my eyes and make them uncomfortable with itching or just uncomfortable so I was pleasantly surprised that did not happen. I recommend this eye cream highly. Estee Lauder makes amazing makeup products that I have always loved and now I can add the eye cream to my list of my favorite products to use long term. Highly recommend.I received this product free for testing purposes. Lovely soft gel cream.
