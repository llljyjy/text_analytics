So I got this product through influenster free in exchange for my honest review. Here’s what have to say about it. This is a nice moisturizer that doesn’t leave an oily residue when you apply it. It blends into the skin nicely and has a nice smell. The packaging is beautiful and id expect nothing less from Estee lauder. I dont really have anything negative to say about it except the price. I know this is a luxury brand so does the price surprise me....no! But is it practical....also no. Nice but $$$
