I finished up my 5 ml sample pot and have to say it was great to use. I truly enjoyed applying it twice a day. It kept my facial skin feeling hydrated without that heavy feeling. The formula is very unique and felt amazing. I did not see a big difference in my skin but at least felt good. Smooth and buttery with no greasy feeling
