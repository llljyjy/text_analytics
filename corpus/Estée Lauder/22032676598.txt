This moisturizer is a good option.  I received a free sample to test out and review from influenster. I am not sure of the long term impact but short term, I’ve had good results.  It’s a thicker formula so I found myself using a little more product but it’s a rich, hydrating formula. It is scented and isn’t my favorite scent (perfumed scent) but it does dissipate pretty quickly.  This works best when washed before each time you apply. I break out pretty easily but this didn’t break me out which is great. Solid choice
