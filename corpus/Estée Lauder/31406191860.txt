I received this product for free sample in exchange mi hones review. It leaves my skin soft, hydrated and fresh.  I have a dry skin and I had no negative reaction, no rash. It absorbs quickly, it is creamy and does not leave a white residue. The smell is not that strong but, it lasts for my sense of smell.  I use it with other samples of the same brand together they do a good job.  I would need more time of use to be able to obtain better results. The sample package is luxury. nan
