I recvd this product complimentary for my honest review from Influenster. I use serums and moisturizers more than most and I can say I nearly know them all. This one is for someone that doesn’t need a excess heavy type serum. If u need a light to medium Amt this very thin micro essence is perfect for a daily routine and I do see a slight improvement in my skin. I will say that though with the size of the sample it’s hard to notice a high difference as it just isn’t enough but I think for someone who uses essence every day this is def one worth trying. I have very sensitive skin and it did Not make me break out. I will also state it has a scent to it also. I found it pleasant but for the people out there who want there skin care items I scented, you won’t like this one. So all in all 4 of 5 stars. Very Nice! Very Good Addition to the Skin Care Routine!
