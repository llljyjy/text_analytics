This is a nice moisturizer.  It definitely does the job but maybe better for more mature skin.  I appreciate the SPF although I’d prefer a stronger rating like 30.  It’s also quite thick, so know that going in.  I would be more prone to use it during the winter when I need extra protection, as opposed to the summer when the weather doesn’t dry me out.  No major skin reactions.  It does have a strong cucumber scent, which is something to keep in mind. It’s a good moisturizer
