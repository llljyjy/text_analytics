I received a trial size of this product for free from Influenster and brand in exchange for my honest review. This is not the first essence I have used so comparing with the others, this product is not heavily perfumed. I appreciate this. The texture is very watery so the bottle is an issue with what I received. I hope the full size product is easier to use. With being a trial size I did not notice a difference with swapping out my existing essence. I might have with longer use. It goes on light and is not tacky on my skin so it can be used morning or night. It absorbs nicely. I had no breakouts while using so it does not appear to clog pores or cause a reaction in my semi sensitive skin. Nice essence with very light scent
