I received this product for free in order for my honest review. I’ve only been using this product for the last few weeks, but I haven’t noticed much of a change or difference (which may change over time with long term use). I have oily, break out prone skin and I usually use a light, fragrance free moisturizer. I find the scent of this product amazing and I love how it smells, but I don’t love how it leaves my skin after. It doesn’t absorb well and I feel greasy immediately after using it. I don’t think it makes my face feel hydrated - it just feels shiny and oily. I feel like there’s better products out there for less money. Just okay
