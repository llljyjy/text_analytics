I got a sample of this eye cream from influenster and I was so excited because I heard good things if their serum and was interested in trying a new eye cream. The feeling and finish of the eye cream is incredible! It’s such a soft texture and has a great satin feeling and finish on the skin. It applies as a satin matte that reminds of a really good primer. Overall, I didn’t notice of a difference compared to my other eye creams but just the experience with this is sample makes me interested to keep using it. Great finish!
