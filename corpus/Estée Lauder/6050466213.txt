I received a free sample of this cream from influenster in exchange for my honest review.The cream is lightly scented, it has a nice creamy texture and goes on smoothly. It is very Hydrating especially if you have dry skin. It kept my skin hydrated all day. The cream feels a little heavy at first but it absorbs quickly into your skin and doesn’t leave it looking or feeling greasy. Unfortunately the sample was small and there wasn’t enough product to use for a longer period of time therefore I cannot give my opinion on how this cream performs as far as anti aging. I will definitely purchase and continue to use this product and I do recommend it. Very Hydrating! Great for Dry skin!
