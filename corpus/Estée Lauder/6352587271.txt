I’m a big fan of Estée Lauder products, and this one is really nice. It’s very moisturizing, and sinks into the skin beautifully. It’s light weight and feels very cooling when applied. I very much enjoyed the consistency of it!  I incorporated it into my night time routine and it’s been great. Didn’t irritate my sensitive skin, and I felt like my skin looked more supple after using. Especially on my eye area. Once I finish this smaller one I’m looking into purchasing the large size! Very moisturizing
