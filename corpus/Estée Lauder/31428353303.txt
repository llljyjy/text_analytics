I received this free sample in exchange for my honest opinion. I used estee lauder products before and I really like this moisturizing cream, in particular, I like it, I have dry and sensitive skin, it does not irritate me and if it moisturizes my skin, it absorbs quickly and does not make me roll like others necessary in my routine
