I received this product for free and exchange my honest review. I love this new cream it is perfect for my combination skin and perfectly moisturizers and last all day. It is a thicker cream so I would prefer to use it during the winter, however, it didnâ€™t feel too heavy during the summer. The moisture lasted all day I would 100% recommend. Rich
