I received this product for free from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review. I loved how thick and smooth this moisturizer is but it wasn’t ideal for my skin type. I have combination skin and this was a little too hydrating which left my skin feeling greasy. Also, I didn’t notice a change the firmness of my skin but maybe I needed to use it for a longer period of time. Not worth the money for me. Not in love
