I was sent a sample size, 5ml jar from Influenster to reviw. The scent was not unpleasant and thankfully didn’t linger. The texture is a nice cream that absorbed into the skin well. I wore well under makeup during the day. I can’t honestly say it was enough of a sample to wow me. I had enough usage to get a true feel for the cream. Great product
