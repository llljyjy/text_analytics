Excellent Mosturizer for any age.  It has a very light scent and did not cause any skin irritation.  The creamy texture is pure luxury as it glides across the skin easily.  It wears very well under foundation and made my skin plump after only a few applications.  The Mosturizer made my skin appear well hydrated and smoothed my fine lines under my eyes.  I highly recommend this product even with the big price tag, it is worth it! The Best Moisturizer for Over 40 Year Olds
