While I’ve only been using this product (received complimentary for my honest review) for 2 weeks, I will say that it’s super hydrating. I’ve been using it more around my eyes, as I live in Colorado which is pretty dry. You really only need a TEENY smidge. Even less so with it still being hot out here. I think I would use more during the winter at night for a nice layer of hydration at night. Super hydrating
