I received a sample of this to try, which lasted me less than a week but was enough to become a fan of the soft floral scent and the richness of the formula. I don’t typically like heavier moisturizers but while this is rich, it didn’t feel heavy in and the pink hue of the cream gave me a little dew to my olive skin. I am certainly going to give this moisturizer another shot when I’m ready to buy a full size product! Feels rich, smells fab!
