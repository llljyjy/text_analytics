I received this product for free from Influenster and Estee Lauder in exchange for my honest review. I will admit I was skeptical at first because I received a small sample size not the full size as stated. However a little goes a long way with this product. I’ve used a pea size amount daily for almost two weeks around my eye area and there’s already a substantial difference. This product has a pleasant scent, goes on smoothly absorbing into my skin with zero greasy residue. As we age there are certain things we struggle with and fine lines and wrinkles are mine. I’m so impressed with the outcome I’ve received! My fine lines and wrinkles are almost nonexistent I love that this product contains hibiscus morning bloom, Moringa, cactus stem cell and hyaluronic acid which helps with collagen boosting and anti-aging. I absolutely recommend this product! Best anti-aging moisturizer
