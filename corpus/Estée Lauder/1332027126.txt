I’ve tried several things in this line now and I must say they are all really good. I wasn’t sure about this one because my under eyes are very dry and I like a thicker cream. This is definitely more of a gel consistency and it doesn’t feel hydrating to the touch. It’s deceiving though because it IS hydrating. I also think that after 2 weeks my under eyes appeared smoother. nan
