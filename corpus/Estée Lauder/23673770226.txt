I’ve been using this product for about 3 weeks now and can honestly say I am seeing positive results. My skin was starting to look so drab and was really dry but I actually look like I’m kind of alive lately. What’s not to love? The circles under my eyes aren’t so extreme and it’s like you almost can’t tell that I’m a walking zombie (mom of 2 babies under 2)  I will definitely be using this for as long as they make it. Absolutely love the results!
