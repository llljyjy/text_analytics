It’s a really lovely eye cream. Not too heavy, not too light. Honestly reminds me of the regular Advanced Night Repair Eye. I can’t really tell much difference. But it blends in like a dream and looks amazing under makeup. My eyes feel refreshed and moisturized. I can easily see myself buying more in the future. Has a Lovely Texture
