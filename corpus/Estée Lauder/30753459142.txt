I received a free sample of this product from Influenster and Esteelauder in exchange of my honest review. This eye cream is nice and smooth to apply. It’s pretty oily but feels nice on the eyelids. I’ve used it several times it is definitely hydrating but I didn’t notice much improvement in my dark circles but maybe I should have used it longer but again I only received a tiny sample. So I cannot recommend it or not recommend it. Nice hydrating eye cream
