I received this product complimentary from influenster in exchange for my honest review. Iâ€™m in 33 and I am starting to notice under eye darkness and slight puffiness. After using this product for three weeks my under eye is brighter and less puffy. It goes on smooth without any sticky residue is a big plus. There are some mornings were I wake up feeling a slight dryness under my eye lid if I place it too high. Otherwise it is a great eye cream and I wish it was a little cheaper. Awesome eye cream
