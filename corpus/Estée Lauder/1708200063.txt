I had received a complimentary sample of this product, to test, in exchange for my honest review. To start off, I’d like to say that the toner had been buying for yrs starting drying out my skin so much. I of course did not want to throw out such and expensive product, but even then, the serums I frequent, none of them were working , nor my water based moisturizer. Once I received this sample, I started to use it after applying my toner at night. This was a life and money saver! In the mornings I’d wake up glowing, and not in an oily way, but like radiant. I loved it even more because a little goes a long way! I literally dabbed the top and use just that on my whole (wide) face. The consistency is thick, and enriching. After a lot of thought, I think this may very well be worth the price. A New Must for My Routine!
