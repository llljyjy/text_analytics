I received a sample of this from Influenster. I think it has a pleasant smell, but might be too much for some people. It’s a nice moisturizer, but it didn’t make a noticeable difference for me as far as firming up my skin, etc. The good news is that it didn’t cause any breakouts on my sensitive skin, so might be something worth trying more of. It also feels lightweight on my skin. i might need more time (product) to see results since the sample provided was not enough to notice any differences in my skin. nan
