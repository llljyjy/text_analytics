I think one of my favorite things about this product is that it doesn’t take much at all to get the coverage you need. Just a dab and you’re completely covered. It glides on smooth and doesn’t leave a greasy feeling. I’m a few weeks into using it and I do feel like it is helping with the area around my eyes. Good stuff
