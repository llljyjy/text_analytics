I liked this moisturizer and it made my skin dewy and supple. However, it was a little too thick for me, especially during the summer months. Better for winter or very dry skin, probably. Overall very nice and smells good too!I received this product complimentary in exchange for a fair review. Very moisturizing, but too heavy for summer
