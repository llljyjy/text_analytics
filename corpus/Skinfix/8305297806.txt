Using this along with prescribed tretinoin, needed something to maintain and restore my moisture barrier and this does the job nicely. The niacinamide also works well with tretinoin to brighten uneven skin tone and minimize pores. I also love the packaging, it keeps the product bacteria free. Works perfectly with tretinoin
