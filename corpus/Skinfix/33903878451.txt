I was very happy with the result of the cleanser.  I have oily skin, but when I use products for oily skin it makes my skin so dry that in winter it dries out a lot and cracks.  but this cleanser is just right, it helps with oiliness without drying my skin.  I use it twice a day, morning and night.  Another very positive point is that they donâ€™t test on animals. nan
