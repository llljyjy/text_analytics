I’ve literally spent so much money trying so many different moisturizers from high-end to drugstore and everything has always made me break out or clogged my pores. Like literally everything! I was ready to give up and just say forget it with moisturizer because I couldn’t find anything to work for me. The sweetest employee at Sephora in Peterborough (Canada), was telling me about her skin troubles and was so understanding with mine. She recommended this product and I decided I had nothing to lose. I’m literally so thankful I gave this a chance. My skin is glowing and no breakouts. This doesn’t make me oily or cause any irritation. I wish I remembered this employee’s name because seriously, she was so kind and helpful. I won’t use any other brands of skincare other than skinfix now because I truly trust this brand. If you suffer from sensitive/acne prone skin, please try this! It’s truly a game changer and I will never use anything else.  Skinfix is in my opinion, worth every single penny.  I will continue to use their other products as well. Hope this helps anyone struggling with their skin! Xx RUN DON’T WALK
