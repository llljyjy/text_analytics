I love this brand so I was excited to try this product and see how well it works. I had a small hormonal breakout a while ago and was able to put this to the test! This absorbs quickly and did not dry out my skin. Although it does not eliminate blemishes, it sure sped up the process and they were gone in two days. It usually takes me a whole week. I would recommend this to friends for sure. nan
