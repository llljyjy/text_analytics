I was a bit weary on trying this line as some other reviews stated their skin broke out with white tiny bumps. Thankfully, that wasn’t the case for me. I’ve been using the skin fix cleanser, ytp toner, glow recipes watermelon serum and this moisturizer for my skin care routine. And let me tell you within only 4 days of using these products almost all of my mask acne on my chin is cleared up. I was pleasantly surprised to see how fast it helped my skin clear up. I’m so happy I found a regime that works for me. Especially having oily skin I find it harder to find skin care products that doesn’t overly dry your skin causing you to break out or something so moisturizing that it clogs your pores. Definitely a winner here! I also love the gel texture and pump bottle so I’m not wasting product or putting my fingers in the jar causing bacteria build up. Love it
