I got this bc it is a clean formula that is fungal acne safe however I have combo skin that’s drier in the winter and this isn’t helping that much at all. I’m still dry after using it. Definitely would be better in the summer as a light moisturizer. Would only suggest for oily skin types Better for summer/ oily skin
