I’m a huge lover of SkinFix products. I use the oil cleanser and the eye cream every night. That being said, I was very disappointed with this specific product. I didn’t find it to feel very nice at all and the smell wasn’t  great. It made my skin sting and didn’t feel at all hydrating. Sad to say o would not recommend it nan
