This past weekend, I flew to Calgary to visit my sister. I went from the humidity of lower mainland BC to the dryness of Alberta. Due to air travel restrictions on toiletry sizes, I took several samples from another product line that I hadn’t tried before. Their retinol serum KILLED my skin. It was rough, dry, and sore. I went to the nearest Sephora store and got this product. It’s amazing! I applied it twice the first day, noticing my skin already felt better by the second application, and have been using it daily since. My skin feels wonderful - smooth and soft. Although there’s a slight odour I don’t care for when first taking product out of the tub, it disappears nearly instantly, so I didn’t remove a star, even though I’m sensitive when it comes to how a product smells. This product worked miracles for me. I can’t praise it enough. This saved my skin!
