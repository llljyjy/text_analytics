A clean cleanser! This contains salicylic acid, niacinamide, and azelaic acid which targets my acne. With the weather getting warmer, my skin definitely takes a toll with the change, and this has definitely helped. Less acne pop ups making my skin clearer. I’ve been using this as a daily cleanser and so far, it’s been treating my skin well. Haven’t seen any progress as far as minimizing pores but I’ll definitely continue using it. nan
