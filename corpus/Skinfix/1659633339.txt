Give me all of the hyaluronic acid please!!! Somehow in my mid-30s, I’m finding myself battling two issues: skin that looks super dehydrated, and random breakouts that I haven’t seen since my early teens. This product specifically helps with both my issues. The consistency is super cool and gets absorbed very easily into my skin. I also love that Skinfix is cruelty free and vegan :) nan
