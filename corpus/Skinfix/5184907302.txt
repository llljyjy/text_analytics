This moisturizer is great for dry skin or for winter time! I love that you pump the product out because it keeps your product cleaner since you’re not dipping your finger in but I’m not sure how much product gets left behind when you’re almost done. I’m not really a fan of the scent (it has a strong no scent scent iykyk) but it goes away after a while. nan
