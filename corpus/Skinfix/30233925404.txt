Great moisturizer! Not too heavy but very hydrating! I saw DermDr on TikTok rave about it. I ended up watching some of his YouTube videos, that he does with another dermatologist, and saw it was a product he really liked (not just an advertisement thing). I bought it and Iâ€™m glad I did! Most used out of my moisturizer collection!
