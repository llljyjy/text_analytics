I have been struggling with eczema and have very dry skin for past 5-6 years. Even when it disappears, I have to have something to prevent it, in case it comes back and starts spreading to different parts of my body. I am glad, that I got this Barrier+ Skin Barrier Restoring Gel Cream and looking forward to see great results Complimentary from Skinfix nan
