It sucks seeing so many negative reviews! I really like this product. It seems expensive but I only use them once or twice a week and they are lasting me a long time, plus the pads are big enough you can cut them in half. They are great for body acne as well. I have very sensitive skin and I have had no reaction to these. They have visibly helped smooth my skin, diminish dark spots and pores, especially on my nose. The only con is how awful they smell at first, this is normal (I almost took them back because it was so bad). I assume it is the witchhazel, but the scent calms down as you use them/air the jar out (or you just get used to it!). I have had the pads for several months now and they are still super wet, I havenâ€™t experienced any drying or discoloration issues. Give them a try!!
