I tried this every night for 2 weeks and woke up feeling like I just dipped myself in a bowl of oil every morning. Not sure if this cream did anything (or even absorbed into my skin) besides breaking me out. I bought this product after reading the reviews, but I do not recommend this for dehydrated oily, acne-prone skin. I rather stick with my Dr. Jart+ Ceramidin Cream. nan
