I really like this serum!! After I wash my face it helps bring back the glow. The texture of this serum is legit so smooth and perfect and makes my face feel refreshed after my skincare routine. It also has already helped reduce a pretty bad hormonal breakout I’ve been having. This is the first collagen serum product I’ve tried but I’m a huge fan already and highly recommend! Skin so smooth and hydrated!!!
