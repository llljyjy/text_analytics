The complains about this products leaving the skin “oily“ I think are counter-productive. That’s what this product is supposed to do: create a barrier. And water won’t do that. So y’all played yourselves.I use a hydrating serum then seal everything in with this cream. It has worked a charm for me, considering I use retinol, vitamin C and BHA regularly. It’s a literal balm for my skin. Makes me comfortable and my forehead and nose not too greasy by the end of day. I understand though, that $70CAD is tew daymn mooch moneii, but for the winter here? Something protective like this is a must. Love the comfort
