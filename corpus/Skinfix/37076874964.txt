I suffer from a really dry t-zone, hair line and eye lids. I get pretty bad eczema flakes and my skin will turn pink and feel raw. Looking for a product that helps it instead of making it worse has been tough. This Skinfix Eczema+ Dermatitis Face Balm has been amazing on all my eczema prone patches. This is a balm, so it will have that almost greasy balm texture, but doesn’t leave my skin looking shiny or oily at all. Skin fix is amazing, their packaging is made from 100% recycled paper and they use vegetable based inks. Talk about green friendly! I love that their products are ophthalmologist tested and recommended by unbiased dermatologists. Their ingredients are great, containing colloidal oat, shea butter, jojoba and almond oil, and always free from gluten, parabens, preservatives, fragrance, silicones, all those nasty ingredients we don’t want in our products. What I love most about this Skinfix Dermatitis Face Balm is that it is safe for use around eyes and on lids. My most prominent eczema symptoms are are around my eyes and lids, this has helped so much and hasn’t irritated one bit. I’ve even been able to use this concentrated balm in my toddlers sensitive skin and eczema without any sensitivity issues. It is a truly wonderful eczema product! Safe For Around Eyes & Lids
