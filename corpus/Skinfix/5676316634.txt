No matter what I always get a couple pimples on my chin and they are extremely stubborn. Looked at the ingredient list for this and loved what I saw so thought I’d give it a try. When I tell you I put this on at night right after cleansing, let it dry a little and went to bed. The next morning my pimple was dramatically less red and big. It was hardly noticeable. What I especially loved is they it didn’t dry my skin in that area out and I have no reaction on the area that the pimple wasn’t on. This is a game changer, absolutely recommend. Game changer for pimples!
