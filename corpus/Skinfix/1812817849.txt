It’s not that this is a bad product but the formula and way the product feels or absorbs is nothing groundbreaking. It’s nearly identical to one of my drugstore favorites, the only difference is the price. It’s fairly lightweight, absorbs well, sits nicely over other serums, and sits well under makeup and spf. I’ve had no issues with pilling, it is hydrating without being oily(I have dry skin and use Tretinoin), and was just fine as a daytime moisturizer. I just can’t justify the price when I have other moisturizers that work just as well. Nice but nothing special.
