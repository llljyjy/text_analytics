Unfortunately this breaks me out in whiteheads. I’ve tried it off and on for a year trying to experiment since it has such great reviews. To me (combo skin, oily t-zone), it is very greasy. I give it two stars because I guess if you have VERY dry skin and absolutely no oil or you really messed up your skin barrier, this could be useful. I keep it around to use if my elbows/heels get dry. Would’ve returned but I waited too long. What a shame. Oily/Combo Skin Beware
