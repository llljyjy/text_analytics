I have had this cleanser for several days now and have been using it every day. It has been really great so far. I love how easy it is to wash off your face (unlike some oil-based cleansers) and I love that it is not too drying either. I have some acne and acne scars on my chin, but they have not cleared out yet, but I am hoping that after some consistent use of the product those will clear out as well. I am honestly impressed by this product and will defiitely buy it again. Really nice everyday cleanser!!
