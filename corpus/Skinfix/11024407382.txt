I prefer Tata Harpers clarifying cleanser. Going to return this and repurchase hers. Wanted to try this due to reviews, and it’s a lot cheaper. But this wasn’t as potent. I had no brightening, or clearing of pores with this. After using Tatas AHA/BHA cleanser my skin is NOTICEABLY brighter, clearer, and glowing. It’s just worth it to get what actually works. not as good
