Since the beginning of the pandemic and the introduction of frequent mask wearing I have struggled with perioral dermatitis. Over the past 2 years I have tried half a dozen face creams looking for one gentle enough to not cause flare ups, but also strong enough to moisturize my dry skin and help combat signs of aging. This cream has been my miracle. My skin looks the best itâ€™s looked since prepandemic and feels so soft. Yes, the smell is not great, but I could not care less based off how good my skin looks. So thankful to have found this after feeling so discouraged over the past 2 years nan
