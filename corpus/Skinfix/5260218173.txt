I have never tried Skinfix, but I’m So excited that they have put 4 Holy Grail products together to create the Barrier Besties Kit! I have Sensitive Skin, and I’m so happy to say that my skin hasn’t had any irritations or breakouts. This kit has left me with Moisturized, Nourished and Clear skin at 41 years old! I really like the Oil Cleanser as it easily removes my long lasting mascara and liquid eyeliner without irritating my contacts! Yes!
