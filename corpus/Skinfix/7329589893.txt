So I deal with hormonal acne thanks to my monthly visitor and it’s like clockwork and I notice I also get random breakouts in areas I unconsciously touch my face often (specifically my chin area).  I used this cream and all I can say is wow! I felt a pimple coming in one day and I put this on the area and it was almost gone when I woke up the next morning! It has a creamy like texture which threw me off because I’m used to like a gel or serum like consistency but I loved how it felt on my skin! I personally think it’s worth the money too since a little does go a long way! Overnight results!
