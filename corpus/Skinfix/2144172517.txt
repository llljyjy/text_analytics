I was looking for a plain/simple type of moisturizer, so I picked this one.  I wasn’t super impressed with it, although I will say that if your skin is irritated in any way (redness/dryness, etc.) this is good to use because it doesn’t further irritate the skin.  I feel the Inn Beauty slushy serum and next level moisturizer work way better. Just Meh
