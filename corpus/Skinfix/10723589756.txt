Really like this brand and the ingredients in this product. Like other reviewers have stated, I’ve found that this cleanser doesn’t lather well unless you double cleanse. I used for a month and did see some improvement, but not sure if other products in my routine contributed more. Also, the packaging is so wasteful. Skinfix please make this cleanser in bar form! It's pretty good
