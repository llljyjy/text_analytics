I was looking for a new facial cleanser after running out and I’m so glad I was able to find this! I have sensitive dry skin and I have dermatitis. When I was looking around the store browsing, a salesperson assisted me and showed me this product. She explained that she had similar issues with her skin and that after using this product she saw a drastic difference in her face. While it was pricier than my drugstore Cera Ve face wash, I splurged and bought it. I was sick of how fast my skin dried out and how I was applying a moisturizer every two hours to prevent flakey skin. Shockingly, after even one use I noticed that my face didn’t feel tight and I didn’t feel the urge to run to my heavy-duty moisturizer. I’ve been using it for a week now and I don’t have flakey skin. (to be fair, the flaking skin is specifically around and under my nose, not all over my face) In fact, after using it for two days I already noticed that my face wasn’t as red and that the skin around my nose wasn’t flaking. Overall, I’m thoroughly impressed and will continue buying this product! For the Dry and Sensitive Skin Girlies!!!
