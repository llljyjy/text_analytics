I wanted to love this eye cream since I love Skinfix Barrier+ line, but unfortunately this didn’t work for my skin. I used it for about two months and I started getting red, tiny bumps all over my under eye area. They weren’t itchy or painful so that often means whatever you’re using is too hydrating and/or heavy for you. I can definitely see it working for people with dry skin around their eyes. I also didn’t see a difference with fine lines. Not for sensitive/oily combination skin
