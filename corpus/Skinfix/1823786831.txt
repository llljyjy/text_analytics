I was intrigued to try this gel moisturizer version of skinfix barrier. I have dry skin so I definitely prefer original cream version over this.Regardless this is a great moisturizer. Loved the light refreshing texture of it and great addition is Niacinamide in it. Great for acne prone skin.Packaging is same as the original. nan
