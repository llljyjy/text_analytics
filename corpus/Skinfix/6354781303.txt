I had purchased this product on impulse after watching a YouTube vid. After purchasing I decided to read the reviews (completely backwards). After reading the reviews I instantly started to regretted seeing people say they haven’t seen result and that the product was dry. With that being said I’m glad those reviews didn’t stop me from trying the product. I will admit the first 10-12 wipes were not too saturated they did the job. A little goes a long way which is why I think the product is made the way it was. As you get to the middle area it is slightly more saturated to the point where half can be applied to the entire face. I love the results I’ve seen in the past 15 days I’ve been using it. Genuinely see a difference in my face. Dark spots have faded (still there but much lighter), I had a pimple after using the product pimple shrunk dramatically basically gone, and I see a nice natural brightness/glow. I will be repurchasing and definitely recommend but as the title says judge for yourself if you’re thinking about this product. Judge for yourself
