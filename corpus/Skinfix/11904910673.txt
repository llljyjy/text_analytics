This moisturizer has a nice gel-cream consistency, which I think would be great for those with oilier skin! It’s pretty lightweight and sinks in easily, but I personally don’t enjoy the scent too much. May not be moisturizing enough for drier skin types, and even though I’m combination, I don’t think I’ll reach for this often until the summertime. Nice, hygienic packaging, but I feel like it’s quite pricey for a simple moisturizer. Ok gel-cream
