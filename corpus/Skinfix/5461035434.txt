I’m sad to see these reviews about the product because I really like this moisturizer. But, everyone’s skin just responds differently. I have sensitive and acne prone skin. I do visit my esthetician religiously, and use medicated curology serum w/tretinoin and clindamycin at night. These products along with the moisturizer don’t irritate my skin. And a little goes a long way with this moisturizer! I love the dispenser. I did experience some tingling in the beginning, but nothing major. It keeps my face well hydrated, but not too oily (I live in Hawaii), and my acne and pores have stayed at bay. I just wish they had a mini size like the other moisturizer for travel. Love this product !
