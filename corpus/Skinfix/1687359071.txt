I was so excited to get the Barrier Besties Kit since  this was my first time trying anything by SkinFix. The kit has everything you need for healthy skin - cleanser, serum, moisturizer and eye cream. The cleanser is gentle but removed all of my makeup, the serum left me looking hydrated and healthy, the moisturizer plumps up your skin so nicely and the eye cream helped calm my dark circles and puffiness. My favorite is the moisturizer because of its’ super light and airy feel in the jar and then insanely thick texture on your skin (in a good way!). I’d recommend this kit to anyone! Must have for everyone
