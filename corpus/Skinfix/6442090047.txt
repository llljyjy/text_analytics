I wanted to give this product at least a week to see if it truly worked, because obviously acne cleansers don’t work overnight, and I’m disappointed so far. I’ve been using this twice a day for about a week and have seen no change in my skin. My acne is still very much visibly and hasn’t really gone anywhere. I’m going to keep using it for another week and see if anything changes, but I’m disappointed. nan
