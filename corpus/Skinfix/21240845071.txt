I’ve used this product for a few months, and my complexion has seen such a positive improvement! This moisturizer is creamy, hydrating and feels luxurious. There is no scent, which is nice. I use it after washing my face, morning & night. My skin soaks up the moisture, leaving it supple and smooth. My only complaint is that I’ve never mastered the pump feature on the jar..! Luxurious & Effective !
