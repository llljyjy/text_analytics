Shewww okay so I get really bad hormonal acne when it’s close to my time of the month and nothing ever really helps because well… it’s all hormone based. This is an absolute game changer. For some reason this has actually helped lighten up those breakouts. I’ve been using it once sometimes twice a week to get my dry skin used to it and I’m so happy with it. nan
