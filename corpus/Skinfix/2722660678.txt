This Skinfix Triple lipid + Collagen serum is such a great addition to my routine. I always need something to help with my barrier and this has been very helpful in that. The serum is white and a little thicker than your normal serum. It helps my skin by keeping it moisturized and plump. The price might be a bit scary for some as itâ€™s $69 for 30 ml. Great ingredients
