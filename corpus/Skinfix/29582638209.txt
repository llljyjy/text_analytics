Though I like the texture of the product, there were a few overwhelming cons. The smell is bad, almost like cleaner product not in a good way. It also seems to make my face tight as it’s not hydrating enough, may be better for oily skin types. Lastly, within a day my face started getting small painful bumps, almost like irrational bumps not even acne. The ingredients in this aren’t my favorite… May want to skip this one.
