This spot treatment is my favorite that I’ve found and tried out so far! I love that they included Azelaic Acid as an ingredient in this spot treatment as well as the 2% BHA, because I feel like that just makes it extra effective and not only is it a treatment for existing blemishes, but it can also work to prevent possible new ones as well! The actual texture of the product is a white cream, kind of a similar consistency as a typical moisturizer cream, that rubs completely into the skin (so no white residue or anything is left after applying). I do feel like 0.5oz is a pretty small amount of product, but since it is a spot treatment, I guess I’m okay with it… would definitely recommend this as well as the Skinfix brand as a whole! Love Skinfix, BHA, & Azelaic Acid: all 3 combined‽
