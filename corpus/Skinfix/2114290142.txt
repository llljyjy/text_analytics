This has truly helped my skin retain moisture. Like most of the country, we had a horrible cold snap over Christmas and the humidity at our house was 20% even with humidifiers going. My skin *never* felt dehydrated or like it was dryer than normal and I attribute it to this product! And I don’t mean that it was greasy or anything but it is not at ALL, the texture is great and it goes in quickly, but my skin never felt like it was being shrink wrapped and it 100% would have last winter without this product. I don’t think it’s been long enough to see any wrinkle/fine line results yet but I love all of my other skinfix products so I am sure it will be up to standards. It has worker wonderfully so far and I will definitely repurchase! Amazing!
