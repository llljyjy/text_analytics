This stuff totally changed my skin. Occasionally I overdo it on the actives and it restores my skin barrier every time. I use it mostly at night but if I’m ever feeling dry in the morning, it layers beautifully under my tinted sunscreen. It is intensely moisturizing but not heavy- just give it a few minutes to fully absorb. Pro tip: don’t bother with the refill packs (they don’t actually fit the original pump) Perfection
