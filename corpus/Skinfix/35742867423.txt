Love the texture and consistency of this product. Been using it for a few weeks and can feel a massive difference. My skin feels super hydrated. Although I do feel like it has this odd smell. I’m not sure if it’s because of other products I use or just this. But as long as my skin feels and looks good I’m not complaining! nan
