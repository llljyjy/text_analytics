l bought this product because my skin can get extremely dry and crack in the winter but this just feels heavy and seems to be causing bumps on my skin, it does feel hydrating when you put it on but it can get greasy. I really wanted to love it but it just doesnâ€™t work for my skin. Not bad but not for me
