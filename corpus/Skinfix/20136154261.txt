As someone with oily/combo skin, I usually gravitate towards lightweight gel moisturizers so this was a product I was excited about. It did not disappoint - it’s lightweight yet very hydrating. Dries down to a natural finish, doesn’t leave my skin looking shiny or greasy. No noticeable scent either. I enjoy the pump as I find it to be more sanitary then a jar packaging! nan
