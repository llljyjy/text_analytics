I bought this moisturizer when I was being lazy with my routine and left a 3 star review. I finally used it day and night consistently for a month and noticed a huge difference in my skin, so much so that when I surprisingly ran out and started using a cheaper/different cream I had on deck my skin started breaking out and got noticeably dry again. Iâ€™m glad they came out with a larger tub because the 1.7 oz did run out pretty fast and although it is expensive it is worth it until I can find a cheaper dupe. I redact my previous 3-star rating
