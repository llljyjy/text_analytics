I have really enjoyed the Skinfix products I’ve tried - they are simple, never irritating, thoughtfully packaged, and effective. This cream is a great example of that. It is a lighter gel cream that has no fragrance and sinks into the skin really easily. I like the press pump, it helps get the product out without having to dip fingers into a jar. This is not sufficient for me in the winter because my skin is drier, but I can really see myself enjoying this on summer days when I don’t really need a heavy moisturizer. Overall, a great product to layer on other skincare for the sole purpose of barrier support and moisturizing. Lovely hydration with barrier support
