I usually have VERY oily skin but during the winter i get pretty dry skin. For its price I was expecting a lot more hydration. It was practically drugstore moisturizer in a more functional and hygienic container. I don’t know if it’s just mine but mine smelt bad. It genuinely smelt like a sweaty armpit. smelt bad and the quality of drugstore moisturizer
