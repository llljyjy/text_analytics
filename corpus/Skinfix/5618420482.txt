AMAZING. Only docking one star because I finished this in less than 2 weeks but it is a mini. I have combination-oily skin and this didn’t leave me too greasy. It was just the right amount of moisture and gentle enough for my sensitive skin. I can’t use too many moisturizers with my rosacea, but this was perfect. I ordered the full size already AMAZING
