Since using this serum, I noticed my skin looks very plump, clear, soft, and smooth!  It contains wonderful ingredients such as niacinamide, ceramides, and polyglutamic acid.  Polyglutamic acid is 4x stronger than Hyaluronic acid at retaining moisture! This is a perfect anti-aging serum or for anyone with dry skin in this cold season. I love pairing this with their triple lipid-peptide cream for the perfect glow. Goodbye dry and dull skin this winter! The one serum that does it all!
