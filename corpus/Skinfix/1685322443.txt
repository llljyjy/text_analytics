I have been using the Kiehlâ€™s 24h light hydration cream which I love but it is too heavy for the summers and I was noticing my skin was getting congested and oily. I was in the market for a fragrance free cream that was less heavy but also gave enough moisture for my combo skin. I tried manyyy different creams and this is the only one that feels very moisturizing while not causing any irritation or heaviness! And the ingredient list is simple + effective! Would definitely buy again. nan
