Iâ€™ve tried many different face wash from the cheap ones to expensive ones, and this is definitely my favorite so far. Since I moved to my new house, my forehead got so bumpy and always had acne which were super annoying. After using this face wash for like 3-4 days, I noticed that my skin looks and feels so much smoother.   You gotta give it a try !! nan
