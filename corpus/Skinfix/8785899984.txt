Ooooo yes! I use the triple lipid cream from Skinfux  and it’s one ofmy fave moisturizers! It’s so thick and feels like it really seals in my skin for the night (after using my serums!) but unfortunately it’s too a little thick for the day time… So I was super happy to try this gel cream! It’s perfect for day! I wear it under my SPF and it doesn’t feel like it’s too much on my skin!! nan
