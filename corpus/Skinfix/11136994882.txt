I had purchased the cream/container last year, used it up, and ordered the refill. Going 1 week without the cream (and having to use an alternative) was not fun. My skin became dry, tired, and less radiant. To my relief, after receiving my refill, my skin went back to normal. It is one of those products you donâ€™t realize makes a difference until you have to go an extended period of time without it. Highly recommend and great for sensitive skin. Bonus: In my opinion, it serves as a great primer. nan
