The Skinfix Barrier+ Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream is packed with 95% naturally-derived, nutrient dense cream with high concentration of active ingredients such seaweed hyaluronate and lily root. The container is pump dispenser, a small pump is more than enough for my combo skin. The cream is on a heavier side, it acts as a night cream for me. I feel that this cream would be great for colder weather to keep my skin nourish, hydrate and plump. The texture of the cream appears thick but glides on like a gel cream. The product have no scent. nan
