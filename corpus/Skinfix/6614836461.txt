Love this cream. I have combo skin and during winter, my canadian skin is so dry I have difficulty of putting on makeup. I have also redness and texture and i love purging my skin with this before bed. Worth the price. But, the pump has me screaming. The pump works every other time and the old cream freezes on the top and blocks the pump. I already had to clean it and I have had the jar for only 1 month. I was so excited to try this mechanism because I really like packagings that is different and innovative. But other than that, the cream is so good! very rich and full of goods ingredients. The cream you had been searching for
