While this cleanser is a bit expensive, I find that it’s really unique and there are not really any other cleansers like this on the market. The blend of active ingredients is amazing; this combines Azelaic Acid, Salicylic Acid, Niacinamide, and Glycolic Acid. This is honestly a great cleanser for someone looking to help fight breakouts and hyperpigmentation. It doesn’t leave me feeling dry or stripped, and I have dry skin. I like to use this as a 5 minute leave on mask in the shower on my face and body. I haven’t used it long enough to see dramatic results, but since I’ve started using I have not had many breakouts. Amazing Blend of Actives!!!
