The skin underneath and on the sides of my eyes have been irritated from allergies causing my eyes to water excessively and the water causing those places to dry out. My skin barrier has felt weaker especially in those areas so I wanted to see if this would help. My irritation has gone down and the skin on my face has overall felt more hydrated and healthier. I love that this gel is lightweight and not heavy. Iâ€™ve been using it both morning and night! nan
