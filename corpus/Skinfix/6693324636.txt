I really enjoyed using this serum for spot treating some blemishes that I’ve had it’s definitely been effective at reducing them. I like that this does not have a sent to it and the texture is nice and creamy. However I think this is quite expensive for the amount of product you’re getting. There are comparable serum’s on the market for about half the cost per ounce. Because of that I’m removing one star. Overall though this is very nice and definitely effective at reducing blemishes. Nice but expensive
