I wasn’t too keen on the price of this considering how tiny it is but omg does it work wonders! I get really dry eczema patches under my eyes every spring and fall and this stuff has saved me. A little goes a long way! I put on a tiny bit before bed and wake up and my dry patches are gone. It’s also helped with my lines as well! Amazing!
