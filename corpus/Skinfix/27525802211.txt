I have combo and acne prone skin and this set has been great! The cleanser was my least favorite out of all these products though. It was a little difficult to remove makeup with this, but it was very hydrating though. The eye cream worked great! I liked the packaging  because it made it easy to use. The hyaluronic acid product is a must have for those with dry skin because it felt almost like a lotion applying it, which I really liked! The cream was probably my favorite! I really liked the texture of it because it was very moisturizing, but it didn’t feel very heavy on my skin! I’d highly recommend this set! Perfect routine for those with sensitive skin!
