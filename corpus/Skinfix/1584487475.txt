This Barrier+ Skin Barrier Restoring Gel Cream from Skinfix is so refreshing!  I donâ€™t like the feeling of heavy creams on my skin during the warmer months, but my skin still needs hydration and this is just the product for that. It feels hydrating without the feeling greasy. It sinks into the skin nicely and I can apply makeup on top just fine. Huge bonus is the packaging! I hate digging my fingers into gel creams, so this kind of pump is perfect for that. Absolutely love this for the ingredients too! Hydrating and awesome packaging!
