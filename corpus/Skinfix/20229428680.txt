I use tretinoin at night along with Skinfix barrier cream and in the morning I use clyndamicin/benzoyl peroxide gel along with this gel moisturizer and it works wonders. My skin was very dry, peeling and irritated from my actives and no moisturizer was helping my skin until I started using skinfix barrier cream and gel moisturizer. Another problem I had with other moisturizers is that they would pill with my actives but not these two. Iâ€™m really happy I decided to give skinfix a try. I read some reviews that that this moisturizer feels heavy, I would say that if you have a barrier of dead skin cells your moisturizer gel or cream will feel heavy. I used to hate moisturizer for this same reason until I began using liquid exoliants (there are very gentle ones for those with sensitive skin) and hydrating my skin really good both inside and out. Hope this helps. Great Moisturizer!!
