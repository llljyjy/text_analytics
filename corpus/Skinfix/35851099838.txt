I’m currently on Accutane and was trying to find a product to calm my super sensitive/reactive/red face. I kept seeing this product everywhere and decided to bite the bullet and order the small/mini size, and I’m so glad I did. After only two nighttime applications (I find it too heavy for daytime) my face has severely calmed down. It’s les red and reactive and overall has more of an even glow. I feel moisturized for the first time in my whole life! I already ordered the full size and plan to use this forever, even once done my treatment. (I NEVER spend money on skincare. I don’t wear makeup and until recently only ever used Aveeno lotion on my face. I also don’t make very much money, but this is absolutely worth it, IMO. Holy grail product for me. Highly recommend.) Mini is smaller than expected. Buy the full size.
