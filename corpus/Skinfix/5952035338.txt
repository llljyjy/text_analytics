my skin doesnt LOVE products often but this was an instant winter holy grail for me. it gives my face the perfect moisturizing barrier without feeling like im suffocating when i need something on the heavier side. i have adult acne and this just helps so much when my skin goes dry at the same time as a breakout, without overwhelming my skin. would suggest to anyone who deals with any kind of dry skin at ALL nan
