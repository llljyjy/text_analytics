I was glad to see a few others mention the scent of this product because I thought I was going crazy given how many positive reviews there are. Despite being fragrance-free, it has such a mildewy smell to me when I apply/as it dries down. Thankfully it’s not noticeable beyond that or after I apply makeup, but it’s enough to make me look for a different product once this is out. Otherwise, it has a really nice lightweight texture and I like the packaging. Terrible scent
