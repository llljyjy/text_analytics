After repeat use my skin feels so soft and smooth, redness has decreased and so has dryness. When I wake in the morning my skin has a nice glow to it. Oh and I LOVE the pump, it keeps the product airtight and sanitary. Plus you can buy refills, how cool is that?! This is my second product from the brand and I am eager to try more! nan
