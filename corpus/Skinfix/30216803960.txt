I love the gentle-yet-effective ingredients in this that help to gently exfoliate And clear out clogged pores, without stripping and irritating my skin. After using this, the texture of my skin improved and it still felt soft and happy and not irritated the way it can with other exfoliating cleansers. I still have acne but this makes my face look and feel a little bit better and thatâ€™s all we can really ask for from a cleanser! Gentle and effective
