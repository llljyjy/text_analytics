excuse me while i take a trip to GLOW CITY when using this serum! as the winter gets colder, my skin needs extra love, and this serum takes my skin to where it needs to be— smooth and hydrated. the texture is luxurious, starting from cream and then smooths clear when rubbed in my skin. this serum works perfectly with my hyaluronic acid (which I use beforehand) and now takes place of my niacinamide serum since it already contains that ingredient. after my serum application, my skin feels glowy and plump, helping my creamy moisturizer to apply flawlessly. *such* a lovely product! i’m totally here for it!! new product in my skincare lineup!
