Anyone struggling with breakouts and using actives in skincare NEEDS this product. There may be others that are good but I can swear by this. I started using retinol on my fairly problem free skin and it just triggered this bad breakouts that wouldn’t go away. Clearly my skin barrier was an issue. I needed to continue to use actives after that to face the pimple marks etc, but wouldn’t have been able to do without this product. It’s an honest, unbiased, unpaid review. Anyone with acne prone skin can use it too. I use it at night before my active and very happy with it. honest review for acne prone skin
