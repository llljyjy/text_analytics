This cream became one of my go-to cream during winter. I don’t use this during summer, cause it does feel a bit heavy, but winter I end up using this as my daily moisture at night. I sometimes mix it with my foundation before putting on the make-up and it’ll help the foundation stick more flawlessly. nan
