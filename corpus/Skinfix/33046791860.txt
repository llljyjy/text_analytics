Holy grail!! I have combination+sensitive skin. I used Creams that are lightweight and perfumed and ended up having acne or red spots and zero moisturizing. But then I used Skinfix. It’s not as light but not too heavy as well and fragrance free. I was worried it’ll break me out but voila!!!!! My skin felt so nourished, soft and moisturized with no red spots. I’m definitely going to repurchase and not switch to anything else. And I love the pump too. Loved it!!!
