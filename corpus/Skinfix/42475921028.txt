I love this product, it has made my skin feel so soft and hydrated. I would recommend this if you have dry skin as it is a heavier moisturizer. But if you do have dry skin it is definitely worth the price. It feels lighter than the LaRosche Posay triple peptide moisturizer (which I had been using), but it makes my skin feel more moisturized. Great moisturizer for DRY skin
