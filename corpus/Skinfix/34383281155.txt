Let me preface with the fact that I have struggled with acne since early highschool (so about 8 years now), so trust me that I have used mannyyyyyy spot treatments: from drugstore to prescribed. This is one of the BEST that I have ever tried. I used it last night on a few spots and today they are not red at all and minimized so much. I am so tickled to have finally found a good spot treatment. Truly Works!
