I really like this moisturizer. I started a real skincare routine a few months ago with a solid cleanser, exfoliant, some serums and this moisturizer. I have tried several moisturizers over these months and this is my favorite one for my oily, acne-prone skin. This product does not make me greasy and it does not make me break out. It is also soothing on active breakouts. I like her!
