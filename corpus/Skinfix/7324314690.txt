I LOVE this moisturizer. It’s been a game-changer for me (I have combination skin). I like the concept of the pump, but it isn’t perfect. Sometimes nothing comes out, sometimes just a little bit does. It just makes it hard to tell how much you need to use each time. Also, you have to wipe the top pretty much daily to keep it uncontaminated. Small prices to pay for such a good product. Great stuff, worth the price
