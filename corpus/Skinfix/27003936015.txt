Skinfix never disappoints! I’ve been loving what this serum is doing for my skin, it’s a thicker serum with a cream/gel texture but soaks instantly into the skin, not heavy at all and layers beautifully with my other products! This is become my one of my favorites because of how calm, soothed, and hydrated my skin feels after using this! You can tell just on my hand with a before and after how soothed and hydrated it looks! Skinfix does it again!
