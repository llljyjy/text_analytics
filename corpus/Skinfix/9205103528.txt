This product is pretty effective, albeit drying. I have a few spots on my face right now that went down dramatically over night, but now they are really dry and flakey. I didn’t use that much product, but my acne spots are crusty even after following up with my best moisturizer. It’s not irritating otherwise! The product itself is a little runny and I wished it was creamier. effective but drying
