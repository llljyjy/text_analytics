I really like the SkinFix Barrier Niacinamide Restoring Gel Cream. It is a hybrid of a gel and cream and it goes on smooth without any pilling. My skin is combination and gets oily on my t-zone. Iâ€™ve noticed a decrease in how shiny I get towards the end of the day. The formula feels great and my skin feels ultra hydrated. nan
