I absolutely love this brand and product! It’s Light on my skin which is great! I also love how this helps to Improve skin-barrier function and provides intense, long-lasting hydration! This lightweight gel cream is more than a moisturizer; it restores, strengthens, balances and protects all skin types – even oily, blemish and fungal acne-prone skin. So Good!!
