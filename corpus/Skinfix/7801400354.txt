It’s without a doubt a good moisturizer. Thick and moisturizing, absorbs quickly and doesn’t sit on skin. There is no fragrance but there is a smell, and it smells like… medicine? Herbs?? Tbh I would prefer a faint scent to cover the smell of the product. It doesn’t smell bad, I just personally don’t like it. I can’t say I noticed a difference in my skin after using the 15mL, but that could just be me. I might not restock but overall decent product with a slightly higher price point ($68/50mL), one star off for the smell and I just don’t love it, nothing else wrong really. not my fav but not bad either
