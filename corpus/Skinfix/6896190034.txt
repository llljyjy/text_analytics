I rarely get pimples but when I do it usually goes away with a pimple patch. This time however, I woke up with a really painful blind pimple. Since it was deep in the skin my pimple patches didn’t work. I was so grateful for this spot treatment. It worked immediately. I applied it a couple of times during the day and the pain went away by the next day. The size of the swelling diminished too. I am really happy to have found a clean and effective , non scented spot treatment that works immediately. It didn’t dry out my skin either. Works quick
