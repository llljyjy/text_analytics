Finally, a cleanser that doesn’t make my skin tight or flaky from striping down everything. It’s a very gentle and effective cleanser. Did not expect that, being an acne cleanser. My face tends to get red around my t-zone with cleansers but because this one doesn’t do that, that’s how I know its gentle and actually works better for me.I did notice a small improvement in my skin the very next day. So far, I love this cleanser! Gentle and effective!
