I have been using the regular moisturizer and love that SkinFix came out with the gel version! Love the fact that it contains 2%  Niacinamide which is an added bonus! Hydrating and makes my skin feel amazing! The packaging is made from recycled materials and container is spill proof which is a plus! Hydrating Moisturizer! Spill proof container!
