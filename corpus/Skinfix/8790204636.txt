I have always used a spot treatment for my acne since I was a teenager. I’m now late twenties and still get random breakouts. I decided to try a new spot treatment because as I get older, I am really trying to take better care of my skin and not use super harsh ingredients. I actually really liked this treatment! I put it on at night and left it on overnight and it did reduce the size of my breakout in one night! It also felt great on the skin and not as drying as other products I’ve tried. I would recommend this for anyone who suffers with breakouts. Love this spot treatment!
