stubbornly hoped to not love this because of the price - also because I used to buy skinfix in the drugstore (before Sephora carried it) for a *fraction* of the price for years. however I can’t lie, its great. dry skin + canadian winters = need for major, thick moisturization and this delivers. to make this last longer, I alternate it with the cerave thick cream (purple jar) which is similar consistency, but I do notice a difference in the morning when I’ve used the skinfix. i find myself reaching less for it in the summer, but deffffinitley keeping this in my rotation. love it
