This the BEST moisturizer I have tried in a long time and I’ve tried it all. I use this morning and night and it can be layered with other heavier moisturizers. I love putting it under my facial sunscreen as it’s a smooth base with no pilling. I use a lot of drying products for my acne and this stuff has worked wonders to help repair my barrier. Skinfix never fails me. I just wish I could buy an even larger size! Skinfix, please sell the refills for this product! nan
