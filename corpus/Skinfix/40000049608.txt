Iâ€™m usually a HUGE fan of skinfix. Their original lipid peptide cream is AMAZING! Was always so hydrating and made my skin smooth. I decided to get this gel formula because sometimes the peptide cream was too heavy for the mornings. This barrier skin gel cream BROKE ME OUT!!!! I got so much acne from this! My skin was absolutely clear until i started using this product!!! I was shocked at what this did to my skin. I went to sephora and returned this devil cream and exchanged it for the lipid peptide cream. My skin is back to normal now. DO NOT GET THIS!!!! I GOT 8 BIG PIMPLES FROM THIS!!!!!!! MY FACE WAS A MESS!!!!! I recommend the original peptide cream formula from skinfix not this!!!! IF YOU HAVE ACNE PRONE SKIN RUN FAR AWAY FROM THIS
