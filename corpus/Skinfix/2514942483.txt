I’ve tried many salicylic acid acne cleansers and this is one of the best. It has a gel-like texture with just a hint of grit that exfoliates and leaves my skin super soft. I’ve seen a huge reduction in my breakouts and the ones I do get only stick around for a couple of days. I also like that it isn’t too drying or irritating. Clearing and non-drying!
