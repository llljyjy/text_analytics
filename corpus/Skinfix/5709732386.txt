I have been hunting for a good cleanser, and this is it. My skin likes to bounce around, but even at 30 in still battling acne, blackheads, etc. I tend to be oily but I get flaky also. I use Belif make up cleaner first, then dermalogica scrub, and then this. It doesn’t get sudsy so it’s perfect to finish off a double cleanse if that’s your thing. Everything else used to strip my skin like crazy. Buy this now if you have acne problems! Perfect for adult acne
