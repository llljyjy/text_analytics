If you have dry, flaky and/or mature skin this serum would be a nice addition to your skincare routine. It has a lightweight almost lotion like texture. It has a lot of skin barrier repairing ingredients that will help soften and smooth your skin. Overall, I like this serum but itâ€™s quite pricey. Not a must have if you have oily or normal skin. nan
