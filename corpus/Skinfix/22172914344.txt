My biggest issue with this product is the packaging. Since it was my first time trying this product, I accidentally unscrewed the bottom part where you refill the product, instead of the cap for the pump top.  I spilled a ton of product onto the floor just because it was super easy for the refill pod to just pop out of place. Regarding the moisturizer itself, I did enjoy using it and it felt very moisturizing and definitely would be a winter staple for me, as I have very dry skin. nan
