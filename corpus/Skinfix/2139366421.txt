Im going to be completely honest as much as i wanted this to work for me it didnt. It is extremely thick and filled with oil ingredients which is a disaster for my acne prone skin. It does not dry down and leave an extremely oily film over my face. The whole night my face felt so oily and uncomfortable and i couldnt sleep. My face was also itchy and this happens when the pores are getting clogged and i wake up with acne. I can see this working for people with extremely dry skin who have trouble producing oils but its just not meant for oily skin, sensetive skin and acne prone skin. NO GO for oily, sensetive, acne prone skin
