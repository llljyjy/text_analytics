Usually Iâ€™m super skeptical because my skin is so very sensitive but this was instant relief to such dry sensitive skin I had from just having a baby. The cream is thick but absorbed without being oily, irritated or sticky. I highly recommend this as a investment for your skin and I usually have a real issue with most products but this was such a breathe of fresh air! A absolute must have!
