Skinfix is known for the richest and thickest cream to heal dryness. Skin Barrier Restoring Gel Cream is the lightest cream I’ve tried from Skinfix. It’s suitable for oily, blemish-prone, or sensitive skin looking for hydrating cream. I love the fact they have a press-down pump container. It’s so convenient to use.
