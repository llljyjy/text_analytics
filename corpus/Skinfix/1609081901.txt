This cream absolutely lives up to the hype. The texture is light and great under makeup but it somehow seriously delivers on moisture. I use the heavier peptide formulation at night, this in the day and the combo has blown any others out of the water. My skin is dehydrated and super sensitive with a T zone that gets oily and prone to clogged pores. I love this, not going back, worth the money. nan
