so i usually stick to one product but i started noticing that once my skin gets used to a cleanser for a couple months it stops working. so i need to change it up sometimes. i dont like to use anything with a fragrance so i saw this one and it got alot of good reviews . i have very oily skin so i like something foaming and hydrating at the same time so i thought this would be perfect . as soon as i started using this cleanser my skin got bumpy so i stopped using it and tried my cerave foaming cleanser for a week and the bumpiness went away. i tried the skinfix once again and little bumps came back. i had to stop using it . bumpy skin
