Love this spot treatment! The only downside is the package. Once the product is 60% empty it becomes a lot harder to get product out. When I thought it was empty I cut it open and there was a surprising amount of product left in the tube. I just scooped it into another container to use up because this is a pricey product. Will continue to buy as the product really works for me but I wish the packaging was different. nan
