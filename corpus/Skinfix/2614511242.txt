Omg I love this serum! I am definitely going to grab another one. This serum feels so nice on my skin and more importantly leaves my skin so smooth and plumper. I love the soft texture and how well my skin drinks it up. I just feel like I always need this. My skin looks hydrated. It has ceramide repairing properties and I love that! The ingredients are amazing and works well with my vitamin c and retinol. I definitely grab for this serum. Highly recommend. nan
