The perfect, light-yet-moisturizing feeling from a moisturizer! Itâ€™s a little more moisturizing than the other gel cream moisturizers you find at Sephora, but not in a bad way at all! It gives your skin the perfect amount of moisture and it sits well under makeup and SPF. It does not pill. Definitely recommend anyone who wants more moisture than a gel, but not greasy or heavy feeling like a cream. Fragrance free too. Perfect Gel Cream Texture!
