Pretty sure this *tiny* tube is just overpriced vaseline... did nothing more for me than vaseline does, and has the exact same texture and feel of vaseline. OK, I read the ingredients, I know that this isn’t petrolium jelly, but I wouldn’t be able to distinguish between the two things in a blind test and I think others should know what to expect LOL
