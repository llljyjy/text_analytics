I developed a dry patch in between my eyes rows and under my right eye and I’ve tried about 10 different products and nothing has been working until I found this product. It has an oily balmy texture and melts into my skin and my dry patches have since disappeared. Sometimes the areas still get a bit flaky but I’ll just throw this on whenever it’s feeling dry. I’ve tried it under make up and it just makes the face look very greasy. I would recommend using this before bed or on days you’re at home and not wearing make up! 12/10 recommend. saved my skin
