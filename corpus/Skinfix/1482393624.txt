This and the matching face wash are incredible. So worth giving it a shot. I didn’t love it right away, had to play around with it to figure out how it would work with my skin but now I’m having the best skin I’ve had in years. I use the face wash only 1x a day every day or every other day, the spot treatment I use every day or night. The spot treatment doesn’t work well under my makeup but it makes my skin look so good so I do use it during the day on my no-makeup days. I look matte and clear all day without feeling that uncomfortable tightness that mattifiers usually cause. This spot treatment brings my blemishes down fast and makes my rough patches peel off and stay soft, it also fades dark post-blemish scars! And it’s so gentle and non-drying! The texture is weird though - kind of pasty and it pills, so just spread a pea-sized amount around the face quickly before it dries and then don’t rub it after. I’ll never be without this! holy grail, must try
