1000% recommend. I have been suffering from cystic acne, eczema, super sensitive skin all at the same time on my face for months now and I from day one i felt a relief from all. My face looks less red, less sensitive and less acne breakouts. I hope it never stops selling!  I first used the other skinfix moisturizer and it was great but this one takes the price for my skin type. sensitive- acne prone
