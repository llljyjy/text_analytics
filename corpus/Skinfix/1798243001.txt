Barrier Besties Kit is such a nice way to try out multiple Skinfix products at the same time without breaking the bank. This kit contains everything you’ll need for a simplified skincare routine. A healthy skin barrier is so important and those products focus on deeply nourishing the skin and restoring the skin barrier. All of the products are great and work well together, but the Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream is amazing and is something I would definitely repurchase! I’ve been using it as part of my nightly skincare routine and ever since I started using it, I’ve been waking up to deeply moisturized and glowing skin. I also really enjoy using the Foaming Oil Cleanser. It is gentle, non stripping, and I’m obsessed with the creamy texture! Barrier Besties Kit is an excellent choice for anyone with dry and sensitive skin! A must have for those with dry or sensitive skin!
