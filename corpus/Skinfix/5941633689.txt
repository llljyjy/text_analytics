Ive been looking for a winter moisturizer and this skin barrier is my new favorite. It smoothes onto my face so nicely and the gel feels very cool. I have extremely textured and dry skin and this has been my savior throughout winter. It has niacinamide in it which is my favorite ingredient right now. Itâ€™s super lightweight as well. Lightweight!
