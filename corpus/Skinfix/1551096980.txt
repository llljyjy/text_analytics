I have incredibly dry skin, and this is the absolute best moisturizer I’ve found. I’ve sampled countless creams, and this is the only one that both sinks into my skin and also protects the barrier. With that said, the refills are a complete disaster; I couldn’t get the pod to fit and it broke the original tub. Amazing cream for dry skin. Don't buy refill pods
