I received this today and my review needed to be posted tomorrow so hopefully this first impression will help someone. The packaging is very nice and you donâ€™t have to pump the product forever to get it to come out. It smells pleasant and pretty soft/natural, not overly fragranced. Made my skin feel very soft and moisturized Also made my skin very glowy in a hydrating way, not over the top. Looking forward to using this tonight and for the next few weeks. first impressions
