New year means new fitness routine. While having to wear a mask while working out my skin has been going through it.  I definitely needed a cleanser with resurfacing power and the skinfix acne+ cleanser does just that. As a treatment cleanser the 2% BHA deep cleans my pores without stripping my skin and without harsh chemicals because this wash is also cruelty free and vegan. Tough on dirt but easy on skin
