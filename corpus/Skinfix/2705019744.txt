The Skinfix Skin Barrier Restoring Gel Cream is a lightweight moisturizer that’s super hydrating. I love that this moisturizer is free from harmful chemicals and is cruelty free. The packaging itself is great. I like that the container is a push top so it only dispenses the amount you need and helps keeps things hygienic. I found this moisturizer to be very light on my skin but very moisturizing. My skin didn’t feel dry or tight like it would with so many other lightweight moisturizers. This one actually keeps your skin hydrated. I highly recommend this moisturizer! nan
