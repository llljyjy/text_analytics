This is such a great cleanser for acne! I’m not sure why they have a sticker over the name calling it just 2% BHA cleanser (the whole appeal for me was the blend), but either way it works! It has a slew of great acne fighting and antibacterial ingredients, but also hydrating and repairing. A little goes a long way, it doesn’t strip too much, and it exfoliates gently! I will say -- it is powerful, I usually only use this in the morning! Best Cleanser for Acne hands down!
