I’m always looking for an acne cleanser with salicylic acid as well as a BHA, so I love that this combines both! This makes my skin really soft. It doesn’t have a strong scent to it which is nice. Definitely felt like my skin was smoother and breakouts were less intense after using for a few days. Great Cleanser
