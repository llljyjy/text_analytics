This has to be my favorite launch yet from Skinfix. Their cleanser is one of my favorites, and their AHA pads have been a godsend for dark spots and discoloration. But this serum is the absolute best for dry skin. It make my skin feel so hydrated and plump, which is precisely what I needed this winter. nan
