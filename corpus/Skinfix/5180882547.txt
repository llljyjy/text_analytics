I really love how it has kept my skin acne free, even during the times my skin would normally break out: a week before my period. I have oily skin but I feel it doesn’t overly dry my skin after cleansing my face. I’d definitely recommend this cleanser for those with acne prone/ oily skin! Great for acne prone/ oily skin!
