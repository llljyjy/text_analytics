Bought this product because the reviews were really good. I used it as a nighttime moisturizer and it was decent but the packaging was a little weird. I ran out in a month which is super unusual for moisturizer and for how little I used. Then I opened up the container and found that you actually get 1/4 of what it looks like you get. Never buying from this company again. This is an absolutely DISGUSTING ripoff for the price of $62 and is smaller than my actual travel size products. RIPOFF BEWARE
