Iâ€™ve been a fan of their barrier+ cream so I was very excited to hear they have launched a new serum. This serum is very moisturizing, which is awesome for winter. It also compliments the cream very well because they are both very nourishing. I get itchy skin often, and I find this serum (paired with the cream) really helped make my skin stronger and less sensitive.  Oh and I LOVE seeing that glow on my skin right after applying it. Another awesome product by Skinfix! nan
