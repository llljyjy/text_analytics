Good but not great. I’m 45 and need to use 2-3 pumps just for my face and neck as you need a lot of product to replicate the hydration of a product that sinks in more. If you’re not on the ‘almost hitting menopause and sky is still as a bone’ journey this could be an okay moisturizer but for the price it should be a knockout. nan
