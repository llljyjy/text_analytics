I love this face wash, I recently had breakouts and was looking for a cleanser to help with that and this was perfect! Even though it has salicylic acid, my face didnâ€™t feel dry after using this, usually, this is my biggest concern for a cleanser with SA. Overall I would recommend it to someone struggling with pimples or acne. good
