This is a nice moisturizer, but it’s not worth the cost.It did a nice job hydrating my skin overnight, but I didn’t notice anything remarkable that would make me want to repurchase this. Maybe this is better for someone with extremely dry skin, but I have combo skin that leans dry in the winter and this didn’t do anything that Vaseline couldn’t do. I think there are several drugstore options that are comparable if not better. It's just ok
