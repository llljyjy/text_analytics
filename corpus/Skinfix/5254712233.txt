After using Skinceuticals Triple lipid restore for a few years, I was hesitant to make the switch after being told this was a solid dupe for a fraction of the price. I used the whole jar of the 1.7oz (twice daily), and my skin felt moisturized and dewy. BUT when I went to order the refillable pod, it was unavailable... Sort of defeats the purpose of a refill with all that extra packaging waste. I bought the value size instead - figuring I liked it, and the pump was airless and more sanitary so the larger size should be great... right?Not so much. After using the new size for about a week or so, the pump has STOPPED working! I’ve done a bit of troubleshooting and nothing helped. It seems like the center piece has gotten jammed, and the push mechanism won’t move to release the cream... not sure what to do other than reach out to customer service.I’d say 5 stars for the actual product, 1 star for packaging. Great product, sub par packaging...
