Great concept but is just average. It’s great that it removes make up but you would definitely need a separate make up remover for your eyes which totally defeats it’s purpose. You would still need to use two clwanswrs to remove makeup and then also use a regular cleanser to remove the residue from the yw makeup remover.I would just get a balm or oil cleanser and then use a regular foaming wash. Great concept but average execution
