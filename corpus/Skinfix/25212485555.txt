To be honest, I didn’t have high hopes for this. Most spot treatments I’ve tried are either way too drying or just don’t work at all. This spot treatment is so gentle, yet effective. I put it on my entire chin (where my breakouts are) and it reduced the size and redness of my pimples overnight without any irritation. I’m obsessed! Gentle But So Effective!
