This Skinfix collagen serum really has help improve my skin. My skin isn’t sensitive to most skin care products so I didn’t have a problem with breakouts from using it.  My skin didn’t feel dry or over exfoliated. I only use it at night so that also could be the reason my skin took to it. But so for so good. nan
