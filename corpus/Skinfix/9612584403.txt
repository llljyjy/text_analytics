This wasnâ€™t as hydrating as I thought it would be unfortunately. Instead of making my skin feel deeply hydrated it felt like there was a silicone-y film on my skin and my dry skin was still flakey, even after reapplying 3 times a day! Soooo expensive for not a great moisturizer. I will be going back to my Farmacy honey halo, I just wanted to give this a try because of all the hype! BELOW AVERAGE
