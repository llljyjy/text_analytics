I’ve used a lot of acne cleansers and this is a GREAT ONE! It doesn’t make my skin feel tight or super dry after use. I’ve used hand creams from this brand before and since they are so hydrating, I expected this to be amazing too. And it was! If you have sensitive skin but are suffering from acne, I would definitely suggest you give this a try! Great for sensitive acne prone skin!
