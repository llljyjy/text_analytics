I love the serum so much. This is one of the most effective serums I have ever tried. I have tried many of these brand products and this is so far my absolute favorite. The serum is silky and very lightweight which I  absolutely love. It doesn’t clog my pores. It doesn’t clash with my make up either. The serum absorbs very fast. I would say it takes less than a minute to dry.  It’s not sticky at all. My skin was dull and very unhealthy looking before I started to use this serum.Once I started using it my skin transformed beautifully. Now my skin has a beautiful radiency and glow which I  absolutely love. Also my skin is very soft and looks plumper. I just love how this serum transforms my skin for the better. I find this amazing serum extremely hydrating and nutrient-dense. During winter months this serum is going to be absolutely useful as my skin needs extra love. During these cold and dry months, my skin needs  a potent  and nutrient dense serum exactly like this one. I cannot wait to see what this amazing serum will do to my skin after 6 months of usage. Also it must be noted that this is suitable for sensitive skin. Having sensitive skin for so long, I can only use number of products and this is definitely one of them. Give this one a try you will not be disappointed. nan
