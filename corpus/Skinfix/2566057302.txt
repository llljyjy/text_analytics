I have combination acne prone skin that leans more towards the dry side. I really loved this cleanser because it didnâ€™t leave my skin feeling stripped. I definitely saw an improvement in active acne on my face. I used this as the second step of my double cleanse and my face really did felt clean but also soft. Less Acne but without stripping the skin!
