Skinfix has been a stable in my skincare routine for a while now. This collagen serum is amazing , I apply it in the morning and at night . It keeps my skin super healthy , glowy, hydrated and it doesnâ€™t irritate or dries my skin like some serums I have used in the past.  Love love the texture dupery silky and smooth . This is so hydrating that if I use foundation it blends very nicely . The ingredients are so clean and amazing. This is an amazing serum to have especially for me living in one of the coldest state in US. I would definitely recommend this amazing collage serum to anyone wanting to have a great product for their skin Amazing Serum
