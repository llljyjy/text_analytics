I’ve been experiencing a lot more breakouts recently due to stress and maskne, you too? Ugh! I started using this product as a spot treatment and it does a pretty good job at speeding up the process, but where it really shines for me is to prevent future breakouts AND to also prevents pesky hyperpigmentation lingering around. I add a thin layer over my more troublesome areas on days I can just feel like I need some extra help and it’s been great! Great for maskne
