the absolute most amazing moisturizer I have ever used. Iâ€™ve been using clinique moisture surge for a year, and I just could not get rid of the little hard bumps on my forhead and my sibacseous filaments on my chin. I have been using this for a week and my forhead is smooth, my skin is brighter, acne scars have fade, and it even helps with those filaments. It is incredibly and I am never going back! best product I have ever used on my face
