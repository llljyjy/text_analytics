This is my favorite cleanser. Background: I’m 48, I use full strength prescription Tretinoin, which can make my skin flaky and dry. This is the only cleanser that’s effective enough to remove makeup and sunscreen without stripping my skin, and without the need for a double cleanse. Best cleanser for dry skin
