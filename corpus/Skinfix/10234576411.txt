This has to be the most perfect cleanser for my dry skin. I have always been a fan of cleansers that foam up cause they made me feel like I was cleaning my face. Then I found that cream cleansers where better for my dry skin but didn’t necessarily leave my face feeling clean. Then I found this cleansers it gives me that foaming clean feeling along with the hydrating cream cleanser it’s the best of both. nan
