I’ve been loving this cleanser! It’s been helping keep my acne at bay and it makes my skin super refreshed and clean with the 2% salicylic acid. It doesn’t make your skin feel squeaky clean which is great to keep the skin barrier healthy. I also love that it has 1% azelaic acid since it helps with acne and post acne marks! nan
