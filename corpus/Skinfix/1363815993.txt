I love this balm. I put a moisturizer underneath, such as a little extra swipe of my face cream on my lips first, and then this on top at night. This is great at sealing in moisture. If my lips are bone dry, I agree, itâ€™s not great alone, but with something hydrating underneath, this helps to heal and maintain the moisture. pair with moisturizer underneath
