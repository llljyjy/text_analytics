I liked the product. it’s veerrryy thick but I wanted that for winter. I know that with peptides to get full benefit you should use twice a day. This moisturizer didn’t last very long with twice daily usage (and I didn’t need much because it spreads nicely). Not worth the money in my opinion, though if it lasted longer or came with more product I’d purchase again. Doesn't last very long, but overall I liked it.
