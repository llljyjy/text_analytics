skinfix always does my dry, sensitized skin so good, but THIS!!!! THIS SERUM. WOW. a lot of the time, ceramide serums just feel like thin lotions to me — they’ll interfere with moisturizer and won’t sink in, often throwing off my routine for good. but this is truly so healing and protective. i use two pumps on damp skin (after a hydrating toner ofc) and let it sink in for a few seconds before layering on more hydration and it’s just divine. i’ve been using it for the last week or so and i have to say, my skin barrier is NOTICEABLY stronger. thank you once again, skinfix, for being a hero. ❤️ 10/10 A+ gold star y’all really OUTDID YOURSELVES
