As someone with combination skin, there’s a fine line between cleansers that are too stripping and ones that leave my face feeling not fully cleansed. I’m happy to say that this cleanser leaves my face feeling clean, but not like a desert.I should preface that I don’t break out very often, and I’m not dealing with any breakouts at the time of using this cleanser, so it’s hard to speak to its ability to treat my breakouts from a personal perspective. However, I was impressed by the ingredient list at this cleanser’s price point. It has a lot of my favorite ingredients, which I normally don’t stress about finding in a cleanser (definitely the least important ingredient step) but am able to find here. Salicylic Acid is of course, the tried and true for breakouts. Niacinimide is one of my all-time favorite actives for reducing the appearance of dark spots. Azelaic Acid is great for targeting more under the surface acne.Overall I would probably consider repurchasing if I needed to obtain a cleanser fast and didn’t want to put n the effort to get one shipped from overseas like I normally do. Those cleansers tend to be a little cheaper with similar actives. Solid Cleanser!
