I truly enjoy using this product and seeing my dark spots fade away.  I have sensitive skin & a lot facial hair that when I remove the hair my skin leaves a dark spot at the hair follicle.  I’m doing facial laser removal to get rid of the facial hair, and having been using this to combat the scarring that has occurred & honestly I’m so happy I’ve come across this. And for the black women, don’t worry this won’t bleach your skin, it will more even out your skin tone and fade the dark spots. Holy grail
