Skinfix is a clean skincare brand and this is what I like the most about it. Its vegan , cruelty free and ,fragrance free . The product is smooth and gets absorbed into the skin well without leaving any greasy residue. The consistency is more of cream than serum. After having used it for a week I feel my skin is more smooth ,plump and moisturized. It does not feel dry and patchy as it does during drier months. My skin absolutely loves this. My new favourite
