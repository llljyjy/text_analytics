I know itâ€™s not that common but if anyone else gets angular chelitis, this has really helped me when it occurs. I use this cleanser then IMMEDIATELY go in with blistex ointment and aquaphor on top. This cleanser also helps clear my hormonal breakouts without drying my skin. Helps angular chelitis and hormonal acne
