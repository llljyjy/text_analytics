This is the only brand I trust for my extremely sensitive and dry skin. Absolutely love the cream version and now this gel variant is my favorite for warmer weather. This sinks into my skin so beautifully and doesnâ€™t feel greasy at all. I would think this would work very well with combination and oily skin too. Need to try all products from this brand. Amazing formula and clean ingredients Great for sensitive skin! Fav brand
