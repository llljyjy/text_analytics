This cleanser makes me skin feel clean and refreshed. I have occasional cystic acne breakouts from hormonal changes, but this cleanser minimizes the appearance and helps prevent bad breakouts. Hormonal acne is typically quite hard for me to control, but because this cleanser includes 2% salicylic acid, 1% azelaic acid,  3% glycolic acid and 2% niacinamide, it treats my  post-acne hyperpigmentation and helps keep my acne minimal. It also contains green tea and zinc, which works to help calm any inflammation I may have. Absolutely Incredible Cleanser!
