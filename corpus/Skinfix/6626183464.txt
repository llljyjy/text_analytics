After about one week of use, I remember seeing my skin actually GLOW after cleansing and before adding moisturizer. I have now been using this cream for well over a year. I had incredibly dry, red, and sensitive skin. I still deal with hormonal breakouts as well as from medication, BUT my skin barrier has completely been repaired. I didn’t even believe in “repairing your skin barrier“ until I started using this. My skin no longer screams for hydration as soon as I wash my face. I can actually handle spot acne treatments now because this is so hydrating. The texture and little bumps all over my skin are completely gone with using this with the foaming oil face wash. I use both morning and night. It even gets me through harsh Midwest winters without the need for additional products. My skin actually gets a little oily now in the summer! I have SO many allergies to ingredients. This whole line is truly the only face products I can use without causing hives and irritation. Additional perk, makeup goes on beautifully over this. Holy grail, will never try anything else
