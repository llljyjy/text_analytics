Great cleanser! So glad I listened to the reviews and got this one. It worked really well to remove makeup and the bottle was really easy to use. A little went a long way with this one too which I appreciated because it was a bit pricey. Would definitely recommend this for anyone who wants a basic yet effective cleanser. Solid cleanser
