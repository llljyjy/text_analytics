I was gifted for the Skinfix Acne BHA cleanser and have been enjoying it so far! My skin concerns are currently dryness, clogged pores, and hormonal acne. After using this cleanser my face felt so refreshed and clean, there was no residue or any tightness. I think with repeated use I could easily implement this into my morning skincare routine. One thing to note is that there was a sticker on the bottle covering what seemed to be an old label. I am unsure if they switched formulas and havenâ€™t gotten new packaging yet but understandably so, supply chains are running slower. Just something to keep in mind! Enjoying so far
