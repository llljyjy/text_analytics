I have very reactive skin that gets inflamed whenever I use exfoliating products.  This moisturizer has been effective at calming down any residual redness on my face.  With its lightweight consistency and my skin being on the drier side, this has become my go-to morning moisturizer.  Especially in the winter, I need a thicker moisturizer like Skinfix’s Triple Lipid Peptide Cream for my skin to stay hydrated overnight.  However, I could definitely see those with combination or oily skin enjoying this moisturizer morning and night year-round.  It’s a perfect base under make-up because it’s not greasy or sticky so it doesn’t interfere with the formulas or with application and I don’t have to wait long for it to absorb.  It makes my skin look more even toned and less patchy and feel soothed and refreshed.  I wish all moisturizers had an airless pump like this one because it’s much more hygienic and helps preserve the ingredients inside.  With so many amazing ingredients like squalane, niacinamide, and peptides, this is a must try moisturizer for anyone with a damaged skin barrier! Reduces post-exfoliation redness
