i’m suuuuper happy that i picked up this cleanser. i have combo-dehydrated skin & while i love a good foaming gel cleanser most of them tend to leave me feeling tight & dry after washing them off, which is why i was super curious about this cleanser bc it claims to be a ‘foaming oil’. i’d say it’s more of a cream cleanser with a nice lather, but wowwww this cleanser is amazing!!! i use it nightly & have never once felt tight or dry afterwards. i really think this would work for any skin type & would last a really long time since you only need about 1 pump to get a good lather going.
