This gel cream was very enjoyable to use. It provides a good amount of hydration and skin felt nourished. This will be super beneficial in summer when skin gets more oily but requires nourishment. The packaging is a plus and I donâ€™t need to use a spatula. Knocking off 1 star because although It has a lightweight cream texture I felt a light layer sitting on top of my skin. Nice daily moisturizer
