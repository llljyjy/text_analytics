After using this product for 3 days the dermatitis on my eyelids and under eye skin appears to be back to normal.I was suffering from itchy skin that was red, irritated and flaking around my eyes. It was so irritated and itchy!! I have no idea why this started happening. Thank goodness I found this product. It has finally given me some relief and my skin looks healed. I hope it lasts!It does not sit under my make up very well (on their packaging it says it does). My foundation doesnâ€™t sit well under my eyes and collects visibly in the wrinkles under my eyes. Even my waterproof mascara started running- I suspect it is the petroleum in it.I considered only putting 4 stars because of the makeup thing but honestly the relief it has provided deserves 5 stars Has provided relief from mystery dermatitis
