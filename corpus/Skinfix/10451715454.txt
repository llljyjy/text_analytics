This is a very nice thin gel moisturizer. If you don’t like very creamy, oily or thick moisturizers, this is the one for you. It’s recommended for oily, blemish prone skin or combination + sensitive skin. It’s free from many irritants so sensitive skin might work with this. Great lightweight moisturizer
