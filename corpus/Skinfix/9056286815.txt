This cream made me break out with tiny pimples shortly after using it. It made my skin very red and itchy. I did not notice any moisturizing effects from using this cream. I am thinking that I may be sensitive to the concentration of niacinamide that is in this product. The packaging is good, I did like the method of dispensing. Sensitive Skin Beware
