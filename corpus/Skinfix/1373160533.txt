This all-around serum is good for any skin type, especially dryer or sensitive skin. It has some fantastic ingredients and supports collagen production and skin barrier health. It is lightweight but creamy and absorbs well. I like to use this in the morning to hydrate and protect my skin but I also enjoy it at night when I can pair it with an ’active’ such as Retinol or AHA  so that my skin doesn’t become sensitized or irritated.  This is a good serum for me in the colder weather and helps protect my face from the wind. I like that it is cruelty-free and vegan too. The packaging isn’t my favorite aesthetically but it is functional. Good Serum!
