received a complementary Skinfix Barrier Besties set in exchange for my honest review. I have thoroughly enjoyed using this set over the past few weeks. The kit is vegan and fragrance-free and is said to improve skin barrier function, increase hydration, improve firmness/elasticity and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. I found that all of these claims are true, and appreciate how much more hydrated and healthier looking my (dry) skin is because of these products. I like the small TSA-friendly packaging as well.Foaming oil cleanser - unlike many cleansers, this leaves my skin feeling cleansed without being stripped. Despite the formulation being sulfate-free, it lathers and applies beautifully. Triple Lipid-Boost 360° Eye cream - this hydrated and refreshed the skin around my eyes without causing any breakouts.Triple Lipid Hyaluronate Serum - I found this serum’s texture was slightly thicker (more like a face lotion) than many of the other serums I have used, but I nonetheless enjoyed it. It blends in and absorbs nicely into the skin, leaving it plumped and ready for a richer cream.Triple Lipid Peptide Cream - I love using this cream, especially at night! The formulation feels luxe when applied, but even more importantly, it makes my skin glow and helped improve the overall hydration/appearance/complexion of my face. nan
