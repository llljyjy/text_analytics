I just recently started to struggle with acne again….and I’m in my 40’s.  I went to the dermatologist first and received medicated creams but I felt like the side effects of irritated flacking skin out weighted the potential cease to the mild acne I was experiencing on my chin.  So receiving this cleanser as a gift from SkinFix was an absolute blessing.  The 2% BHA seems to be just the right amount to help reduce my breakouts but not cause my skin to freak out.  It’s gentle enough to use all over my face and doesn’t leave any reduce behind or leave my skin feeling tight and dried out.  Would absolutely suggest this to someone dealing with acne but also doesn’t want to deal with dry flacking skin. Great for acne and doesn’t cause dryness!
