Worth every penny. My second cold Canadian winter dealing with dermatitis mostly around my mouth and nose, and after trying so many creams, spot treatments, washes, medication, and methods to control it, none of them compares to what this product has done for my skin in a week! Sure, it seems pricey when you look at the tube size, but you need the absolute tiniest amount for the treatment area, and when I consider all the time/money/product wasted on what didnâ€™t work, this face balm is worth it. I also spray Tower 28 SOS mist on my face before I apply the balm - a match made in heaven. Perioral Dermatitis Dream
