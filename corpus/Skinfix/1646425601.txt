I have recently started using the Skinfix moisturizer and I’m loving it for these colder winter months. I was excited to try this correlating Skinfix serum. It has a nice fresh scent and lightweight texture.  After using it for the past week, my face is looking bright, smooth, even, and a bit more firm. It’s also doing a good job keeping my dry skin hydrated in this extra cold weather. Overall, a nice serum that I’m excited to keep using. I want to try more from this brand. SkinFix
