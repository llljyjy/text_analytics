I really like this cream! I have combination skin that tends to get dehydrated from time to time and this cream is very nice for my more oily days when I want something lightweight it has no fragrance in it which I love and it gives my skin a nice glow ✨ I wouldn’t recommend for drier skin types, you may not get the hydration you want from this but oily, normal, & combination skin types would love this!
