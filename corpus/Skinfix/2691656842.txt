I LOVE this face cream but the refill is truly impossible to use, unfortunately. If by some miracle you are able to get the refill on, you lose about half of the product in the process of screwing it back into the container. It’s incredibly frustrating to waste the money on a refill that simply does not work with the original packaging and it’s disappointing that Skinfix hasn’t addressed the issue, especially given how many brands make refills that are functional. I can’t believe Sephora hasn’t pulled this product yet. Read Before You Buy!!!!
