Writing this review after 1 days use of this product! I had a bad reaction to an eye cream which turned into topical dermatitis on my eyelid and under eyes. I tend to stray away from topical steroids so I thought I would give this product a shot and I am SHOCKED by the quick results! 24 hrs after and the itchiness is almost completely gone and the textured flare up has subsided. Still a bit of redness around the eyes, but Iâ€™m really happy with the first days results. I would definitely recommend for any kind of face dermatitis or allergic reactions. Amazed after 24 hours
