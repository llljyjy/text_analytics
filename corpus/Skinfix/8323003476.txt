I’ve been using skin fix products for over a year now and I love the way they’re designed for sensitive skin. I also love the packaging and textures. I have dry skin, this worked really well for me as a summer moisturizer. It works well when combined with other skincare, and layers well with makeup. I’ll be switching to their other moisturizer during the winter, but will come back to this one in the spring. One of my holy grail brands!
