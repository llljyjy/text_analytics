I took a chance on a new product and I absolutely love it so far! This cleanser is like a makeup balm, clay mask, and soap wash in one. It removes eye makeup like a dream, and without having to rub harshly. I wouldnâ€™t call it a foam, but it does lather. I have very oily skin and this leaves me feeling clean and dry without being dried out. It creates a nice canvas for serums. It does not feel irritating feels gentle enough to use every day. Perfect for Oily Skin!
