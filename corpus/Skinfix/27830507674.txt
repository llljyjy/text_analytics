My combo skin tends to feel dull and dry during the winter, and I love how this serum instantly makes my skin look and feel healthier and brighter. The texture of the serum feels smooth, it absorbs quickly and doesn’t interfere with other skincare products or makeup. I prefer to use the serum in the morning bc it’s very lightweight and keeps my skin feeling moisturized throughout the day. nan
