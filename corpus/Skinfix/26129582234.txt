My first impression is that I love the packaging. The pump helps save so much product and makes it where you can waste any extra. I have really sensitive skin so I’m always worried about products, this is amazing on my skin and doesn’t irritate me at all. It’s light weight, not greasy or oily. Soaks right into the skin. It also leaves my skin feeling so hydrated and soft which I love. Love it
