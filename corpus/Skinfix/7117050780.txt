First and foremost, this stuff smells like earwax. Yeah, I know, it’s weird. But it does, I promise you, and you will absolutely notice, because it lingers for ages and you can’t get it out of your head (or nose). Besides the horrific smell, this stuff just felt like it absolutely sat on top of my face. You know that weird stuffy cloggy feeling you get when you put on dimethicone based primers? I get that with this, but less slippery. Would give 0 stars if possible. Holy yuck. No thanks, nope, nope, nope.
