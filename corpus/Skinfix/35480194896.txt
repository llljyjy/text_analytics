literally cleared my skin so much when i paired it with the glow recipe watermelon toner and cetaphil gentle skin cleanser , def recommend but you have to really trust the process cuz it took like 3 months bc of me using too much for my skin but yeah please get it its so good and will prob work fast for u as long as you keep your skin routine short nan
