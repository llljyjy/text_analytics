This is the only product that has helped the eczema I get on my eyelids and under eye area! It works so well on all parts of the face while still being gentle and non-comedogenic so it doesn’t clog my pores or cause whiteheads or anything. I also haven’t gotten any milia around my eyes like some eye creams can cause. The dry flaky skin was gone almost immediately when I used this, then the redness after a day or too, and the swelling along with it. I can finally wear concealer without dry patches and eyeshadow without crazy swelling from the irritation. It feels so soothing, and won’t ruin your makeup as long as you wait for it to dry before applying… but I haven’t tried to layer it over the top of makeup yet so I’m not sure about that part. Basically, I cannot recommend this enough for sensitive/puffy/red/dry/flaky eczema eyes. It’s a tiny miracle that I’m always going to keep with me now. Holy grail product! Holy grail for eyelid eczema!
