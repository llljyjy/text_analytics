This cream is really nice, and a great value. I was a diehard Drunk Elephant Protini fan, and this is very similar. I like that it keeps my combo skin moisturized all day, feeling smooth, and I do feel my face looks more plump. I bought the 3oz - since it is the same price as a regular DE Protini bottle - a no brainer purchase. The 1.7oz lasted me 3 months! great price for value, and works!
