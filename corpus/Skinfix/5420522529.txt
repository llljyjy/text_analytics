This was my first time trying Skinfix and I’m glad I tried this cleanser. This product came in at the perfect time since I was suffering from some breakouts perhaps due to stress and a recent imbalanced diet. This has calmed some of the redness from those breakouts and has controlled any new blemishes from forming so far. This cleanser does not lather in case you prefer that but I enjoy it as it feel gentle and non-drying. It also doesn’t have an overpowering scent and last but not least I love that Skinfix is a clean, vegan and cruelty-free brand! nan
