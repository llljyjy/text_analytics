I purchased this for my teenage son who struggles with acne. He discovered this product after seeing it on tik tok. Like MANY others, when the product arrived it was different than originally stated and had a sticker covering it. I too am frustrated with this. SKINFIX should “fix“ this! It is very misleading to your consumers. Why the sticker?!
