This is a really nice set, especially to try out Skinfix products. The cleanser and the eye cream were most appealing. I love the lather the cleanser gives and the eye cream left my eyes super hydrated. The serum and the moisturizer were probably my least favorite. I didn’t feel that they really added the hydration I was looking for which I thought was weird because my skin is more combo and I felt like my skin was somewhat dry. I do recommend this set of you’ve been wanting to try their products! nan
