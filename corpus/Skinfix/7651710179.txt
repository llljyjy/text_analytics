As I’m getting older I’ve noticed more and more that my skin is going from oily to dry so I’ve had to change my skincare routine to suit this. It still has its oily moments so I have to be careful but I use and that it’s not too heavy. That’s why I’ve been really loving this serum. It’s a cream consistency that has really been helping add hydration back into my skin but it’s a thinner consistency and melts right in so I don’t have to worry about make up slipping and sliding. My skin looks and feels healthier as it helps repair my skin barrier. I love pairing this with exfoliating products as it’s not scented, non irritating, and those barrier boosting ingredients compliment it a lot (ceramides, polyglutamic acid, niacinamide). It’s like that cherry on top of the AHA sundae when paired together. Great for dry sensitive skin!
