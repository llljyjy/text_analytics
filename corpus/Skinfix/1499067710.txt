This kit is really the perfect way to explore what Skinfix products have to offer for almost every affected area of the body. Start with the foaming oil body wash for gentle cleansing and moisturizing. Targeted body balm is a thick cream to be applied to specific trouble areas that need extra attention. Dermatitis face balm helps soothe sensitive skin and reduce redness without adding a heavy greasy feeling. Thereâ€™s even a hand repair cream included which provides extra moisturizing and softening for hands and elbows. Natural ingredients, cruelty-free, and they work. I noticed my skin felt healthier and moisturized from the first use. Skinfix provided a complimentary sample to help facilitate my review, but my opinion of the product is unbiased. Thoughtful gift
