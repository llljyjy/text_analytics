This cleanser really helped clear my Malassezia folliculitis. I have combination skin that is prone to pore-clogging and breakouts, and a couple months ago I had a bad flare-up. I used this cleanser morning and night for a couple weeks, letting it sit on the skin a couple minutes before rinsing off. It cleared up my skin, but was very drying. Recommend using it only when needed, and be sure to follow up with really hydrating products! Works but is drying
