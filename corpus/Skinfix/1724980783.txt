I’ve been dealing with some hormonal acne for a few months now, so I was super excited to try this!  I used it a few times throughout the week on some spots, and while it took some time, I did see a difference in the appearances of my blemishes by the end of the week!  Basically dries out the pimple really well. A little goes a long way and it’s pretty effective if used correctly!  Definitely would recommend! Very effective!
