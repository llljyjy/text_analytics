These are fantastic exfoliating wipes… I use these when I don’t want to splurge on the ones sold from my dermatologist- and these work just as well, highly highly recommend if you’re trying to resurface your skin, you have some stubborn facial scarring that you want to get rid of, or just acne in general that you want to clear up! These are magic- but be diligent! nan
