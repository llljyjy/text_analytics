Overall, this is a great cleanser. Since I’ve been using it, I haven’t had any hormonal breakouts which is something that I’ve been struggling with for the past few years.  The only thing I wish I could change about the Skinfix cleanser is the texture. I wish it created more bubbles when I used it, similar to the Tula Cult Cleanser. Either way, I would recommend this to someone who struggles with acne. Just one thing ...
