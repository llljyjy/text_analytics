I adore the cream version of this, so I already had high hopes that this would be more suited for me when itâ€™s not the cold winter months. I love the gel texture. It still leaves my skin hydrated and moisturized, but it definitely has a lighter feel. I also love the dispenser as it keeps everything clean and hygienic. nan
