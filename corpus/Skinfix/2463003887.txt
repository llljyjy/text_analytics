I got this as an alternative to DE protini. I don’t notice a huge difference between the two to be honest. Sinks nicely into skin. Didn’t break me out and I’d like to think I have pretty sensitive skin. Not a heavy duty moisturizer though. I layer with a few drops of marula oil on the areas that get extra dry or I use DE lala. Works for the price point nan
