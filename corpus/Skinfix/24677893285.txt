I’ve been using this product for a few weeks now. It is very hydrating and thick which is great. Can be used as primer too because it’s thicker consistency and moisturizing effects. However, other than moisturizer, it does nothing else. I would not pay the price for the singular effect. Also, I find it irritates my eyes if I use too much product. I like to put my eye creams on my eyelids but can’t with this. I’ve only ever had this issue with this particular product. Moisturizing but that’s it…
