I’m shocked at the amount of bad reviews i am seeing of this product! Within my first 3 days of use I could already tell that my scars had lightened. My skin texture has noticeably improved and brightened as well! I also do not notice any “rancid“ smell about these pads as i have seen others complain about. I definitely DO think these are worth the price! I love the ingredients. Also, the pads aren’t meant to be dripping in product (as I have seen people complain about them being ’dry’)... they are definitely saturated with all the ingredients listed. I have struggled with my skin for the past 4 years and these have become a holy grail product in my skincare routine as I am finally reaching my skin goals!! - I highly recommend. Holy Grail!!!
