I suffer from occasional dermatitis flare ups around my eyes and have tried probably a dozen products to remedy my symptoms. Nothing has come close to working as well as this stuff. It doesn’t burn or irritate in the slightest and it immediately started smoothing the scaly patches around my eyes. I don’t think it truly heals the flare up, but rather, it provides a super moisturizing barrier around the skin so the body can heal itself. The dermatitis I have been fighting with for over a month has cleared up within less than a week while using this stuff. dermatitis gone within days!
