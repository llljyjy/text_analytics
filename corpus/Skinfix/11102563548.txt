This is just a more luxurious Cerave PM lotion. Texture is light and non clogging. There is no added fragrance but I hope others can agree that it smells like moldy towels or something that water has sat around in for a while. I threw out the box thinking that the scent would dissipate after a while but it doesn’t and now I’m stuck with a full sized container. Bad scent
