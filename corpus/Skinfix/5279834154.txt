Such a bummer. I had high hopes for this cream! I wanted to love it so bad that I continued to use it even though it was wrecking my skin. I didn’t want to believe it was the reason my skin was freaking out. I have normal to dry skin that is kinda sensitive. This felt like it sat on top of my skin and never absorbed, yet my skin on my forehead felt tight. I even reapplied throughout the day...my skin ended up flaky and red. my cheeks were super red and felt hot to the touch which has NEVER happened to me before. my forehead (which is where I usually have issues) broke out in tiny red itchy bumps. I am so disappointed...I’ll be returning it. But, I do use the face wash and so far I like that. Bummer
