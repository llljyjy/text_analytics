I have been suffering from horrible dry, itchy skin covering my chin and hive like reaction around my eyes. I’ve been dealing with it for months. My skin would burn and itch and I could constantly feel it. I take great care of my skin and only use oils and super hydrating things because it’s so sensitive and dry. I finally figured out that it’s probably eczema. I ordered this and after one use I noticed a bug difference. After two days, my skin was sooo much better. It’s been about 4 days now and my skin is almost healed. If you have super dry, eczema prone skin, don’t even hesitate to order this. I’m sure I’ll be ordering this on repeat!..also, I purchase items from Sephora all the time and this is the only review I’ve left. It truly did help!! nan
