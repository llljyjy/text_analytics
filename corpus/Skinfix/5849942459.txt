I love this cream. Feels so good on my sensitive hormonal acne prone skin and serves as a nice adjunct to retinol use. That being said, skip the refill. It doesn’t screw in to the container. You waste a ton of product trying to get it securely in the packaging and then you end up just leaving it out of the container so you can use it. Spend the extra $10 and waste the extra plastic for a new one. I’d return it if I had a Sephora near me. The cream itself is great… the refill is BS
