I love how this blends out. I was first worried because it is a thick cream, almost like a paste. But I was actually pleasantly surprised at how well this blends out. It doesn’t take too long to absorb into the skin. It doesn’t leave a weird residue on the skin and I have to use it more to see the benefits but when I put it on an itchy pimple, it quickly soothed the pimple! So I think it is working! Blends out really well!
