This balm is the real deal! It healed my Perioral dermatitis in 72 hours. I broke out around my eyes mouth and sides of nose, the eyes were the worst, non stop itching, burning and even a feather touch was painful. I am so grateful to have found this product I have been suffering since October 2020, I had never had dermatitis so took forever to get to the right products and care. I also used the Skinfix face wash and it is gentle enough to use around my eyes. Definitely need a bigger size, if you are debating on this purchase to help with dermatitis, just buy it, you will not be disappointed and it will become a holy grail in your skincare cupboard, I will never be without it! Healed in 72 hours
