I read a lot of reviews, but rarely write them. But I couldn’t avoid it in this case. I have fungal acne and most moisturizer messes up my skin. I also have rather oily skin that also gets irritated. I came across this product and figured it’d be another failure. I was so wrong. This is amazing. It doesn’t irritate my skin at all. It is perfect under makeup. It soaks in wonderfully, but gives me the moisture I need during the day. I only wish it wasn’t so expensive and had refills available. nan
