Most creams this thick take forever to soak in, but there is something about this formula that just naturally absorbs and leaves my face looking and feeling soft and hydrated.  I have dry, sensitive skin and I’ve never had an issue with a Skinfix product and this is no exception.  I’ve been obsessed with strengthening my skin’s natural barrier and this cream is packed full of amino acids and ingredients that actually help nourish it.  Nothing in it clogs my pores, and my skin feels amazing all day with this cream.  It *might* be my favorite Skinfix product (but tbh I love them all).  And bonus points for refillable packaging! 100% Yes!
