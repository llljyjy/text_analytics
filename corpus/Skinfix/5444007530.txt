I love how lightweight this moisture is, but it’s also as moisturizing as those thicker creams too! I love all the ingredients listed as they’re all meant to protect the skin barrier, calm redness and irritation, and help with skin tone and texture. Very excited to continue using this for my acne prone sensitive skin! nan
