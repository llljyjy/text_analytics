This is the best moisturizer ever. I took one star off just because if you wear it during the day you will look oily and your makeup will move around because it is so thick. But this is the perfect nighttime moisturizer. I used to put petroleum jelly on my face at night a couple nights a week, but since using this I have not felt the need to because I feel like it always locks in my skincare products and brings my skin back to life. best skincare product
