Skinfix Barrier Triple Lipid Collagen Activating Serum is a gel cream texture with a hint of scent. The product quickly absorbs into my skin leaving a matte and smooth finish. Itâ€™s nice product for layering before moisturizer, to add another level of hydration and nourishment to my skin. It pairs well with my other skincare products. nan
