The cream didn’t feel like it personally penetrated the skin enough and did not feel hydrating enough. Overall, the cream was quite average and found that it never really “fixed“ my skin barrier. Very unique touch to the packaging as the pump is good for not letting the cream dry out etc Not Hydrating Enough
