I’ve tried great products before but this was so perfect I actually wanted to leave a review. I have a TON of skin issues; oilyness, pig pores, hyperpigmintation, redness, very acne prone, sensitive skin (allll the issues). Not only does this not trigger anything, it actually has improved my skin. I usually have to use 2 different moisturizers for day and night but not anymore this is sooooo moisturizing without feeling heavy in the mornings, and looks great under makeup. Don’t feel greasy or oily just hydrated. For the first time ever I can use an intense moisturizing product without looking like an oily mess. I’ve been using this for about 2 months now and my face looks plumper, I breakout less, and my texture is improving, this is actually repairing my moisture barrier. I live is a super humid and hot state btw so even with all this intense weather it’s still gucci. Also I love the inkey list use a bunch of their stuff but their moisturizer is not a dupe for this. Anyone hoping it is, and wanting to save cash sorry to break it to you, if you have similar skin issues to the ones I listed it will break you out almost immediately. Trust me the skin fx one is worth the extra cash. First time I felt the need to leave a review
