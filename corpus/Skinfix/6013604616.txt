I’ve been loving the thicker cream version in the darker blue container in the wintertime when my skin is dry and flaky. I recently noticed this gel version and decided to try it out for the summer months, when my skin is significantly oilier and more acne-prone. Feels light and cool on the skin, and hasn’t led to any breakouts. Going to be a summertime staple for me for sure! Perfect summer moisturizer
