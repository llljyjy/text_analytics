I found this product to not be too drying or irritating to my acne! I don’t get a lot of acne but I do get the occasional pimple that will stay for a while and I found that this product helped with getting rid of it faster. It isn’t an overnight miracle worker for me, but I did find that my pimples didn’t stay as long nor did they leave any dark marks afterwards. nan
