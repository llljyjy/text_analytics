Very good. Exceeded my expectations. I have very oily/combo skin with acne. I’m used to products that strip my skin to give it that “clean” feeling. As I get older, I know better - you don’t want to completely strip your oils or else your skin will increase production. I didn’t know if I would love it at first but after finishing the bottle - I’ve already put in an order for another. Gentle, effective, protects my skin barrier surprising!
