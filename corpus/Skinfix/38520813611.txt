This product was a free gift in exchange for an honest review. I really enjoyed my initial impressions of this serum! First of the ingredients are wonderful, it’s pact full of ceramides and peptides which is a huge win for me! It’s also fragrance free which I love! The texture is light, moisturizing and extremely silky! I think this would be perfect layered under the Skinfix gel cream if you wanted to add ceramides into your routine wile still maintaining light weight hydration. Absolutely stunning serum!
