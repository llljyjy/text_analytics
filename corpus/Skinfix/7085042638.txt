I got a 2ml sample with an order, and got 3 uses out of it. I really hoped that I would like this, and maybe my expectation was that it would feel like DE Lala Retro or FAB intense hydration, but it wasn’t. This felt like a medicinal cream, kind of thick texture and has an old smell. I didn’t like the after feel.. will stick to my FAB intense cream. nan
