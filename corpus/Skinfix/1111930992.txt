The lotion itself is divine. The packaging is atrocious & the refill instructions are confusing causing you to accidentally lose product. The letters come off the packaging with each use and get all over your face and hands… embarrassing walking around with the letter “t” on your cheek!! I love the idea of refillable packaging but really this just creates more waste than any other bottle. If you love the product just buy the value size that doesn’t do the gimmicky, greenwashing “refills”— at least once they fix the letters coming off issue. greenwashing packaging
