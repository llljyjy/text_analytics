I have tried many cleansers of diverse price range. I have a few in mind that are good for sensitive skins and acne prone skin. I am confident that this one is not going to make it in that list. I started breaking out a little bit in a few days, then got worse and worse over a month. NO bueno! I just give an extra star in addition to one star rating, for the content amount. NOT for sensitive acne prone skin
