I have combo acne-prone skin, especially on my cheeks. This is a really nice cleanser, more of a cream, and doesn’t lather that much. After using it, my skin felt clean of oil but not tight or stripped of all moisture, which was great. The product itself has a vague, almost oatmeal-like smell. Fortunately, I haven’t had too many blemishes recently, but I have noticed a little bit less oiliness in my T-zone. Gets My Oily T-zone Under Control w/o Stripping It
