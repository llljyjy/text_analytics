I received a deluxe sample of Skinfix Mini Barrier+  Lipid-Peptide Face  Cream in one of my beauty box subscriptions a  long time ago.  Im 61 years old and have mature skin.  If I dont use deeply hydrating and rich moisturizers, my skin becomes very dry. Combating this issue,  Ive learned to use creams that are rich in peptides, cerimides, and collagen.  I used my sample ribht away.  For me, and my dry skin issues,  my skin did very well, staying soft and bouncy through pm and am...Applications.  does well under makeup as well.  Ive been researching creams, once again with peptides and keep coming back to Skinfix brand. Price per efficacy makes the product worth it for me.  While mini sizes are available,  I suggest you try it.  Thats what got ME started loving this product... Great For Dry Mature Skin+
