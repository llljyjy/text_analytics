I have been using this skin barrier for a couple months and it has been a life saver in the winter months so I was excited to try the gel version. I live in Chicago and my skin gets so dry. I love how the product comes out so you don’t waste anything. It’s the perfect consistency to moisturize your skin without making it feel greesy. 10/10 recommend. Great for winter skin
