This product is absolutely amazing! I am 18-21 with acne prone skin my skin is oily but can get really dry overtime. I thought this product was going to be like the Inkylist one but it’s super different! With the inkylist peptide moisturizer it’s very thick and heavy but the skinfix one is thick but breathable especially for oil skin. Perfect use for the wintertime and hasn’t broken me out once! best for any skin type!
