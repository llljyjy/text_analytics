My skin usually flakes after a light chemical peel, but used this after and had no flaking at all! Doesnâ€™t feel particularly hydrating when you first apply the product, but throughout the day skin feels and looks more hydrated. Definitely a product to use for a healthy skin barrier! Must-have for compromised skin barrier!
