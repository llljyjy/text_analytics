A good cleanser, although a little drying. This definitely caused a purging period for me and my skin was very bumpy and rough on my t-zone and chin areas which is not typical for me. Unfortunately I didn’t see a lot of payoff afterwards. I was a little put-off by the sticker on the front of the tube that covered up “Azelaic Acid” and was replaced by “2% BHA”, not sure why they did that. I wouldn’t recommend for hormonal acne but I would recommend if your main issues are blackheads/whiteheads. nan
