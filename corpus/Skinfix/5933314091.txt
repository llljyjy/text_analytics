I have combination skin dry and oily t-zone and uneven texture, also I have some rosácea and this moisturizer I love it. I’ve been using it now for like 4 months or so… keeps my skin hydrated without feeling oily all day. It calms my skin since in 2020 I developed like maybe some type of dermatitis that I haven’t been able to have it check out by a dermatologist so I’m extremely careful with products on my face, this moisturizer doesn’t activate that part of my face that I’m struggling. I highly recommend this product. hydration hydration hydration
