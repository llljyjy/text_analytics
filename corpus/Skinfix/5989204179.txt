Y’all this is a thickkk cream! Use it as the last step of your skincare routine to seal all those serums and hydration in. Even with my oily skin i only use it on the contours of my face or else it clogs my pores and gives me whiteheads. Even then, it doesnt do much for my skin. This cream is not meant to provide hydration in my opinion. It’s just a thick sort of occlusive that best works for very very dry skin to make sure it stays hydrated all night. NOT FOR OILY SKIN! Super thick cream
