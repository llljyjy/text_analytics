This cream is really nice after my skin got used to it. For the first few tries it made my face red and irritated but I kept trying it and now I like it. I love that this cream contains Niacinamide, which is one of my favorites ingredients. It applies very well and absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy feeling. Nice cream
