Another Skinfix product that does not disappoint and even surpasses expectations. I love this serum— for its formula, texture, and effectiveness. It’s lightweight, blends seamlessly, and leaves skin instantly feeling soft and hydrated. I was impressed that I could feel and see a difference even after the first use! After continued use, my skin has become smoother, brighter with even coloring, and more plump. I have been using this morning and night after cleansing, and it is now a staple in my routine. I love that this serum is boosts hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, collagen, elastin to fight wrinkles and loss of elasticity. And it does so without Andy added silicone or fragrance. Seriously, no scent to this serum! I definitely recommend this as a powerfully effective anti-aging serum that protects and repairs the skin barrier. nan
