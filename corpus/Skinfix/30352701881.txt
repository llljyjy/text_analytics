A perfect kit for my facial routine, the texture of the products is not so light so I prefer to use them for my facial routine at night, their packaging is simple but the products are perfect, the smell is mild and does not bother me, all the products are white, the foaming oil cleanser I love how it leaves my face soft and lathers quite a bit, the texture of the serum is heavier than normal but it is easily applied and absorbed, I love the eye cream, it leaves that area well hydrated and gives me a feeling of freshness that I really like, the moisturizer is not so light in texture but it leaves my face very hydrated and soft the next morning.  I recommend this kit the size is perfect to carry in your travel suitcase Perfect kit for my facial routine
