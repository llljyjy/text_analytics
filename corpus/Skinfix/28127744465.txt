At first, I did not like this cream. I had bought the mini to try. I was put off by the smell, however I continued to use it. Then, I started noticing that my skin in the morning was softer than before. After the mini was five, I went back to Cerave cream (which I love), but I realized that the texture of Skinfix felt better and luxurious on my skin. I decided to buy the larger jar. My skin is more supple and hydrated now. Smooth Cream, Smooth Skin
