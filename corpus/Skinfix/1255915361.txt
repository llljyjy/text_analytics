i am fortunate enough to only get occasional pimples, but when they do pop up, they hurt like crazy and take forever to go away. iâ€™ve tried a dozen drying lotions, topical creams, etc. but they usually only have minimal effect. i found that this did a pretty solid job drying out the area and getting rid of the pimple. nan
