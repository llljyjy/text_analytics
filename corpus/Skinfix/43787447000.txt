I’m not one to write reviews but I had to for this product! I have always been a Kiehl’s kind of guy, but their product wouldn’t quite do the trick during the harsh Canadian winter. I can honestly say that I can use this day or night. Life changing for people with dry skin! Must have for people with dry skin!
