I found that this gel cream was hydrating without leaving my skin feeling oily/greasy. My biggest issue with the product is the smell. I thought it was just me but I saw that other reviews also mentioned the bad smell. Unfortunately, once I’m finished the container, I won’t be repurchasing. Good hydrator, bad smell.
