The kit is a great way to try for starters. I love the moisturizer. It’s light in texture yet very moisturizing. It’s my number go to moisturizer for the winter. The cleanser is good, gentle and clean my skin without stripping my skin. The eye cream and serum is just ok for me. Good but nothing too special. nan
