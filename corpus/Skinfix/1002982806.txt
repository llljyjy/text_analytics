I love this cream, itâ€™s a gel cream moisturizer. It is lightweight and super hydrating I used it paired with my hydrating serum and vitamin c and it was great. I was sensitized around my nose and it irritated it a bit but I was fine. I applied about two pumps all over my face and that was enough! I am excited to use this during the spring/summer time! I would recommend and re purchase! I have normal to dry, dehydrated skin- it gave me a nice healthy glow nothing greasy. Worked well with my spf no pilling involved So great!
