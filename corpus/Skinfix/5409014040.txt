Just repurchased my second container. My skin is VERY picky with skincare. I have dry skin but if I use anything too thick or too moisturizing my pores get clogged and I deal with whiteheads all over my face. This is one of the only few moisturizers that doesnâ€™t do that to me. Very lightweight but makes my skin so soft and smooth. nan
