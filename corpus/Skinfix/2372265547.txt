I was excited to try this product based on the awesome back story of the company and how great the ingredients sounded. The packaging is cute and I like the thick opening of the tube. The product I received did have a sticker over part of the text on the front with new text, so that was a bit odd and sloppy looking, but otherwise it was a cute component. I tried this overnight on a few occasions on some hormonal and mask-induced breakouts, but did not see any results that ’wow’ed me. I think the breakouts reduced slightly in size, but based on how high my hopes were for this, I was not amazed with how this worked for my skin. If you have a different type of acne, it may work better for you. It was a thicker consistency that helped to stay in place and was not runny or anything when applied (which was great!), but it also took awhile to dry down. Because of this, I think some might have come off on my glasses/pillow when going to sleep, so maybe I missed out on some of the benefits, but that’s the time of day and circumstance under which I’d use this product so that’s a bummer it didn’t work out for me as I hoped. nan
