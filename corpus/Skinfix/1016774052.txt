I received this skinfix barrier cream for review. First of all, I think all skincare should come in this packaging. I love that it’s a pump so you don’t have to reach into a jar and potentially contaminate it. My skin becomes very dry and easily irritated and flakey in the winter months. This is so soothing and really helped my barrier! It’s really as good as everyone says. A winter staple
