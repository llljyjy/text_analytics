I’m over 40 and still have oily/combo skin.  It’s hard finding a good moisturizer that won’t leave my skin greasy an hour later. This gel formulation is fantastic. My skin is fully hydrated and the product is absorbed quickly into the skin, but it doesn’t feel greasy later. I like the table-top pump bottle too. It’s a fun design that only needs one hand. Great for oily skin
