I am so surprised by this product! My skin is frustrating: It’s on the drier side, but it also tends to be a little breakout prone occasionally. (maskne, amirite?) It makes choosing a moisturizer difficult. This one is like nothing I’ve ever used before, and I love it: It’s a not-greasy, rich cream that sinks in quickly. My skin is firmer and hydrated, never sticky or greasy. Makeup goes on over it really nicely. my perfect moisturizer
