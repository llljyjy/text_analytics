I really like the packaging, the main thing is that you donâ€™t have to unscrew the lid, so you can fight germs from invading your skincare products. The texture of this cream is very creamy and easily absorbed by the skin without being greasy, it locks the moisture in my face well and keeps my skin from drying out in the dry fall. nan
