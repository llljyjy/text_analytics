I have to admit I’ve only been using this for a short time but I already want to buy a back up! It definitely plumps the skin and adds hydration and my pores look pretty minimal! I like the packaging and the fact that there’s little to no scent. This is definitely going to be a repurchase for me mainly because I’ve used skinfix for so long and I’ve always had great results! I was gifted this from Skinfix. Add to cart immediately!
