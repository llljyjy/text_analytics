I love this product. It’s a must have during the dry winter months. I struggle with VERY dry skin during the winter months and this is the oily product that soothes my skin without feeling uncomfortable. It is very thick but melts into the skin while leaving a dewy look. Wouldn’t recommend for oily skin but excellent for dry skin. nan
