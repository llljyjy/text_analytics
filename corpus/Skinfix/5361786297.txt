I used the Skinfix Eczema Dermatitis Face Balm and I found the balm to be nice and thick but not greasy. There wasnâ€™t any noticeable scent and my skin was smooth in the morning and not irritated. I liked this balm and used it on my hands as well. A little goes a long way so it should last a good amount of time. Great product!
