Love this cleanser. It’s cleans well without stripping your skin and it feels luxurious. I used this while my skin barrier was damaged and not once did it irritate me. The only downfall is the price point but it’s worth the splurge if you don’t mind spending money on skincare. I have dry/sensitive skin. nan
