I’ve been using this serum for a week and my skin is looking plumper & I  have noticed a lot more glow. My skin feels more even and softer, it has definitely improved my texture and hydration.  The gel like texture of the serum is really nice, I am a fan of lightweight and this is perfect for my combination skin! It works great with my moisturizer without making it too heavy on my skin. I am excited to continue using it and see even more improvements. Perfect addition to my routine!
