This kit is worth it for the hand cream and foaming body wash alone! I live in an extremely cold and dry part of Canada and this stuff saves me every winter. I have eczema, so keeping my skin from cracking is my main goal. I love the foaming oil soap especially for shaving my legs and the hand cream is thick and moisturizing without being greasy. The face balm is great for my cheeks in the winter to protect them from the extreme cold. If I could give this 10 stars, I would!
