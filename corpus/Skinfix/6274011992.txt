I really wanted to like this, but it’s just not good for very dry skin. I have dry skin around my nose that flakes easily, and I guess the rest of my face is dry too. I had a sample of another Skinfix moisturizer and thought this one looked promising. However, after use, my skin still felt tight. I ended up returning. I’m sure if you don’t need a LOT of hydration and you’re looking for a light daily moisturizer for combination or oily skin, this is great. For us super-dry skinned people, it’s a no from me.
