I really love this cream! Perfect ingredients for dry skin without extra junk. The consistency is perfect and feels like you put on a hydration veil. I like to put my vitamin C and serums first then top it off with this. I think this is great for keeping skin hydrating and helping with transepidermal water loss. nan
