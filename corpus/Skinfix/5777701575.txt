My skin was extremely dry, red, sensitive, dull all due to topical steroid withdrawal. One pump is all you need, and it lathers nicely. After I use aFace balm to take off dirt and makeup, I use this face wash next. It does not leave my skin feeling dry, especially how my skin was severely dry and super flakey. It left my skin feeling moisturized even when dry, but off course I have to slather on moisturizer. I use the triple lipid peptide cream and using them both worked wonders. This helped tons with the redness on my face, and did not irritate my skin at all. Definitely recommend. Good for TSW
