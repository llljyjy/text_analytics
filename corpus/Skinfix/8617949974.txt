I tried this serum out after I accidentally damaged my skin barrier and I must say it did help repair it. It is very hydrating and instantly gave me a nice and healthy glow! I really like the texture and that there is no added fragrance! This product also layered well with other products in my routine and did not pull like others! Love it! Great serum!
