SkinFix does it again! This serum has amazing ingredients such as Niacinamide, Polyglutamic Acid, and the brands B-L3 technology which works to increase the skins ceramides, collagen, and elastin. The consistency is thicker than most serums but I absolutely love it. It feels very nourishing, hydrating, and skin feels instantly more plump and protected. I love to top it off with the skinfix triple lipid peptide cream. Such a powerful duo! Over time this will continue to give amazing results and Iâ€™m here for it!! Layers well with other products, no irritation, and fragrance free. Packed with amazing ingredients
