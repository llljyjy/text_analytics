Incredible night time moisturizer that totally upgraded my skin. I’m a male 34 yo generally blessed with clear skin (thankfully) but this took my face to a whole other level. Extremely hydrating, face feels comfortable and repaired after waking up and feels velvety smooth as I wash. Too thick to use during the day imo but there isn’t anything better to use at night! I’ve tried a lot of them nan
