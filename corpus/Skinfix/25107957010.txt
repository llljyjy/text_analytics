Unfortunately, this cleanser did not help to clear my acne.  That being said, I won’t knock it because no salycic acid acne cleanser has ever been able to clear up my acne and I knew this going into the purchase so that’s my fault.  Otherwise it’s a really nice cleanser.  I appreciate that it’s fragrance free, doesn’t cause irritation or make my acne worse, and it doesn’t dry me out or mess with my skin barrier.  I’ve since started using Kate Somerville Eradicate acne cleanser and it’s totally cleared up by skin.  I still use this cleanser every few days when I want to double cleanse  and really like it now that my skin is clear.  I would recommend this for someone who has a good track record with salycic acid cleansers or to someone who has never used salycic acid in a cleanser.  It really is a good cleanser with a ton of good clean ingredients. nan
