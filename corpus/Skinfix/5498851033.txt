I’m not one to write many reviews or go out of my way to say something is my “holy grail” product.. but omg this cleanser is AMAZING! I had a really bad stress/hormonal breakout that wouldn’t clear up for approximately three weeks. I finally got fed up and decided to give this a try. This along with two other products gave me great results within a week! I have been following that same routine for the past two months now and the acne that I struggled with along my cheeks are almost completely gone. I wash my face twice a day and have sensitive, congested pores, acne prone, combo skin for reference. New breakouts (mostly around my chin.. mask-ne) are minimal and clear up within 3-4 days. My routine consists of this cleanser, a AHA/BHA toner, and a clarifying dry oil that I use as a moisturizer. The dry oil has really helped to combat the dryness from the cleanser and toner. I definitely feel like I got my money’s worth for the size of the product.. I’m not even halfway through the tube! (I use a little more than a pea size per wash) Hope this helps! :) Highly Recommend
