When I tried this for the first time it truly blew me away. I got a sample of it and was hooked ever since. After I ran out of my 1.7 oz size, i tried switching back to my drugstore moisturizer because the price of this seemed kind of steep and right away I noticed I had new breakouts where as with this, I don’t get any! This stuff truly is a miracle cream. Makes my skin soft, glowy doesn’t feel greasy and doesn’t break me out! I’m sticking to this from now on! Hate that I love this so much!
