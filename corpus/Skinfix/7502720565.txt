I’ve had hormonal acne for about 6 years and I have tried all types of cleansers ranging from drugstore, luxury, and even prescription cleanser (Sulfacetamide/Sulfur). Nothing has worked as well as this cleanser! It cleared up my acne and flares up within two week from the first time I used it. It can be a bit drying around the mouth area but as long you moistures you should be okay. If you’re struggling with acne and it’s affecting your confidence I would highly recommend you try it out! A MUST FOR HORMONAL ACNE!
