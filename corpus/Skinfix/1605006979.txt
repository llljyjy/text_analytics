This cleanser is THE ONE. It seems a little pricey, but this is worth it. No need to double cleanse. Half a pump is plenty to wash my face and neck, so itâ€™s going to last quite a long time. My skin feels soft and moisturized rather than the usual tight and dry feeling after cleansing. Removes makeup no problem. My acne prone skin is much happier and clearer now! nan
