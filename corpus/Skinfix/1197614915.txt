I have normal/combo skin with dullness, fine lines, texture and post-acne dark spots. This serum has a gel-cream consistency and feels nourishing and hydrating without feeling too heavy. It smooths into the skin quickly and doesn’t leave a sticky residue behind. Within just a few days I’ve noticed my it has helped my dullness and plumpness of my skin making it look more youthful rather than like a tired mom (which I am, very tired ha!). I’m able to use this under my daytime and nighttime moisturizers and treatments as well as under makeup without any pilling or bunching up. It’s super silky so it makes my skin look great whether I’m going out with a full face of makeup or nothing at all. I sometimes find other serums to be far too watery or greasy so I love that this one is just the right texture for my preferences. All around a great product to work into your routine! Makes me look refreshed!
