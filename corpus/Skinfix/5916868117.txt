This gel cream is absolutely amazing! First of all can we talk about packaging?! The fact that its a refillable component makes me so happy! I love that the dispenser is different from most creams, itâ€™s definitely something I enjoyed seeing. The gel cream is sooo lightweight and feels amazing on my skin. 1 pump was actually more than enough and very hydrating. I will definitely be purchasing refills for this one! Lightweight & extremely hydrating!
