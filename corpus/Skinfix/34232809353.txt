I have combo skin and was feeling a little more on the dry side so gave this cream a try at nighttime. The first time I woke up with my face feeling extra tight and I was very red. Thought maybe it was a reaction to something else so I waited a few days and tried it a couple more times with the same result. Very itchy, very red, new pimples, and my skin feels drier than ever. not for combo skin
