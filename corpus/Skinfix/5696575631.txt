I received this Eczema+ Dermatitis Face Balm complimentary from Skinfix, and I’m giving my honest feedback. This is not a typical facial moisturizer. It has a thick balm texture and aims at nourishing dry skin and relieving minor skin irritations and itching due to eczema, rash, and dermatitis. I wouldn’t use it when my skin is in good condition. But it’s a nice to have product for my occasional flaky or irritated area. It’s a bit overpriced though for such a small tube. nan
