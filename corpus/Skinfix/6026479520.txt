As a fan of the original of the barrier repair cream, I was excited to try something a bit lighter for the upcoming summer months! I love the airless pump packaging, that’s my absolute favorite thing about this. I love that it also includes niacinamide and Zinc PCA to help with oil control, as an oily gal myself. I love the feeling of this on my skin, it doesn’t feel like it’s too thick or heavy but my skin feels so hydrated and moisturized. I love anything that promotes a healthy skin barrier, so this product gets 5 stars in my books! So good for your moisture barrier!!
