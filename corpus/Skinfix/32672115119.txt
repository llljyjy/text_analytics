at first i was really skeptical about this product because my skin is acne prone and almost everything breaks me out. but i still decided to give this product a try and i do not regret it at all. before this i was using the inkey list salicylic cleanser for about 3-4 months i believe. so if youâ€™re scared to try this cleanser you can definitely try the one from the inkey list AMAZING CLEANSER
