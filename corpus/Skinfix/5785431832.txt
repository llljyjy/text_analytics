I have dehydrated, yet oily-combo skin. Iâ€™m not sure but these reviews sound super fake. The pump feature is great and I love how the moisturizer feels upon application. It feels like a splash of cold water. However, it quickly sinks in but dissipates completely. My face becomes stripped of moisture while leaving a silicone-like finish. I was expecting to retain moisturize but this left me with none. I would only recommend to extremely oily folks. This is a return for me. not understanding the 5 stars
