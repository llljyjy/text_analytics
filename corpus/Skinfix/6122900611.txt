This moisturizer is one of my favorites! I love the way it makes my skin feel. This has not irritated my skin, or caused my makeup to separate. There is a very light scent, but it is not overpowering once itâ€™s on your skin. I am a big fan of this brand and excited to try more of their products. My go-to moisturizer!
