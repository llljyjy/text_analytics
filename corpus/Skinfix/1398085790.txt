I would probably not repurchase this Skinfix barrier triple lipid eye cream. When you get older, no eye cream on the market can reduce wrinkles around your eyes. This product is gentle around the eyes. Not worth the money. Results will not occur. I am in my forties. I am disappointed. Don't bother if your older.
