I’ve been using this moisturizer for almost 2 years now. I believe this helped tremendously with an acne problem I had prior to using it. I was attacking my acne by drying it out and it would just make it worse. I started using this and it’s so soothing. My acne slowly went away. So I’d say this is the bomb. It’s pricey, but worth it. PS - attack acne with making sure your skin is moisturized and your barrier is in tact. Drying it out doesn’t work for everyone! Helped with Acne
