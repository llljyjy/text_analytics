The best face cream I have used to date.  I feel it leaves me feeling a bit greasy but I am a fan of that.  I prefer to feel moisturized and glowy than dry.  I use it during the day as well under tinted primer and it does not flake.  Since it is pricey I have tried other products such as Pacifica wake-up beautiful retinol cream, and Ceravae skin renewing night ceam and these are inferior to Skinfix.  I would compare it more to face creams like Aveeno absolutely ageless restorative night cream, or Olay Regenerist cream but much better. Also, I have oily, hormonal acne-prone skin and this does not clog my pores or cause breakouts. Love it!
