This cleanser is alright, I don’t dislike it but I don’t love it either. It has an unscented fragrance if that makes sense, it doesn’t smell fragranced but it does have a smell. The lather on it is pretty nice but after using it I’m not sure I see any noticeable difference that would make me repurchase it. I haven’t had any negative reactions to it so that’s a plus but I don’t think I would replace my current cleanser with this one. Not bad
