Winter is coming and with it, my skin inevitably turns dry and I have to work really hard to prevent it from getting crazy dry and flaking. This year I am getting ahead of the game and I like that this works to improve your skin barrier. The gel cream has a lightweight consistency and it absorbs quickly. Thanks to its ingredients, it is hydrating and leaves my skin dewy. Time will tell if it keeps dry skin away, but so far, my skin feels soothed, soft and hydrated. So far so good!
