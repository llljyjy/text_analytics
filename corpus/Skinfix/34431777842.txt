This is one of my favorite moisturizers for effective nourishment in a humid/hot environment or for layering. I do have dry skin, so this is more lightweight on me, but the ingredients pack an amazing punch and truly help improve my skin condition. I see smoothing and soothing on my face when I use this consistency. The pump is perfect for cleanliness. I adore the cooling and soothing gel to cream texture. Love for summer!
