In the past I ordered the full size and it was amazing. The best moisturizer for my super dry skin. Then I decided to order the mini size for when I travel. It feels like a completely different cream. The consistency isnâ€™t the same and definitely not as moisturizing as the full size. I needed to apply several times during the day, while with the bigger jar, my skin remained supple and dewy for hours after only one application. Very disappointing. Not the same as the full size
