As someone who has struggled with acne the majority of their life I was skeptical that this spot treatment would work (I have tried many, many spot creams with only one having worked for me in the past). I am so pleased to say that the Skinfix Spot Treatment really does the job. Overnight I noticed that my acne was starting to flatten and dry out, making applying makeup so much easier. The product doesn’t over dry, and seems to absorb quickly. I’m going to use it in combination with the Skinfix acne cleanser to see if it will prevent future flare-ups. With the return to wearing masks, and the corresponding mask acne, I’m grateful for this spot treatment. A little goes a long way so the tube will last you a while! Hits the Spot
