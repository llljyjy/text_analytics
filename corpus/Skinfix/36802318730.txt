So nice!! I needed a substitute for my Laneige moisturizer after I realized they tested on animals, and I stumbled upon this. I was a bit skeptical because I didn’t recognize the brand and it was a bit pricy, but on a whim I bought it and I love it so much. I have very sensitive skin due to sun exposure and I’ve tried other moisturizers such as Drunk Elephant (which made me feel like my skin was burning) this one is so creamy and soft. It isn’t heavy at all and sinks into your skin. The package is neat and I don’t find myself creating a mess with it or having to dig my hand into it, contaminating the entire product. I recommend this to people with sensitive skin or who just need a lightweight moisturizer just to start their day off. The Best Moisturizer
