I never write reviews but had to for this product. This is the best moisturizer i have ever used on my skin. I have tried for years to find a moisturizer that won’t break me out and have failed over everyone i’ve spent money on. The Skin Fix is definitely the most expensive one i’ve bought but has been worth every penny. I have been using it for around 2 months and my skin has had no break outs and i haven’t changed anything in my skin care routine other then my moisturizer. in love with this product and recommend for anyone with incredibly sensitive skin You need this product
