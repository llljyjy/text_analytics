I love this! It’s moisturizing and light weight. Great for the summer. I have sensitive dry skin but have recently started to prefer lighter moisturizers to the thick creams. It doesn’t break me out and absorbs into my skin nicely. I wanted to try the new Skinfix gel cream and I actually ended up liking that more but this is still great! Note that this has no pump straw. It manages to pump out without it. Though I do wonder if there’s any waste in the bottle since you can’t fully open it and get everything out. perfect for sensitive skin
