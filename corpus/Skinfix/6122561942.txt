I struggle with small bumps and texture on my face, namely on my forehead, but also my chest—this cleanser works well to get rid of them. I’ve noticed everything being smoother and my blackheads being partially diminished (I imagine they will improve more over time, but they are incredibly stubborn so it’ll take some time). My skin has always reacted well to chemical exfoliants, and I typically use a chemical peel once a week, but this is a nice way to get a lighter exfoliation every day to really stay on top of the breakouts without overdoing it. It leaves my skin feeling a bit stripped, but I always make sure to moisturize SUPER well after, with toner, Hyaluronic acid, moisturizer, and a facial oil, and that really balances everything back out. So, I think paired with the right things, this cleanser is a winner! Good product for stubborn breakouts
