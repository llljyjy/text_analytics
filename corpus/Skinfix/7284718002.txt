I love this so much!! First of all, the packaging is a dream. It disperses the perfect amoun and I love that I dont have to shove my fingers in a standard tub and worry about contaminating it. My skin is pretty dry, and I found that this moisturizer sinks in seamlessly while still leaving me feeling hydrated. It’s lightweight yet highly effective, and sits amazing underneath makeup! The ingredient list is incredible and I love that it has niacinamide in it too! I can’t wait to keep using this. a dream!
