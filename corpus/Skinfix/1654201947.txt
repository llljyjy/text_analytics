I had to write a review for this cream simply because of how incredible and miraculous it was for my skin. I have combination skin, where oil tends to trap on my nose and in between my eyebrows. I struggled with cystic acne and horrible clogged pores as well as the beginning signs of fine lines and aging on my forehead. After using this product for 3 months now, I point to this as my holy grail--it saved my skin barrier, cleared my acne, and started to smooth out my lines. The texture of the cream itself is fantastic and the packaging is perfect--comes with a pump to prevent bacteria from building in the entirety of the jar. People in the other reviews upset about the smell, it doesn’t last and it’s not as strong/pungent as it seems. Just doesn’t have a fragrance, which is great for my sensitive skin!I am SO happy I found this and highly suggest anyone to use it as their normal moisturizer! The BEST facial moisturizer EVER
