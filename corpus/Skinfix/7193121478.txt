Pretty good moisturizer. Even with my dry skin it feels like this takes a while to sink in and never fully sets down. I think because of this greasy layer that remains on top of my skin it just feels like maybe it’s not really being absorbed and so it just doesn’t feel very hydrating. It’s definitely thick and feels protective like it locks everything in, but I still need a couple hydrating layers underneath. So I wonder if it’s worth the price? Or is it doing what any old thick night cream does? Anyway, haven’t really noticed a difference in my skin and will probably not repurchase (especially not the $80!!! jar) going into summer. Also, the pump cap broke so now I have to unscrew the whole top to access the product. Which is pretty unhygienic and also very difficult with wet hand. Unfortunately Sephora customer service was unable to help at all with sending a replacement so I’ll just have to deal with the inconvenience until the jar is empty. decent but pump cap broke
