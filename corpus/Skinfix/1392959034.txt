This moisturizer is great for a lightweight way to hydrate your skin either in the day or the evening. Since it’s a gel cream, it’s almost like a hydrating serum (though a little richer in texture). I will get the most use out of this product in the warmer months versus now when my skin is still on the drier side. nan
