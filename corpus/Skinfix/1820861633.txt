This is a gel cream moisturizer as it is states in the name.  I like the consistency of the moisturizer, but I felt as though it wasn’t enough for my dry skin in the Winter.  I do, however, feel that it will be a great moisturizer in the Summer.  It provides hydration, but I needed a bit more for my skin type.  It sinks in well, doesn’t peel under makeup, and feels really nice on the skin. Good, but need more for the Winter for dry skin
