I’ve had troubled red skin for a long, long time. Since I started using this as a daily moisturizer, I’ve noticed my dryness and redness reduce significantly! I love this product and would recommend it for everyone suffering from similar issue to at least TRY it. The consistency does not feel heavy on your skin and I haven’t experienced any clogging of my pores from this. I use it in the morning after cleansing as well as a second moisturizer in the evening (after cleansing and a different water-gel based moisturizer. great for redness and dry skin!
