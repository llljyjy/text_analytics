This moisturizer packs a punch with core ingredients like niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, squalene and zinc. All in which support the skins moisture barrier and prevents acne from forming. I love to use this in the daytime right after my vitamin c serum. So far I am really enjoying the light consistency and feel of it on my face. I have also noticed a difference in my redness and acne blemishes with consistent use. It does not pill under my sunscreen which is a bonus. This moisturizer is also fragrance free, oil free, and noncomedogenic which is something I am always looking out for when I try new products. This is safe to use especially if you have normal to dry sensitive skin and get easily irritated. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to try a new moisturizer with skin benefits :) Staple for Sensitive, Blemish Prone Skin!
