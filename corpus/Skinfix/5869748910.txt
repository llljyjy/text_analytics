This is a very nice cleanser that has a really nice consistency. I am someone who has issues with acne and tends to be on the more combination side when it comes to my skin so this seems like the ideal cleanser for me. It also doesn’t feel too drying on my skin. I can’t wait to see the results the more I use it. Great cleanser for acne prone skin
