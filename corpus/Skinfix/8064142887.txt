Wow WOW WOW WOW this product works so well with my skin and I saw results as soon as I used it. Skinfix did the job when it comes to BHA cleanser. Pros: the amount you get is enough to last a couple months and I appreciate that because you get to learn more about this product as much as you start to love it. The texture is very unique it has the smallest grains to gently exfoliate the skin while consistency wise it is a medium to thin formula. The color of this cleanser is a off white yellow and a quarter size dollop was enough to cover my whole entire face. I saw results right after and more after several usages. I had a crazy red pimple in the middle of my forehead and after a few times cleansing my face with this cleanser it disappeared ( with the help of other products). I have oily- resilient skin and so BHA is a savior for me and I really enjoyed this.Cons: there is no huge cons for this cleanser. I am huge fan of foaming cleansers and wish this was a little more form when cleaning. nan
