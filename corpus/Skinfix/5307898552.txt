this product completely changed my skin! coming off BC, I had dry (Canadian winter), irritated, acne-prone skin (cyctic, hormonal acne + scarring and occasional random white/blackheads) - I think this product reduced my skin irritation to the point where all the redness is gone. Even if I do get an occasional breakout, my skin doesnâ€™t look irritated and red, it just looks like a standalone pimple. overall, I recommend this product, though 1 star off for the price. Pricey but truly fixed my skin barrier
