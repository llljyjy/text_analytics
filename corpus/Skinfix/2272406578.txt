My son has eczema occasionally since he was a baby. We have tried a lot of things and so far this Skinfix care kit gives the best result. The foaming oil body wash helps clean and moisturize the skin without irritating the skin. After that, apply targeted body balm to the trouble areas. The balm is a thick cream that stays in the skin, it helps reduce the itch and redness on the areas. For thicker skin area like hands and behind the knees, the hand cream works extra hard. See better skin after a couple days a the itch is reduced almost to none. Help a lot with eczema
