Bought when experiencing very dry and tight skin due to winter weather. It’s a fine moisturizer but comparable to what you can buy at a drug store. Used over multiple weeks and did not help my skin.  Only after switching to a new moisturizer did my skin feel hydrated again! I don’t think this is worth the $$$ Won’t help with very dry skin
