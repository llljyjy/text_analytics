I don’t write reviews... even for products I don’t like, simply because I don’t have time or figure it’s a personal reason for not liking something... but this, oh my gosh, I HAVE to. I just bought my second bottle of this moisturizer. I purchased it awhile ago and was nervous because I have combo/oily skin and no matter what product I use, magnifying included, I always look super shiny and greasy. I wanted to try a new “expensive“ brand and branch away from drug store moisturizers because I’m 25 and know that now more than ever it’s important to start taking the extra steps and spending the extra money to take better care of my skin. It took me a lot of browsing before I decided to try this one out- and at the price point, I was super nervous. But low and behold, I quickly became OBSESSED with this moisturizer. My oily skin was craving hydration and this somehow didn’t cause me to look shiny, rather it helped keep the oil at bay! A little bit goes a LONG way, it IS pretty thick, but feels luxurious and pampering. I ran out of the first one and panicked because I adore this one, but as I’m on a budget, I couldn’t justify spending that money at the time, so I used another moisturizer I had. I ran out of that one today and immediately ordered this one again because my skin just isn’t the same without it. The only complaint I have that I’ve noticed others mention is that because it’s in a little tub like this where you push the top for product to come out, I couldn’t tell when I was running out of it. So that was a little annoying but honestly, I’m more than willing to buy a second one to use for when this one runs out. I love this, honestly, and I’ve never been a moisturizer junkie. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to use another one without wishing it was this one. Hopefully they keep making it because I can’t get enough! OILY and OBSESSED
