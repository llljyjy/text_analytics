Nothing else has ever worked like this cream. I use tretinoin and I live in a very dry climate. Iâ€™m also older and have super sensitive skin, and sooner or later everything (except Skinfix) slides into my eye area and makes my eyes water. This product leaves my skin super hydrated and soft, soothes irritated areas, never bothers my eyes, and a little goes a long way. I love things that work and deliver on their promises, and this absolutely does. The only drawback to this product was the amount of plastic used in the container, so I was very happy to see the refill. nan
