The skinfix barrier repair line is my favorite. I have a sensitive and reactive skin type and the new barrier+ Triple Lipid + Collagen activating serum is what I need at the moment. My skin is dry and I experience redness and this serum sinks in immediately providing the needed hydration. The formula is silky and lightweight and it layers well with my other skincare products. I noticed an improvement in my skin and it feels softer and plumper. Repairing
