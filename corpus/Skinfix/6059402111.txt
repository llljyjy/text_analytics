I LOVE this serum! I have been using this cream for 10 days now and I’ve been getting compliments on my skin more often since using this product. I use it morning and night. I apply 2 pumps all over my face and neck, I let it dry and then I use my regular moisturizer. It’s not heavy or greasy at all.. in fact, my makeup still goes on flawlessly over it. I am so surprised by the quality and how it made my face and neck feel. First time to try this serum and definitely not my last. I recommend this serum! I’ve been getting compliments on my skin
