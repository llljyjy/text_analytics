This Barrier Besties kit has everything I need to have a good skincare routine. The foaming oil Cleanser was my favorite it was gentle on my skin and didn’t strip it, the triple lipid hyaluronate serum gave my skin that boost of hydration that pairs beautifully with the eye cream and peptide cream.  I also love that this doesn’t have fragrance in it, since I have sensitive dry acne prone skin, this didn’t cause any irritation. nan
