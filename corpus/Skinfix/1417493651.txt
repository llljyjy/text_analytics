This is just what I needed for my dry, winter skin! It’s super rich and creamy, and feels so hydrating and nourishing. It does take a few minutes to absorb, but it’s worth the wait! I’m using it on my neck, chest, and the backs of my hands, too. I also love that it’s an airless pump and refillable! Amazing for dry skin
