I love this brand and this moisturizer. I have really dry skin and like to wear makeup so it’s a struggle finding a moisturizer that keeps my skin hydrated and not flakey especially under makeup. This is definitively the one for that! It also doesn’t irritate my skin at all which is a plus. Must have for dry skin
