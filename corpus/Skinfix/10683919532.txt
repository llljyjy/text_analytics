I love this product. My skin was looking a little dull and dry. After using a few times I already saw improvement. The texture was great and no scent really. Not to thick or thin and a little went a long ways only using a little bit. I do recommend I have combination skin . It wasnâ€™t greasy so it helped with my oily skin and helped with the dry skin also . A great fix for dry skin
