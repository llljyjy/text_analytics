I was so excited to get this product and then it hit me, it’s winter months! My skin gets so dry in winter that gel based moisturizer are not enough hydration for me. I really liked the product, it didn’t cause redness and absorbed quickly. However, I did have to pair it with a thicker moisturizer since I’m in a city a lot and it’s still cold. nan
