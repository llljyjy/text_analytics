The only reason I’m giving it two stars Is because the packaging is very deceiving. You are paying more for the plastic bottle than actual amount of  cream, almost like a scam. They make the container look large and heavy making you think it’s FULL when it’s definitely NOT! There is layers to it and when you open it there is only a couple of table spoons worth of lotion. Very upsetting for the price. Very little lotion
