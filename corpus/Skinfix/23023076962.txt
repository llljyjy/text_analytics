My oily skin loves this moisturizer! Its gel texture feels perfectly lightweight and non-sticky. It soaks into the skin really fast and makes it plump and hydrated without that greasy feeling most moisturizers leave. Highly recommend for oily peeps.PS Pump dispenser is amazing! Itâ€™s really convenient and helps to prevent contamination. Love it! Oily skin HG!
