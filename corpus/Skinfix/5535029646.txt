I’m absolutely loving this cleanser. I personally like using the medicated skincare for blemishes or any breakouts because the risk of breaking out is very less and with this cleanser I did not experience any breakouts. I saw a huge difference within the first week which is amazing. The formula of this product seems amazing because it did’n burn my skin at all. It was very gentle to use and I’m excited to continue using this product and highly recommend anyone who is struggling with any breakouts. Highly recommend!!
