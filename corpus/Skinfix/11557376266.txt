I absolutely love this cream. I have sensitive, acne prone, combo to oily skin. This cream doesn’t break me out or irritate my skin at all. I go to bed with it on looking like a glazed donut and wake up the next morning with my skin looking and feeling hydrated and dewy. This is quite an occlusive cream and works great for me in the cold and dry winter months. Once I’m finished the tub I may try the lotion version of this to use throughout the summer and switch back to this for the winter. Love.
