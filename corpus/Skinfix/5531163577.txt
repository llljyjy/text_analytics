Finally I finished a bottle. As I used two different cleanser in turns, it took almost a year to finish it. It is very mild and foamy and never left my skin dry after washing. After a few washes, however, I noticed this would not take off my makeup completely. I used this one as second cleanser after other oil cleanser or as morning cleanser. I still like it. This must be real good for dry/sensitive skin. It is a nice and mild cleanser
