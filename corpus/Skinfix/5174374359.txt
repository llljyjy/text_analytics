Skinfix never misses! I was so happy to see the skinfix barrier restore gel cream because a gel and cream combo is the best thing to get me through the changing weather. This is a beautiful cream and texture. My skin feels soft, plump, and hydrated after using it. Highly recommend as a day cream but could certainly be used at night. AMAZING
