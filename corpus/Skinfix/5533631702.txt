It’s a good everyday cream. I don’t suggest using this on super humid days. It’s bring out more oil. Maybe it’s just me. I will continue to use this as my everyday cream. It’s goes on nicely. Doesn’t feel heavy. I pair it with the Blume serum and see improvement from my uneven skin. Good everyday moisturizer
