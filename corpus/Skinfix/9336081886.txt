At first I was a bit skeptical of how thick the product is but my favorite beauty advisor recommended it when I asked him for a moisturizer for my dry skin. He swore by it so I tried it out and OMG I absolutely love it! The first time I wore it was at night since it is a little bit heavy and my skin was perfect in the morning- plus I’ve had a few people comment on my skin since I’ve been using it! If I’m wearing it during the day I do use very little and it does just fine with my skin, I don’t end up looking oily. Even though I live in Fl my skin does not react well to our winters but is fine during the summer so I’m very interested on how my skin will react to the product then- I will post an update then! Love this moisturizer!
