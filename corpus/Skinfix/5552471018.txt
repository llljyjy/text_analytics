I have been using this eye cream for over a month and I will not buy again. It does not absorb into the skin no matter what you try. It gives the under eye a matte finish (which I am not a fan of). I don’t notice much moisturizing happening. The first time I used it, my under eyes did burn but that went away after the second use. I will continue using until the bottle finishes as it’s pretty expensive. Do not recommend. Meh
