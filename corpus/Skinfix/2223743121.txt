I was very excited about this serum as it contains lipids and collagen and as I have dry skin these ingredients sound amazing to me. The texture is more like lightweight moisturizer for me. Feels great but not light enough for serum to me. The packaging is not my favorite. I love the pump but the cap is unnecessarily big. Overall I would like this more if it was marketed as lightweight moisturizer and that’s exactly how I’m planning on using it. Would be better as moisturizer
