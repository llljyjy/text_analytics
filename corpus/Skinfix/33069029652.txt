This moisturizer is probably the worst that I have used. After reading reviews I was expecting to really enjoy it, and the pump feature. But it really didn’t do anything for my skin, and left me feeling greasy. Considering the price point I thought I’d be getting a great product but honestly I prefer Cerave. Waste of Money
