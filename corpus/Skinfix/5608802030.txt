This is a comforting cream that provides lots of hydration to dehydrated skin. My skin was very irritated and the skin barrier was compromised due to strong and abrasive products, so this was much needed. Upon application my skin felt soothed and softer. It did not irritate my delicate skin. It also makes moisturizing cream prior to foundation. Leaves the skin with a glow and lots of comfort. I am loving this product. Calming Comfort Cream
