When the weather changes to cold, I tend to use more hot water. From showering to washing my hand, my dry skin dries out even more from all the hot water usage. I have cracked and rough skin, itching, and dry patches on my face and body. This eczema care kit helps a lot with my dry skin condition. The hand cream smoothed my dry and rough hand after a week of usage. It protects my hand from cracking. It works miraculously and makes my hand hydrated, smooth and soft.The body wash cleans your skin without stripping your natural oil. I don’t feel my skin oily at all, yet you have that clean feel after you are done showering. It has a very mild, almost not noticeable scent.Despite the results, they soothe and protect my skin. I’m not a big fan of the targeted body balm. It’s too tacky and needs more effort to blend into my skin. It’s like wearing thick sunscreen. And I noticed that it has a scent that I don’t like.The dermatitis face balm works well and soothes my dry and itching skin. The texture might not work for everybody, but this is a must-have item if you have dry skin like me. Overall this is a good eczema care kit worth trying and recommended! Good eczema care kit, with trying!
