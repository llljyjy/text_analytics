I honestly love this moisturizer. My skin is usually normal, but it can run dry in the colder months. This cream saved my skin so many times. It’s thick but doesn’t feel greasy. It’s also helped prevent some scarring from a waxing mishap around my brows and upper lip. It’s hydrating and healing, and I will definitely repurchase. New Fav?
