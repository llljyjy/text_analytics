This is terrible if you have sensitive skin. It made my rosacea flare up worse than it has been in a very long time. The day after putting this on at night, my skin is super dry, red and irritated. I developed bumpy red skin all over my cheek area. Do NOT use this if you have sensitive skin or are prone to redness. NOT for sensitive skin
