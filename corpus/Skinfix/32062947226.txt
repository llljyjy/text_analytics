This is fantastic! It has Azelaic acid that works super well on my skin and I actually see a significant change in my skin when ever I use this ingredient. I like using the Skinfix acne spot treatment to target my breakouts on my cheeks and chin area and Iâ€™ve noticed that my breakouts have reduced and or shrunk a significant amount. Definitely recommend you give this a chance! It works!
