So I have very sensitive skin and am very prone to acne, especially during that special time of the month. I used this but I didn’t see a major difference, I used it 3 days straight on 2 of the same spots and it almost made it worst. Not a huge fan of I’m being honest eat, but my body has never been a fan of those popular acids. Be careful if you have sensitive skin or open acne scars or broken skin. Not Impressed
