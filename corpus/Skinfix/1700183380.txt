This serum has the consistency of a lightweight moisturizer and Iâ€™ve been using it under my regular moisturizer for an added boost of hydration. Like other Skinfix products, I find this to be non irritating and gentle on the skin. Unfortunately I think this is very high priced for the moisture benefits. Good for extra moisture but pricey
