first time buyer here. I was looking forward to using the product. I expected to open the container and see a foil or plastic seal to ensure no tampering and/or if not for that reason I was hoping such a seal would be there to keep the ingredients or solution from either spilling or evaporating. There wasn’t a seal on the container except the lid. Now I don’t know if the pads are made to be dry as they are or if maybe it dried over time from shipment. dry pads
