A Sephora employee showed me this product after I told her that I struggle with dry and sensitive skin. I also mentioned that I have ezcema and she said that many customers with ezcema uses this, and I am so glad that she introduced me to this!I have very sensitive skin, where even baby lotion and Cetaphil has irritated it. This surprisingly did not! It left my skin feeling so soft, yet firm. I’ve never had my skin feel this way before, where it’s not irritated and dry the next morning. I definitely recommend this during the colder months as it’s made such a difference already with just a few uses. Such a difference within a couple of uses!
