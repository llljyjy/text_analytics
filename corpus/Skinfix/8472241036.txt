I like the feeling of this moisturizer, but I have been using it for the last couple of months and it runs out so quickly! I bought the value size two weeks ago and was so disappointed when it ran out this week. It also has a light but unpleasant smell. I like the product, but Iâ€™d have to keep replacing it way too often based on the last two I bought. Not worth the money
