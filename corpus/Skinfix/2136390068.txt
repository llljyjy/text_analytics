I have very sensitive skin around my eyes and have gone through multiple eye care products. I would get these weird white bumps around the eye area from them. However, this is the best eye product I’ve ever used. It has not only brightened my eyes BUT gotten rid of my under eye circles! My mom even noticed when she hadn’t seen me for a while. Totally recommend! Brightened my eyes and got rid of my dark circles!
