I like this product so far, but I have not used it long enough to attest as to whether or not it helped with my acne. I did like the way the product felt when applying and how it made my face feel. It also doesn’t have much of a smell which is nice because sometimes acne product have a bad smell. Overall, I like it but don’t know if I love it. I like!
