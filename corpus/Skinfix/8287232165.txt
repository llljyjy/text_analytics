This was decent. I have consistent acne and this did not completely clear it. That having been said it did not break me out and my acne seems less than usual right now. It contains salicylic acid which fights acne but 2 percent in a face wash seems like a lot for regular use, especially if paired with other acne fighting products. I loved the packaging. Super cute! I also appreciate that it is vegan and cruelty free. Decent
