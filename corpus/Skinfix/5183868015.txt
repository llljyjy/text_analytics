I’m in the minority with this one, but unfortunately this did break me out.  Woke up with under-the-skin pimples and whiteheads across my t-zone after just one use.  I have normal, acne-prone skin, but had cleared it up with no active breakouts.  It’s very rare that a fragrance-free product creates that much havoc on my skin - my guess looking back is that the vegetable oil is the comedogenic culprit in this guy.  The moisturizer itself is very reminiscent of the DE Lala (they both smell like butter oddly enough), and I can see dry and sensitive skin types enjoying it the most.  Seems that many oily-skinned and acne-prone folks get along well with this, but if you’ve had sensitivity to even slightly or moderately comedogenic ingredients, then I would proceed with caution knowing you may suffer the same fate.  Definitely double-check the ingredients and learn from my mistake! A word of caution for acne sufferers
