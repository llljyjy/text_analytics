Skinfix triple lipid collagen activating serum has a lightweight silky creamy texture that goes on the skin beautifully and absorbs well without any sticky feeling. The key ingredients in this serum are ✨ Patent-Pending Bio-Barrier3™ Technology 9% that supports ceramides, collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid for firmer-looking skin; ✨ Niacinamide (2%); and ✨ Polyglutamic Acid Complex (3%) which is 4 times more effective in retaining skin hydration than hyaluronic acid.I have tried Skinfix triple lipid peptide cream and this feels like a better version of it in the serum form. This serum is supposed to be used after cleansing and before moisturizers paired with vitamin c, retinol or other actives. Note: I saw lactic acid in the inci list (in the middle) so definitely apply spf in the am. It is a good addition to my routine and i have been using it once a day sometimes in the morning and sometimes in the evening. Another good product from Skinfix
