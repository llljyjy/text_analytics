I love the product so much. It’s the right amount of moisture for me and great for acne prone skin. I was so excited when it was time to restock and I saw they sell refills to minimize waste. It’s always a plus when brands are eco-friendly with the packaging but I was super let down to find out the refill did not work. It made a mess and didn’t dispense correctly. It was a hassle to go in store to do a return/exchange plus felt super wasteful. I hope they fix this issue soon otherwise the product itself is 5/5 stars. Save your time on the refills
