This product is a game changer for people with sensitive skin and acne. I have tried many products and none of them worked for me. They would either dry out my skin too much or be too harsh. This product is the perfect blend between the two, It doesnâ€™t dry the skin to the point where the skin starts peeling, or too hard on the skin to the point that it burns. This is go-to cleanser moving forward I love it. I use the product with the caffeine eye cream, tatcha water cream moisturizer, and the occasional kheils rare mineral face mask. Bottom line this product is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING, you should defiantly give it a try. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT
