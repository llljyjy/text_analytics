The product itself is fantastic. Saved my skin overnight when I introduced retinol too much too fast into my routine as well as my skin didn’t like the glow toner over time. I can be acne-prone with the wrong product and this hasn’t caused a single breakout. It feels like velvet going on and keeps a healthy moisturize barrier all day/all night. Skin feels velvet-soft and plumped. Took one star off because the amount of product for the price point is a little ridiculous. I find I’m using it so sparingly more so as a “rescue ointment” when I need it vs daily. nan
