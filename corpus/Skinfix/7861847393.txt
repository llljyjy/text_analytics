I love this as a night time routine, just adding a bit of this moisturizer on my face. I have combo skin and I absolutely love the peptides!!!! It leaves me looking like a glazed doughnut, and my redness is usually gone by the morning. Has helped with my dryness in the colder months, but when I have blackheads I try to avoid those areas! game changing
