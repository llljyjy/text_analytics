Pros: moisturizer is scent-free and not too heavyCons: I have oily skin, and this moisturizer gave me the worst breakout I have had in half a decade. I stopped using it after a month because of this. I’m back on cerave, but it’s going to take months to get my skin back to what it used to be. So oily people, if you have something that works for you, stick with it. Lesson learnt. Not for oily skin
