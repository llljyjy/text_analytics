My skin LOVES gel cream based products. As someone with oily skin like no other, gels are a gift and this is the gift that keeps on giving. My skin has been odd irritated lately and feeling a bit tender. This did a great job at soothing my skin and making it feel less “raw“ then it did, so woohoo! Niacinamide is just the added bonus for brightness and evening my skin tone. nan
