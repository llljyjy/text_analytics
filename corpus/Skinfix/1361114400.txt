I love that this is a cream cleanser. Most BHA cleansers I’ve used in the past weren’t and left my skin feeling stripped of moisture. After using for two weeks there’s a definite difference in the texture of my skin and it’s breakout free. I’m hopeful within the next 6-8 weeks I’ll see some clearing of hyperpigmentation left behind from previous acne breakouts. Great for aging skin with hormonal acne
