Trust me when I say I am sensitive to Salicylic acid! My skin looks amazing the first two days then I go through a horrible breakout period. I’ve heard so many good things about using a BHA in your skincare morning routine due to the natural exfoliation. I suffer from hormonal breakouts and some months are worse then others. Recently I had a reaction to testing out some skincare products around the same time of my hormone breakout. It was a disaster. The first time I used this face wash I loved it; …,but the second time I used it I noticed new breakouts and wanted to quit using this wash immediately. After reading a few articles on BHA and knowing the difference from skin purging and breakouts I decided to stay the course. So HAPPY I did!! My skin is clear and I absolutely LOVE, shall I say ADORE this face wash! I think the purging period for my skin ( 4 days) was less due to using retinal for a while. I’m sure it varies from person to person. Thank you SKIN FIX for FIXING my Face … SO HAPPY I DIDN’T QUIT USING THIS CLEANSER !!!
