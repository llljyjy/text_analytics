Very oily skin!! Had 3 large pimples on the left side of my cheek prior to buying this product. I bought it Wednesday and a today is Sunday... they have decreased in size by ove half AND redness is a lot better. I was also getting a pimple above my lip and it canceled it out completely!! With that being said I’ve never used this product as a standalone, I use the Kale cleanser by Youth by the people, Glow recipe watermelon toner, then apply skinfix acne spot treatment, herbivore moon eye cream & the Aquarius moisturizer mixed with 3 drops of the ordinary niacinamide, then the lapis blue tansy herbivore oil. I wouldn’t say this specific product helped me alone however in my opinion I noticed a difference regardless of my typical routine! Would recommend. For current & future acne
