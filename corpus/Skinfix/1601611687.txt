I received this product, for free, in exchange for my review. Wow! I was not expecting to like this product, let alone continue to use it after I was done testing this product. With the weather getting colder, my nose is runny and gets raw and red from frequent tissue use. I slapped some of this balm on at night and wake up… BAM! Pain is gone, less flaky skin, and barely noticeable redness. I’ve used it on my lips and don’t find it as magical as I did for my raw and angry skin. I actually think this did a better job that aquaphor or vaseline. Depending on the price, might buy this again. I’ll definitely recommend to friends. Bye Angry Red Nose!
