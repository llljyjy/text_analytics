Took a bit over a few months to see real results. Im oily, acne-prone but I used to be on accutane so my experience might different. Almost a year after being on accutane I started experiencing acne flare ups again but now on my chin area and those mini bumps that come in numbers on my forehead. After buying this cleanser, it almost immediately cleared up the mini bumps on my forehead but it took almost the full bottle for my severe, stubborn acne on my chin to stop flaring and eventually stop the acne altogether. Now I’m left with acne scars/pigmentation on my chin but it did the job eventually. I started religiously using sunscreen too so I don’t know if it helped halt my stubborn acne as well. I overall in my experience give this 5 stars but if you’re looking for a miracle over night acne eliminator then this cleanser isn’t for you. Took some time …. But patience is virtue
