So greasy!  I was so surprised after all the positive reviews.  I was excited to receive yesterday and applied very lightly after cleansing this morning.  Several hours later, I was still waiting for cream to be absorbed... and it had seeped into my eyes, even though I kept application far from eye socket bones.  I have now had to wash face thoroughly. Very disappointed.
