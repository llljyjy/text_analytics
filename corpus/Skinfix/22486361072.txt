First time trying a Skinfix product and I am not disappointed. Itâ€™s very smooth soft and velvety when you apply the cleanser and non-stripping. My face feels hydrated and plump after each use but I do feel that it is a bit overpriced as I have tried Korean cleansers much cheaper which offer the same results. Great results if you're ok with the price
