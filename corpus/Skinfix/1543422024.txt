I have combination skin. I have dry flaky areas and sensitive skin. I use this as a night moisturizer every night and in the morning my skin is very soft. No reactions after using it for a month. I like that it doesn’t have a fragrance and the packaging is good because you don’t have put your fingers inside a jar. Works for my sensitive combination skin
