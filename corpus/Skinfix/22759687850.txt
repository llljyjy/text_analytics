I’m dealing with some stubborn acne lately. I opted to try this cleanser instead of a BHA product that worked in the past, La Roche’s Effaclar 2% gel cleanser. There’s no comparison between these products. This cleanser is not only significantly more expensive, but it doesn’t seem to be nearly as effective. It has no slip or lathering effect, requiring a large amount of product to be used to avoid excessive friction when rubbing it into skin. It definitely exfoliates, probably due in part to said friction. It had very little noticeable effect on active or developing acne. I switched back to my Effaclar cleanser and quickly noticed how much more effective it is, while using far less product with a less irritating process. I speculate that this poor performance could be due to packing too many active into a single cleanser, causing formulation changes that reduce the efficacy of the Salicylic acid, but I’m not an expert. I do know for sure that this was a waste of money. Not worth it
