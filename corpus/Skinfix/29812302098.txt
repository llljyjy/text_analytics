I love Skinfix and this new Triple Lipid Collagen serum is a new favorite for sure! I’m always on the hunt for a great serum to plump my fine lines and keep my skin nice and hydrated and this delivers! I love how it pumps out creamy and immediately melts into the skin! It leaves my skin plump and glowy and keeps my barrier in check! I absolutely love it and love the packaging is refillable, and this serum has no scent ! I can’t recommend it more! LOVE!
