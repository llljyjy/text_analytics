The product is quite strong and helped control my break outs. These pads are an extremely convenient way of doing a “chemical treatment”. When I wanted to treat my skin but wasn’t in the mood for messy clay masks these pads were my go to. Their biggest flaw: there’s not enough solution! The pads are quite dry! The container doesn’t house any excess solution for the pads to remain saturated. As the pads dried my disappointment set it. I had to use multiple due to their dryness, and at that price the dry pads are a bummer. Wouldn’t repurchase unless they start saturating the pads with more product. Dry Pads
