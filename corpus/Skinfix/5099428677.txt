I have been using retinol on my face for years now and it messed up my skin barrier. My skin would be dry and have redness on my cheeks. This product was exactly what I needed to fix my skin barrier!! I use it in conjuction  with my retinol and vitamin c serums and I reaaally love the finished product. Its so smooth and I can already feel my skin heal. Cant wait to use it farther down the road! nan
