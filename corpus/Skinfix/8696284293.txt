This cleanser is good! From the first use I noticed my skin looked better. Lately, my skin has been breaking out a lot and this cleanser has been helping with that. It does have a slight chemical scent but that doesn’t bother me. It also does tingle a bit once applied to my skin which again, doesn’t bother me. I have normal skin but lately it’s been acting up so this cleanser is definitely a new staple in my routine. Great cleanser!!
