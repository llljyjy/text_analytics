SkinfixFall came and winter is coming, my skin is becoming to dry so I alway feel dried and itchy.  I tried some Eczema care kits but they weren’t work for me. If they work, I don’t like the scent. Luckily, I have a chance to try Eczema care kit from Skinfix, it worked for me. Especially, hand cream and foaming oil body wash. After using a few time, my skin is smooth now, no more dried and itchy. Highly recommended for winter. nan
