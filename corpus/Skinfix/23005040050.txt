Skinfix products have always worked wonderful on my skin, I love trying out this barrier + skin barrier restoring gel cream. At first I thought it would be a greasy or sticky type of cream since it was gel, but itâ€™s totally lightweight for the skin. Absorbs pretty well, and I love the packaging of the cream. The way of the container of the cream is great, because you can control the amount and love using it for day time moisturizer Works Great!
