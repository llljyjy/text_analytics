I have oily/combination skin type with dehydrated skin and I absolutely LOVE this new gel cream! I love their other face cream, but I like this one even more because of my oily skin. I love how this contains Saccharide isomerate, a skin similar carbohydrate complex that helps reduce transepidermal water loss, That ingredient really helps with my dehydrated skin and has helped strengthen my skin barrier. This has a lightweight texture that still makes my skin feels nourishing. If you have sensitive and oily skin, Iâ€™m tell you that you need to try this!! 10/10
