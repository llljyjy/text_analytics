i kid you not, i’ve tried so many things for my hyperpigmentation and dark spots from acne scars. this is the only thing that’s actually worked, and i’m shocked at how quickly i saw results. i like the fact that it makes my skin look brighter but not in a bleaching way. because of the aha/bha combo i would recommend using a moisturizer after because it did make my skin feel a bit dry afterwards. besides that, this was definitely worth the price! it may not work for everyone, but it did the trick for me! must-have!
