I have fallen head over heels for this Barrier+ line! I’ve already used up a full serum, the cream and now I’ve started on the newest gel cream.  For me and my normal to slightly combo-oily skin the cream is perfect for Winter and Fall. But I have a feeling I’m really going to enjoy the gel cream as the weather heats up. The texture is lightweight while still feeling incredibly nourishing. It plays well with my SPF and sits great under makeup. I love the packaging (I don’t have to dip my hands into a jar.) Overall, incredible addition to the line. And please excuse me, I need to reorder the serum now. Love this line!
