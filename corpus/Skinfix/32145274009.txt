I really like this moisturizer from Skinfix. I have combo skin and the gel cream formula of this is perfect for my skin. It is super hydrating, not too heavy, and doesnâ€™t leave my skin feeling or looking greasy. It absorbs quickly into the skin and leaves me looking fresh and dewy. I love the packaging and that this is fragrance free. Hydrating!
