I am impressed with how lightweight this moisturizer is. Usually I associate products that improve the health of my skins moisture barrier with thicker, heavier creams, but this gel-cream absorbs into my skin like water leaving it silky smooth and hydrated, while the formula of cholesterol and peptides still go to work to keep my moisture barrier strong. I have sensitive skin so I like to use products that focus on skin health, and this has impressed me so far. Since my skin is on the dry side, this has been the perfect morning moisturizer for me. I prefer something heavier at night, but I do love the pump top applicator for sanitary reasons. So lightweight but still hydrating!
