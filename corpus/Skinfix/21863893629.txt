This acne cleanser is my new FAVORITE! It is so gentle but also crazy effective. It has a very light formula and lightly foams up, but cleanses my skin so well and does not over dry my skin at all! It is so effective in calming and healing my breakouts, all while preventing a good portion of other breakouts. Just two nights of using it and I could visibly see the difference in my existing acne. Such an amazing cleanser! Worth every penny!!
