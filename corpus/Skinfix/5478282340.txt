I have always been skeptical of spot treatments because I find that they rarely work as expected. This one was a pleasant surprise for me, though! I applied it on a few spots I had (Iâ€™m not really acne-prone, but I do get the occasional blemish) and by the next day they were practically flat. This stuff is amazing! Stellar spot treatment!
