I think this cream is incredible. I have eczema on my face and had a really bad flare up in July. I had only had eczema for a few months at that point, and this was the worst flare up I had experienced. I didn’t know what to do. My face (cheek area) was raw, burning, and peeling. Nothing, and I mean nothing, could soothe it or keep it hydrated long enough with a single application. I had a sample of this from a previous order and just tried it out of desperation for relief. It immediately felt better. After 2-3 days of use, the top layer of skin healed over and I was finally able to get a grip on treating the flare up. I ran to Sephora to purchase a full size right after. If you have dry, chapped, painfully raw skin, please give this a try!Only thing I don’t ~love~ is that it can be a little greasy if you use too much. I have dry skin, but I have to use this sparingly otherwise my face is an oil slick. You also don’t need a lot! A full pump is too much for me. Other than that, I find it to wear well underneath makeup and on its own. It’s changed my skin!! Just restocked! (I have facial eczema)
