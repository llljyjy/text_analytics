Skinfix is one of my favorite skincare brands so I was excited to see they came out with this new gel cream. I already use their cleanser everyday and love their 911 ointment and Barrier+ face cream. I was originally recommended this line by a girl I once sat next to on a plane after we started talking about skincare and sensitive skin. If you have sensitive/reactive skin, I highly recommend this brand, as none of their products have ever left me with any irritation. My skin is also on the drier side so Iâ€™m always looking for new moisturizers to add to my rotation and I think this gel cream is going to be great as the weather gets warmer! love this brand!
