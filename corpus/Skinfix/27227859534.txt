I’ve been looking for a more affordable replacement for the Skinceuticals Triple Lipid Restore so I bought the mini version of this to try it out. The product itself is okay, but for $20, I was disappointed to find the container over half empty when I opened it. Reading through the reviews, this seems like a common issue. $20 for a week’s worth of use is not a good value, so I consider this a miss, and I’m grateful I didn’t spend over $50 to have the same issue. nan
