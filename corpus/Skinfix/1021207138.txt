Can’t live without this! It’s super hydrating. I have oily/dry combo and this is exactly what my skin needs. I use it at night and I wants up with soft, plump, and hydrated skin. I put this on after my tetrinoin. If I’m having super dehydrated skin in the morning, or sometimes in the winter, I’ll use this as a day time moisturizer too. Holy grail. I love that they added a value size! Now we need value size refills. nan
