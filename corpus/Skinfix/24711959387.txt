I’m a huge fan of Skinfix and was so excited to try this Skin Barrier Restoring Gel Cream. It doesn’t leave my face feeling greasy or oily which is super important for my combination skin. I feel hydrated all day and I love the pump lid jar. This makes it so much easier than digging my nails into cream. A must have!
