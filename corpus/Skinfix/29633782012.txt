The Skinfix Barrier+ Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream is an award winning product, and for good reason. The packaging is sustainably made using PCR resin, and has an airless pump in order to preserve ingredients and maintain hygiene. It is also refillable in order to increase sustainability. This happens to be one of the very best barrier-repairing moisturizers I have ever tried. Suitable for use with retinols, AHA/BHA’s, vitamin C, and most actives, it boasts 3% peptide protein and seaweed hyaluronate blends along with a patented lipid multiplier that helps the skin replenish ceramides and fatty acids to help protect against damage. Even those blessed with excellent skin can benefit from using this moisturizer, especially during the winter months when skin has a tendency to become dry. This happens to be one of the very best barrier-repairing moisturizers I have ever tried. I have somewhat sensitive combination-dry skin, and have finally found a groove in my routine using skin-cycling (a skincare regimen of 1 day exfoliate, 1 day retinol, 2 days repair) and couldn’t have asked for a more perfect repairing moisturizer. Whatever redness, peeling, or sensitivity I incur on my first two nights is quickly healed. It absorbs really well and doesn’t look or feel greasy and I personally don’t experience any stinging sensation when applying on areas that are feeling extra sensitive, either. This is most definitely a must-have! Absolutely Vital!
