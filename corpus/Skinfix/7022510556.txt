I just think this is overpriced for what you are purchasing. I have very dry patches on my skin and was looking for an occlusive to seal in my moisturizer. I put this on two hours before I went to bed and my skin never really absorbed it. In the morning my skin didnâ€™t look any better. I think you could find something cheaper out there to get the job done. Overpriced
