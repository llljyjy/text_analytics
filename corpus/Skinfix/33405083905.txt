This serum is great for dry skin especially during winter months. My skin drinks this up and feels so soft and plump after each use. This has been the perfect addition to my skin care routine to add that extra hydration to my skin. Collagen is one of my favorite ingredients in skincare and this product doesnâ€™t disappoint. I love the texture and the formula. Great addition to my skincare routine
