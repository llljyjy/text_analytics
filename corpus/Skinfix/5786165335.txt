I love this stuff. My skin feels so soft. It’s cleared this red patch I’ve had going on for the last few months on my cheek. I had used numerous products with no relief. I use this with the serum and it’s definitely now my go to product. I bought the mini first to try and I will be buying the large container. I’d say it’s worth every penny. It has a butter texture like nothing I’ve used before. Love love love it Love it!!!!!!! baby soft skin
