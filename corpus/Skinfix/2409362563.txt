I have oily, acne prone skin. I found that this spot treatment with BHA is good for the beginning sign of acne when the skin first swollen up. It helps reduce the swollen skin. If the acne already has the white stuff, itâ€™s better to clean it out first and use this spot treatment to help disinfect and heal the skin. Good for beginning of acne
