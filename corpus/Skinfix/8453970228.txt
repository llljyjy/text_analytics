I bought the 0.5 ounce to use after my first microneedling.  It met the criteria for being gentle, having lips and peptides for healing.  The texture is thick and felt great after my treatment.  I used it for 4 days on my face and neck and still have some left.  I work in the medical field and have to wear a mask all day.  It protected my skin and kept it hydrated. Great after med spa treatment
