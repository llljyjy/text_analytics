I like the product but after seeing that the container was only half full at $42 .. I will be switching. I’m so disappointed. I wish I would have looked at the review pictures before trying it, and I would have never. I feel betrayed. Either down size your container so ppl don’t think they are getting a decent amount or fill it. needing a new moisturizer after the disappointment
