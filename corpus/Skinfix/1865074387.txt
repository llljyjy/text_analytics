I’ve been using skin fix products for a while & really enjoy them. I was super excited when I saw they were coming out with a new moisturizer. My skin has been really dry lately & it even hurts. Well let me tell you that this moisturizer was so good on my skin. My face doesn’t fell as dry & it feels a lot more moisturized . I’m definitely going to be repurchasing this one. Love it
