this just posted on sephora and has 35 reviews... not one verified. anyways i purchased this because the shani darden eye cream though great product has awful packaging/pump. it’s hard to find non scented eye cream. this has no scent and packaging is perfect. not as hydrating as i’d like but it’s good enough. for the price it’s great. one pump is all you need for two eyes. decent eyecream for price point!
