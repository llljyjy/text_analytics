This Smoothing Vitamin C Eye Cream applies really beautifully. It has an almost silky/silicone feeling texture which I personally really enjoy for a bare face. It doesn’t seem to play very well with some of my products so be careful when layering because I had slight pilling. It appears to have a slightly blurring effect, but as you can tell in the after photo (the second picture), it’s not a lot. I haven’t noticed any major changes, but I’ll keep using and see what happens. Overall really nice eye cream. Gifted by The Outset! Feels Great
