Whoa this serum is gorgeous! It’s a perfectly sized, unscented serum packaged in a glass bottle with a pump system. The product inside is light in texture and with a slight chemical smell (no fragrance) that fades on application.I am always approaching skincare with a bit of a skeptic’s eye - so i was hesitant about what this “vegan collagen“ was supposed to be. After looking into it, I discovered that this product is using a peptide of vegan origins that may act similarly to collagen in our skin. I also tremendously appreciate that this product is free of the common irritants: fragrance, dyes, some preservatives, and also - get this - hyaluronic acid and niacinamide. Ingredients that can be great for some, sure, but you probably have them in ...well, probably every other product in your routine. In short, this product ACTUALLY takes a different approach to skincare. I’m really impressed by the amount of thought that was poured into not just this product, but the brand as a whole.Gifted by The Outset, all opinions are my own Actually something new to the skincare world
