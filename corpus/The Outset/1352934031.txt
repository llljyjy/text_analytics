The night cream has a nice creamy texture. Absorbs nicely and feels very hydrating. Looking at the INCI list it does contain some nice oils and HA so it will leave the skin feeling soft and plump. The cream does contain some fruit extract and Bakuchiol, if your skin is feeling irritated, I would refrain from using it for a few nights. My skin is currently feeling ok so I have used the night cream and it feels nice on my face. I have been using the cream at night and part of the last step in my PM routine, woke up to soft skin.  This is just a first impression so I will have to continue using it to give a full review. I think the packaging is so interesting yet simple, I only wish it came with a spatula. I can never have too many of those. The product was kindly gifted by the outset in exchange for my honest opinion. Nice night cream
