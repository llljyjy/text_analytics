This is a deeply nourishing cream that absorbs quickly and does not leave a heavy or greasy feeling after application. It does leave behind a healthy looking sheen, which I love.What I love most about this product is how it immediately transforms my dry and dull skin! Thereâ€™s nothing glittery or anything in it, but I swear it makes my complexion come back to life. Almost like it plumps everything back up.I also have sensitive skin that can be problematic so I really appreciate that this is not fragranced. The frosted glass jar is weighty and feels luxurious. Super cute for repurposing, too. Fantastic Night Cream!
