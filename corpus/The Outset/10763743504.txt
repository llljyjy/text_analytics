This is such a wonderful kit that has been helping to lock back in moisture to my skin. I can definitely say my skin is looking much more radiant and better then before. I had some acne when I first started this kit but after days of consistent use my skin not only looks better but the acne has really diminished a lot. I see fewer blemishes and more spots truly after using this. This makes me happy to see since those bumps were so painful and irritating. I really enjoy using this kit and highly believe the serum in this preps the skin just as well as it said it would. The moisture goes on so nicely and does not leave me feeling greasy or weird at all. I like how it also does not clog my pores and is not so heavy. The cleanser is pretty great too as it leaves my face soft and clean. Overall this kit is great and I am happy to be using it. Outstanding kit
