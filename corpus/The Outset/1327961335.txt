This serum absorbs quickly and doesn’t feel sticky at all when I wear it on its own.  My skin tends to run dry and it seems to offer lightweight hydration.  I have sensitive skin and I have had no issues with sensitivity, and I do like that it is fragrance free.  However, when I mix this with my foundation, my complexion looks dry and I’m not sure why because I don’t have that issue when I wear my foundation on my own. I really thought this would be a dream to layer and blend so I’m a bit surprised that it isn’t playing as well with my makeup as I had hoped.  Perhaps it would work better with a different beauty regimen. Lightweight and absorbs nicely
