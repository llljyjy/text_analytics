This moisturizer is ok. It’s nothing fancy and I’m confused by the reviews. It is NOT a thick cream especially if you are used to La Mere or the Kiehls overnight. It’s a nice moisturizer but I’m not falling all over myself about it maybe because I didn’t get it for free? Not sure, but take it for what it is a light moisturizer, a hybrid between a gel and cream. Since it has niacinimide I’m planning on using it before retinol and then following up with a thicker cream overnight. Don’t buy this thinking it’s life changing. Take it for what it is and see if it has a place in your routine. nan
