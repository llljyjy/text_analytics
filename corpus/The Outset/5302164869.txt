I have been blown away by the Outset Starter Set! I was so excited when this brand came out and the quality has really surpassed my expectations! The Gentle Antioxidant Micellar Cleanser did Ana amazing job of removing all remaining makeup on my face after cleansing and it was so gentle on my sensitive skin! The Firming Vegan Collagen Prep Serum soaked into my skin quickly allowing for flawless makeup application on top! The Nourishing Squalane Daily Moisturizer felt light and hydrating on my skin and dries quickly! I will definitely be purshasing full size of this products and canâ€™t wait to try the rest of the brand! Great for sensitive skin!
