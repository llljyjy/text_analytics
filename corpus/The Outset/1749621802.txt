I was gifted by The Outset their Firming Prep Serum in exchange for my honest thoughts on the product…here goes! I’ve been wanting to try products from The Outset for the longest as most everything is clean and vegan and this is my first! The packaging is beautiful, wasn’t heavily scented (a big plus for my skin) and so far, no breakouts! Hopefully it stays that way. Definitely recommend this product…particularly if you’re a sensitive skin girlie like me Great product for sensitive skin!
