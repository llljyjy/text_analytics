Moisturizer: broke me out and a bit greasy. Sat on my skin and didn’t really ever absorb fully. Serum: it’s fine. That’s it. Doesn’t do anything. There are better drugstore products that actually do something for cheaper. Cleanser: a bit “detergent-y”. Harsh on my sensitive skin. I gave 3 stars because I love the ethos of the company and on paper the formulations are solid but in the end they just didn’t work for my combo skin. Love the trial sizes so I’m not wasting full size products. Just okay
