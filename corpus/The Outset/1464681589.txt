This serum has surprised me and I like it a lot! It’s a very hydrating serum, more in a light lotion way. My skin has responded well to it and it keeps my skin barrier strong and my skin hydrated and dewy. It’s a really simple addition to your routine that makes a huge difference. I love that there aren’t any actives in this, so you can use it twice daily and just focus on hydration! it really is a nice prep product. A surprise love!
