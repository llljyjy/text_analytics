I like that it’s unscented. The more skincare I try, the less I see a need for a scented product. It has a light feel to it. It easily absorbs into my skin. I didn’t notice any flakiness under make-up. It didn’t cause my skin to break out. I’d like to try other products by this brand. Would recommend! Clean and light!
