Upfront - I have oily skin (and hypothyroidism) and live in an extremely humid environment. I got this as a sample in store from a sephora employee who said she also had hypothyroidism too. Those of you who may have thyroid issues know, finding the right skin products are right up there with addressing hair issues. I was shocked at how this moisturizer melts into your skin and makes it super soft without over moisturizing. If you have super dry skin, I don’t know if this would be a long lasting hydrator for you, but for those of us with an oily situation, it’s definitely worth trying! Not crazy at how expensive it is, but I do like how they have that hylauronic alternative in there too. Great product! Floored!
