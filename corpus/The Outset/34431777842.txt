I have super dry skin and I need a thick night moisturizer. I usually feel like I have to layer them in order to retain moisture by the morning, but this night cream is so lovely and thick without feeling heavy. When I wake up in the morning my skin is balanced and happy.  I see a reduction in redness. I think this will be my go to for winter skin! YES!!
