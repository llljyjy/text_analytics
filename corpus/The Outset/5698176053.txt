there’s another new celebrity skincare line - the outset by scarlett johansson. i tried out the night cream and it comes in a beautiful frosted glass jar. the texture is a very thick cream that’s perfect for dry skin types or for the harsh winter. since my skin is super dry, i enjoyed using this as my night cream. it’s formulated with niacinamide to improve skin texture but time will tell bc these effects can take weeks to months! nan
