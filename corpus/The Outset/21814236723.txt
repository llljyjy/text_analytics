This product was gifted to me complimentary from the brand. This night moisturizer has a rich, creamy, nourishing texture that absobs nicely leaving my skin feeling soft and hydrated. Love that it’s fragrance-free. As someone acne-prone, I’m thinking it might be a little too nourishing for my skin, but if you are someone with dry/mature skin you might really enjoy this. nan
