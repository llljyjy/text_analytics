Probably my least favorite of the daily essentials set. I have tried several skincare products that include collagen in the ingredients line up, and ever single one of them did nothing to my skin. Collagen is a huge molecule which is unlikely to be absorbed by the skin and work on the deeper layer, though it stays on the surface and can work as a moisturizer. I havenâ€™t used this for long so no noticeable changes seen. nan
