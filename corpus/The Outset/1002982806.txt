I tried to like this cream, I tried it on 4 different occasions and this left my skin peeling everytime. I tried it with tretinoin, or with just a hydrating serum and on all occasions it pilled. It made me not even want to use this and during the winter this cream is definitely not hydrating enough Pilled on my skin
