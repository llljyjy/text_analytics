If you’re in your late 20s/early 30s looking for a good eye cream, DO NOT BUY!I was excited to try this eye cream and desperately wanted to like it – given the cleaner ingredients, promising product description and wanted to support Scarlett J. Sadly to say, this is the worst eye cream I’ve ever tried. I got the opposite of the results the product description said it would do – it created more imperfections.I used it for 9 days, twice a day. Overall, applied smoothly and felt moisturizing (why I give 2 instead of 1 star). On my 9th day, I woke up finding very tired-looking, wrinkly and saggy eye areas. It gave me MORE wrinkles. (I know what you’re thinking. No, the rest of my skincare routine was the same.) I know it says this is a lightweight eye cream, but I’m still SHOCKED at how light it is. Immediately returned it the next day.When I returned it, a Sephora employee told me that this skincare line is meant for a younger audience who are starting to explore more functional products. IDK if that’s true, all I have to say is don’t let the other ratings/reviews fool you. Learn from my experience! DO NOT BUY! It gave me MORE eye wrinkles.
