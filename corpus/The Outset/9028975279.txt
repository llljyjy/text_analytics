Gifted by outset.  I loved how lightweight this serum is. I felt my skin was hydrated without being overly sticky or greasy. I’d recommend applying morning and night! Another benefit is the fact that it comes as a pump. I can’t stand when you have to reach into containers. Highly recommend! Very hydrating!
