Just by looking at the ingredients, I was more interested in the moisturizer than the serum. But after trying both, I must say I prefer the serum more, at least while the weather has been hot as we ease into summer. It soaks in beautifully, hydrates well but without any oily or greasy finish. It just leaves your skin feeling happy and soft, like cashmere. I think they named it perfectly when they call it a prep serum because it does feel like a “first essence“ step to really lock in moisture after cleansing. To be honest though I am iffy on their firming claim. I see this more as a hydrating rather than an anti-aging product. I don’t think vegan collagen does anything for aging; it just makes skin feel smooth as long as it is used. The price is still rather high for this serum, but you should see what they charge for the cassia angustifolia extract in HydrExtreme. I’d rather buy this serum. Great product, but wish packaging refillable
