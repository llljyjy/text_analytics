The aesthetic and packaging is so gorgeous. Clean, fresh and beautiful. There’s no fragrance which is a plus. The serum texture is great and absorbs quickly into skin which provides instant hydration! I have dry skin and this works great. Knock off one star because I don’t get the plump effect like the claim. The aesthetic 10/10
