Bought the starter set to test out before buying anything full size, I normally have combination skin but tend to be more oily in the summer and dryer in the winter. So far I’m loving it! I love that the products don’t have a scent because sometimes they can be irritating for my skin and also love that the cleanser isn’t stripping after using it. I also like that the prep serum and the moisturizer aren’t super heavy and melt into the skin rather than having something sitting on top and feeling heavy. Definitely wanna try the other products in the line and will be repurchasing the ones I tried to be able and test them out a little longer nan
