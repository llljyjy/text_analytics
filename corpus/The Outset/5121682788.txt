The first product I ever tried from the brand. Love the fact that it doesn’t have fragrance and it’s vegan. I have combination skin that’s on the dry/sensitive side and this serum really worked for my skin. It feels and looks hydrated with less visible pores. Definitely open to trying more from this brand. nan
