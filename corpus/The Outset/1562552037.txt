I purchased this after having used the eye cream for about 2 weeks and being sold on it, and after having watched JLo slop serum all over her incredible skin in a TikTok. I’ve been using an organic skin care line called Biodara for some time now with success but they don’t make a lightweight serum and I decided, at 50, that it was time to start. It has only been about 2.5 weeks so I can’t say if my life has changed but I CAN say that this product integrates really nicely with the oil-based products I also use and that as the weather gets drier here in Southern California I can definitely feel the hydrating, soothing benefits of using this both in the morning and at night. I’m giving 4 out of 5 stars only because it hasn’t been long so I can’t rate this product the way I would rate something I’d used for a year, but I would definitely recommend giving it a try over other non-cruelty free products! nan
