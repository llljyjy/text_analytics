I’ve really been enjoying this for my skin in the morning. I have combo skin that is starting to lean more on the dry side as I’m getting older. It has a gel cream consistency that absorbs well into the skin. My favorite part is it really is plumping. I do feel the plumpness as I’m working it into the skin. It does feel smoother and more hydrated. Very plumping
