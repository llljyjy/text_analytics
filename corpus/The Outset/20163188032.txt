This eye cream is a total game changer! It leaves my undereyes looking more hydrated, bright, and plump, which is no small feat since I live in the desert. I’ve noticed more fine lines around my eyes lately, and this has been the perfect eye cream to push those beginning signs of aging back. It has a light texture that absorbs easily into my skin, but hydrates like a rich balm—I’m so obsessed with this brightening eye treatment! I received this eye cream complimentary from The Outset. nan
