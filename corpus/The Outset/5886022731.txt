This serum was gifted to me by The Outset in exchange for my honest thoughts. I really enjoy this serum! The ingredients are gentle and it leaves my skin feeling plump and glowy. I was really happy to see the addition of hyaluroset instead of hyaluronic acid. I see HA in everything now and was excited to see a new alternative! nan
