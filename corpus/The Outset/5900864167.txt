This is the best hydrating serum I’ve ever tried. I’ve noticed a difference in fine lines, hydration, plumpness, and the overall health of my skin. The consistency is perfect and lightweight while hydrating the skin. A holy grail of mine and a new staple. A bit pricy but so worth it!!! Best hydrating serum
