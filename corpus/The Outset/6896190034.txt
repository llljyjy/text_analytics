The smoothing vitamin C eye +expression lines cream by the Outset is by far one of the best eye creams I have ever used. I have been using it twice daily and already seeing a difference after one week of use. The lines on the upper inner corners of my eyes have softened. The skin around my eyes look hydrated and youthful. I love that it is unscented and has Clean ingredients . They have also packaged it well in a recyclable glass jar with a pump. The formula is thick like a moisturizer but not at all heavy. It absorbs easily without having to tug and massage the skin. Overall a great find. Works wonders
