I use it every night and my skin it keeps my skin super soft. Has never caused any breakouts or skin irritations for me either. This cream feels a little bit heavy and thick on my face but it does make my skin very soft when I use it and doesnâ€™t seem to bother my sensitive, combination skin. Gifted by The Outset. nan
