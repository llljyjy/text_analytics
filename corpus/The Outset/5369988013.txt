I have been using this night cream for a few days in a row now and have been pleased with the way it hydrates my skin. I felt like it absorbed well and hydrated my skin thoroughly, which is wonderful in this winter weather weâ€™ve been having. I also used this night cream with The Onset products for day use, so I would just recommend the line in general! Hyrdrates well for winter weather!
