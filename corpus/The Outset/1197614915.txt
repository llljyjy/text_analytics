This product was gifted by The Outset. I have normal/combo skin and found this serum to be really easy to apply.  It has a fairly thin, liquid-y texture that applies smoothly and sinks in quickly.  It sits nicely under makeup as well as under my other skincare products. When applied it made my skin look glowy and feel hydrated. I havenâ€™t noticed any remarkable firming of my skin yet but those things often take time to see results.  I also like mixing this with a few drops of foundation to create a nice skin tint for those days when I want something a bit lighter.  Overall this is a nice serum. Glowy & hydrating
