This is my first time trying a product from The Outset, I’ve had my eyes on them for a while so I’m glad I got this gifted by The Outset. This vitamin c eye cream feels so smooth and I love the texture. I will probably gift it to my mom to try to see if she had improvements in her expression lines nan
