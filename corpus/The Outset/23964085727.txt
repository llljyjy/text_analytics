This was a great product to try the brand for the first time! it’s a great hydrating serum, that even though I did apply my moisturizer after, it did feel like I didn’t anything else on top. Feels very hydrating and my makeup applied beautifully on top. I do enjoy it being fragrance free since I do sometimes use other products that have some scent added. The packaging is a sleek elegant glass which I love. Feels like all I need!
