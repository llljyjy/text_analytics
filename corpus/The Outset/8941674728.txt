I received this product complimentary from The Outset but this is my honest opinion.This is a really nice night cream. First of all, I really like the frosted glass jar since it feels very high quality and well made.The texture is a little bit on the thicker side since it’s a night cream, but it still blends and absorbs very easily and quick.I apply this every night after all my serums and it layers well, doesn’t look greasy and makes my skin look and feel brighter and more even thanks to the niacinamide.I have dry sensitive skin and this does not irritate my skin.Highly recommend to check it out! Rich and hydrating
