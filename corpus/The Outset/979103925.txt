I actually paid for this product ( ordered off Outset website before it was avail at Sephora) I give it 5/5 because:  it is gentle and does not cause my sensitive mature skin to break out or get red. Also the micellar component does actually remove most of my makeup which I appreciate.  ( but I have not tried on waterproof mascara)   There is no fragrance. It is a clear jelly like texture.  A light foam/lather develops and rinses away clean.  Price is not too bad IMO.   Since it actually works and does not break the bank, I will most likely repurchase when I run out. If you do not have sensitive or reactive skin you can prob find a drug store or less expensive cleanser that works just as well for you though. plain and simple. my reactive skin likes this one!
