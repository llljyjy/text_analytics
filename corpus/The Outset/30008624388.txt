I received this product complimentary from The Outset to review - This is a very nice serum! It’s super hydrating and soothing. I love using it in my barrier repair routines. I’ve also tried using it mixed in with my skin tints for a sheerer and glowier coverage/finish and that has worked out really well too! Very hydrating!
