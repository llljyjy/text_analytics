I wasn’t sure exactly what to expect from the Serum but I am pleasantly surprised to find that I love it! It did feel hydrating but it left my skin feeling very smooth and didn’t feel heavy or sticky on the skin! I also really enjoyed mixing this with foundation and concealer to give a more skin like lighter coverage to my other products! I like it!
