This is an amazing set to start your clean routine! I’ve been using it for a week and really love the experience. All the textures are nice and gentle. I also appreciate fragrance free formulation. As for the results - I can’t see any dramatic changes for now but it seems like the amount of blemishes reduced, which isn’t bad for a week. I’m excited  to see the long term results. nan
