This kit included the cleanser, serum and moisturizer. The serum had a weird texture and I personally wouldnâ€™t rebuy it, but I liked the cleanser and moisturizer. It was all scentless. I have combo skin and this did not over-dry my face at all. However, I live in a humid region (SC) so not sure how it would hold up if I lived back in North Dakota where the atmosphere is more dry and cold. This set would make a great travel set or gift! nan
