I got combination to oily skin, however this product is definitely good for all types of skin.the only one I don’t like is the cleanser, the texture is so weird, I thought it would make more pimples but it didn’t, so it is still probably a good cleanser just I don’t like the texture and the way it smells just like chemical.This serum and moisturizer is good for whole seasons I think, till the next day only clean, dewy, and soft feelings left on my skin, and no more pimple in my face since I used this set as my night routine. Would buy the serum and moisturizer again!
