Nothing to not like about this night cream - light, airy, absorbs quickly, doesnâ€™t irritate. I have adult acne from time to time, and I was happy to see this did not trigger it. My skin immediately felt refreshed, and my fine lines looked improved when I woke up. I use this with the collagen serum by The Outset as well as their eye cream - a power trio! I received this product complimentary from The Outset. Dream Cream
