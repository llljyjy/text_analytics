I didn’t know what to think of the serum when I ordered it. It’s another celebratory brand, which are often hit or miss. I did like that brand is vegan, and focuses so much on the cleanliness of their ingredients. The serums it’s self is super hydrating, and feels lovely on the skin. It’s better than I expected, and I look forward to continuing to try it out. nan
