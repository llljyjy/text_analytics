The Outset gifted me their Restorative Niacinamide Night Cream in exchange for my honest review. I really like it. This is a nice thick cream that comes in a nice glass container packaging. Iâ€™m not a fan of the packaging because of sanitary reasons but the product itself is quite nice.The Restorative Niacinamide Night Cream has a nice consistency that spreads easily on the skin and, because of its thick texture, a little bit goes a long way so you only need a little scoop. The cream absorbs quickly and hydrates/moisturizes the skin without leaving any residue or tackiness.I really like adding The Outset Restorative Niacinamide Night Cream for my evening skincare routine. I find that adding it to my evening routine allows me to wake up to softer and smoother skin in the mornings. I would definitely recommend this cream to anyone looking for a light cream for sensitive skin or has dry skin. nice cream for evening skincare routine
