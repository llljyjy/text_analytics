Was on the hunt for a new night cream as my winter go-to FAB was beginning to pill on me. I’ve been hearing lots of talk about niacinamide and in a panic of trying to understand all the options at Sephora with 16 minutes to get home for a meeting, I just grabbed it and ran, despite having never heard of the brand. Boy am I glad I did. I have noticed brighter fresher skin in the morning and less obvious wrinkles I’ll say its a bit greasy or oily in the morning, but I usually apply a few serums at night so that’s probably my fault and should just make up my mind about what to use! Panic purchase - but its GOOD!
