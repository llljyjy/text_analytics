I am 53 and have dry skin for reference. I was excited to try this but unfortunately it isn’t very moisturizing even when I put an oil on top of it. I thought maybe I want using enough so I applied more but it just pills off my face.  I’ll be returning this today. Very disappointed in this cream. Not moisturizing for dry skin
