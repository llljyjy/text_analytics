The firming vegan collagen prep serum is my favorite product in this set.  It absorbs well and left my skin feeling soft. The gentle micellar antioxidant cleanser was ok but not overly exciting. It removed my face make up fine, and my skin feels clean but not dried out. The daily moisturizer was a little too heavy for my skin. It seemed to sit on top of my skin, and felt greasy. I wouldnâ€™t recommend this cream for acne-prone skin. nan
