This was gifted by The Outset in exchange for my honest review. I love the simplistic philosophy of this brand and love how that is reflected in the product - it’s no nonsense and free of irritating ingredients like fragrance. This is nicely hydrating, no huge skin changes but I’m really enjoying it to add some bounce and glow! Hydrating!
