Didn’t find this particularly moisturizing, and I think it’s expensive. I surprisingly didn’t have any irritated skin after using this (sometimes niacinamide can do that to me) but the product was sticky and didn’t sink in well. It left my skin feeling a little chalky as well, and I’m not sure if it’s a combination of it and my other skincare or just itself. gifted by the outset nan
