My new favorite serum! I’ve been using this daily for almost 10 days now and can safely say it works really well. I apply this under my moisturizer and it sits beautifully. Absorbed into the skin really well (but still leaves a bit of a tacky finish, I don’t mind it) and most importantly doesn’t break me out. One thing I’ve noticed is that my skin looks more alive, way more even in tone, and looks/feels plumper. I’ll definitely continue using this. Made my skin look more alive
