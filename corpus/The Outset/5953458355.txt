I love this niacinamide cream from The Outset. It does not have a noticeable scent and is rather thick in texture. But it absorbs efficiently while giving me hydration all night while I sleep. I apply it every other night as the final step in my skincare routine and I wake up in the morning with glowy, supple skin. A Must Have in my Nighttime Routine
