This cleanser was gifted by the Outset and I am so happy to have been able to experience this product.  I have found my new favorite cleanser.  I had never heard of a Micellar Cleanser before that you use with water. This cleanser is amazing. In the past I have always double cleansed but with this product I no longer need to.  This product leaves my skin felling extremely clean but not dry at all. The texture feels like a jelly wet cleanser and I am loving it. I also love the fact that the cleanser has no smell and leaves my skin feeling fresh and hydrated. Clean And Firming
