Really enjoying this serum so far! I love the silky texture and the added collagen. It’s very lightweight. I’ve been using it in my night time routine, especially on recovery nights. It’s helped with added hydration and I wake up with refreshed skin that feels soft. For reference I have dry, sensitive skin. nan
