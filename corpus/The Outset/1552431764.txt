This moisturizer is hydrating and pleasant to apply to skin. It is a rich cream that does keep my skin feeling soft. Aside from soft hydrated skin I’m not sure I’ve noticed any huge changes in my skin texture or tone. It’s a nice product but not life changing. Gifted by the Outset. Pleasant night cream
