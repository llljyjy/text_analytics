The best night cream I’ve used, hands down. No fragrance, noticeable smoothness within a week, better skin overall, and a little goes a long way. I bough this when my 3 step Drunk Elephant “smoothie” was done- hoping to minimize and simplify my night time routine. Totally worth it! Not only is my skin better, it’s less expensive. I ended up finishing my Shiseido cream and Youth to the people C serum and then bought the whole Outset line. After about a month of using the whole line, I’m happy with each product. Least favorite is the eye cream just because it’s been the least effective- still good however. The fact that it’s no fuss line that’s working great AND is half of what I’ve been paying is amazing. Happy with this and the whole line!
