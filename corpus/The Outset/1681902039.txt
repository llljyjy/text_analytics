This product had my face feeling so squeaky clean and it removed all of my makeup residue. I definitely did not notice a smell so if scents bother you, this may be the product for you. I loved the packaging and how you could see the product inside. Overall, nice standard cleanser. Didn’t feel any tingling sensation or burning. Super gentle. I will continue using, however, it’s not as exciting as some of my other cleansers lol. This product was complimentary from The Outset. Does the job, simple clean formula!!!
