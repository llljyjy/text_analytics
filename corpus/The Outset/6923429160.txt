I received this complimentary from The Outset, I have dry skin and this night cream works great for me. It’s rich and creamy without feeling greasy.  I use it every couple of days as I like a night cream in my routine but not every night (personal preference) but I feel it does such a great job that you don’t have to wear it every night! A great night cream!
