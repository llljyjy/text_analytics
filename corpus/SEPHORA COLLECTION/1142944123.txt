The Rose cleansing wipes have always been a staple for me because the wipe texture and formula worked so well and left my skin feeling clean and slightly moisturized. The new formula and wipes are completely different (and horrible)! The wipe texture is more like those flushable toilet paper wipes and the formula isnâ€™t as effective and sticky. It took me a lot more scrubbing and effort to get my makeup off only to be left with a residue feeling and my eyelids sticking together... Please bring back the old version!! Until then, on the hunt for something to replace these... new formula is awful!
