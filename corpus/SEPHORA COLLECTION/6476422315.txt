Okay, this one surprised me! I’m usually wary of new cleansers, especially since some of them can be simultaneously stripping and not good at removing makeup. Thankfully, this gel cleanser doesn’t fall under that category. I was so taken aback by how gentle this was and how well it worked as a makeup remover and cleanser in one. It supposedly tones too, but I didn’t notice any of that in my experience. It doesn’t really lather, which is fine! Nonetheless, my face still felt clean after using this, but still retained moisture.Also, I love that it has such a simple formulation at only 10 ingredients (and none of them fragrance)! Plus the bottle is made up of partially recycled material. Finally, it’s suuuuper cheap. What a steal at that price!!If you have combo-dry skin, I’d give this one a shot since it’s not overly drying! Nonstripping and perfect for drier skin
