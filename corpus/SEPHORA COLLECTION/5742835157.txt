Love this vegan and clean product at Sephora! This eye cream is a lotion consistency and easily sinks into the skin. It also leaves a touch of a glow, which I love. Quality doesn’t have to expensive, especially with one of my favorite ingredients hyaluronic acid! I also love the feel of the packaging (which is 72% recycled plastic!). I do like that it’s unscented, but I am not a fan of how this smells… almost old? Overall, loving this so far! Love it!
