I received a free sample of this product to try from Influenster. I have never used any sephora brand serums before and actually really liked it. It didnâ€™t leave any sticky residues, smelled sooo good! It has a light citrusy fragrance that awakens the skin and leaves it soft. I would recommend Smells so good
