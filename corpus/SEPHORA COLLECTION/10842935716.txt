Been using this for little over a week. Not seeing much process in diminishing my dark spot but i do love the feel of this serum. It melts in the skin wonderfully and doesnâ€™t feel sticky or heavy. Also loving the easy dropper application for my speedy morning skin care routine. Will continue to use this with hopes it helping to fade my acne scars. Hope it works at fading spots over time
