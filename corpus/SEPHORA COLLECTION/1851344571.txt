I love this night cream! I’ve seen a few comments saying it doesn’t work for oily skin, but I don’t find that’s the case for me. I’m super oily, and this doesn’t break me out or anything. It’s a night cream, so I expect it to be richer and more moisturizing. It definitely doesn’t make my skin feel gross or greasy, it is a bit heavier though. I find I only need a pea sized amount :). Def makes my face feel firmer and plumper Works for this oily face
