Gentle, no-nonsense cleanser that has kept oil and flakes at bay on this sensitive skin.  It doesn’t break the bank either!My only complaint is minor: because it’s fragrance-free, the natural scent is... not great.  I would rather it remain fragrance-free for people with fragrance sensitivities. nan
