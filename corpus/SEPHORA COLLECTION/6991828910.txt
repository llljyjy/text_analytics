As a first time user I was surprised to find that I actually like it quite a bit! It dissolved into the skin very quickly and left my skin feeling very hydrated. The only “complain” is that it’s very liquidy.  However, that’s not really a reason to complain lol. I gave it 4 stars because I have to keep using it to ensure that it really does work well for me. Hydrating !
