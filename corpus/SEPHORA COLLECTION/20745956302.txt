honestly, I have never tried Sephora brand products I thought they gonna be ahmmm :/ product so thatâ€™s why I never give a try to this moisturizer. This cream is amazing and feels amazing too! I used it on my hand and elbow too.it makes my skin hydrated and soft. Usually, i have combination skin but in winter it gets super dry skin after using this product for a week, my skin was glowing and super soft and hydrated. I love it! must give a try
