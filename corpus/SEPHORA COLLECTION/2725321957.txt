This is a good vitamin c serum if you’re new to the ingredient or new to skincare in general. It’s not one I personally love but I’ve tried higher end vit c serums which I prefer. It takes a second to absorb into the skin but it does make my skin look brighter after continued use. Not a bad product overall Good for beginners
