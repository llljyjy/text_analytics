I have combination skin and this gel is great - it is non-greasy and my skin feels clean afterwards. This gel is vegan and formulated with clean ingredients. Its formula includes prebiotics and aloe vera which I love. I was familiar with prebiotic benefits for the digestive system but learned recently that it supposedly also helps to balance the good and bad bacteria on your skin which may reduce symptoms like redness. nan
