I didn’t really see a difference when using this product, my fave didn’t look any different. I felt my skin tightening and feeling dry and it caused me to want to moisturize but I don’t know if it’s supposed to feel like that. I won’t be purchasing this in the future I’ll be going back to using my regular serums that feel more moisturizing. Didn’t see a difference
