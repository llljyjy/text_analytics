I am surprised at how much I enjoy using this. I use this guy once a week at night to exfoliate and I feel so nice and smooth afterwards. I have pretty oily skin, so I exfoliate 2 times a week, the second time with a leave on one. Even my oily skin wouldn’t be happy with this intensity more than once a week. I don’t think you should use this too frequently. It’s nice and cooling! Overall, I really enjoy this and would recommend giving it a try. Great Weekly Treatment
