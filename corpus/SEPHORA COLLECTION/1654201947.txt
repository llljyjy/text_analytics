I love this product!!!! This is probably my favorite sephora purchase out of everything I buy--every time I go I always throw these in my cart to keep on hand because theyâ€™re not only extremely cost effective but they actually work wonders for your under eye. The hydration and caffeine instantly wakes up your face and makes a visible difference--putting these on after a night of drinking or after a night of no sleep will help incredibly to reduce dark circles and puffiness. Keep them in the fridge and use them when you need them--your under eye will thank you! Instant gratification with these!
