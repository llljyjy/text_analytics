I bought this because it was reasonably priced and the Sephora employee recommended it. I was too lazy to try and find anything else. Iâ€™m glad I did end up buying this. It has a very nice jelly texture, cleanses the skin perfectly, did not feel like it stripped my skin and made my skin feel refreshed without the squeaky clean feel I know should be avoided. The ingredients also seem to be quite good. It did help with my active breakouts; my skin was instantly less inflamed and the size of my pimples had reduced. I now use it as a body wash as well because it just feels so good. I will be buying it again and again. Worth it
