I’ll preface by saying I only use this brush to cleanse my face after I’ve already removed makeup. I double-cleanse and I don’t use this brush to remove makeup specifically as a first step. I’ve been using this brush for a while now and I can say that I like it pretty well. The brush head is small, but it’s nice for scrubbing all the more smaller areas of the face that might be harder to get to with a large brush. The handle is nice and grippy, so when I use it in the shower it’s unlikely to slip out of my hand while using. It has a very simple aesthetic but is still pleasing to look at. I will say that I don’t really care for the silicone bristles bunched up in the middle of the brush head. They are recessed too far back compared to the softer fiber bristles, so I don’t really ever feel like they’re scrubbing my face as much. It is also harder to rinse out product from the middle of the brush since those bristles are so tightly bunched together. I would love to see a different version of this brush without silicone bristles, or at the very least incorporating them into the design in a different way.My biggest gripe by far though is the lack of a stand to set this brush on. I get that the exclusion of a stand or some way to hang up the brush probably cuts the cost, but I would have gladly paid a couple extra bucks for some way to store the brush when not in use. The solution I resorted to is to hang the brush by the brush had on my small shower caddy, on some hooks that might normally be used for a razor handle or something similar. It’s a decent fix, but I often accidentally knock the brush off while reaching for my other products and it’s a little annoying to deal with.Overall I believe this is a really nice skincare tool that is a good compromise if you don’t want to spend that much money. However, I think it could be a lot better with a few design improvements. It’s still a pretty good bang for your buck. Nice cleansing brush with some caveats
