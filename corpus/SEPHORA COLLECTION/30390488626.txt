I love Sephora brand skincare but this one is not good.  My skin is not fussy, it’s quite easy to take care of, maybe just some dry patches once in a while, aka, my skin is not hard to impress. This moisturiser is supposed to be for all skin types + extremely hydrating. Yes, indeed it’s thick, but not thick like thick on your skin, it’s thick in the jar.. You have to dig it out. (if anyone used Sephoras Leave in Conditioner for hair with Amino Acids, it is similar consistency on your hands)  Once you apply it to your skin, it feels like it dries off within seconds, frequently I forget that I already applied it and end up re apply it, because it feels that dry.. It does not add shine.Your skin will feel thirsty. I usually purchase Fresh, Origins or SkinFX but I am on a budget and I trust Sephora brand skin care + makeup, so I bought this daily moisturiser. I don’t think it’s worth it. Buy SkinFX and use less of it, so it lasts you longer, if you’re on a budget like me. VS buying something cheaper and needed more of it to feel like it’s doing something. I love that it has no scent! Don't do it ladies, buy SkinFX.
