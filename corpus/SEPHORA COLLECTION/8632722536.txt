This cleanser is lovely. It came out clear and had a nice lather to it. My face felt much softer after using than before. I noticed that it didn’t strip my skin’s moisture like other products. It was actually hydrating. I used it with the all day hydrator and I don’t think my skin has looked this good in a while. Sensational
