If you are someone who removes their makeup with Micellar water, these reusable pads are for you. Way more practical than the single use pads you toss away. They wash up nicely and are very soft and gentle on the skin. A little pricey for only getting 7 in the pack, but more cost effective in the loss run than the disposal pads. nan
