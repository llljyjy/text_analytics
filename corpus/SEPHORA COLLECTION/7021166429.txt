I really wanted to like this serum but overall, I felt like it was just okay compared to other vitamin c serums I’ve used in terms of brightening effects. Could be worth trying though in case it’s just my skin!Pros: - Amazing texture—goes on really well and sinks in quickly - Price point isn’t bad - No smell - Doesn’t make products applied after pill Cons:- I been using this a few times a week and I honestly haven’t noticed much difference in my complexion. - Packaging for the sample size I had was difficult to use as it poured out (but full sized packaging looks better!)
