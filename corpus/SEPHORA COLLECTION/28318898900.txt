This balm feels and smells great, but the packaging kind of sucks. When applying the balm it will wind itself back into the tube if you’re not super careful. If you’re applying it with a brush though, it would be absolutely excellent. While the price point is fine, because of the packaging flaw, I probably wouldn’t recommend this, especially not with how many different lip balms there are out there. Love the Balm, Not the Packaging
