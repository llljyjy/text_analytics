Usually with cleansers I run into the problem with my combo skin feeling stripped; however, with the clean skin gel cleanser my skin is still very hydrated after a wash. I have sensitive skin, so the aloe is definitely a win for me! It’s also vegan and Clean at Sephora, so there’s no added fragrance. I love that it’s inexpensive and still good quality. nan
