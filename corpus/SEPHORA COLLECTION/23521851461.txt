I was really excited to try this product but ultimately was left disappointed. I did not like how watery it is and when I tried it it irritated my skin. I do not have super sensitive skin so when it gets irritated by a product that’s always a red flag for me. I did like how my skin looked/glowed after using it which is why I gave it two stars. Disappointed…
