This is my first time trying skincare from the Sephora Collection and I’m so glad I did! This clean, fragrance free moisturizer leaves my skin feeling super soft with a hydrating glow that isn’t greasy. It’s affordable but it isn’t skimping on quality at all. I also love the packaging and even better it’s recycled! I’m pleasantly surprised!
