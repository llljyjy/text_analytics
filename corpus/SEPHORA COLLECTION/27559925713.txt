these smell nice and are good if you are in the biggest rush but not my favorite.  i picked these up after not using makeup removers for a while and WOW i remembered why i stoped using them.  i canâ€™t get any of my eye makeup off with these and my face makeup barley comes off.  they dry out super quickly and make my skin feel dry after use.  they can get the job done in a pinch but there are better alternatives. nan
