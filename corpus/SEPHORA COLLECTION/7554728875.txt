I have received this product to test and have been using for the past 2 weeks. Its a pretty decent moisturizer, it does the job pretty good but its not the best I’ve ever used. After you apply it you don’t feel it on your face neither look oily afterwards which I like. Also it claims that can be used under make up, I have tried several times and all the times I’ve tried my foundation was peeling and coming off, I didn’t like that. nan
