This is a very simple easy facial cleanser. It lathers up well on my Clarisonic and does it’s job at making my face feel clean but not stripped.  It does not, however, remove makeup like it claims. I definitely need to go in with a cleansing balm or oil before hand. But it’s great when you aren’t wearing any makeup. I also love that it’s made with clean ingredients! And the price can’t be beat. nan
