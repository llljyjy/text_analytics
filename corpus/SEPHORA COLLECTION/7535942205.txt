Best thing I’ve bought from the Sephora brand. I love this little tool I don’t know why I didn’t buy one sooner. The bristles are ultra soft yet you can feel them help with exfoliation. Keeps my pores clean when paired with my favorite cleanser. It dries quickly and easily considering it’s a little rubber tool. buy it!
