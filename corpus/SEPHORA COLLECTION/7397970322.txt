Hi, I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion, as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador. I wasnâ€™t sure if this would be too harsh for my sensitive skin.It is not, thankfully. The bristles feel soft and I can use it like a Litmus test when the foundation has washed off. It rinses clear within seconds, without staining the bristles. This will help me complete the 1st part of the double cleanse easier and faster. Now I can't imagine cleansing without this.
