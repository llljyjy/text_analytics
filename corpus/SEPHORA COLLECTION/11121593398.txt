This is one of the best moisturizers I have ever used, and at such a friendly price! Don’t sleep on this. My dry, sensitive, acne prone skin drinks this up!! I’ve even noticed that my acne is clearing up since using this (haven’t changed up anything else) which is interesting as there aren’t really actives for that in here… must have repaired my skin barrier or smth. Been using this day and night! loves it
