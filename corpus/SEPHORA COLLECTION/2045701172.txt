leaves slight residue after rinsing off and stings eyes. It removes makeup and gets the job done, but it takes a bit longer than other cleansing balms I’ve tried. Not sure if I received an old one, but the smell seemed slightly off- almost like a faint cucumber smell, borderline fishy. Won’t be repurchasing. nan
