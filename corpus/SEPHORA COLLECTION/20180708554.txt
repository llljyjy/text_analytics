Thank you so much to Influenster and Sephora for sending this product in exchange for a review. Great product! It is very liquid-y and that could make it a little more difficult to use, but once youâ€™ve gotten past that it is a great product. Love using vitamin-c in my routine and this is a great addition. nan
