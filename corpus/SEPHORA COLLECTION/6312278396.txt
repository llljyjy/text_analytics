Kind of confused by all the bad reviews. While I agree that when you wash these, they then do not lay flat and the edges become mishapen, but that does not change the effectiveness of these pads. One side is soft and one side is rougher, almost like an exfoliation which is a nice option. I just throw these in the laundry with everything else and they clean great. Awesome for taking off makeup- especially under the eye. I just use my micellar water, swipe and Im good to go to cleanse! nan
