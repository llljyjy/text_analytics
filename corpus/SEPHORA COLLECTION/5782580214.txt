Does not smell like cherry -so don’t get your hopes up there. BUT. I do like the texture and packaging. The paper packaging is special-different. -And I love that I can swipe it on without having to check if it’s bled out or too much. It’s a great balm -not sticky or watery. I just there was better colours. A true red or burgundy even. Something with colour but natural looking. This is almost there, but still bright pink on my naturally colourless lips. Not bad looking, just not a colour I like. Perfect deposit, waiting on different colours
