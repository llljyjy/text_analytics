I have never written a review on Sephora before, but I was so disappointed in this product, I knew I had to review it. I bought a cheap and cheerful one time use version of this at Target and that was LIGHT YEARS better than this one. The Sephora Razor Collection one cut my face way easier than expected, did not seem to “dermaplane“ and now, just a few days later, my face feels dry and awful, unlike what the Target version did/what happens when I get my face professionally dermaplaned. I would strongly caution you against buying this! I am returning as we speak. AWFUL
