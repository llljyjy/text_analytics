Sephora Collection gifted me this product and here is my HONEST opinion. I am very picky about my skin care, but I thoroughly enjoy this product. It is vegan, fragrance free and cruelty free which is a HUGE plus! After using the product my face was soft and hydrated. I am excited to continue using this product and watch my skin transform. Yes, yes and yes!
