I feel kind of impartial to the Ultra Glow Toner. I am always looking for quality products that are affordable and inexpensive, but when I compare this toner to other more expensive toners I have used I do think there is room for improvement. The smell is very mild which is great if you donâ€™t like fragrance and there is very little irritant if you are sensitive. For that reason, I think it is great if you are sensitive! But I wanted something a bit stronger for my skin. Does the job but not anything special
