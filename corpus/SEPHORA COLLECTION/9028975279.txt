Pretty decent amount of product for the size of the jar and the price. I think it’s meant to be odorless but I felt like there was a slight chemical smell. The product goes on smooth with no sticky finish. For results, I noticed my eyes looked brighter but they were still puffy. All and all for the price I think it’s still a good buy but If you’re looking for it all, splurge for the nicer products! Cheap and effective but not a fan of the smell
