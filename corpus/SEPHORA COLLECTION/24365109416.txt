I LOVE this moisturizer! Disclosure - I have VERY dry skin, I wouldnâ€™t recommend for oily skin, but for me this is seriously moisturizing. Its thick, almost body butter consistency, and a little goes a long way. It leaves a layer on my skin but I like that and look for that, especially in night creams Awesome for dry skin
