My go to moisturizer. I have super dry skin and this helps it so much. I use it for a primer for my makeup because my skin gets patchy with any foundation, specially in the winter so this really takes away any patchy skin when I use it under my makeup!! I like pairing it with rose hip seed oil when using it during my skincare routine!!! Holy Grail for dry skin
