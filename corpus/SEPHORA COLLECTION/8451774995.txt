Love this! Has a very thick cream-like consistency so it’s easy to apply a good layer on your skin. I love that it’s unscented so it’s better for sensitive skin. Thankfully, it didn’t give me any burning sensation which is great, and I didn’t have any redness after using it either. This is such a nice addition to my skincare routine to help clarify and exfoliate, and I can’t wait to start seeing the results! nan
