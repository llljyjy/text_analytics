I received this product from Sephora Collection in exchange for my honest review--I haven’t used this type of mask before so it was a new experience for me! It definitely stung a little bit(like most face mask do) but left me skin glowy and soft after. I really like the packaging and that the formula didn’t have a overwhelming scent. nan
