Really impressed by this. I finally used this today after I spent too long in the sun yesterday and got a bright red burn on my face and chest. It felt super cooling, helped with the pain and it honestly made my face and chest significantly less red in colour too!  I used the extra liquid in the pack to massage into my shoulders and burnt knees as well. Very hydrating. bye burn pain and redness!
