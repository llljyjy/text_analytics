I can’t believe this lip balm is only $7! It smells and tastes just like lychee. It is super moisturizing and I didn’t need to reapply in the middle of the day like I do other chapsticks. There is no color to the balm so can be worn with any outfit. This product was given by Sephora collection in exchange for an honest review. nan
