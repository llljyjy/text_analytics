I have the original product with amino acids , but after doing a quick view of the ingredients I noticed there isn’t much difference to the formulation other than the removal of the scent . This was my staple face wash for at least three years but unfortunately it’s become clear that this is designed for one skin type . This face wash is what I’d recommend to anyone with oily combination or oily skin , as that was my skin type a few years ago while I was still going thru puberty . For anyone with drier combination skin , this will DESTROY your skin barrier ; I use summer fridays ’jet lag’ as my facial moisturizer because this wash now strips my skin of all moisture . It , alongside niacinamide , cleared up my acne beautifully and was a perfect face wash until my skin type changed . nan
