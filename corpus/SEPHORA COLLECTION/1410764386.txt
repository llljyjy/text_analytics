Y’alllll, you NEED this mask in your life!! I’m a huge fan of any products that contain AHA/BHA but am sensitive to some, so I was super excited to try this out to see how my skin would react. I used this by itself at night and used nothing else in my routine other than my usual face wash and moisturizer, so I could see if this actually made a difference. I woke up and my skin was glowing! I also saw a great improvement in overall tone and my pore size as well. I would highlyyy recommend this to anyone - it’s an amazing product for the price! Your skin needs this!
