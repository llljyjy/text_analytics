For the first time using Sephora collection moisturizer. It’s a medium weight moisturizer. It literally melt into my skin and keeps it hydrated the entire day. I like the fact that it is affordable and quality doesn’t have to be expensive. I love using it under my makeup as a base. It’s vegan and clean moisturizer. It’s fragrance free and therefore smells not so good. I think it’s perfect for all type of skin. Affordable, and does the job.
