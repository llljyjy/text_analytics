I don’t normally write a review for anything. Bought these because I wandered into Sephora on my bday and wanted to treat myself. I have acne scars I wanted to heal up. I did not expect this glow! Yes it says glow but like, I am radiating!! And it’s not sparkles or shimmer it’s just my skin. And pores? So I have pores anymore? Nope! Gone. Make up glides on. I have sensitive skin and 1 week in, using daily, no issues, in fact no acne now.. this is a miracle. I am going to stock up, I never wanna be without these little pads. I’m telling everyone to try them! I’m not even big into beauty, just wanted a little feel better bday present. The acne scars are fading, of course the deep ones will need something more invasive. now I get how people can have a HG product
