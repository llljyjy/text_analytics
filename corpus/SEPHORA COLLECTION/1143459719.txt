These are just ok in a pinch. They aren’t as wet as I’d like (maybe mine were just old? Idk) so it takes more than one to really feel like I’m doing much of anything, and they definitely don’t remove mascara. I will use them up just to refresh my face in the mornings before my skincare routine, but for makeup removal they aren’t great. I wouldn’t repurchase. meh.
