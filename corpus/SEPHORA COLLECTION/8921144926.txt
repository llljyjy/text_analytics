If you are looking for a nice resurfacing mask, this might be it! I am a fan of the Ordinary products and this Sephora Collection Resurfacing Peel Mask is up there with them. The price point is great and it does the job. However, it is very DRYING on the skin (as most resurfacing masks are), so youâ€™ll want an amazing moisturizer to keep your skin hydrated. I only use this 1-2 months, so keep that in mind. Great Product at a Great Price
