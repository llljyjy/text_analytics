This is very hard, waxy, and has an unpleasant smell. It coats your lips in wax but they feel sticky instead of smooth and nourished. I absolutely loved the texture and smell of the old version and kept one in my car, purse, at work, and at home. I really dislike this new one, very disappointing. I donâ€™t ever review things- but had to with this one. So disappointed!
