Works great for me! I do feel like it brightens my dark under eyes but not a lot and I’ve tried it multiple times. Probably just need to keep using it tho. I like how it’s very lightweight but not a fan of the smell. It smells like something’s burnt in a very synthetic way.. idk how else to explain it Works great, not a fan of the smell
