I was not expecting to love this product so much. The Sephora brand products are always a hit or miss for me - They are either a must have or a never purchase again. This product is an example of the former for me. I bought this in the hopes that I could minimize the appearance of my pores, and I was not disappointed. Throughout my high school years, I had an obsession with squeezing out all the gunk (sebum) in my pores, and was left with enlarged pores and very red skin + some scarring. Typically you need to wait a minimum of four weeks to see results with any skin care routine, but I saw results after a week of using this! It made my pores less noticeable, and I noticed less cakeyness with my usual foundation. Another benefit was that my skin felt cleaner to me. It was the extra little step I needed after cleansing. Overall, I definitely recommend this product if you are looked to minimize pores, reduce redness due to skin swelling/irritation, and an overall brightened look. My only regret is not taking before and after photos of my face! ConsThere really aren’t any, but I like to include any drawbacks to legitimize my reviews. You get a lot of bang for your buck with this product. The bottle is a decent size for its price of $16, and cheaper than many of the other brands you find a Sephora (though in my opinion it works better than most). But because I apply using cotton pads, you need to use quite a bit of product to soak the pad and have enough to press down and hold on each section of the face. This bottle lasted me about 2 months, so it’s a little bit of an investment as a student with no income. But all in all, totally worth it and the price is actually cheap for the benefits you get so don’t let this con hold you back from trying it! Most Underrated Must Have
