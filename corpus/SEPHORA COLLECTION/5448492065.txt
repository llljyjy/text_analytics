I’m really surprised by these mixed reviews. I decided to give these a chance during the sale and I’m glad I did. I threw them in the wash and dryer in their provided bag prior to first use, and though they curled up, I laid them flat just using my fingers and they’re back to new. I also use them primarily with eye makeup remover and they work great, no fluffs of cotton coming off. It might be a quality control problem in this case, because mine are everything I wanted from this product! No problems here
