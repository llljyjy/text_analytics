I owned this for two weeks when my cat pushed it off of a shelf very low to the ground and it shattered immediately. Sure that’s mostly his fault but I also see other reviews where the product has broken/shattered so the material seems to be poor quality. In contrast my other gua sha I’ve had for a year plus has survived a lot of falls and mistreatment in my travel bag. Will be looking for a sturdier product to replace this. Shattered immediately
