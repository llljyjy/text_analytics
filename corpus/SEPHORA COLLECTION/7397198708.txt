This is a very nice option for a lip balm. The overall container stands like a lipstick, but is made out of a heavy paper material. I worry that it wouldn’t last well over time, but for now it stands very nicely. I chose a light pink color. It goes on very easily and evenly. I don’t need to apply too much to get the full moisturized effect. I think this is a great nourishing lip balm. It doesn’t have a heavy color. I received this as a gift in exchange for my honest review. A nourishing lip balm
