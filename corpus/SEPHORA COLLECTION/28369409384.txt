I received this product to sample and I was impressed with the texture and the way it feels on my skin because for a non branded private label Sephora item it moisturizes VERY well.Im impressed overall and shocked because I looked it up and the price point is very reasonable so itâ€™s good to know that quality can come at a good price overall this product does a great job at keeping my skin supple and smooth and I was able to easily put it in my bag and bring it with me to the gym.  So far so good been using it for a week and loving it so I will continue to keep using it for this harsh east coast weather. Great moisture relief
