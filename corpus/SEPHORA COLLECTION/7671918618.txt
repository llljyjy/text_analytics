I LOVE this stuff! I am 22 years old and have fairly normal skin except in my tzone where I can be oily and have large pores. A Sephora employee suggested this to me and I noticed a difference the first time using it within minutes! After only a week, my pores are so small and this stuff makes my skin feel and look tighter as well! I use it in my nightly skin routine, but I believe you can use it day, night, or both. I just suggest a sun screen if you use it during the day just to be safe. I couldnt recommend this more to someone who has large or notixeable pores! Large/noticeable pores? GET THIS!
