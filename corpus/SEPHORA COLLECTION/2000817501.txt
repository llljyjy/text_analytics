I am always on the hunt for new skin care, especially with anti aging, I recently started to notice small aging signs and have been looking for products to help with first signs of aging around the eyes and forehead. I see love that this serum is not only vegan and cruelty free but it’s so affordable! Typically serums run over $50+ so when I saw the price I knew I had to try, all of Sephora’s skin care collection that I’ve tried is amazing. I will say I’m not a 100% sold on the texture of the serum it’s like a milky texture but I did feel a bit drying yet super hydrating at the same time so that’s a plus! I love that it layers well with other serums or facial creams! affordable and great option for first signs!
