I used to LOVE Sephora masks. Theyâ€™ve since changed the product and this new formula SUCKS. No longer cooling, refreshing, invigorating, relaxing - now annoying, irritating, sticky, uncomfortable. Also the eye holes are way too small (and I have average to small eyes to begin with.). N will not be buying again. Formula changed - now these suck.
