I like this cleanser as a second step in my routine. I wouldnâ€™t say that it cleanses my makeup off, but it does leave my face feeling clean.  I also found it odd how they described this cleanser as unscented, even though it definitely has a scent.  This smells like it is coming from the ingredients used, however, so I wish they would just say it was fragrance free. Just okay
