I actually bought this peel mask in store before there were any online reviews. I just finished my first bottle and picked up my second. This peel mask is really gentle, so if you have sensitive skin it would be good for you. It has a minty cool feeling when you let it sit on your skin. For more exfoliating power, I actually leave it on longer than what the bottle says. I use it every 3 days and I keep it on for about 30 minutes and then follow my routine with a sheet mask. Itâ€™s worked great for me! My pores are not completely diminished but I definitely see a difference in my acne scarring/spots in the days after I use the mask. Very gentle and effective!
