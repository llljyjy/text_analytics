These are also a body mask, meaning that it’s VERY heavy and not completely targeted for facial skin. This isn’t advertised on the picture/description so thought I’d share.Pretty average mask. I bought all of them and didn’t see a difference between them. The fact it doubles as a body mask bothers me, bc my skin ALWAYS breaks out with dual purpose products. beware - not specifically formulated for the face
