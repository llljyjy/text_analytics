Dried out my skin so much to the point it was uncomfortable. I’ve tried a bunch of different Vitamin C serums from different brands and this was the only one that’s happened with. I stopped using it for a few days and the dryness went away and then incorporated it back into my routine to see if it caused the same problem, and it did. Dried my skin out horribly!
