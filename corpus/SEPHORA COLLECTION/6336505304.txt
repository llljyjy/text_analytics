I bought this on a whim during the VIB Rouge sale not expecting much because of the price point but I honestly LOVE it so far. It’s super gentle so can be used as a mask/peel 3x a week, it leaves my skin feeling smoother and it doesn’t tight or burn or agitate my redness, so I think it’d honestly work well for anyone with sensitive skin. And the pricepoint! You really can’t beat it. AMAZING gentle exfoliator!
