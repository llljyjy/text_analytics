Iâ€™m a big fan of Sephora brand products as I find their quality quite good and very reasonably priced. I have never heard of Bakuchiol Serum prior but read such good things about it. My skin has been so dry lately and have loved how hydrating this serum is and helps my complexion look smoother especially under makeup. Loved that it is vegan and a little goes a long way. nan
