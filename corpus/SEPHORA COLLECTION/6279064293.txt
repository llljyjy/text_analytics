This lip balm is hydrating and leaves behind a very pretty pink sheer tint! It smells like watermelon but does have a bit of a nasty taste if you accidentally lick your lips. It glides on super smoothly and It’s very  affordable for only $7! Makes a super cute gift or stocking stuffer. The packaging does feel kind of flimsy so if it gets squished at the bottom of a purse or bag the cap/holder may get distorted. Otherwise, this balm is wonderful! It’s hydrating, pretty, and affordable! A nice stocking stuffer
