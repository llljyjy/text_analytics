Amazing! I will be honest I was slightly sceptical because it was by Sephora and not a trendy brand but oh my god does it clean well my pores! I washed my face three times and my skin looks like I got a facial done! Absolute miracle worker! I can’t believe it’s only 16$.. must try My pores cleared and tightened after three uses!
