I am actually so disappointed they changed the formula for this. It used to be made in Italy and now itâ€™s made in France. You can very clearly see the significant change in quality not only in the packaging but also in the lip balm itself. It went from my favorite lip balm to an actual piece of garbage that I threw in the trash. Bring back the quality please bring back the quality please
