I have been obsessing over how soft and nourishing this balm is. I am super picky with my lip balms as they tend to be super thick or sticky, but this one literally feels like a hydrating oil. Also, it is crazy how pigmented it is for a balm and the color lasts a good 3-4 hours (which is never the case for lip balms). But the best thing, is how it is only $7!! I want to get all shades!
