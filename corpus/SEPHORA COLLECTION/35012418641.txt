I enjoy most of the Sephora Collection so I thought I would give this a try. I went through the entire thing and it has some decent moisturizing effects but I needed some real help with my dark circles (not hereditary) this cream didn’t help with those at all. I use retinA at night and this cream didn’t bother my sensitive skin at all. It would disappear into my skin and in the morning my eyes were the same as they ever were. I guess I just need some serious caffeine or something! Decent product especially for the price. I’m now using Clinique all about eyes rich cream and R.E.M. Beauty cooling eye, these two together seem to work a lot better. I guess I’m just past the age of not using a color corrector & concealer unfortunately. I would recommend this Sephora Eye Cream to anyone just starting to use eye creams, and I know some people say eye creams are unnecessary, but I’ve religiously used them since I was in my 20’s and that has definitely paid off, since I’m now in my mid 40’s and don’t really have any crows feet and very subtle under eye lines(retinA really helps & I’ve only just started that 4 months ago) Don’t forget to wear sunscreen! Hope this review helps someone out! nan
