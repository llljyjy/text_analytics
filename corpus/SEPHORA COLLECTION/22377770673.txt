this mask does make your skin glow but when reading the directions, i had used it as a quick mask and not overnight. it implies to apply a thick layer and use a cotton pad to remove. while removing the mask for the most part it did come off easily, but some areas the product rolled onto itself making it a hassle to remove. ended up having to use a wet cotton pad and came off a lot easier. will have to try as an overnight mask and may not see this issue. the product alone does a good job, feels super refreshing and does help your skin glow use as an overnight mask and not a one time use
