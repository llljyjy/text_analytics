I received a sample of this product to test through Influenster and I was super excited about the ingredients of this product as I’m VERY picky about products and chemicals I use on my body, but this product fell short, I didn’t care for the texture of the product and it dries way to fast. It also caused a stinging sensation which made me immediately wipe the product off. Meh.
