I absolutely love this product. I have been using this serum for over a year, and I plan to continue using it for a long time. I have always struggled with my pores, especially from hormonal acne on my chin from PMS. This product helps prevent some acne, and visibly shrinks my pores. Of course, it does not totally keep all acne at bay every time, but it does definitely help a lot. This product works and it is worth it! So Worth It!
