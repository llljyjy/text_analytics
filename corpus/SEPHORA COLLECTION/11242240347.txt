So I have combination skin, and using this product on combination skin was an absolute joy !! First off I absolutely love the ingredients and love the fact that 97 percent of the ingredients are NATURAL!! Secondly I really like that this serum is infused with vitamins C and E and infused with peptides from marine algae!! Thirdly it says what is does, it made my skin feel radiant and soft, I have dark spots on my face from the sun and this helps even out my skin tone !! It helps with fine lines and wrinkles to !! I will say it was a little sticky or tacky on my face but it wasn’t super bad at all ! My skin def feels hydrated after using!! I def recommend this serum if you have not tried it yet, because I actually enjoyed using this serum !! Thank yu :) ♡♡ Decent serum !!
