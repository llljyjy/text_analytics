The Sephora Prebiotics Nourishing Moisturizer soaks right up into my skin! The texture is yogurt like, but it’s light as a cloud. A big plus is that the packaging is made from cycled bottles! This is great for sensitive skin because it’s nearly all natural and unscented! It feels great. Looks great. Definitely recommend! nan
