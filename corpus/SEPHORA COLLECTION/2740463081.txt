First of all, I wish I could give this 10 stars. Absolutely love this brush & I had never used one before… I always thought they’d get dirty & introduce bacteria to my face, but I’ve been using it well over a month and that is not the case! (Just make sure you wash it & run hot water through it regularly) I love how soft my skin feels after cleansing with this! I use it every night with a face wash and it’s so gentle, but very exfoliating. YOU NEED THIS!
