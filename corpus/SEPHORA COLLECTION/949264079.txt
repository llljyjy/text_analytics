I love this lip balm! I have bought it at least 15 times over the years. It is the perfect level of hydration, has no gross aftertaste, is not gloppy and has a very light scent that I find pleasant and I am sensitive to strong scents. I put it on generously on my lips right before bed after I wash all my makeup off for the evening.  It has cured my chapped lips in the winter. I use this lip balm every night all year long including in the warmer months.  It goes on smooth and also doesnâ€™t melt or break the way the Fresh lip balms do. Perfection in a little tube! nan
