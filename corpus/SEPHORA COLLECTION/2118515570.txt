This cleansing brush is okay, not great, not horrible. I prefer to use Sephoraâ€™s silicone facial cleaning tool without a long handle. As for the brush, not sure how effective it is in helping to remove makeup. It does feel good though to massage over the face with. It is gentle and the bristles are soft. Gifted by Sephora for my honest review. Not a Must Have
