So far I’ve been loving the product for years. I’ve used maybe over 10 bottles of this serum and it makes my skin glow under SPF. I use it daily in the morning and never breaks me out or clogs my pore, I have combination skin (more on the oily side). The only reason I reduce it 1 star is because of the bottle, it’s clear so it’s very easy to be oxidized over time, but unlike the other vitamin C, it turns to a lighter color instead of orange, which makes me confused if it’s an actual vitamin C or an ascorbic acid or what!? Other than that, I’ll purchase it again if I can’t find better products since it’s affordable and it works on my skin. I’d still recommend it if you want to give it a try. My favorite so far
