First and foremost, I love that the packaging is eco-conscious. I am 30 years old and have been trying out a lot of resurfacing and peel masks and this is one of my favorites. Itâ€™s not too aggressive on my skin and leaves me with a nice glow. The gel texture is cooling and easy to apply and I love that the product is completely unscented. This is an amazing mask for the quality and the price. nan
