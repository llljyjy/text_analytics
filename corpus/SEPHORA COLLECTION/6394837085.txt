This did nothing at all. I got it on a whim because it was on sale on the counter at checkout. It smells like playdoh, it’s goopy and slimy and in the morning my lips are just as dry as they were when I went to sleep. I’m going to finish the tube because I don’t like to waste things but from now on I’ll stick with my Laneige. Meh.
