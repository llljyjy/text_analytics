I have tried all types of types of wrinkle serums and this one is one of the best. I havenâ€™t used it long enough to determine long term results but I love how it absorbs immediately into the skin without leaving a residue, which means I can wear under makeup. Also makes my face looks glowy but not shiny after application. And the price is great! Great serum at a great price
