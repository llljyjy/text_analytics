The Sephora All Day Hydrator made my skin extremely glowy and was the perfect prep for under my make up. I used it to hydrate the skin before application and it gave my makeup a glow from within while using it. I also used it alone and it gave a very natural glow! I think itâ€™s a perfect product for day to day and skin prep! Perfect for skin prep and everyday use!
