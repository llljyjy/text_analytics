So I have really liked this product, but I’ve only been using it a couple of weeks, so I haven’t seen any real results yet. It does work well to hydrate and plump my skin though and I have noticed my skin looks healthier and moisturized since using it. For the price - it’s well worth it for those points alone. I will continue to use though to see if there’s any major difference with the dark spots and update/re-review My Skin Feels Amazing
