After using this, I got a lot of breakouts. I’m not sure whether it is just a coincidence OR whether removing the hair from your face exposes your skin and makes it more prone to acne. It definitely takes the fuzz off but I’m not sure this is necessary to do. People have said to use it with oil, and then some said to use it without. Giving it 3 stars because it is just OK, but maybe there is no need to shave your face unless you absolutely have a lot of visible hair and are of darker complexion. Questionable product.
