I noticed no brightening effects which i would typically expect from a vitamin c product even after multiple uses. The scent of the product also leaves something to be desired and although not bad persay it definitely did not make me want to apply it. The texture is more watery that gel so be aware of that. But all in all it just didn’t do enough for me to continue using it in my routine. it’s not me, it’s you.
