Because I haven’t been using this long enough to see results on my skin, I can only speak to the application experience. This serum starts as an opaque milky white, then spreads out like a clear gel. It has a faint scent like a disinfectant wipe that dissipates on the skin. It layers well, doesn’t pill, and is comfortable to wear. Odd smell, nice serum
