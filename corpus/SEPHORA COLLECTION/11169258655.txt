Sephora Collection Vegan Makeup Remover and Cleansing BrushThis brush has an outer rim of soft bristles and an inner circle of silicone bristles. The brush has a total length of 6 inches - the brush head has a diameter of 1.5 inches and the handle is 4.5 inches long. It’s gentle and not too abrasive, so I’m not afraid of over-exfoliation. I gives a better clean than when using just my hands, but it doesn’t clean better than a washcloth and because of the small size it takes longer to clean your whole face than it does with a washcloth. I agree with some of the other reviewers who described the as an oversized toothbrush - it’s not really anything special and just seems unnecessary. This isn’t something I’d purchase on my own. Nothing special
