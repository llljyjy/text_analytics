There are many things that I am trying to get rid of. Such as Hyperpigemntaion and scars. I love the soft and moisturizing consistency! The Mask is fragrance-free, which is a HUGE plus for me. It has terrific ingredients that are safe to use. Not only is it a great product, but the packaging is made out of recycled plastic and cardboard. I have seen a few changes, but I cant wait to see the total result. I apply it after washing my face and let it sit for ca. 15 min it feels so good!
