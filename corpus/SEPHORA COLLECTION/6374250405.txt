✨I received this product for free from Influenster, Belif, and Sephora in exchange for my honest review.✨Here’s what I love about the Sephora Ultra Glow Serum:-It’s free of mineral oil-It’s vegan-It comes in recycled packaging-Feels silky-Smells niceWhile those are awesome pros, I have to admit I’d give this product a 3.5/5 stars at best.It goes on pretty watery and I find the application messy because it’s constantly slipping through my fingers.It dries pretty quickly, but my face feels tacky/sticky for 10-15 minutes after application.Lastly, I’ve tried other Vitamin C serums that I NOTICE. Like, glowing skin IMMEDIATELY, and this one just didn’t hit like that. It’s certainly not terrible, but it’s not going to become my go-to serum.Still grateful for the opportunity to try something new! Not my favorite
