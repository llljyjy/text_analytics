I received this product in exchange for an honest review. My favorite thing about Sephora products is that they are insanely affordable well also being usually pretty good. I found this glow serum to be much better than several of the other products that I’ve tried by them, and definitely one of their better ones. I suffer from bad acne and I’ve been in Accutane for a while. I do feel like this is just as effective as some of the other serums that I’ve been trying as I’ve been going forth on my process fixing my face. I can definitely see this being a low end solution especially over the holidays when things are inevitably more expensive than they should be Great cheap alternative
