Packaging is cute but feels like it could easily get crushed in my bag. I got the shade watermelon, I do like the shade. Reminds me of watermelon lipsmackers( through back to the 90’s). The scent is a little strong so if you don’t like scented things, this might not be the lip balm for you. Overall, very smooth on the lips & is very pretty shade. nan
