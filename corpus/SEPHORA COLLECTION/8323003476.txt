Love the packaging of these lip balms! I love how bright and colorful they are, with the pictures of fruit. I got the cherry lip balm and it absolutely reminds me of classic cherry chapstick. Very nostalgic. I also really enjoy that it adds a nice touch of color to the lips. My three year old daughter is a huge fan! Nostalgia for days!
