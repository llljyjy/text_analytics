I like this item. So travel friendly. I went on a week long vacation to the beach and just popped one mask on my face before getting ready, while I am doing things like ironing my clothes. Itâ€™s really hydrating and my skin felt calmed and soothed. I am always going to carry a pack with me on my vacays. I hope Sephora continues to sell them Must have item in your travel bag
