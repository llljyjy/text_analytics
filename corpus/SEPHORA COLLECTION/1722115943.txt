I love Sephora and have used a number of Sephora Collection products, including lip balms. I hoped to like this one but unfortunately just didn’t. The color was subtle and pretty, but it smelled like a crayon and wasn’t as moisturizing as other SC lip products. Won’t be repeating this purchase. Disappointed
