I received this complimentary from Influenster First off, the price for this serum is very budget friendly. $20 for 1 oz when others are probably at least $50 + is pretty good (especially if you can catch it on sale during the Sephora sale). It has a very watery consistency and does provide an initial glow. However, I havenâ€™t seen any long lasting results. If you are new to the serum world, this may be a good starter. I most likely will not purchase in the future since I have been using vitamin c for awhile. A good starter for someone new to serums
