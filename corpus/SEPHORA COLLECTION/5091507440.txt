I purchased this bottle earlier in the year based on a recommendation after a facial. When I repurchased recently I was confused because the bottle was smaller in ounces/size at the same price. I didnâ€™t think I ordered the same product. First purchase I bought 1.69 ounces, just this week on my repurchase it is 1 ounce. I do enjoy this product very much (clearly repurchased) but was surprised about the change. Something to note so you are aware as a  repeat customer. Ounces not the same
