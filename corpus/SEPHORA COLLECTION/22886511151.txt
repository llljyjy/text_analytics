I have been trying the serum since past one week. Iâ€™m using this daily in my a.m. and p.m. skin care routine right after I tone my skin, I love the glow- it has kind of a milky glow when you apply it on your skin. Kinda brightens and its a very quick absorbing serum. My skin feels even toned and clean def will be using this for a month to see long term results. incredible
