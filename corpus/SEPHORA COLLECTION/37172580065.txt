I really like this product, I feel like it has made a major difference in my skin and helped me with dark spots. It feels very lightweight and is fragrance free which is a huge plus for me. I also love that this product is vegan and affordable. Quality doesnâ€™t always have to be pricey and this serum proved it to me! nan
