I’ve only had this product a few days so I haven’t used it enough to see any results yet. The mushroom one smells awesome!! It doesn’t leave a sticky residue after it absorbs. The packaging however is terrible. It took at least 20 pumps to even get it started. The shape of the pump is so awkward too. It’s almost rounded at the top so it’s difficult to grip and totally uncomfortable to use. I wouldn’t buy again but I’m not super disappointed being that I got this item on sale. Terrible Packaging
