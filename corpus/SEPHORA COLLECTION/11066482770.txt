When I saw this product had caffine in it I was all in. Battling fatigue & overwork my blood is actually about 90% caffiene. The surprise was what a good product this is too.  Light not sticky or smelly and eyes not only looked brighter but felt brighter too.  Of course if your eyes are very deep set there may be small irritation in outside corners of the eyes but quickly clears up if avoid those areas when applying.  Will buy again. Pleasant Surprise
