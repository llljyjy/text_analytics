I didn’t have many expectations from this product because of the price but I was so wrong. The product doesn’t have to be expensive to give a great quality and Sephora proves it with this beautiful product.First of all the packaging is pretty and eye catching, also travel friendly. It has lightweight gel texture  which foams moderately. My skin feels so fresh and clean afterwards. The most important is doesn’t strip off natural oils which is amazing. If you are after clean and vegan cleanser, this is your answer. Affordable but effetcive
