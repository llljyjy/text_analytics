I have been looking for a good pore serum for so long and I think I finally found it. The best part is that it’s not too expensive. It’s also vegan and clean. Even after only using for a few days I feel a change in my skin. My skin is sensitive but it doesn’t feel like it’s burning or irritated after I use it. I love it. I will keep purchasing this over and over. will help your pores!
