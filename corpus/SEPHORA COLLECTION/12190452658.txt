This is my first time purchasing/using an eye cream. I struggle with dull/dry under eyes as well as dark circles. Prior to using this product, my concealer always looked dry and sort of patchy no matter what type of concealer I was using (both high-end and drugstore). I thought that using my face moisturizer under my eyes was enough, but then did some researching. Now I know that our under eyes typically are more sensitive/different than the rest of our skin because it’s thinner. I was not looking to spend lots of money on an eye cream since the biggest problem I have with my under eyes is really just the dryness. Seeing that this eye cream has hyaluronic acid, I decided to give it a try. I have been using it in the am and pm for a few days now and can say that I have definitely seen a difference in how my concealer applies and also the overall look of my under eyes. They look brighter and overall healthier. My eyes don’t water when using this product and my skin also has not reacted badly as of yet! It is also fragrance free which is a bonus.I recommend this eye cream for those who are just starting with this skincare step/only problem is dryness/dullness under the eyes! Great for starters
