I like how thick and sturdy the strip is and was easy to put on and pull off. However, after it was all done and over with I saw lots of yucky stuff in the strip but it wasnâ€™t all of it. I sat there with a tool and got out at least as much on my own after the strip. It may be because I had a lot built up and may work better for someone with smaller pores. For me it worked same as the pack of 10 strips for $7 at Walmart. Good quality but not the best results.
