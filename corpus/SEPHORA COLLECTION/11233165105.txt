This is my first skincare item to try from the Sephora line.  This can be used AM and PM and feels very lightweight.  It blends out easily.  Feels very hydrating.  It does give a brightening effect to the under eye area so make sure to use this under my makeup and not just at night.  There is no added fragrance, but I do smell a slight scent if I hold the jar up to my nose, but donâ€™t smell any scent when applying it.   Will keep using. Lightweight, hydrating and brightening
