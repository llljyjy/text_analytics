I LOVE this! My lips are always chapped, and in the winter, they get so bad I wake from them, and often they are bleeding. This does EXACTLY what I was hoping for. You put it on your finger and apply liberally before bed. Yes, it feels like it isn’t going to soak in. Don’t worry, it is, but this is the “mask“ part. It stays on your lips for most of the night. When I wake up, my lips feel softer than ever! A bonus: my mouth doesn’t feel quite as dry in the morning either. I thought that was a coincidence until I forgot to apply a few times. It doesn’t have a strong flavour, but the flavour it does have is yummy. I went from never using lip masks to never wanting to go without one again! It came to my rescue!
