I was looking for an affordable and effective daily face moisturizer since the winter has drastic sucked the moisture from my face. I decided to pick this up while it was 30 percent off and I can definitely say...it is amazing stuff. I had to go back and buy two more. My foundation sits on top of this moisturizer beautifully. No need to prime. And also, dry patches be gone! My new favorite. Great for dry skin and under makeup
