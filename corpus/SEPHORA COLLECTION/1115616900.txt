I’ve been enjoying this anti-aging serum in my nighttime routine. The texture feels lightweight  and fast absorbing. It doesn’t irritate my skin like other retinol products.  I’ve noticed positive changes in my skin’s texture and my skin looks smoother. I look forward to continuing using it in my routine. Gentle and effective
