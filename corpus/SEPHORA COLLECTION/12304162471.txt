I reiceved this product and love using it when I’m wearing a lot of make up with my cleansing balm to get everything off my skin. It helps get even thick glitter and waterproof makeup off easily without having to rub my skin raw or soak it off with make up remover. It’s not something I use everyday, but definitely a helpful and affordable tool! Helpful for Makeup Removal
