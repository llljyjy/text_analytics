It is super effective. I like to take off my makeup then go in with this because I like to double cleanse. It makes my skin feel super soft and not dry or tight after. It has not irritated my sensitive skin. I feel like it would be a great fit for anyone and the price is amazing! Thereâ€™s really no strong scent which is great too. Sephora Collection gifted me to this product, but the opinions are completely my own based on my experience gentle cleanser
