I only been using this product for a few times, but my first impression is high! I like the consistency of the serum. When I added it to my skincare routine, it was pretty thin... which I think is a plus because I donâ€™t like for my skincare to feel greasy or heavy. It is a milky serum. Also, the packaging is recycled which I think is a great step in the right direction for Sephora. It is also vegan! Lightweight and easy to add to a routine!
