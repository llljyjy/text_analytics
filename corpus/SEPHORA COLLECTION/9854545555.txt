LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! I’ve tried so many lip balms but this one is still one of my favorite. It’s literally like butter for your lips. It glides on so smooth and keeps my lips hydrated all day. My chapped lips are loving it! I have the Lychee one and while it doesn’t smell like Lychee to me, the scent is soft and fruity. It leaves a beautiful sheer pink/coral tone on my lips. It offers the best results at affordable price for only $7, which is a real deal. Looking forward to trying them all! nan
