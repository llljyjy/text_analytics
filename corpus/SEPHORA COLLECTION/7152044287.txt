I really like sephora collection products but this doesn’t work for me. I have dark circles I have used their eye cream in the past too. This doesn’t irritate my eyes or burns my under eyes but other than that doesn’t do much in hiding or treating my dark circles. It’s just a nice soothing eye moisturizer but I don’t see much difference in my dark circles. nice moisturizer
