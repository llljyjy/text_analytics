It’s perfect for what it’s needed for. My only complaint is I would like a different color option. It’s compact, cute, holds just enough, and durable. I don’t know what the other users are doing to theirs to cause them to break. I’ve had mine for nearly two years. My husband actually “stole” or from me and colored it with a sharpie. He loves it too, sans the color. nan
