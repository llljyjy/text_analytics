I had help from one of the sephora employees at the store, he recommended me this product, it didn’t help what I was really looking at.My skin was dry before I got this product and I told him I needed something for my acne prone skin and for my clogged pores. It didn’t help with that, it made my skin normal but it i’ve been using it for almost two weeks and it made my skin break out more and made my skin red really easily. nan
