I have chronic pain and I have a pill case for my daily use but I keep a spare daily dose of everything in this so I donâ€™t miss a beat when I sleep over at a friends/boys house or do an overnight trip.  Has enough room for two days and I take like 15 pills (meds and supplements) a day. This Lives in my Little Fanny Pack
