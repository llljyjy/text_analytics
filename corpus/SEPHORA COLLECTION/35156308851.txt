The Sephora Collection eye cream is very rich and nourishing. I especially like that it contains caffeine to help with puffiness. A little goes a long way so this jar will last me a long time. It is also vegan and fragrance free which is great if you have sensitive eyes. This cream did not burn or cause any irritation. Since testing it,  I have seen some improvement. I still have some darkness and puffiness but it is not as severe as before. It has definitely helped alleviate my under eye circles and puffiness. nan
