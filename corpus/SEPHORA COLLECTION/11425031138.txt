First time using a product like this that’s gel based, but I honestly liked it a lot more than I thought I would. It’s easy to use, it really cleanses your face and leaves it feeling clean and soft. It’s super easy to wash off and doesn’t leave any residue. It does the job. I would still cleanse with an oil based product to remove make up first, and then follow up with this cleanser if you’re trying to remove make up. nan
