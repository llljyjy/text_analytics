I love this moisturizer. It isn’t anything that fancy but it definitely does the job and moisturizes your skin. A lot of moisturizers have broke my skin out in the past, but this one is totally a safe option for acne prone skin. I definitely recommend if your just looking for a simple and nice moisturizer. doesn’t cause break outs
