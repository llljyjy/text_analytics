The lip balm I got is the coconut flavor. At first I was skeptical about how the scent was going to turn out, but I was pleasantly surprised! The coconut scent is just right, not too oily and it reminds me of hawaii so much. The lip balm is light on the skin and easy to apply. It kept my lips feeling moisturized for hours. Since itâ€™s coconut, there are no colors which I love! The packaging is a chunky cardboard-like tube. It feels very sustainable. So moisturizing!
