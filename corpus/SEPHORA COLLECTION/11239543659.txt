I received this product from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. I have been using this product for the past two weeks and I am fairly pleased with the results. It has left my skin feeling extra soft and moisturized, but I wouldnâ€™t say my skin is necessarily glowing. Also the consistency of this product is hard to work with because it soaks into the skin very quickly which makes it difficult to get an even application, and it is very watery. A great addition to a moisturizer for the winter
