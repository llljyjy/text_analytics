I’ve only been using this product for about a week, but I already see an improvement in my skin! I don’t have a ton of dark spots on my face, but do have some on my neck, and so I was super excited to see this vegan, clean, and affordable product from Sephora! I’ve had great luck with Sephora Collection in the past, and have found that they have great quality for the price! I would definitely recommend, and I’ve already gotten a bottle for my mom! Works great!
