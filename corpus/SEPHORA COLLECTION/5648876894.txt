My skin is extemely dry and I do not like cleansers that strip away even the essential moisture out of the skin.  I have been using clean skin gel cleanser for a couple of weeks and I have been noticing how hydrated and Glowy my skin looks. All of the high points of face glow and skin looks fresh. I highly recommend this product Hydrated skin
