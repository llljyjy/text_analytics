I have been searching for a product to help me blur and minimize the appearance of my pores, so I was very excited to try this BHA and PHA targeted pores serum. I love how the price point is very attainable showing that a good product doesn’t need to be expensive! I really like that this product is vegan and clean as well now that I’m trying to live a more clean lifestyle. After using this product for the first time I immediately noticed that my pores seemed to be minimized and my skin felt very soft and didn’t have a lot of texture. Will definitely continue using this product! MY NEW GO TO PORES SERUM
