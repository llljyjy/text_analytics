I used to buy the Honey Lip Scrub and the Almond Lip Balm for years. They must have discontinued it and then reformulated them. I am in need of a new lip scrub, so I thought I would try this. Smells okay, leaves a nasty taste and film on your lips. Didn’t exfoliate at all....This new formula is trash... at best. Please bring back the old flavors and formulas! I am only giving this one star cuz that’s the lowest rating I can give. I would give it zero stars if it was permitted. Bring back the old flavors and formula!!!
