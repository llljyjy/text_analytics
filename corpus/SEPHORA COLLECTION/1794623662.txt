I got a sample version to try this product out through influenster and really like it so far. It’s made my skin appear brighter and less dull. The product has a nice light scent which is perfect because i can’t stand heavily scented products. The texture is light and feels perfect for regular use! I think it’s comparable to the more high end vitimin c serums out there! Great serum
