I have never been a fan of masks (especially sheet masks due to plastic waste) but picked one of these up when my skin was particularly angry from a bad run with retinols.  I was pleasantly surprised by how my skin felt after! It seems to stay on pretty well (I had envisioned having to lie still while wearing) and after removing and patting my face dry (didn’t rinse) my skin felt great! Very moisturized and super soft.  Still felt nice and smooth the next morning. Although I don’t see myself using masks too often, I do think I’ll try to work these into my routine once or twice a month. Can’t beat the price too!
