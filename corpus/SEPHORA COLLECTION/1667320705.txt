Quality doesn’t always mean expensive. I love the consistency of this vegan, clean moisturizer. It’s a great winter moisturizer. It absorbs well and doesn’t feel sticky. The only thing I don’t like is the fragrance. It really lingers. Other than that, it’s great. You can also use it as an overnight mask if you layer it on thick before bed. nan
