I swear by Drunk Elephant’s cleansing balm, but the price tag is a bit hard on the wallet. This balm DOES NOT have the same texture. It is not an oil, and feels more like a gel. However, it works quite well. It’s not as effective as an oil, but for my oily skin, it seems to lead to fewer breakouts than oily balms. I always follow with a water based cleanser. Nice for oily skin
