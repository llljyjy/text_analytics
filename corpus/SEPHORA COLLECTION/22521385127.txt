Tried this since they discontinued the AMA Clean Skin Gel Cleanser which I LOVED. This is NOT a good replacement it completely broke me out. I guess i will have to find something else. I will say sephora online beauty advisor is working on finding me something with similar ingredients, which i appreciate. Broke me out :( NOT a replacement for AMA Cleanser
