Nice and cute little lip balm! Always fun to find a Sephora brand product I like since theyâ€™re less expensive than the other brands they carry. This lip balm is best for casual, everyday use. The texture is very thin and smooth, and I like the coconut scent. It feels good on my lips and seems to actually absorb into them after a while. For times when my lips are super dry, I want something a lot thicker and heavy duty. nan
