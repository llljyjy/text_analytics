The Sephora Collection Clean Lip Balm in Watermelon is so fruity and amazing! I love the beautiful color it gives and the smell is so nice! My lips feel nourished and look hydrated! The color last a long time too! The price point at $7 is so affordable! Also love the cute packaging! Love the watermelon!
