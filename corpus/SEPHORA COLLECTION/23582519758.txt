Super impressive! Not only is this moisturizer rated high as not toxic and safe in my app that I check products for dangerous ingredients but it works so well! I was using a Tatcha moisturizer in the purple container that I loved but actually love this one better, which is a huge plus because it’s A LOT more affordable. My normal to dry skin loves it. Leaves a soft, firm, non greasy feel. I’ve been using a month now and no breakouts, doesn’t feel heavy, it’s moisturizing, lines are softer, and my skin is glowing. I will purchase again. nan
