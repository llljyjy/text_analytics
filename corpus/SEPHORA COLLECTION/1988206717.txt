This tool has been a great addition to my routine. I don’t use it daily but when I wear a full face of makeup it’s nice to use.  I purchased one myself to keep in my shower that’s how much I loved it. I use a face oil to remove any makeup and then I apply my cleanser to the brush and gently in circular motion I cleanse my face. It doesn’t irritate my skin but I have very dry patches around my chin/mouth area and this hasn’t cause any irritation. Highly recommend and it’s a great price point as well. Great little tool!
