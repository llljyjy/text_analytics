I am a lip balm addict.  I have tried tons of lip balms on the market and I honestly really like this one.  It glides onto my lips and doesn’t feel waxy like some others I’ve tried. It leaves my lips feeling soft and smooth.  I’ve only tried the coconut so far, but would love to try some of the others. The coconut really gives the summer beauty vibes. Very hydrating and not waxy!
