I bought these to pair with my Sephora BrandTriple Action Cleansing Water - Cleanse + Purify.The fact that they have a soft side and an exfoliating side is amazing although I really only have had to use the soft side. The pads are pretty big, not quite sure how they compare to others, but itâ€™s more than enough to remove all of my makeup.I fully intend on getting another set (mostly because I only do a load of laundry maybe every two weeks). 100% Will Buy More!!
