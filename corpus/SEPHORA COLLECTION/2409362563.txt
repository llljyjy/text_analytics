My skin is somewhat sensitive to retinol so I like using Bakuchoi serums instead. I am glad that Sephora has this serum and it is not expensive, plus it has clean and vegan formulation. The texture is milky, the scent is not noticeable. I do feel the immediate hydration on my skin. It is not sticky. It will take time to see if it helps with my fine line, but I do believe hydration is the key to prevent wrinkles. A good retinol alternative! nan
