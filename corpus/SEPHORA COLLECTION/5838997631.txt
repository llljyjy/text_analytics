I really liked this vitamin c serum! However, this sample was so small that it’s hard to really honestly say if I felt it made a difference on my skin. I have redness on my face and vitamin c has in the past really helped with redness/irritation. I’m definitely interested in trying maybe a full size of this product. Has potential!
