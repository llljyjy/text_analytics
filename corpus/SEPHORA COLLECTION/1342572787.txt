Sephora PLEASE bring back the original formula wipes, this “clean” version is so inferior that I’m going back to purchasing Neutrogena hydro boost wipes. As many other reviews have noted the texture, the effectiveness, the scent…everything about these is different and not in a good way. Now seeing that the old version/formula is sold out of almost every type/scent online and that they aren’t even carried in stores at all anymore is so disappointing. BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL FORMULA!
