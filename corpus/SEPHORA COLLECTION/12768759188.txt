It’s a huge plus that this Targeted Pores Serum is 100% clean and vegan. It has become a staple step in my skincare routine morning and evening. I can’t get over how much my skin looks healthier and more radiant just after using for a few weeks daily. This serum doesn’t have a greasy or heavy feeling, it helped even and tone my skin. It does not irritate my sensitive skin. And is a super affordable product! Love this serum
