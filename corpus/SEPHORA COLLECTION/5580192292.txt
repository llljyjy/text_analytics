Tried to use these to cleanse my face after sinus surgery & it was a disaster. They irritated my sensitive skin & left it red & splotchy (even with gentle wiping since these are textured). Left a film on my skin that I had to clean off w/Micellar water. Coconut smell was very chemical and not at all natural. Used once & returned. Iâ€™m disappointed in these for sure. So not worth it. not worth it at all
