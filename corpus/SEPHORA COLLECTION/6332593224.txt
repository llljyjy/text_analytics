I typically don’t enjoy gel cleansers for the small fact that they don’t lather or foam well which makes me feel like I’m rubbing a mixture of gel and water on my face. This cleanser is different, it lathers and foams so well and doesn’t make my skin feel dry afterwards. I also love the fact that it’s apart of Sephoras “clean” line and it’s super affordable as well! nan
