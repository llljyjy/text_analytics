I received a sample size of this product through Influenster. It’s something I probably would not have bought on my own because most serums tend to make my oily-combo skin feel extra greasy, but not this one! Between this and a new cleanser, my face has been feeling so much softer and brighter and more dewey than greasy. I think I’ll have to snag a full sized bottle for myself when my sample runs out! Dewey Not Greasy!
