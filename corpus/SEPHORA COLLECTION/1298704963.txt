Love this eye cream, it’s the most effective I’ve found so far. Perfectly moisturizing, not greasy and fine to wear under concealer. After only using for a week, I’ve noticed it is already effective against under eye bags & puffiness. I also have very sensitive skin and it has not caused breakout or irritation. Hasn’t done much yet for my dark under eye circles yet, though. nan
