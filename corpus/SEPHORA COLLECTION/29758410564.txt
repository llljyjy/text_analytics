I got this product in a complementary VoxBox from Influenster to try and I liked it. It makes my skin have a bit of a morning glow and I really like that. However, the formula is very watery or like liquid, so I feel like I’m using more product than I need to. Also, throughout they day my skin looked oily, which it doesn’t usually do. Sample is okay, won’t be buying
