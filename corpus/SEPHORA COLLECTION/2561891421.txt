I really didn’t like the combo of silicone + bristles on this brush. It doesn’t distribute my cleansing foam any better than using my own fingers. The silicone in the middle feels uncomfortable on the face and doesn’t do anything for me. Turns out I am not even using it. I would have liked this better if it was just a soft normal brush to make a foam with my cleanser and spread it over my face. I don't get why half of it is made of silicone
