So I got these products in Vitamin E and B3, and for the price I must say they really took me by surprise. I love the smell and the smooth effect it leaves on my skin which makes my makeup go on so smooth. Has not caused any breakage on my skin and infact has made it even less dry then before. I would highly recommend this product A must buy!
