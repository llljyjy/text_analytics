I received this product from Sephora Collection in exchange for my honest review. I have very sensitive skin and so many products break me out and I had a great experience with this product. Itâ€™s super gentle and makes my skin feel moisturized and not dry afterwards. I remove all my makeup with a cleansing oil then went in with this after and my skin felt very nice after. The price is amazing and this is a great option for anyone. The ingredients are great and it has no strong scent. I definitely enjoy this product. Lovely cleanser for an amazing price
