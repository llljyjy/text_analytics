The pump is cheap and hard to use. It is not a goos shape to control where is squirts. Your finger tends to slide off half way through pressing it. Using two hands helps but then you still don’t have control over how much comes out or where it goes. Even if I squirt it directly on my face it still ends up everywhere.The product is pretty good. It had helped with clearing up my skin. I still wouldn’t recommend it because it isn’t anything worth putting up with the packaging. Product is good but the packaging is bad
