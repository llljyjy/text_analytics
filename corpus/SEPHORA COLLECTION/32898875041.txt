I have acne scars and some sun spots on my face and have not found anything that helps so i tried this! SO glad i did because Iâ€™ve only been using it for 10 days but have already noticed an improvement in my overall complexion. I use it on my face and neck 2x a day and follow with moisturizer or spf (in am). This is great for my sensitive skin nan
