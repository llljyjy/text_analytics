Bought this in a kit to try them out, so it didn’t come with the full size container. The only info on the packaging is almost completely in other languages aside from a small piece in English under the flap that tells you to discontinue if you notice irritation, and that it may increase risk of sunburn…I assume maybe the instructions aren’t on there because of the sample sized packaging…so I go to your website and under the product page, I click “how to use” and the only info you’ve supplied is how to recycle the packaging? Come on Sephora, this is your product. I maybe would have rated it higher if I knew what I was supposed to be doing with these, or what their desired effect is supposed to be. Why is it so hard to find instructions for use?
