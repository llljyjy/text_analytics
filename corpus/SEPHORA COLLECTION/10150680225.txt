I really loved using this for my face. It was especially helpful as a way to relax my jaw muscles after a stressful day. I’d put it in my fridge/freezer in a container and then use it with some moisturizer for a nice cold rolling effect. Amazing especially during our hot summers.Unfortunately, it didn’t last long as it snapped right in half about 2 weeks after I started using it! Very disappointed. I didn’t bother trying to return or exchange it since it’s such a hassle and I got it on sale. I would replace it after the snapping, but twenty bucks is just too expensive for an item that isn’t made to really last through regular use. Two Ends? More like Two Pieces!
