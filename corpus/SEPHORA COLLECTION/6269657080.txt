I got this is Lychee, and it’s a great affordable tinted lip balm at $7! I like that it’s a pretty light tint so it looks natural but does provide a bit of color when layered on. It also smells good and the packaging is cute! It hydrates my lips and leaves them soft. If it had spf that would make it even more perfect! Lovely tinted lip balm
