This was a bit odd. The serum is extremely watery and liquidy (moreso than a typical serum) so it soaks into the skin fast. However the feeling that’s left is an odd powdery feel. Opposite of the claims on the packaging. I found my makeup did not sit well over this at all. I tried shaking it very well before trying each time. It’s not something I’d want to use at night either. Not for my dry skin type
