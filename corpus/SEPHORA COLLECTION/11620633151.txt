Iâ€™ve used the original formula in the jar in the past and i was excited about trying the new reformulated version. I prefer the original version.This texture feels more like a body lotion than a face moisturizer. While fast absorbing, glowy, and hydrating, I feel greasy and like there is a residue left on my face. It pilled up when applied with other products, so not something I would recommend using under make up.2 stars for being budget friendly, vegan, and clean. I would rate it 4 stars and recommend IF it were marketed as a hand cream or body lotion. Not as good as original
