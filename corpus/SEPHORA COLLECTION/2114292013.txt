This product is ok.  Didn’t cause breakout or no strong perfume. But what I don’t understand is why Sephora has to change its most basic product- basic cleaner.  The original cleaner worked better, cleansed better, smelled better.  It was 99% natural ingredients.  Now they also raised the price not 10% but more than 30% for a cleaner. It’s so annoying. Why change what was perfect?!
