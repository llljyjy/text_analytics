I’ve been using this every morning and evening on my face for ~1 week now. I can happily report: no breakouts, dryness, bad reactions. Still need to give it some time for the evening out of skin tone... but glad that it has no negative effects so far. Honestly surprised that it truly is unscented - smells like absolutely nothing. Love that it’s clean, vegan, with a short ingredient list. So far so good! So far so good
