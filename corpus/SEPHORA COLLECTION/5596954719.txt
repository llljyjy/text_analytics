The Sephora Ultra Glow serum helped give me glow to my skin and provide my skin instant moisture. The serum is easy to use and glide on my skin easily. I did find it to be tacky when I first use it but afterwards when it settled into my skin it was no longer tacky. I did like that it help give glow to my skin when it is dry and dull. The serum also provides extra moisture and evens the skintone. Help even my skintone
