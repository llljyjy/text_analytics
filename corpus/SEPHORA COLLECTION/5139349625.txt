If you want something cooling and moisturizing, these eye masks are for you. Other than that they don’t really do much and I would argue that if you leave them on for too long that they could be drying to the delicate undereye area. I don’t regret this purchase at all since I used these during a self care night but they’re nothing to write home about really. Not a holy grail, but not bad for the price.
