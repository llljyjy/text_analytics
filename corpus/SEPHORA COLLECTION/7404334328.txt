This moisturizer works really well. I use it in am/pm after my cleansing routine.  I like that it is fragrance free. I also have really sensitive skin, dry combo skin. This product did not irritate my skin and kept it feeling hydrated and moisturized. I love a clean beauty product and this is great to add in your skincare routine. nan
