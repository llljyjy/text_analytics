I absolutely love this product - it removed all my makeup including mascara with ease though I of course had to work the eye area a little bit more which I’ve had to do with other cleansers.  Difference is that this one isn’t scented and so the area didn’t feel raw or tender after application - will definitely be using this regularly! A game changer
