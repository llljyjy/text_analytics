Quality doesn’t have to be expensive! This vegan, clean product is awesome for the price point and really gives the same effects as a $60+ serum. It’s super light weight and doesn’t feel like anything on the skin and is great for morning and night. I see a big difference in my pores and blackheads after using this product for just a few weeks so I can’t wait to continue to use this serum for more results. Sephora Collection is so worth it and a great bang for your buck! Blackheads be gone!
