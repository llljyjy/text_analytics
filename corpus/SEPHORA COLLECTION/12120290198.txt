I’ve tried the watermelon Vitamin E mask in both the warmer and cooler months and feel like it’s alright. It doesn’t irritate my skin but I wouldn’t say it standouts amongst other masks with similar claims. I should preface that opinion, which is my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Member, as an opinion of someone who has gone through a ton of masks with similar claims and as such, may have be really picky about my hydrating masks.This is on the richer, thicker side as far as hydrating masks go. Even so, it spreads smoothly and easily. The scent is subtle. I can pick up some watermelon in the scent but it is very faint; what I pick up more prominently smells of a fruity-floral blend. It’s pleasant though slightly synthetic. My skin feels lightly hydrated after washing off the mask with lukewarm water and a wash cloth, but not more so than most hydrating masks. I’ve also used this on my hands, legs and feet but not as a mask, more as a lotion / cream, and it does a nice job in the warmer months when I need something hydrating and moisturizing but not heavy or greasy. This feels light on the skin and does not leave behind a residue or film. nan
