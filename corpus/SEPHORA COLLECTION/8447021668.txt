I am in love with this serum! It’s so lightweight and fast absorbing. There is no scent to it so it’s great for even the most sensitive skins. It’s 96% natural ingredients formula which is great. Another great thing is the price point. You don’t have to spend tons of money to get good quality. I do recommend this serum to you all.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. Great, lightweight, affordable- me love this!
