I have bought the exfoliating wipes from Sephora for years. And I used to LOVE them. Sadly they changed themâ€¦for the worse. They have changed the wipes themselves, they do not have the same great texture and they are hard to get out of the package.  Even worse, you now get 5 LESS wipes per package and they INCREASED the price! As soon as I find a comparable alternative, I will be switching. Please bring back the OLD formulation please! Now you get less but they cost more!
