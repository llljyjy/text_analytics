I’m a longtime fan of Sephora collection products, but this pill case is not it. Cheaply made, hard to open as the compartment doors are so delicate. I take v good care of my stuff and still managed to break it, v disappointed if the quality. I have another plastic pill case in a similar style that has been going strong for 7 years now, there’s no reason for this one to break on me after a couple of months. It’s too bad because the design is quite practical and aesthetically pleasing. Just don’t expect much in terms of durability. cute but too fragile
