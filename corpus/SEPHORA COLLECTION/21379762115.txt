I received a complementary sample of this serum from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. I have been using it for the past two weeks in the morning before my sunscreen. It is a nice serum, and I do notice that my skin is glowing and is somewhat brighter than before. I will continue to use it and I will buy a full size bottle of this as soon as my sample runs out. Nice serum
