I received this product from Sephora collection in exchange for my honest review. I am so impressed with this peel mask from Sephora my skin has improved so much it looks brighter my acne spots are nearly visible , I rarely wear any makeup Iâ€™m so pleased with this product. Note if your sensitive I would be careful work your way up with this product but other than that I love it . great restoring mask
