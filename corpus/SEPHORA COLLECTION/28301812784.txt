My favorite things about this product is that it’s vegan, clean and inexpensive! I love when products are of good quality and aren’t outrageously expensive. This cleanser is a game changer. It doesn’t dry my skin out at all and it actually leaves my skin feeling hydrated. I use this both day and night. I love that it’s unscented so it’s  perfect for sensitive skin nan
