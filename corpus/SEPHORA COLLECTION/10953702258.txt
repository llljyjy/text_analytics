I’ve been using this eye cream for more than a week in my morning skincare routine. I love that it is a very lightweight texture. It’s easily absorbed onto my skin while leaving my under eyes hydrated and feeling silky. I especially love to use this eye cream under my makeup, because it doesn’t disturb my concealer, but instead it allows it to slide easily and avoid my concealer to settling into my fine lines or look dry.
