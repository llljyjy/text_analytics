it’s been years since i’ve found a great cleanser that i now swear by! i have combination skin, oily on my T zone & dry/combo everywhere else! my face feels so fresh & clean after using & it doesn’t irritate or cause redness like other products i’ve tried! it’s worth every penny! highly recommend this cleanser! throwing out all other cleansers!
