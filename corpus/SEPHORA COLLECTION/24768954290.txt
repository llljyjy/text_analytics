I received a complimentary sample of this product in exchange for my honest review. Overall this product felt nice on my skin. It has a light fresh scent that isn’t overpowering. It is very runny when you go to apply it though which I wasn’t the biggest fan of. My skin always feels nice after I apply this serum but I can’t say that I have noticed a big difference in my skin.
