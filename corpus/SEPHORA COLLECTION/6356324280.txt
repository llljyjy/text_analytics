This moisturizer is definitely a good bang for your buck! It is a nice thin consistency and feels soothing on the skin. I have dry sensitive skin and I feel like itâ€™s decently hydrating without being overly thick. I love the price point for this product compared to other moisturizers! Great monetary value!
