Finally found my holy grail moisturizer and it’s not expensive!! Doesn’t make me greasy, so moisturizing, repaired my skin barrier, even my pores look less congested???? Only downside is that I would love it in a bigger size! Hands down best moisturizer I’ve ever used. This is after 2 weeks of using it best moisturizer!!
