This moisturizer is lovely! It’s lightweight yet makes my skin feel so soft and hydrated. I use it both morning and night and I’ve notice my dry skin is so much better. Even my neck area is more hydrated because of this. And it’s a holy grail for its price point. A must have for me! A Drink for Dry Skin!
