By no means has this product been life changing for me, but things that I have noticed and like about this product is that it has a non-sticky formula, layers well with other products, looks good under makeup, inexpensive, and didnâ€™t cause breakouts. I would say this is a good starter or introductory skincare product for beginners. nan
