The product is a little watery and left my skin a little sticky/tacky feeling. It felt like it gave some moisture to my skin but I didnâ€™t really see a glow on my face. I have used better vitamin C serums and have seen instant results from others. I received this product from influencer for testing purposes. Alright product.
