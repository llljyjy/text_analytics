I’m super impressed by this moisturizer! It has a whipped-like texture and feels great on the skin. The quality is similar to other more expensive creams I’ve used. It’s super hydrating and a great value for the price point! I also love that it comes in a tub so I can use 100% of the product. Impressed!
