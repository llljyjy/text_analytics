Love these! They’re simple to replace and use, and a great price. I’m glad to not have to repurchase disposable plastic razors. I have occasionally had trouble pulling the old blades out of the razor (there’s only a small raised bump to catch and push up from, and I’ve had it chip off before while removing). But they’ve never given me too much trouble. I’ve already repurchased. nan
