Excellent product - I implore Sephora to not reformulate it any time soon! I selected this particular bakuchiol because of its quality formulation, and in practice it is indeed a light, milky serum that is wonderful to use and already shows results in 1.5 weeks of using it. By choice I only use it at night. I am someone who was able to use prescription tretinion regularly up to a year at one point...but hated how it left my skin feeling sensitive and reactive. Over-the-counter retinol/retinal products also left my eyes feeling dry. This Made in France bakuchiol serum has given me a similar rejuvenation, bounce, and glow as tretinoin but my skin barrier is also more reinforced.To echo some other reviewers, the only minor quibble I have is to improve the packaging...maybe switch to an airtight pump instead of the clumsy dropper. It wonâ€™t stop me from repurchasing and recommending this product to friends and family, however. My alternative to retinoids :)
