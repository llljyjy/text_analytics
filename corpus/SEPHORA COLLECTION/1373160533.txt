I’ve been very pleasantly surprised by this inexpensive cleanser! It is gentle and effective, it removes makeup well, doesn’t strip my skin, and has a clean, vegan formula. It is a clear gel that lightly foams, good for any type of cleansing, first, second, or morning - I like it for the mornings best. The tube packaging is practical. It does say it is unscented but it has a very light fresh scent from the aloe vera it contains. I will definitely look at the other affordable products in this range from Sephora. Great inexpensive cleanser!
