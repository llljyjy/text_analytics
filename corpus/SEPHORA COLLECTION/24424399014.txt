For several years since knee surgery I’ve had dry and chapped skin on my knees along the scars and also very dry and chalky shins.  I’ve used difference moisturizers with no noticeable results.  With one treatment of this mask the dryness is completely gone.  No more itchy chalky skin.  I was shocked.  I have sensitive skin and I didn’t wash the mask off until my shower.  I love this product and highly recommend it.  The coconut smell is divine. Totally helped my knees and shins
