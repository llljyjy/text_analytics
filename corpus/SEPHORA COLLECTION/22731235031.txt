I was skeptical because of how inexpensive it is than my normal makeup melting balm, but this exceeded my expectations. It’s a big container & a little goes a long way! Make sure to emulsify it in your hands first and it’ll melt your makeup right off! I wanted to see how easy it would remove makeup so I tried without water and it literally wiped my makeup right off. I do strongly suggest using water and cleansing your face after, as with any makeup balm. I love it & will definitely only buy this from now on! I wish I bought this sooner!
