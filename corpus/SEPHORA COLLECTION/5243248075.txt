The packaging of this chapstick is cute although not sure if itâ€™s practical because if it gets wet it may ruin the shape of the casing of the chapstick since it is made of paper like material. The smell of this chapstick is great, smells like coconut icecream.  It applies nicely and hydrates the lips. Average Chapstick
