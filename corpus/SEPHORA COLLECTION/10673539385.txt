I really like this serum! It’s one of the only things that has helped with my dry skin this winter. The only thing I would say isn’t ideal about this product is that I look a little greasy after a couple of hours, but I’ll take that over dry skin any day! Makes me look glowy and clean! Awesome for dry skin!
