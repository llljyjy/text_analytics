I received this product from Influenster to sample and unfortunately it was not a favorite of mine. The serum is very thin and runs too easily. In addition I did not feel any change it my skin. It was a light product that didn’t leave me feeling greasy, but my face also didn’t feel moisturized. Unfortunately not a new staple
