My daughter (8) and I both tried this out, and it gets a 4 thumbs up.  Super smooth, adds a little color, and smells delicious!  The packaging is so cute, I love the bright colors and packaging of the tube.  I think I will definitely be buying more of this, if not for me, for my daughter.  She loves it!! Love it!
