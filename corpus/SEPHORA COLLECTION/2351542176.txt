I have been using this face moisturizer in the morning as a primer. It’s nice that it is vegan and Clean at Sephora. I’m always on the hunt for a good quality skincare product that is at a great price point.  Bonus points for it being unscented and having 96% of its ingredients from natural origin. Plays well with makeup
