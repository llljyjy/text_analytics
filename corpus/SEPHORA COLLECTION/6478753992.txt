Since I’ve gotten bangs, my forehead has been greasy while my cheeks remain dry. Throw in larger pores and skin that’s in it’s 30s, and I needed a new routine. After only a few uses, I’m already noticing a difference! I definitely recommend, although the moisturizer isn’t my absolute favorite. I still prefer another brand, but this absolutely saved me money regardless! nan
