Smells great, very light and fresh. Very lightweight feel and it absorbs pretty quickly without feeling oily. My skin tone has evened out by the few uses ive had, but i can’t really say I’ve seen much change as far as dark spots. I’m content with the product but not particularly  sure if I’d purchase it once this tube runs out. Seems nice
