absolutely delighted! I am absolutely delighted with this night cream. I’m 30 with dry skin. I’m always trying to find a night cream that truly hydrates my skin and tackles my dry patches. I had previously bought a very popular night cream that is over double the price of this and was so disappointed as it felt thin and didn’t so much for my skin. This exceeded all of my expectations. The packaging feels very nice and I like it has recycled plastic. The cream itself is luxuriously rich, but doesn’t feel heavy or greasy. I wake up with soft supple skin. Better than more expensive night creams
