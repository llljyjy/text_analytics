Sephora Collection gifted me this product in exchange for my honest opinion. I am obsessed with this cleanser because I really look for gels that are unscented and lightweight since my skin has always been prone to acne. The salicylic acid and AHAs are such a huge plus too and my face that is typically oily feels such a refreshing difference! nan
