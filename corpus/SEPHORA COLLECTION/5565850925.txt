I’m a huge fan of vegan/clean beauty, and this AHA/BHA serum is so affordable! You really don’t need to be spending a lot of money on skincare for it to be good. On my first application, my skin did look smoother than before and I am excited to keep using it every day. The serum itself melts into my skin and doesn’t feel sticky at all. With my other products, it doesn’t pill up. I also love that it’s so easily accessible as a Sephora brand and the packaging is recycled. Melts right in my skin, so easy to use!
