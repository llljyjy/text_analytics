I’ve been trying out this serum for a couple weeks now, and so far I’m enjoying it! The texture and packaging are great, and I love that it’s vegan and Clean at Sephora (also that it’s pretty affordable). My skin actually feels pretty hydrated after using this, which I didn’t expect. I haven’t noticed much change since using it, but since it’s only been a couple weeks I’m definitely going to keep using it to see the long term effects! nan
