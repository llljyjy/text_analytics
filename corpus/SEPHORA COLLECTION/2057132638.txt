Love love this product! I especially love how high end it feels, even though the price is comparable, if not less, than what I’d spend at a drugstore! I wanted to try this because of how clean it is (vegan), and I’m so glad I did! It moisturizes well, doesn’t hurt my sensitive skin, and keeps my face looking plump and moisturized! nan
