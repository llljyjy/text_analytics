I received this product in exchange for a review, but these are my own honest opinions.PROS:- light creamy texture that absorbs easily w/o leaving any tackiness behind- on my oily skin, this works well as a winter AM moisturizer, and I can see it being a good summer PM moisturizer as well- simple packaging that would be easy to travel with- fragrance-free formula may be less sensitizing for those whose skin (or noses!) are sensitive to fragrance- good value for moneyCONS:- since this is fragrance-free, you are able to smell the scent of the ingredients themselves, which may bother some people (my boyfriend did not like the scent, for instance)- this can be a bit difficult to spread across the skin, despite not being too thick (itâ€™s hard to describe!) -- I wish it had more slip to it good basic moisturizer, with a few caveats
