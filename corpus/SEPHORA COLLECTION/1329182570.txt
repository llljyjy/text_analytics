I love how lightweight this moisturizer is and I was pleasantly surprised that is kept my skin smooth and soft all day, despite drying heat and freezing cold outside. It shields your skin with antioxidants and doesnâ€™t have any scent: which I prefer. It alsomakes skin smooth and makes makeup easier to apply. Plus I love that the tube is made with 44% recycled plastic. Effective unscented moisturizer
