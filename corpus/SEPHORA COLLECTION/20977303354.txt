These hold up great. I’ve had them for several months now. They wash easy, they remove makeup with ease, and they hold product without holding it too well so I don’t get any on my face. I thought I would have issues with the non-textured side pilling, but it’s holding up great. These are fantastic for anyone wanting to reduce waste. And you can’t beat the price. Better than I expected
