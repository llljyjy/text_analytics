I love the clean fresh scent of this hydrating moisturizer, and especially love that quality skincare can be affordable. The packaging is sleek and the squeezable tube makes it easy to apply, which I prefer over a tub. I would repurchase this in the future and recommend to anyone looking for an inexpensive face cream. nan
