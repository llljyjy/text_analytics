This cleansing balm is okay. it’s not the best out there but it’s not bad either. I have to apply the product about 3 times for it to completely remove my make up. The smell of the product is okay it doesn’t really bother me and it did not burn my eyes or anything. i don’t think i would purchase this product again. it's ok
