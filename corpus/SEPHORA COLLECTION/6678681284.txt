I’ve tried so many masks and nothing has ever worked so well!! I was traveling for over 20 hours with 3 layovers and looked absolutely wrecked but put these on the last leg of my flight and practically became a new person. My eyes were so fresh and felt so hydrated. If you put them in the fridge before using it’s even better. These have been sold out for a few weeks and I desperately need them back before my upcoming bachelorette party! Don’t take away the thing I love most Sephora! Best Eye Mask Ever
