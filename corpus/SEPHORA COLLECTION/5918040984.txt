I have been searching for more products with AHA and BHA because my skin concerns are texture, uneven tone, pores, and occasional hormonal acne. This is what I’ve been searching for!!! No perfume and clean, this cleanser has been doing my skin wonders. The salicylic acid helps my occasional breakouts and the aloe helps not dry out my skin. Plus it’s so affordable I am so happy I tried this!! Sephora Collection gifted me this product in exchange for my honest opinion. nan
