I was sent this to review. I used it for only 3 weeks. I noticed my texture on my rosacea has improved and my skin does feel softer. I will it wasn’t as runny which makes it hard to apply at times. It’s a good serum and does it’s job well but it’s not the absolute best one that I have used. Works great
