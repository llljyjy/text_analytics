Since I got  this serum in the mail I started using it.  What originally gravitated me towards this product was the fact that it was vegan and clean at Sephora, and it’s ingredients. I had acne scars that I wanted gone and noticed a difference after a week of consistency. I didn’t use it twice a day only at night. My skin type is dry and I only get hormonal acne. This is now a vital step in my skin care. I use this directly after washing, exfoliating, toner, then the dark spot serum and toner again then I apply the rest of my serums. I medium to dark tone. I hope this helps !! Quality isn’t always expensive and I found a gem.
