I got a sample of this and immediately bought a full-size. Iâ€™m completely in love with this. It is super lightweight and absorbs quickly. No greasy slimy feel. Sometimes serums can make me break out but I had no issues with this one. My skin just looked so healthy after using it. I applied this underneath my makeup but I particularly loved using it on days I go bare face In love!
