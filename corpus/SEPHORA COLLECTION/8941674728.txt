This is a great every day lip balm with just the right amount of tint so it looks natural while still adding a nice amount of color to the lips.I use lip balms like this one daily especially for work, where I don’t wear much makeup.This glides on smooth and keeps my lips hydrated for hours.It’s one of the most nourishing lip balms I’ve tried (tinted and not tinted)I do reapply after eating or drinking to have fresh color.It is also very affordable and a great choice at $7! Highly recommend to try it out! This is already a favorite that lives in my purse so I can take it everywhere with me. Great every day balm with color
