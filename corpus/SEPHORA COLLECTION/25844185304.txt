I don’t believe these really did anything, I bought a bunch of different ones to finish up family facials over the long weekend. They felt really nice to have on cool. & naturally cold plumps/gives you some freshness... IN conclusion, nothing magical but definitely can give you a hand if you haven’t slept much & are looking for that fresh feeling. Throw them in your fridge!
