I have a literal pharmacy of medication I have to cart about wherever I go.  This handy little gadget is awesome.  GONE are the days of random bottles spilling everywhere while you try to get out the one med you actually need at that time.  I can separate my rx’s into 6 neat categories!  Each compartment has its own separate, snap-shut lid.  The whole case snaps shut as shown. This is a huge plus because no more meds getting all jumbled about.   Everything stays organized and tidy in the separate section you left it in.I’m showing a Sephora lipgloss (cosmic purple) in the case so you can gauge the size.I love this box.  Thank you. MUST have if you take lots of RX's.
