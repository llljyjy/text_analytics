This honestly surprised me by becoming one of my favorite new products! I’ve never used sephora brand skincare before so I wasn’t sure what to expect, but even at this low price, this stuff really works! It feels really nice going on and soaks in fast. I notice my skin looks more even and just happier every morning, and I love fast acting results. Absolutely love that its vegan, clean ingredients (that are backed by science), and that they use so much recycled material for both the box and the bottle! I’ll definitely be trying more sephora skincare after this because I’m really impressed! nan
