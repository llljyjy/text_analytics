I loved the original bamboo & grapefruit exfoliating wipes from the Sephora brand, but since the recent change and rebranding, they’re terrible! They don’t exfoliate at all, nor remove makeup... and the wipes themselves are more like gauze. it’s so weird! Definitely not repurchasing. :( New Wipes Are Not Good!
