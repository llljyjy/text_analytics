I have combo skin I started using this 2 years ago and never going back I have tried 5 different toners before this one and they either dried my skin or made me break out this is different!! the first week of using my skin cleared up and it was really hybridized!! it was awesome for the cold and dry Wisconsin winter but nice and refreshing in the hot summer!! 10/10!!! a good toner for beginners!!!
