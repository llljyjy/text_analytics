I have only used this for about two weeks so can’t say I’ve seen a drastic improvement in dark spots. There is some evening out of skin tone. What I really like about this is that it is also hydrating, so I can skip a step in my routine. I have pretty dehydrated and dry skin so exfoliating products can make it worse, this helps keep the skin plump. It hasn’t irritated my skin, and layers well with all my skincare and makeup. There isn’t any weird balling up or texture issues. I’m hoping to see better results with continued use. Exfoliating and hydrating serum
