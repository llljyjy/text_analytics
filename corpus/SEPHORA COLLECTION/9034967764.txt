I gave it a try to this melting cleansing balm to see, and I’m not regretting it, it melts the makeup so fast and with hurting your eyes or hurting you face which I liked, but what i loved is that your skin feel actually clean, glowy and hydrate without being extremely oil. That’s a plus for me. Super effective.
