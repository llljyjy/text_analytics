So disappointing. This was my HG moisturizer/scrub; no matter what condition my lips were in, this fixed them like magic. But apparently a formula change came along with the more eco-friendly packaging; while I like the new tube, I hate what is in it. It looks like a scrub, feels like melting Chapstick, and makes my lips MORE chapped. Please bring back the old formula! nan
