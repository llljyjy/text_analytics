I do use this twice a week and it has helped my skin a ton! Im always really excited but also nervous to try or add to my skin care routine and I have done really well with this. The texture is sort of a cold jelly feeling, it goes on the skin super light and smooth almost feeling like its a moisturizer. It does how ever dry up and you can feel it doing so. After the 10-15 min it comes off smoothly with water and a towel. I started out using it once a week with nothing but my cleanser and moisturizer after to see how my face would react, It has helped reduce my blemishes, pores and has almost given a sort of refreshing radiant glow to my skin. So far I have really loved my results and would definitely keep in my routine! Cold Jelly Feeling
