I really like this moisturizer, I was recommended to use this by a Sephora Pro artist and I’m happy I grabbed it. I’ve only ever used drugstore moisturizers and this is much different from the one I had previously. This product has a slightly thick consistency. No smell, and does not leave skin feeling tacky. nan
