Sephora gifted me this product and here is my HONEST review:If you are deciding on getting this or the Ordinary AHA/BHA, PLEASE get this one. 96% of the ingredients are organic, making it safer for the skin. Use a LIGHT layer and don’t use more than once a week. This is a treatment and is not intended for everyday use. The only reason I am giving this four stars is because it doesn’t say on the packaging how many times to use. Get this instead of the Ordinary
