I was pleasantly surprised by this product, I bought it on a whim while shopping in store, I’ve used vitamine E’s before to help with my pigmentation and acne spots but the brand I normally use is hard to find. When I saw this one at the store I decided to give it a try and have been enjoying using it daily before my moisturizer. It glides smoothly on the skin and doesn’t leave it feeling oily, nor does it have any scent that I can detect. Great for daily use
