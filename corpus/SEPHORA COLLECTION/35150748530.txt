I love using the Nourishing moisturizer from Sephora Collective.  I tried it on after taking a shower and it left my face feeling super soft and smooth. I also tried it out with my makeup and it held up pretty good. My foundation didn’t crease while using it.  I love that the moisturizer is fragrance-free, certified Clean at Sephora and that the product isn’t expensive because great quality doesn’t have to be expensive! Great Moisturizer
