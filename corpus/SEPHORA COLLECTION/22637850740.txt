I received this product to sample for an honest review. So far I like it. I haven’t noticed a huge difference, but it seems hydrating which helps my dry skin. I like that it’s isn’t sticky and it doesn’t leave a residue. It smells decent, some serums smell weird. You should give this serum a try. The price point isn’t bad either. nan
