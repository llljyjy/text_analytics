I love that the Targeted Pores Serum is vegan and clean at Sephora. This is a relatively inexpensive serum that still feels like quality. I have enlarged pores around my t-zone and especially around my nose. I started using this serum and though I didn’t see immediately results on the first use I have started to see improvement after continued usage. I haven’t had any breakouts either. nan
