I am very sad to leave such a bad review. Iâ€™ve been using the coconut lip balm since 2019. I loved everything about it, the smell, texture and coverage. I usually buy 10 at a time, leave them in various places and they last year round. I placed my annual order and received a waxy, stinky product. I hope with all the poor reviews, Sephora will take this into consideration and return to the ol formula, or manufacturer.. Whatever it was that changed, PLEASE change it back. No good.
