They work 100% it’s too bad people can’t just use products right before leaving nasty reviews. You’re gonna get a good thing discontinued. You HAVE TO LEAVE IT ON A WET NOSE FOR ABOUT 20 MIN. Pull it like a wax strip and voila! My nose is completely soft and no more nasty bumps and those horrible little hair things. Use them right I promise you they work. 4☆ They work realllllllly good, just use them right
