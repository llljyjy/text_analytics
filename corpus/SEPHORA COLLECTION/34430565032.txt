I absolutely LOVE these face cleaning wipes! They are the best I have ever used! I’ve tried MANY cleansing wipes, and most leave my skin flakey, dull, or too oily!?! these are perfect! the closest feeling to actually washing my face! I love these for mornings I am in a rush or on nights I’m too tired to wash my face!?! great smell! the textured side is amazing for a deep clean. I feel it remove my grease and dirt and make up! this is an everyday staple in my routine! An absolute must have!
