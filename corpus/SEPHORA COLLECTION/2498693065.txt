This facial cleaning tool is amazing! I have very dry skin and often have dry patches on my face. I use my exfoliating cleanser once a week, so I’m often stuck with the dry patches until I exfoliate next. But I started using this a little over a week ago and I’ve noticed a huge improvement in my skin texture! I use it morning and night with my regular facial cleanser, and not only does it help with dry patches, but the texture around my nose (where my pores are) is so much smoother! I was worried that it would be harsh on my skin with daily use but I haven’t found that to be an issue. Definitely a must try! Love this!
