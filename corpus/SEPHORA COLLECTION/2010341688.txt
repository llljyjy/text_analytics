I tried the Sephora Collection Melting Cleansing Balm Cleanse + Balance for the past 14 days, and every single time I used it, it took off my makeup completely. I even used a white towel after, and ALL of my makeup was completely off. And the best part about this cleansing balm is that it’s SIGNIFICANTLY more affordable than other cleansing balms coming in at only $12! The ingredients are great and work well for my combination skin. Overall I highly recommend it, and it’s perfect for full makeup days and the Halloween season! Great for Everyday Use!
