After using Drunk Elephant for almost 5 years, my skin definitely became acclimated and it was time for a new skincare line. I always look at reviews because, hello?! Who wants to waste their money? This skincare line is clean, it’s affordable, and it WORKS. My skin is combo but it’s been super oily lately. I absolutely love how quickly this has worked to close my pores and minimized my comedonal acne. Goodbye Drunk Elephant, hello Sephora Collection! Bye bye Drunk Elephant! Hello Sephora Collection!
