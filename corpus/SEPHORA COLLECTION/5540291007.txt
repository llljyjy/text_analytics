I have really sensitive skin and I had been wanting to try a good Resurfacing Peel Mask and I officially found it. This has quickly become one of my favorite masks because of the cooling effect it has on my skin and guys, my skin is glowinggggg after using this. I truly canâ€™t wait to see what my skin looks like after using this for a few weeks/months! (I received this product as a free gift from Sephora Collection) Must-Have Skincare Product!
