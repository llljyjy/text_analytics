no all these reviews are complaining bc this isn’t a peel-off mask but this mask works SO well. i liked the ordinary’s aha/bha mask but i LOVE this. it’s so gentle, it doesn’t sting when you put it on and you can see and feel the results right after using it im in love i would marry this mask if i could
