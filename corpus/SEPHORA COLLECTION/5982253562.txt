It’s a good cleansing balm. I normally buy the Clinique cleansing balm but decided for the price difference this was worth giving a try. I’ve tried some cleansing balms that felt like they left a film on my face and I didn’t get that with this one. I deducted a star because it does irritate my eyes slightly, not enough to not use it but something I don’t experience with the Clinique. Good balm overall
