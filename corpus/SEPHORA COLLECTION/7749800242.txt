If you struggle with dry lips either in the winter or in general and are on a budget this will do. Strawberry smell is a bit strong and there’s no applicator so you just squeeze it onto your figure which is fine. I honestly prefer the Laneige one but just because it’s fancier. They do the same thing and both work good good for the price
