Lightweight cream moisturizer that gets the job done. It isn’t greasy or too thick and feels like it absorbs quickly. Everything is great EXCEPT… it pills crazily so I only use it at night. It also came with a rather large air pocket in the container so it wasn’t all the way full. pretty good for the price
