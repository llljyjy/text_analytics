First impression, wow! This eye cream has almost a cooling effect when you apply it around the eyes. The formula is rich, but not too rich that it is greasy. It absorbs quickly and leaves the eye area very moisturized. I used it this morning underneath my makeup and I feel like it made my makeup apply nicely as well. Definitely recommend! Lovely
