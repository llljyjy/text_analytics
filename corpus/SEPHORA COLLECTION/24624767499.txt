This is a pretty decent product, it’s at a great price point and part of sephora’s clean collection as well as being vegan. It’s a clear, scent less (i don’t love the scent less smell) very light foaming cleanser. I like my cleansers to be very foamy but if you like a light foam this is for you! You can see the light foam / consistency in my hand in photo. Pretty good.
