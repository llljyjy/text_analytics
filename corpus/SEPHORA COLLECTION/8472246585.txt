This serum mainly uses vitamins rather than acidic properties so if you are new to vitamin c or if you have sensitive skin. Super slippery so be careful when dispensing- also kind of soapy when I didn’t wait enough time after applying previous products but nothing out of control. Definitely made my skin look brighter when applying but didn’t see any changes over time so I prefer other serums personally. Great for beginners!
