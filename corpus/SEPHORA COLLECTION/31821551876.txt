I don’t understand the bad reviews. I bought this thinking it was a lip scrub, but it turned out to be pretty decent lip balm for three bucks. I’ve had huda and other fancy lip balms which were utterly useless and didn’t do anything to help chapped lips, but this worked. It smelled nice, too. All considered, I’d buy it again. Accide tal purchase but liked it anyway
