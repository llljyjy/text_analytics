I was so excited to receive this product from Influenster. In terms of smell it is pretty much odorless, which I appreciate since I like staying away from fragrances on my face. The consistency is a bit watery, so a little goes a long way. My skin is already a bit oily but this gives me just the right amount of glow. I used a bit after cleansing and then applied moisturizer and it felt really nice on my skin. I can wait to see what it does for my complexion! Vitamin C is suppose to help with aging, acne, and dark spots so weâ€™ll see. nan
