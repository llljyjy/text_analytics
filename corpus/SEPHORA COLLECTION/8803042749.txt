not sure itâ€™s doing anything but I have not been regular because my under eye skin reacts badly to this. so I have to be very careful applying this. I am using it on my chin and jaw to get rid of marks I get from my monthly pimples, but they have not faded yet. using this for 2 months.other than the questionable efficacy and my peculiar skin reacting to it, this product is not bad. has a good consistency, no fragrance, slightly moisturizing. nan
