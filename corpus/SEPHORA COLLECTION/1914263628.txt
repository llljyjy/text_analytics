This lip balm is an affordable treat at $7 a tube. It has a nourishing texture that glides on easily and isnâ€™t waxy at all. The fragrance seems to be more rose than lychee, but it has the subtlest tint and a little sweetness if you get it in your mouth accidentally (on purpose). The tube itself is also very cute with its illustrations of the fruit. A little treat!
