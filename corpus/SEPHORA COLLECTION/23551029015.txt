Giving this one star because although it works great Sephora hasn’t restocked the razor refills. I’ve been waiting for refills for 4 months now and can’t find similar refills from other sellers. I ended having to buy plastic razors to suffice. Kind of feels like a waste but can’t return bc I used it for 3 months before running out. No refills available
