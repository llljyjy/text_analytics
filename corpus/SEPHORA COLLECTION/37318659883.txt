First off let me start by telling you a bit about my skin. I have a mix between oily and dry. Lately I have noticed that my face started to break out and so I have a few dark spots that honestly tried covering with makeup. I saw this product and it was the first thing I wanted to try, because I did want to try at least to lessen the dark spots. I have tried it for 7 days so far. To be honest I can start seeing a slight difference. You do need to be consistent. Apply it on clean dry skin AM and PM. You need to do this for 28 days. So far I can start seeing difference. My dark spots have gotten lighter. I will update again in 3 more weeks to see if there is any other visible changes. So far I am beyond happy and excited. nan
