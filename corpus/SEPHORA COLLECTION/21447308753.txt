I like to say my skin has a sense of humor. It’s oily and sensitive and prone to allergic reactions just to keep things interesting. This peel left my skin feeling firm and smooth, with no nasty rash or lingering irritation. It’s only very mildly scented which makes it a re keeper for, because, you guessed it, I have scent allergies. nan
