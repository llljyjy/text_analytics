I have oily skin and I usually have a preference on what serums to use since some of them are either too watery or too thick . If you have combo skin or oily skin this serum gives u a good dewy glow. The serum is light weight but it’s too watery in my opinion. I wasn’t a fan of the scent either even though it doesn’t smell horrible . The smell was too strong for me and it made my nose hurt . The texture is too watery but it doesn’t feel sticky on my face .  I wouldn’t buy this serum mainly because I have my favorite serums that work best for me and that definitely make a differences on my face . I didn’t notice any differences before or after using the serum . The only thing I could see a little bit of is how dewy it made my face feel . I wouldn’t buy this serum but I would recommend it to oily skin or combo skin individuals who want more of a dewy glow .  I received this product as a free sample . Good product
