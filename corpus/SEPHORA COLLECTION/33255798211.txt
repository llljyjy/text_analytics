First photo March 13, 2022, second photo today.I have normal/sensitive and dehydrated skin, 20 years old.I have tried many exfoliating masks and this is the only one that has made me see results on my skin, I leave it on for 15 minutes and rinse it off with warm water, I use it at night 3 times a week . My skin texture has improved a lot and I have seen a reduction in the appearance of my red scars.I don’t want you to think that one product makes all the difference. Diet, contraception, sun exposure and stress are factors that have a big influence on our skin. I changed my diet (eating lots of fruits, vegetables and drinking lots of water), I changed contraception (I switched from the IUD to the pill) and I spent a lot of time outside with a good sunscreen. It can be very easy to spend a lot of money on products expecting to see a difference after a few days, but it’s important not to upset our skin too much with new products every week and find a good routine that suits you, and stick to it. No need to have 20 products in a routine Good product!
