I have oily skin that gets super dehydrated especially in the harsh winters so a really nourishing cream is always a must have. While I was skeptical about using this cream with oils for my oily skin, I havenâ€™t experienced any breakouts yet. Instead, it applies so well and feels so smooth on my skin. This will be a winter favourite for a while. Good for dry months
