I use this serum morning and night after toner. It has a milk-like texture that absorbs nicely without being sticky. It’s gentle and feels comfortable on the skin. I’ve been using it for about two weeks and I feel like my skin looks firmer and healthier. I also like that it’s unscented and the glass bottle is recyclable. I will continue using this product. nan
