This is an affordable cleansing balm being $12 for 4.22oz / 125ml. It breaks down my makeup well including my very waterproof mascara. It transforms into a milky texture when water is added and rinses off well without leaving a film on the skin. Doesnâ€™t sting eyes. Affordable, effective cleansing balm
