I use this balm at the end of the day to mostly remove SPF and some makeup. I have to admit I don’t wear much makeup though, so it’s not like I need to remove mascara everyday using this. It works well and I find my skin is clean afterwards. When I wear mascara, I do use an eye makeup remover first, as it doesn’t melt away mascara the way it does foundation or SPF. I really like it, and would repurchase. Doesn’t burn or sting my sensitive skin, and also doesn’t make it dry so I love it. Will repurchase
