These used to be my absolute favorite and go to make up remover pads.  However, the wipes have changed and no longer give me the clean, exfoliating feeling I used to get when using these pads.  Not only do not they not clean as well, they are more dry and harder to use when wiping off makeup.  I wish they had not changed and would go back to the original ones! not like they used to be - donâ€™t waste your time
