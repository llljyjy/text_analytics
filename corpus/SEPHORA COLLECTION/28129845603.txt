My skin loves this Sephora Collection Resurfacing Peel Mask. This mask has become a part of my special once-a-week skin care routine where I freshen up my complexion for the week. This mask helps brighten my skin for a more radiant & healthy look. I tend to get break-outs and have acne scars so I really like this resurfacing product to tackle those blemishes and dark spots. nan
