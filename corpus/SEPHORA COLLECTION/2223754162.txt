This is a rebuy for me! I used Khiels Avocado eye cream for years. But it was just a great moisturizer that didn’t run into my eyes. One day I noticed after using this for about a month that I wasn’t slathering on the under eye concealer as much and actually realized my forever dark circles have lightened! Bonus, it’s affordable and doesn’t irritate my eyes. Wears beautifully with make up. nan
