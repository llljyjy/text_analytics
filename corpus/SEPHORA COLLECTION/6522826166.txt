I’m really enjoying trying out new serums but knowing what each one is for and trying not to have a negative reaction can be difficult and expensive. I’ve been using this one for a couple of weeks and it feels really nice on the skin, not too harsh. I’m looking forward to continuing to use it and see how my skin changes. nan
