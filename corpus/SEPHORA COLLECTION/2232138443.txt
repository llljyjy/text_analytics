The liquid is the most energetic liquid when you spread it on the face. It’s so easy to roll and you can’t catch with that speed. I feel the liquid can run by itself. I know it’s hard to understand by once you tried it out you would know how wonderful it is. I feels it cleans very well and no strip feeling afterwards. The price is very affordable and it’s made in France! Not too many face wash is about prebiotics. A great product Sephora brings to the market. It's a special product and I love it.
