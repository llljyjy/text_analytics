my fav vitamin c serum i’ve ever used!!! have been using this for over a year now and it’s so good. immediately after i use it i have glowy skin and from using it long term my dark spots/acne scars have faded a ton. it’s also not too harsh on the skin (i have super sensitive skin) which is great. has a good scent as well. LOVEEE
