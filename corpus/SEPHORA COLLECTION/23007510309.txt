Really impressed by this product! I was surprised at first, by the color and consistency, because it is a milky white color, almost like a lotion, and a little creamier than most serums I’ve tried. Application-wise though, it goes on smooth like a serum, and soaks right in (doesn’t sit on the skin like a lotion would).  This product makes my skin feel soft and supple, and I’m loving that it’s clean and vegan. So important when it comes to our skin! Finally— a clean anti-aging product!
