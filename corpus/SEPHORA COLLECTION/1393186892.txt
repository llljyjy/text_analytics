It’s a good product. My skin feels fresh and clean after using it . The texture is beautiful. The only thing I didn’t like was that it made my skin a little bit dry after using it and also it didn’t remove my make up fully. I wish it was more hydrating.  Overall it’s a good cleaner . It feels gentle and soothing on my face . Also the  price is great. I like that I doesn’t have any harsh chemicals. Good product
