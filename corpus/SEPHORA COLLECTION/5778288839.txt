Pros- It hydrates my skin & doesn’t feel sticky. Cons- no vitamin c concentration listed, consistency is runny, no real brightening noticedAll in all it’s an okay serum for hydrating but I noticed no brightening properties, I didn’t love the consistency, and I prefer my serums to list the concentration of the ingredient it advertises Just ok
