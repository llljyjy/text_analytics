Let me start this review by saying I don’t wear makeup so i can’t attest to its makeup removing ability. i use this as the first cleanse in my double cleanse to remove sunscreen but it’s just ok. it has a very strong scent that i don’t like (and i don’t even mind fragrance in products) and doesn’t really “melt” as the name would suggest. It does leave a weird film on your face after rinsing. Makes your eyes cloudy after rubbing it on your face. Even for the price, I think you’d be better off just buying a more expensive one that’s better. It manages to get my sunscreen off decently well but i’d imagine you it would be tough to get makeup off with it. Overall, i’d say find another cleansing balm/oil if you are looking for one. Not great.
