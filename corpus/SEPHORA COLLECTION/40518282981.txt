This product is easy to use and removes unwanted hairs. There is one thing I’d like to mention that the blade is very dull and I’ve cut my skin with it. It cuts your skin easily and you must be careful used. How fast you maneuver with it or how hard you press down can cut you. I still recommend this hair removal tool. I just didn’t expect it to cut me so easily. Hope that helps. Quality and warning
