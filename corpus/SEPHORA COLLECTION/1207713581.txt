I LOVE this Clean at Sephora Cleanser! I can not contain my excitement for this cleanser! I switched from Murad Hydrating cleanser to this guy and I am so happy! I love the no fragrance, gel consistency. This cleanser foams up beautifully and I appreciate the AHA/BHA. This cleanser is helping to smooth my skin from all the bumps from having to wear a mask! Great Cleanser with a Low Price!
