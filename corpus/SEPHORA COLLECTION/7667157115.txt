Let’s start with the pump. It’s faulty and sticks so you never know how much product will come out. So difficult to use. The product itself is sticky. I could probably accomplish the same thing rubbing a grapefruit directly on my face. Sure there’s a slight glow but you have to ensure feeling sticky and it’s just not worth it. nan
