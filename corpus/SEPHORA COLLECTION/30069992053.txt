This is a no for me. I have tried other Sephora Collection products that I loved, so I was excited to try this. It honestly feels like smearing petroleum jelly across your face, and holy man does it sting my eyes if I try to open them without having 1000% guaranteed I’ve rinsed the product off. It’s also pretty difficult to remove, it seems to be quite oil or petroleum-based, so it doesn’t want to mix with water without a fair amount of effort. I don’t think I’ll even be finishing this jar, it’s just too finicky & it hurts ya if you don’t do it right. It works for some folks, just not me. Not for me
