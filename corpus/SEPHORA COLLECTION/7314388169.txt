I use this as a double cleanse when I wear makeup and itâ€™s been great. I have dry, sensitive skin and using this product as part of a system to remove makeup or sunscreen that can irritate my skin if I leave them on too long. Any reaction my skin might be suffering from gets calmed quickly after using this product. This product has been great for me -
