So I put off trying this one for a while because I was nervous, I have very sensitive skin and if I change anything to my skincare routine I usually break out. I’ve tried another mask before from another brand  and it really caused problems for my my face. So far with this one though, no breakouts and my skin does feel different texturally, definitely more smooth and almost Bouncy? Like hydrated… which I guess is what it’s supposed to do! Also it doesn’t tingle so that is nice. I was wary at first but really liked it!
