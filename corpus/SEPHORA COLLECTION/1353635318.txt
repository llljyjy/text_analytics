Could not be more pleased with this product for the price. I love that the ingredients are clean and I don’t have to worry about what is going on (and therefore into) my skin. The consistency of the cream is wonderful… not too thin and and not too thick. It’s also unscented and fragrance free. All in all, it’s a gentle product for the delicate skin around the eye area. I’ve noticed more moisture and less crepey skin since using this morning and night. The packaging is very nice as well. If you’re looking for a clean product that hydrates and doesn’t break the bank, this is it! Clean, effective, and doesn’t break the bank!
