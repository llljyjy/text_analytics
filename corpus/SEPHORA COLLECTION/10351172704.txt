I got this on sale but it still wasn’t worth my money, it broke apart after the second use, the metal pieces are just not strong enough specifically on the side for the big roller which is the one I need the most.It looks exactly like everyone else’s pictures that broke off, will look for a different brand because I know it will just break again if I get the same one. super cheap
