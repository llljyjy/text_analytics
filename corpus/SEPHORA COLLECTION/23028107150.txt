I’ve been using this SEPHORA COLLECTIONTargeted Anti-Aging Bakuchiol Serum for about 2 weeks now. I can see a little change in fine lines/wrinkles around my eye and on my forehead. My skin feels great. Feels hydrated. I’m really liking this serum and can’t wait to see the improvement over the weeks to come. Nice serum for a nice price!
