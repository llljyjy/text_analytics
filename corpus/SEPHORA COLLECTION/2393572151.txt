I have tried name brand cleansing balms but I keep coming to this one. Its only 12 bucks. It completely melts the makeup without making my skin too greasy. The jar is completely recyclable. I do double cleansing but this balm makes the skincare routine effortless. 1st step in my double cleansing routine
