As someone with dark, purple/grey under eye circles, I’m loving this cream. I haven’t used it long enough to see a sustainable difference, but I think there’s potential based on the clinical trials with it. I appreciate the affordable price point, and the fact that it’s clean and vegan. Usually those things alone drive up the cost!! The texture is a thinner, silky cream instead of a thick consistency, which makes it go on nicely under makeup or at night. There is a slight smell to it- kind of a clinical scent, but it’s not bothersome once it’s on. Bye under eye circles!
