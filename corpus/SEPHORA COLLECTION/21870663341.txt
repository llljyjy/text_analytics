This used to be my absolute favourite lip balm, super hydrating, not sticky, perfect amount of natural gloss. I would go through 2-3 every year. I just purchased a new one and it seems the formula has been changed and it’s awful. Sticky, not hydrating, doesn’t feel good on. So disappointed Used to be my favourite lip balm
