I have been using this product for almost 2 weeks now and I have really enjoyed using it. I received this from Influenster for my honest opinion and my opinion is that it is a nice little serum. After about a week my skin had a nice glow to it and it felt healthier than before. The serum itself has minimal odor, if any at all and absorbed into my skin quickly. There isnâ€™t a huge amount of vitamin C in this product but enough to give your skin a fresh and revived feeling while looking plump and healthy. A small downfall to this serum is it is pretty runny, if you are not careful a lot will come out at once. The price of a full sized bottle of this serum is really doable so I, personally, would buy it so I can see results over a longer period of time! Give it a try! Vitamin Cccccc
