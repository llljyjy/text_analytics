Clerk at store told me it was just a cherry chapstick - no tint. Well, it is very tinted - had I known beforehand I would’ve chosen a different one. Smells/tastes like nothing. I don’t even know why it’s called Cherry. Nothing special about it and not the best chapstick I’ve tried. One of the few ‘Sephora’ brand products I’ve tried and not looking to good I’ll try their line again soon. Disappointed
