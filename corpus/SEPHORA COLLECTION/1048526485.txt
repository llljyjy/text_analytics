I haven’t tested the serum long enough to get a sense of long-term benefits, but I will speak to what I’ve seen so far. The texture has a nice viscosity to it, but isn’t too thick and absorbs into the skin very easily. It doesn’t completely mattify the face, and you can still see a natural glow, but it does give a slight blurring effect to the skin. It plays well with the rest of my skincare, and hasn’t irritated my skin at all. Really excited to keep using it and seeing if the effects multiply! nan
