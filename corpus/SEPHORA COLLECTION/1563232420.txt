It is a nice cleanser when you look at the price product performance. I definitely prefer a cleanser that’s a little thicker and i didn’t see much of a change on my skin but it works as a great cleanser to take of my make up. It feels a little tight on my skin after i use so i feel like i need to use extra moisturizer after. But overall it is a good product and what i loved the most about this product is that it is clean and vegan! #sephoracollectionlove nan
