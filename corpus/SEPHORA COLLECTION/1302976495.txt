Can’t go wrong with this cleansing brush. bristles are soft. I used it with both a liquid and a creamy cleanser and it worked well. I have sensitive skin so I wouldn’t recommend using it first thing in the morning. It worked better as part of my evening routine to remove makeup, cleanse and massage my skin gently. nan
