I’m in love with this hydrating moisturizer! It’s such a great price point with such quality ingredients. I use it morning and night and it sits nicely under my makeup. I love love love that it’s vegan and part of Sephora’s clean beauty! Natural ingredients are super important to me but I also want products that work. Affordable & high quality!!!!
