I have struggled with skin texture and tiny bumps on my chin and forehead for years and nothing has worked. I was previously issuing Glow Recipe’s  Watermelon Toner hoping it would help with my texture but it never worked. After using this cleanser for only a week, I already see a dramatic improvement in my skin’s texture, and my skin is so soft and smooth. I have dry skin and it doesn’t dry it out at all. Highly highly recommend!! nan
