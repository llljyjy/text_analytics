I love this! At first I was skeptical since I have used the little dinky twinkle razors for years, but man oh man! This baby worked so much better! I was always jealous when I saw a lot of people use them and they had a lot of hair coming off because the tinkle razors never gave me much pay out. This razor, not only got all the bits and gunk, felt less sharp? I’m unsure if that’s stupid but whenever I would do sensitive areas like the cheek (closer to nose) the tinkles would hurt and this felt fine. I love the feel of the stainless steel blade because its weight kind of makes me use a much lighter hand (I am usually too rough and heavy-handed whenever I shave my face). I assure you, this razor is SO much better + I did not want to waste so much plastic anymore... so my only complaint is that sephora does not sell the refill razors separately because that would be incredible. I’m unsure if it’s a safety/liability or shipping issue, but please please PLEASE sell the refills! The only con, is that they are sharp (duh it’s a razor) so be careful. I did nick myself a couple of times, but again, I was hurrying and not pulling my skin taut enough. Perfect ... but sell refills please!
