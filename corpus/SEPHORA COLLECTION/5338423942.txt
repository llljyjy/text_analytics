Although I havenâ€™t seen any immediate improvements to my dark spots I did see improvement the the skin around a pimple that has been healing. Overall skin looks brighter and plumper after using the serum. I understand that I must use it for several weeks to see major improvement to dark spots thus I will continue using especially after all of the raving reviews. Also I have sensitive skin and I have not had any negative reactions to this product. nan
