Sephora Nourishing moisturizer has a very thick consistency but feels very light on the skin. My skin felt hydrated all day after applying this moisturizer without making it look oily. I love sephora collection products because they are so economical. This moisturizer costs under $20 dollars giving me another reason to purchase it. On the whole I loved this product and would definitely recommend it to you guys as there was improvement in my skin texture New favourite
