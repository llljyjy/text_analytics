The tube that it comes in is so so cute but … - it is some kind of paper material ( which is cool because of the environment or whatever I guess ) but if you close it at any slight angle the paper bends and then it is hard to close forever - the consistency is very very waxy so it feels slightly uncomfy to put onto your lips cute tube but that’s it
