Just the perfect facial razor! It’s a nice heavy duty metal razor with a nice little case and 3 replacement blades (so it comes with four blades total, one already on the razor). It works so much better and smoother than those cheap plastic razors you get on Amazon and you’re creating so much less waste this way. Honestly this is one of my favorite beauty products I’ve bought in 2021. I use it weekly and I wouldn’t change a thing about it. Love it!
