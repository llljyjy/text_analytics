I usually do not go for Sephora products just because I am used to other products BUT I am so happy I tried this one. I like this moisturizer the same if not more than I have now. Itâ€™s so hard for me to find moisturizer for my face that I like. I have stuck to a very generic one for such a long time. I have now started using this one more than the one I have. You can tell how clean this moisturizer is. It feels great on my skin and leaves me feeling very refreshed (not oily at all). Would recommend to a friend! Great Moisturizer!
