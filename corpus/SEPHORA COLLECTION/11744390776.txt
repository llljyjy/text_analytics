Cute water bottle that I used only 3 times because it cracked from the bottom and spilled my water everywhere. This plastic water bottle is made from super cheap plastic and you have to be careful with it. It’s not durable, so don’t drop it-it will BREAK! I liked it a lot because it was a good size and fit perfectly in my purpose, but very fragile. Won’t last. Cute but not durable
