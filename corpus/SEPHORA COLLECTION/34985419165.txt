I received and gifted Sephora’s Targeted Dark Spots Serum. If there is one thing I look for in a product is it won’t make my face burn and cause a breakout. Reactions that I’m glad I didn’t get with this serum. Love that it is unscented and quite generous for the price. There are a lot of spot remover out there but this one hits the price and the spots right. Price and Quality
