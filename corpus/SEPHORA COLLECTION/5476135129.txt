This is a nice Vitamin C serum that is affordable and used with quality ingredients. It isn’t thick, it’s easy to apply. It has a natural scent that is very mild and not overpowering. I have dry & sensitive and I didn’t break out from this serum. My skin was glowing more after using this product and felt hydrated. I like that it has Vitamin C & E. I also appreciate that it is vegan and clean beauty. nan
