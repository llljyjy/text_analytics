Was looking for an eye cream to help with wrinkles and fine lines without retinol. After seeing the reviews and talking to Sephora employees, I took a chance on this one. First night of application, I woke up to smoothed out lines around my eyes and no dry skin. I didnâ€™t even recognize my skin! Nourishing and true results! Even without the sale price, this value and results-driven product is totally worth it! Save your money on those luxury creams and pick this up immediately! Woah!
