Love! Great lip balm for nighttime. After brushing and flossing and using my white strips my lips feel dry and I can’t sleep with dry lips. The scent is light and good for me since I love vanilla, it smells like real vanilla not the fake stuff. The texture is medium thick and a little goes a long way. I haven’t had any issues with the product getting in my mouth or whatever, I’ve read some bad reviews but I have had good a good experience. My lips feel soft in the morning with no residue. I bought this as a splurge sort of during the recent sale and I will buy it again, since it’s only $7. nan
