It works wonderfully as a SPOT treatment. This is not meant to rub on all over like a lotion or moisturizer. I shake it up really good about once a week and then let it settle, as the bottle indicates. Then I take a q tip and dip it into the powder at the bottom and apply that to any pimples or blemishes I have as the last step in my nightly skin care routine. It works beautifully. If pimples arenâ€™t gone in the first night, I use again for a second night and that does the trick. One of the BEST blemish removers I have ever used. Idk what me or my teenage kids did without this in our cabinet! Pimples gone overnight!
