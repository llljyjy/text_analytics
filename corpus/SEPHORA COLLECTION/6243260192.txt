I have been using this lip balm everyday. It’s pretty moisturizing and the cherry color has a good color to it. The color doesn’t last as long as a lipstick and it’s slightly more opaque. My only complaint is that the packaging feels very cheap but that doesn’t interfere with the product itself. Good color!
