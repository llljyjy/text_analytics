I have the lychee lip balm. The color is more like orange. The packaging is environmental friendly, itâ€™s made of paper, makes it very lightweight. It is very affordable too, only $7. I like that it is pretty hydrating. Does the job to keep my lips hydrated. It is also easy to glide on my lips. nan
