Too bad I got a defected razor otherwise I’d love this. It works well but I can’t replace the blades. I even followed directions, and ended up breaking my nail trying to take out the razor. I can’t even exchange it because of the 60 day return policy. Never buying this one again. Thanks Sephora Annoyed
