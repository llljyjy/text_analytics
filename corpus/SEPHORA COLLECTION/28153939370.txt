This is surprisingly one of the best face serums I have ever had. It looks weird and smells funny and given the price I never expected much, but it after a short while of regular use, I feel my skin is quite hydrated that no one believes I had a very dry skin.If you have dry skin, I recommend you to give this weird thing a chance. nan
