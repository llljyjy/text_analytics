I love clean, simple ingredients but I wasnâ€™t impressed by this. I have oily skin and love a good gel cleanser, but this left my skin flaky and dull looking. Positives were fragrance free, clean, great price point and contains prebiotics. Only Negative was a bit too stripping. I recommend using a moisturizer or HA serum after every use! nan
