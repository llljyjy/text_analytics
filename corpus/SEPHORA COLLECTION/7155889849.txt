I have a lot of sun damage around my temples that I’ve been self conscious about for a while now and I’m glad I was able to get my hands on this product, I’ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and I’ve already noticed my dark spots have gotten lighter, I can’t wait to continue the use of this product and hopefully completely make my dark spots disappear. I also love that it’s vegan and clean, quality doesn’t have to be expensive! ✨ nan
