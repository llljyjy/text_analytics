I was gifted this product from Sephora Collection. The cleanser is a solid cleanser and is effective to remove makeup and everyday debris/sunscreen. However, if you have dry skin, then this might be too drying for you. Additionally, it would probably be best to use this cleanser in the summer when conditions are more humid/hot. I tend to be more drawn to gentle cream cleansers in the colder months. Overall a solid, affordable cleanser. The brand could do a better job to explain the specific skincare ingredients and benefits in the product. nan
