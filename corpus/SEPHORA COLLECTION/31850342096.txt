The first photo was from 4 days ago. I use this product in the morning before I do my makeup and before I go to sleep. I’ve seen immense results only within a couple days. My eyes look less puffy, more hydrated and less darker. It doesn’t move my makeup at all, and makes my under eyes look less create. I 100% recommend! I love it!
