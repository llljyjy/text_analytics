I received this from Influenster in exchange for this review. I like this more than I thought I would. After reading reviews I was hesitant about it but it’s worked well for my skin. Absorbs well and has improved my skins dullness. I wish it wasn’t so watery, could be thicker for a serum. All in all a good product from the Sephora line. nan
