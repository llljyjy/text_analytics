Defective. The refill blades have two pieces that form a cartridge. These two pieces are supposed to be glued together however, the glue is missing. So the cartridges fall apart as soon as you remove them from the packaging. They cannot be loaded into the razor and handling the separated blade is very dangerous. I ordered three packages and all blade in all packages are defective. DEFECTIVE DO NOT BUY
