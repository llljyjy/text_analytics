SO grateful for this product!!!! Resurfacing masks tend to be CRAZY expensive, especially the higher end brands. Sephora Collection really out-did themselves with this one! Makes my skin super soft and much gentler than physical exfoliants. Would definitely recommend, especially if you struggle with acne or dull skin that needs more of a glow! Makes my skin soooo soft
