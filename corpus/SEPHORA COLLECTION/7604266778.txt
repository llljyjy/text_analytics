This is the first time I am trying this lip balm and I loved it very much. I got the watermelon flavor which smells sweet and is deliciously yummy. My chapped lips are loving this ultra-nourishing lip balm. This gives a light pinkish color and keeps the lips soft and hydrated. I use it daily during the day under my favorite lip color and before going to bed. It offers the best results at affordable price for only $7, which is a real deal. Overall I loved it and will buy again when I am out. I loved it!
