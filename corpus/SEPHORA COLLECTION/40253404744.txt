I found that applying this was a bit tricky, possibly due to not thoroughly reading the instructions or not being able to wear my glasses. It was different than the masks Iâ€™ve used in the past, because it sorta absorbed into my skin, and it was lovely to have on during the waiting time. My face was baby soft afterwards, and the entire process was a pleasure. Definitely recommend this to anyone A real treat, from start to finish
