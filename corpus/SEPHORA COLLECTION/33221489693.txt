After using this product the past few days, I can say that it is a good serum. The best? No. But good for the price point. It does feel good on the skin, no stickiness at all. Light smell, no burning, easily glides on the skin. Makes my skin look nice, clean, and gooey. I received a sample of this complimentary for reviewing purposes. Good serum
