I received this product asa free sample. I love the consistency of the serum, itâ€™s hydrating but not dewy, and I have noticed a difference in skin, the most noticeable difference is the texture. The one con about this to me personally is the scent. It does smell like perfume while your applying it, but it does go away after a few minutes. Lightweight
