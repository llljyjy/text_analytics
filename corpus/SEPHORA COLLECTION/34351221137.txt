I got this free to review from Sephora, but I will be buying this once I run out. First of all the packaging was really cute. Honestly I was not expecting much from an eight dollar lip products but after opening it I immediately got a smell of sour watermelon candies and I was hooked. Not only does it smell amazing but the moisture that it provided was amazing! nan
