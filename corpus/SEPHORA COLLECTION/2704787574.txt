I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. I have been impressed with this toner. It leaves the skin feeling soothed and refreshed when using and with ingredients like Vitamin C, this toner also helps our skin glow (and I always love that glow!). Plus, itâ€™s only $12, which means you can get a great toner at an affordable price. Great toner for an affordable price.
