An absolute favourite! I built a little morning self care routine around this tool! The face massage has helped reverse some of the early lines on my face (I’m 41). The lymphatic drainage from my face/neck massage helps with my year around allergies and I run the tool along my lats which helps loosen my thighs post knee injury. My boyfriend and I frequently do massage on each other’s back and that’s amazing too considering we’re far from trained professionals. The tool is of perfect size to have a good grip on it and the several edge options are great for the massages mentioned above. I don’t spend a lot of time on those routines but certainly upgrades my life! Can't live without mine!
