Look no further. This is my second bottle. I received a free jar and once i ran out I purchased this one. Few things you need to know: most of it absorbs quickly but this is a rich, thick cream so you will feel a thin layer on your skin for few hours. Nothing gross or overwhelming but it’s there. If you have oily skin you want to use something else. Dry skin, agin skin, this is your dream come true. My skin looked so good on day one I couldn’t believe it. Can’t wait to see long term results. A bargain for the quality. nan
