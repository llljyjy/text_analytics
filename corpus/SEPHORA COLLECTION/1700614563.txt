I have been searching for a clean & vegan all day moisturizer that won’t break the bank, so I was SO excited when I started using this All Day Hydrator! Especially during the winter when my skin gets dry, it leaves my skin hydrated without being too oily or shiny.  I love that it’s non scented so you know there aren’t a bunch of crazy chemicals mixed in. Also works well as a makeup primer - my makeup hardly fades when applied after using this product! Great clean product w/o breaking the bank!
