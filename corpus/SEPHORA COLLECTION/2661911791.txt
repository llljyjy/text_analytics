This is a clear, thin gel that’s thin but not so thin it doesn’t stay on your hands. There is a real slip to this, it doesn’t feel oily at all, but it goes over your skin with the ease of an oil or serum. I absolutely love it, it feels so gentle, there is no fragrance… don’t let that gentle feel fool you, this removes even waterproof liner and mascara with ease. This doesn’t sting or create a film on my eyes like some balm makeup removers can, it rinses everything away easily. You only need to use a small amount and after rinsing skin feels so hydrated, it’s almost as though you have already applied moisturizer. This has replaced my Clinique Take The Day Off and it’s affordable so it’s in every bathroom for the whole family. Affordably Amazing
