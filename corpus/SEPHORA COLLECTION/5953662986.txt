This product has quickly become one of my favorite products! The clean and vegan formula immediately caught my attention since I’m a vegan and try and keep my products as clean as possible. I received this as a gift from Sephora and I honestly love it. It’s not expensive and does an amazing job at keeping my under eyes moisturized and I’ve noticed that i don’t have as bad dark under eye bags. It also doesn’t irritate my eyes like some other eye creams. Very happy with this product. Hydrating and non irritating
