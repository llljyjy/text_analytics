A little hard to give a clear review on the true “efficacy“ of this product, considering I’m in my 20s and anti-aging is hard to gauge over a few weeks. But I can say that this product is totally inoffensive in all the ways that matter (smell, texture, etc), the packaging is convenient to use, and it mixes well with my night moisturizer. At the very least it seems to be giving my skin a bit of a plump the next morning! Inoffensive, Good Price
