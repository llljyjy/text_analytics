I’m currently on accutane which drys out your lips completely and keep searching for a lip balm which helps if even only for 20 minutes. This lip balm isn’t moisturizing whatsoever. It also smells like Play-Dog, NOT cherry. It does have a nice tint to it, so if you just need a bit of extra color it does work well for that. Not Moisturizing At All
