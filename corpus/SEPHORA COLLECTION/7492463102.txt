I love this serum. The last bakuchiol serum I used cost 3x as much and irritated my skin. This serum is already working wonders. My skin tone looks much more even and has reduced the typical redness I have. My face and neck look healthier than just a couple weeks ago. I cannot believe what a bargain this is. Retinol is just too irritating for me, and Iâ€™m way too sensitive to the sun as it is. Bakuchiol is the perfect alternative for me. Please keep making this product! Can't believe the quality for the price
