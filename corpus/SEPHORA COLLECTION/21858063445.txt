This product was gifted from the brand but I truly fell in love with it! Iâ€™ve been trying to find a clean and vegan skincare product and this was a great introduction into that. I use it as a daily moisturizer and it feels amazing on the skin. Since wear a mask all day, this moisturizer absorbs into the skin quickly and leaves it feeling plump with none of that greasy feeling which I love. The price point is a plus especially on a student budget. Amazing moisturizer!
