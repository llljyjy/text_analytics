I love this sleeping mask, especially for the low price! It smells yummy and feels great on my lips. I put it on before I go to bed and wake up with hydrated lips. I love using this in the dry months of the wintertime, as my lips get chapped. With this product, my chapped lips are instantly gone in the morning. Thank you Sephora! Great quality for the price!
