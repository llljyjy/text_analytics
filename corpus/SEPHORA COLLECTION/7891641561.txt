I’ve tried out a lot of Vitamin C serums, my favorite way to use them is to mix them with a moisturizer that I like so they aren’t as potent since I have sensitive skin. If you have texture on oily areas, leftover acne spots you can’t seem to get rid of or dull skin this really seems to help. I always think of it as a really soft exfoliate, less harsh than physical scrubs or retinol. This one did all of that for me and I looked it up & it’s pretty cheap compared to some other Vitamin C Serums! They have a holiday gift set right now that is only $15 for a larger size of this along with a Vitamin C toner (I haven’t tried the toner though.) This product is very light, not heavy & sinks into the skin very quick after using it. All in all, good product that is cheaper than a lot of alternative products that are very similar. Cheaper alternative to other Vitamin C serums!
