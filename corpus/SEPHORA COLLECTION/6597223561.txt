I love the texture of this product, the coverage, and how non-greasy it feels. Itâ€™s perfect for combining with my other skincare products (like borage oil or ascorbic acid from The Ordinary) and has not broken me out at all. It also really helps my skin not look shiny from oiliness and dehydration! nan
