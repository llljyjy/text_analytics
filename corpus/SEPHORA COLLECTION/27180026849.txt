Good products that work don’t have to be expensive! I’m loving this pores targeting serum..it’s clean and vegan and gentle, gets the job done, but isn’t too harsh for my sensitive aging skin. Bha is amazing! And 6% is perfect to be effective but not burn the skin off your face like other products. I’ve noticed my enlarged pores look less obvious and my small fine lines look improved too. The ingredients also help with acne which I struggle with for decades. Win-win for me. I’ll keep using and can’t wait to see the results after the entire bottle is finished. Get this for yourself!!
