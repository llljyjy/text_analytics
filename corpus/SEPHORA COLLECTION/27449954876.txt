The bottle was spilled all over the bag when I received it. Called customer service which was great and they sent a free replacement, I receive the second bottle unopened but the pump doesn’t work at all. I don’t like the dropper types and was really hoping this one would be great but now I have to open and pour on my hand to use. Might sound silly but if it has a pump, it should work! The hemp smell is also very strong. Pump doesn’t work
