Shockingly good!! I bought this as an impulse buy while I was inline and who could resist the $3 price tag. I honestly had low expectations for it but so far, i am blown away. The toner leaves my skin feeling extra clean and without drying it out. It leaves a perfect canvas for makeup and use it at night after cleaning and exfoliating, before moisturizing and apply serum!! Will definitely be repurchasing in the future!! nan
