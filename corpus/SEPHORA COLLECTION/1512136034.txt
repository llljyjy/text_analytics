A new vegan and clean moisturizer from Sephora. Price point is fantastic and it stacks up to more expensive options.Texture reminds me of a priming moisturizer and I definitely feel hydrated after applying with no tightness after (which sometimes happens with lighterweight moisturizers to me). Sinks in quickly and even though I’m on the oily side I don’t feel like it adds any greasier even after a full day of wear Great affordable option
