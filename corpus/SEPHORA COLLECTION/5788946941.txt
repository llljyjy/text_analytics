THANK YOU SEPHORA FOR CHANGING THE FORMULA! This is an excellent example what happens when a company actually listen to what their customers need. The new formula is not only more hydrating, they added more skin identifying ingredients, AND it is now fragrance free. Fragrance free is so so important for so many different kind of problematic skin, making this a fragrance free product means this is now so much more accessible for different skin type :) This is definitely my new staple, goodbye Kiehl’s LOVE THE FORMULA CHANGE! IT’S NOW FRAGRANCE FREE!
