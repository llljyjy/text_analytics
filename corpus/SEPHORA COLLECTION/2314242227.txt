I LOVE this face brush. Years ago, Sephora carried a face brush with a pink handle to use while washing your face. I loved it. And I always included it in gift bags to my friends. It disappeared. Mine wore out and this one came and it is 100% better. The bristles are softer and the shape is far gentler. YouCan’t misuse this. I keep mine in the shower. It’s the best way to wash your face. Thanks for bringing it back BETTER. Get it. It’s amazing nan
