This actually works and I’m honestly shocked. I use this in conjunction with The Ordinary Caffeine serum. I know this eye cream already has caffeine in it but using this with the serum I’ve noticed such a difference in my dark circles. I have puffy dark circles (plus allergies) so my dark circles are very apparent. This has improved them by at least 40%! I’m already on my second jar. Keep using this!
