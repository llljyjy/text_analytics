I received a sample size of this serum to try and although it was nice, I won’t be repurchasing it. The serum has a liquid consistency so I feel like some of my product was wasted being absorbed into my hands on application. Additionally, the ingredients have parfum (fragrance) and orange & lemon fruit extract fairly high up on the list. These ingredients are unnecessary since they can be sensitizing to certain skin. Overall, the serum was well-tolerated on my skin, but I didn’t have enough of the product to truly tell if it faded hyperpigmentation on my skin. There are other vitamin C serums that I’d rather use in my daily routine than this one. Nice to Try, but Not a Staple
