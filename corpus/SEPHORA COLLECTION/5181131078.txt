As someone who did not use a vitamin C serum regularly, I have really been enjoying using this  before my moisturizer. This serum is lightweight and absorbs pretty well. I have combination skin and this has not caused me to break out at all. I love the fresh smell. This has been a great new addition to my regimen. I would recommend this to anyone looking on adding vitamin C serum to their skincare routine. Good Vitamin C Introduction!
