I was gifted this by Sephora Collection. I have liked this moisturizer. I usually apply it before my make up. I feel like it has made my skin a lot more hydrated especially during the colder months when my skin is at its driest. I will rebuy this because itâ€™s very affordable and has worked very well with my skin. Amazing
