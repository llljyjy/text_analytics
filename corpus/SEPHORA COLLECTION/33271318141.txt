I received this product for free in exchange for my honesty in trying it.  I really feel that it works the same as the rest of the serums, although this one feels very sticky, but other than that, my face felt the same as with the rest, although the sample was so small that I would have liked to try it for more days and see if change something in my complexion. it's good but not the best
