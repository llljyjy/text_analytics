I normally use the Farmacy Green Clean cleansing balm as my first cleanse and thought I’d try this since it is less than half the price. It broke me out in a rash on the first use which is very disappointing. Will be returning. While it melts and spreads nicely it does not clean as well as other cleansing balms I’ve used in the past. If you’re looking for a affordable cleansing balm I’d try the Inkey List Oat Cleaning Balm instead. The oat cleansing balm worked well with my dry and sensitive skin. nan
