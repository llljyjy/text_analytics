I just received this product and when I applied it to my face it went on smooth. A little goes a long way which is good and not wasteful. I saw results within only 3 hours and it was a good difference. I had an even coverage and it was a beautiful tan, not orange. On the bottle you can apply twice a day depending on how dark you want, I have also discovered that it darkens depending on your skin tone (duh lol). I also went to work after I applied and the tan did not come off on the mask and it has stayed on through face washes and makeup removal wipes. Highly recommend Great Product!
