I bought a couple of packages to take while traveling as I thought the small size was perfect for my trip. They were very disappointing. They are very dry. It took quite a bit of rubbing to get my mascara off and I needed another to clean my face. They don’t thoroughly clean, so I had to wash my face after using them and there was still a lot left on my face...and I don’t where a lot of makeup. I use mascara and a tinted moisturizer. Don't Bother!
