I have combo skin, and have been looking for a new, affordable moisturizer.  This one has exceeded my expectations!  I’ve been using it as a night cream, and it’s transformed my skin.  Its thick and seems like it is sitting on top of my skin, but absorbs over night and my skin totally seems plump in the morning.  I’m sold! nan
