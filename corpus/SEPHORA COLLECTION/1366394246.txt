It’s a great lightweight hydrating moisturizer. My skin is drinking this thing no joke. Especially now NYC been so cold lately and my skin gets so crust and dry. I apply it twice a day and it feels good! I also like that this product is vegan and has clean ingredients! Plus there is no fragrance in it. I know some people don’t like like scented skin care. To sum it up quality doesn’t have to be expensive! Great for cold winter months
