Smells so strongly of perfume it’s giving me a headache. I wouldn’t say it’s the most moisturizing face mask I’ve ever tried either. I’m very sensitive to scents/perfumes and had to wash it off almost immediately after removing the sheet because it made me so nauseous. Would not recommend to anyone with a perfume sensitivity!!! heavy perfume
