No allergic reaction or itching, thankfully; great gradual and natural color. Ordered my second bottle. I have never had the “bruised knees” look or color buildup on the backs of my ankles, which is a “gift” from so many others I have tried. Just works for me! Second bottle, and I’ve tried them all!
