I’ve been trying to swap out all my products for clean and vegan ones and was so excited to try this toner. I’ve noticed in the past that some toners strip my skin too much and dries it out a bit. This one doesn’t at all, plus I love the added vitamins to help nourish. Overall this is such a win, especially at the price point. nan
