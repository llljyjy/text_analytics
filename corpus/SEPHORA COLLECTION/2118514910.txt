3 stars because I don’t know how my skin will feel when I’m done. Came with a piece to put on your chest which I thought was cool and unexpected. But it does not stay on your face. Has a weird texture compared to other sephora masks and it won’t lay over my face, it comes up in some parts and keeps sliding off. Expect to lay down on your back if you want it to stay on your face. nan
