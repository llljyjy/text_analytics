I was excited to use this product because I have large pores and I don’t love them. I was excited to see if this product worked like it has for other people, but I haven’t noticed a difference. I do love that it has clean ingredients and is vegan cause even though it didn’t work for me, I love that I wasn’t putting any harsh chemicals on my face! Didn’t work for me :/
