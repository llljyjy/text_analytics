My lips were hydrated and kissable this morning as I tried it for the first night last night. I know it doesnâ€™t have the best reviews, but I guess my experience with it was different, it actually had the pleasant vanilla smell. I might have ruined the effect by applying another product I reviewed, which was the dragon fruit lip balm/scrub. nan
