I had high hopes for this cleansing balm.  I was looking for one that would travel well and remove my makeup, including waterproof mascara.  Unfortunately, this is not it. I used this is my 1st cleanse and although it removed my face make up my mascara stayed put.   It also stung my eyes pretty bad that I couldn’t wait to rinse it off.  I have to use another makeup remover for my eyes and use this for my face only.  I won’t repurchase this again. Didn't remove waterproof mascara & stings eyes
