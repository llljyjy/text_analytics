After using this product for the pastCouple of weeks I am loving the product. I use it in the morning along with daily skin care. What I love about this product is that my skin did not react bad to it at all! No weird textures, no dry skin, no overlyOil skin, no pimples. It just does what it needs to do without causing anything weird to happen to your skin. I feel like it gives my sling a youthful glow which I really like. I really like this product! Sephora did it again! No skin irritation - glowey skin
