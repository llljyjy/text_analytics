I love using face masks and I’m always looking for new ones to try. I love that this mask comes in a bottle with a pump. You don’t need very much and it’s nice you leave it on for 10 minutes so you can do other things and then rinse it off. I have slightly sensitive skin and wasn’t irritated by this at all. I love that you only need to use it once a week too instead of an every day one so it’s not time consuming at all. It’s very easy to use and feels good and makes my skin feel nice and smooth after using. nan
