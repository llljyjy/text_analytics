Moisturizing is my favorite part of my skincare routine, so I’m always trying new ones. I love this one because it’s light and smooth, and it’s amazing quality for a clean product (certified Clean At Sephora!) at an under $20 price point! The small package is perfect for your travel bag and the pink top is totally aesthetically pleasing perfect everyday moisturizer
