Finally got my hands on the Sephora Moisturizing Lip Balm in the shade “watermelon” here are my honest thoughts on the product! Before I wear any glosses or liquid lipsticks I always apply a hydrating lip balm for a smoother application and this one did not disappoint. A little went a long long way and the watermelon scent and flavor was delightful. I will definitely be recommending this product! Love this stuff!
