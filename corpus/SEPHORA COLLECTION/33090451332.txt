I was truly impressed with how well this has worked for how affordable it is! I struggle with pores on my cheeks and acne and dark-sports on my chin/jaw. Overall, I was impressed with the results and will keep using and most likely repurchase! Also I have sensitive skin and it didnâ€™t make it react at all which is an extra plus!! Truly great and affordable!
