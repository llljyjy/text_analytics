smaller then expected but still a good size, I LOVED the feeling after the first use,  it really felt like a lip exfoliator/lip balm and I LOOVED it, now it feels like just a lip exfoliator that leaves your lips moisturized, (which is still great) usually these dry out and then when you try to apply it the sugar comes off everywhere but this one is great, I’m hoping to try the other ones I just ordered the vanilla one, all in all this is a great product and this is my honest review, I do wish that it tasted like mint though, it smells like mint and every now and then you get a sugar taste from all the sugar that exfoliates your lips, the taste kind of reminds me of old beauty oil,  if anyone knows what that smells like, or like expired face/body oil, otherwise it’s a great product, I would say order it Not too rough lip exfoliator balm
