I typically donâ€™t think many of these dark stop removal make that much of a difference  but this one does! It is so comfortable to use, it caused zero irritation and sank into my skin relative fast. I love that it is unscented, I dislike heavily scented skincare. This one feels so lightweight and truly I notice some lightening! I love that Sephora has come out with their own more affordable skincare line, since as they say quality does not have to be expensive! Zero irritation!
