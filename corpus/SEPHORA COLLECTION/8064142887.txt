I have always been a fan of Sephora brands because not only are they affordable they work just like high end brands without having to worry about the bank. This is a perfect moisturizer for anyone starting off with exfoliants and want a cream to help repair the skin barrier at the same time. This is also a great moisturizer for teenagers who want to start an easy affordable routine. I’ve never used a moisturizer that has prebiotics skin I don’t have much to compare other than it’s an easy and affordable moisturizer. I tend to use my more affordable products a lot because I don’t feel bad for using it so it’s a yes for me. nan
