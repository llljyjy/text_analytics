After some changes in my health, I’ve had to start taking a variety of pills and needed help managing them. This thing is great! It’s small so it fits in any purse, bag or pocket and has the right amount of space for all I need - even the basic Advils and daily vitamins. The only thing I wish is that it come in other colours. Other than that, a perfect purchase! Tiny and Efficient!
