I got this hydrator product with high hopes as the winter had been doing a number on my skin. It is extremely lightweight. I barely feel it on my face but I definitely notice that it’s doing it’s job because I have less flaky skin.   It is clean and vegan which isn’t always easy to find and I find it’s a good price ! Lightweight and works well
