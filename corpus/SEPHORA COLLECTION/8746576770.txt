I want to be 100% transparent i honestly feel like when i started using this i noticed my pores MORE! especially when i put makeup on which NEVER happens to me. i will continue to try to work with it after the last week but i don’t think my skin and this product are compatible. i didn’t see any other benefits or lack there of for my skin so i can’t really recommend if you already don’t have pore problems or they’re very minimal  i would just skip this all together Not the best for my skin tone did slightly hydrate
