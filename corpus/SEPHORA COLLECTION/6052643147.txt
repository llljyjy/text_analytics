This is a great lip balm at an awesome price! It feels a little more luxe than a typical chapstick you’d pick up at a drugstore. It’s super hydrating and I love the tint that it gives my lips. It’s natural enough to wear during the day but a great item to always have in your purse in a pinch! Great lip balm to keep on hand!
