Got it as a gift for mom so we could both enjoy spa days. :) She is a typical Ukrainian mother who does not care about beauty or skincare, but rather focused on taking care of a household. Though I typically enjoy luxurious and more expensive masks, Iâ€™m happy this is the first masks I introduced her into as a beginner of her skincare journey. Reminds me of Tonymoly masks a little honestly. Not to mention this is a great value for 14 masks ($0.42 cents each mask really??) I also like the idea of packaging and how convenient it is. Gotta stretch them out to fit it for your face shape though. Really good! Got it for my mother to try it out together!
