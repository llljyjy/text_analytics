Honestly I thought these weren’t going to work, just more of a fun thing to do. I was shook by the result. My eyes have a thick natural crease under them and after having it on the line was almost gone! I can’t say that this would would be a long term result if used consistently but I am pretty surprised it worked! Great to do if you have an event or if your eyes seem extra puffy one day. Shook
