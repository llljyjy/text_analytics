Bought this lip balm hoping it would be as good as the old version of the Sephora coconut lip balm. The old formula was much better. This lip balm tastes awful and doesnâ€™t do a very good job hydrating like the old formula. Please bring back the old formula. I will not be buying this lip balm again. It is greasy and smells and tastes terrible. It tastes more like chemicals than coconut. Does not hydrate well and horrible taste.
