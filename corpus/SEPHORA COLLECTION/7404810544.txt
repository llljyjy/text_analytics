This worked great on my skin. I have dry skin with the occasional hormonal breakout. I have recently been dealing with dry patches and my skin has been looking dull and thirsty. I bought this on a whim and will be continuing to buy this from now on. Don’t waste money on $50 skincare when a lot of the ingredients are based solely on marketing and offer no true benefit. There’s a few Sephora collection items which have performed beautifully and this is one of them. I have radiant looking skin now. Perfection
