This serum is so phenomenal! I love that it’s a clean product and vegan! And i love that it is extremely affordable! First of all it’s so lightweight and easy to use, absorbs quickly to the skin! I felt my uneven skin looked so much balanced and even toned after consistent using! I added it to my morning and night routine and i apply my moisturizer after it leaves my skin so smooth and hydrated and also more evened! Overall i love it and recommend it More evened skin
