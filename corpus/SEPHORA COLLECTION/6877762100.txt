This is just pertaining to the large pack coconut haven’t had this problem with the other types. I think the formula changed or the material of the wipe but there’s so much left product behind on my face I feel like I need to rinse it off. It leaves too much of the cleanser in my eyes taking away from the convenience of the wipes. The quality of the actual wipe is good and strong just wish there wasn’t all this extra stuff left behind on my face. Too much cleanser in the wipe
