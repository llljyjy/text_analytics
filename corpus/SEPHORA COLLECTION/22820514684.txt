I am always looking for the best quality products made from the best quality ingredients for the best price. I think that Sephora did an excellent job with this vegan, clean brightening eye cream. Eye creams I often find to be over hyped and over priced, except for this one! I used it twice a day.. . in the morning and at night. I can confidently say that my under eyes felt significantly more moisturized and were certainly brighter. I have a personal struggle with dark circles and that this cream really made a difference. For the price point and the ingredients I would certainly give this a try! Worth it!
