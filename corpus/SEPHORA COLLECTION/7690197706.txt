I received a mini of this product complimentary for testing purposes. It’s an okay product and not something that I see as becoming a staple in my routine. My skin is finicky and I usually stick to the basics of cleanser + light moisturizer + SPF. A lot of serums or treatment-type products end up not working well for me in the long run or cause irritation or dryness after consistent use. So I’ll finish using it, but I won’t repurchase nan
