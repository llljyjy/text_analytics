I received this product for free from Influenster and Sephora in exchange for my honest review:I am pleasantly surprised by how much I like this. This has a thin serum consistency - not oily, not sticky, and clear. I didn’t notice much fragrance. The Vitamin C form is Ascorbyl Glucoside, which I believe is a form of L-Ascorbic Acid. This is one of the gentler forms of Vitamin C (and also one of the less stable, so I would love to see a full-size bottle design that’s opaque). This formulation worked well for my sensitive skin - it didn’t cause irritation, redness, or tingling. Note that the ingredients do include citrus extracts which could cause sensitivity for some people. It also didn’t cause breakouts for me. I was surprised to notice post-acne hyperpigmentation appear to lighten within a week of using this, and only continue to get better with use. It left my skin dewy and supple. I would absolutely buy this again. Sephora came through with an affordable, gentle, and effective Vitamin C serum. A pleasant surprise
