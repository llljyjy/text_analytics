I love Sephoraâ€™s skin care line It is very affordable and effective and this Bakuchiol is no exception. It is very gentle on the skin. It has vitamin E and I also love that I can use it during the day as the second step of my facial routine. It is the perfect option to take care of expression lines even in months with more sun, Highly recommended!! Effective!
