I haven’t been able to use this product regularly enough to see how it works for me, because the scent is so overwhelming and gross. It smells strongly like bathroom cleaner and totally turns me off of using it on my face. I may continue to use it every so often, I liked how my face felt after using it, but the smell means it definitely isn’t an everyday cleanser for me. Fragrance free?? Smells like bathroom cleaner.
