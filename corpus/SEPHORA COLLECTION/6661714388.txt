This is definitely a new formula than the previous one I had! The moisturizer is thicker, and has a weird smell compared to the last one which was a little more runny and had such a pleasant smell. I definitely preferred the previous formula. HOWEVER, this one isnâ€™t bad! Not a love, but I did keep it New formula?? Miss the old one.
