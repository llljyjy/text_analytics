This moisturizer with hyaluronic acid keeps my skin hydrated all day. It’s great quality and reasonably priced. It’s a simple lightweight, clean + vegan moisturizer with all the things you need in a daily moisturizer. I like that it is unscented, absorbs easily and protects skin from environmental damage. Good Everyday Moisturizer
