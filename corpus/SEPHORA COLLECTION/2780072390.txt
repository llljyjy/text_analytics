When I tell you that I have tried and used a lot of eye creams, I really mean A LOT. There was only one other eye cream that I repurchased over and over again. Sephoraâ€™s is making that list. I appreciate the lightweight yet super hydrating feel it gives. It feels like a gel but acts like a cream. It also primes my eyes beautifully for under eye concealer or color corrector. I have to get another one. It's a W for me.
