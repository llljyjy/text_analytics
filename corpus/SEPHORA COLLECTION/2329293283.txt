I bought this when The Ordinary AHA/BHA peel was out of stock and I’m glad I did, because I like this better. I don’t have sensitive skin so others may have a different experience, but I didn’t feel any tingling or burning with this. It actually left my skin feeling physically cooled after use, as if it had peppermint in it (it doesn’t), so I’m not sure what caused that, but it felt great. My skin is smoother and this is a great chemical exfoliant. Works great
