This is NOT for anyone with picky skin. I’m no stranger to actives. Or vitamin C specifically. But I usually use the Vital C line from Image. My skin likes most of their products. I knew I was taking one for the sensitive-skin team with this one right off the bat based off of my research, and the strong scent of the product. Strong perfumes are usually always bad news for me. In all fairness I tried all 3 of my fresh for fall Influenster products together. And all 3 of them were fragranced. The Belif cleansing balm and jelly cleanser also have a lot of essential oils in them which my skin hates. But I knew by looking at the ingredients of all of this stuff my face was going to hate it. I didn’t want to prolong my suffering by trying all of these products individually. So yeah. Sensitive skin babes beware! Not for reactive/sensitive skin
