I was hoping to love this product. My sensitive skin was becoming very dry and I needed a good moisturizer. But this product seriously caused a ton of damage. My face broke out With more acne than Iâ€™ve seen since my teen years. The redness and bumps all over my face looked like a terrible case of rosacea. And it clogged my pores so that I also had bumps that matched my complexion. I also dryness around my mouth and the moisturizer caused brown small patches in those areas.  This is not for sensitive skin. Do Not Buy this if your skin is sensitive
