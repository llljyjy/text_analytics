the razor itself is great. i bought one but they actually sent me two! Thanks sephora! but i’ve noticed finger prints on the substitute razor blades, which seemed oily and they’re literally on every blade so I would recommend disinfecting your razor before the first use. I will be a repeated buyer because these are of top quality. thanks for the extra but beware dirty blades
