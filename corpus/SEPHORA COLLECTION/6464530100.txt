i really like it! before using it, I was doing a single wash but the double wash has made a difference! i don’t have a ton of experience with cleansing balms and perhaps I like this one because it’s the first one I tried. it feels very nice on the skin and has a subtle scent that is nice as well. I won’t give it 5 stars cause I’m not raving over it but I still think it’s a great option and I’m happy with the price and quality overall! affordable and trusty
