I’m always on the hunt for a good moisturizer, especially during the winter months my skin gets SO dry! Let me start off by saying you definitely get an amazing value with this product, especially for the quality. I love that it is scent free, it almost has a gel like cooling effect and soaks right into the skin, super refreshing! Of course I also love when skincare is formulated with clean ingredients, which this is as well! Definitely would recommend trying out for the price point, I feel like it’s gonna sell out quick! Get it before they sell out!
