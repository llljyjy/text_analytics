The main thing I like about this serum is its affordability for its level of quality. I have been trying to incorporate more clean products into my skincare routine and this fit perfectly being vegan and clean. I especially love how the bottle was made out of recycled glass too!I have very stubborn acne scarring in my cheeks, and have notice the dark spots getting ever so lighter. I have only been trying this product for a week, so with long-term use Iâ€™m optimistic that it will continue improving my scarring. nan
