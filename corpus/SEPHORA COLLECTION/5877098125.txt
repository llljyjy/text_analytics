I loved the DE Baby Facial but I can only buy it if I goto the US it’s not available in Canada due to the high % of AHA/BHA, same with the Ordinary. Got this and I must say for 1/4 of the cost of DE it’s very comparable. It smells better than the DE version, it doesn’t sting as much, I found my skin is just as dewy and glowy after. Dupe for DE and Ordinary.
