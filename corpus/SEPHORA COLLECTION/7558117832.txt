I find this hydrator to be OK. It says on the packaging that it is unscented but it does have a weird smell to it that I did not like. Texture wise I think it is very thin (seems like liquidish cream) as compared to other moisturizers that Iâ€™ve used. It spreads and applies wonderfully on the skin. If this product did not have the weird smell I would definitely purchase it but it is a NO for me at the moment. okay hydrator
