Obsessed! This cleanser was gentle on my skin. It’s hard to find exfoliating cleansers that don’t make your skin feel dry and tight after a few minutes of using it but this one does quite the opposite. Before I even moisturized my skin felt hydrated and supple. I also love how affordable it is. I will definitely be making this cleanser a permanent addition to my skin care routine.
