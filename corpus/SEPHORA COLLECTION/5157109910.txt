First, love that this is vegan. Second, it’s really saving my bacon right now during a cold midwestern winter! I love putting this on in the morning and getting an instant boost of hydration. I also love the price. It’s performing as well or better then most of my higher end favorites! Love that quality doesn’t have to be expensive! It doesn’t have much of an odor, if you’re sensitive. Mostly just like regular lotion. Great Quality!
