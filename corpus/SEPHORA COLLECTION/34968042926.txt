I would not reccomend this moisturizer. The moisturizer feels like a normal everyday moisturizer from the drugstore for like 8 bucks. For reference my routine is cleanser, a hydrating toner, serum, a face oil, and this moisturizer. The moisturizer does not last for longer than a few hours even when kayered with other hydrating products.I take care to introduce products one at a time and give them the best shot at working. I even switched from my salicylic acid cleanser to my hylauronic acid cleanser and it STILL did not come close to being as moisturizing as claimed.  The fact that this teeny moisturizer does not keep my skin moisturized after a hydrating toner and a hydrating face oil shows me that itâ€™s not very effective. Verrry meh
