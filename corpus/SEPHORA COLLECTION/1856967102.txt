I’m very new to the de-puffing facial roller game, and was hesitant to buy one, since there are so many different shapes/sizes out there and mixed reviews. However, when I received this product from Sephora Collection in exchange for my honest review I just had to try it! So far, its been a good experience. I’m still learning from my estheticians the techniques/tricks one should do when using facial rollers, but I have seen some benefits so far. I recommend to make sure your face has enough moisture before rolling this product, maybe when you’re applying your serums its best to roll. I would recommend to also actively clean this product when using it and for extra benefits, storing it in the fridge if you want to roll in the morning and help de-puff some of the areas around your eyes.  Overall, good product. Good product, for the price!
