I literally never write reviews, but this moisturizer ruined my skin. I’ve never had very acne-prone skin; I usually get a massive pimple or two on my chin but nothing horrible. I used this product once a day for 2 weeks and it made my skin break out HORRIBLY! All over my face, not just the usual chin. I have normal to mildly dry skin and the only thing I changed with my skin care routine was this. I’m disappointed, but after seeing other reviews, it looks like I’m not alone. My skin hated it
