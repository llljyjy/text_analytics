I used these for dermaplaning and it worked out really well for me! I do always recommend putting on some sort of thick jelly on before, this helps to leave a softer finish (I used the lite sauce for item beauty, but you can use something like Vaseline too). If you just use these on dry skin they can skid, but they aren’t very sharp so they won’t cut or get off all of the hair. Overall great product for the price! I love for dermaplaning
