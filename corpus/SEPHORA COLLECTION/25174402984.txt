As a student, I love ordering Sephora brand products because it’s great quality skincare for a much more reasonable cost for my price range. I’ve been struggling with acne that left me with a few scars and dark, pigmented spots on my face. It’s only been a few days since I’ve been using this product and I’m literally already seeing a difference and my skin beginning to get its glow back. It’s also a plus they are clean and cruelty free :) nan
