I started using this product about a week ago and im not 100% sure it’s doing the job for me, but I’ll continue to use it to see. I will say, however, that the formula is so soft and leave my skin feeling bouncy and not sticky. It spreads nicely, you don’t need a lot of product at all. The packaging is cute and I look forward to seeing how it treats my skin Still not sure but it's great so far
