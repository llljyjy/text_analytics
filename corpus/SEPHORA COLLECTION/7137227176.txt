I received this product from Sephora Collection in exchange for my honest review. I have really sensitive skin and have been breaking out so much from the stress of WFH. This cleanser has truly changed the game for me, and has quickly become my new favorite. It feels so refreshing on my skin and makes me glow!! Feels like heaven
