I’m amazed at how cheap this cleanser is considering what it does. This is the best exfoliating cleanser I’ve ever used, hands down. My skin gets very easily irritated by higher concentrations of acids (especially BHA) and I’m assuming that the concentrations are relatively low in this cleanser since they aren’t specified. The other 100+ reviews aren’t lying when they say this is gentle - so gentle I can use it twice a day, everyday. But despite that, it still works. My skin has never been smoother, no flakiness or dehydration even though this winter has been especially harsh, and so clear. And clean and fragrance free, to boot! I’m a bit annoyed with myself that I was paying over 3X as much for a cleanser that admittedly I also liked, but I like this one even better! Don’t change a thing, Sephora, you nailed it! Nailed It!
