The Sephora Clean Skin Gel cleaner is a great affordable cleanser, I have sensitive skin and I was skeptical at first but it has been a nice for gentle use. I like to use it in the morning to clean my face before starting my make up routine and at night just to get any extra make up off my safe. I love that itâ€™s unscented, vegan and truly for all skin types. AMAZING AFFORDABLE AND VEGAN
