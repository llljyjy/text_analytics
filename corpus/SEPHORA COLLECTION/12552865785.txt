I’ve only used this cream a few times - it does absolutely make my skin look younger.  And it doesn’t instantly sink in to my skin leaving it feeling dry an hour later.  But its extremely thick and it doesn’t blend well on the skin and pills.  I’ll try using less, and if that doesnt work Ill try using it on top of thinner oiler moisturizers to see if they prevent this one from pilling.  Maybe after playing around I’ll find the sweet spot- but not sure if I’d buy this again even though it’s very affordable.For reference I’m 49 with very dry skin and fine and deeper lines as well as skin sagging - this definitely addresses all three noticeably after only a few days.  I don’t look 20 lol but it’s definitely firming and tightening my skin at least while the product is on. nan
