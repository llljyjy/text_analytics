Sephora Collection gifted me this product in exchange for my honest opinion. It really is scent free. This is not actually a peel mask because you wash it off after 10 minutes, but its does make my skin feel nice. I always gravitate towards products that have the Sephora Clean stamp. Def worth trying! Peel Mask
