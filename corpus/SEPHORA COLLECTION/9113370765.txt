I was given this soap along with the Vegan Makeup Remover and Cleansing Brush by Sephora, two new products to my skin care routine. After a week of using both, I can say this power duo is a new staple! After washing with this soap and complimented by the brush’s power, my skin feels clean, smooth and fresh. There’s no weird soapy residue left bending, which is amazing! My skin also doesn’t feel too tight/dry after use, which I appreciate it. It’s a fairly gentle cleanser as well. It doesn’t irritate or tingle at all. All in all, it feels like a great daily cleanser for my low-effort skincare routine. Note: Sephora Collection gifted me to this product, but the opinions are completely my own based on my experience. Gentle yet effective cleanser
