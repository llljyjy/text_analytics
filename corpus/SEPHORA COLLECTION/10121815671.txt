I bought this on a wim when I forgot to pack a makeup remover and Im not mad, especially with the price. This balm is thick but feels really good when taking off my makeup. It removes it well and takes off mascara pretty effectively too. It not my favorite overall because there’s nothing super special about it but id recommend if you need a cleansing balm on a budget. I’ll definitely finish the product but I dont know if I would repurchase again. nan
