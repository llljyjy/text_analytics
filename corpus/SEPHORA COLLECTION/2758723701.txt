AHAs and BHAs are some of the best chemical exfoliators you can use for your skin. I’m always on the lookout for a new way to incorporate these key ingredienets in my skincare. Unfortunately, most products on the market are full of other filler ingredients and have a minimal amount of the acids to be really effective. This serum is a great way to clear out the pores and even out my complexion. With chemical treatments, you do need to wait a few weeks before you’re able to see any results. So far, my results are great! I haven’t had any adverse reactions to this product and it seems to be working great on my super sensitive skin. I will continue using this product for more long term results. All in one
