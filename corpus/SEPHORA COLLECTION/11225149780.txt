It’s an okay eye cream. It absorbs into the skin nicely and doesn’t leave a thick residue on the skin like a lot of plumping/firming eye creams do but I’m very sensitive to the way my products smell and this has a very weird metallic scent to it. I haven’t really noticed any significant difference in my eye area after using it, either. I got it as a free sample but probably won’t buy the full size product. Honestly starting to think eye creams don’t do anything at all. I’ve never found one that made any difference whatsoever. Weird smell, mediocre results
