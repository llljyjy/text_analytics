I LOVE the lychee serum. I have been using it consistently for a week, and I’ve noticed that my fine lines are more subtle.I also like the mushroom serum. It makes my skin look SUPER glowy and fresh. If you have oily skin, I’d avoid using it.The only downside of this product is the pump. It is AWFUL. I hope you guys fix the pump because this is a fantastic product! The Lychee Serum Rocks!!
