I actually got the passion fruit vitamin C bottle. It works wonders! I’ve only been using it for about a week and it got rid of my under eye bags and makes my skin glow. I use cerave face wash, then apply this to my face using a cotton pad, then add some of the ordinary serum and lastly use the cerave moisturizer. My skin is the best it’s ever been and I feel great! Buy this right now trust me!!!!
