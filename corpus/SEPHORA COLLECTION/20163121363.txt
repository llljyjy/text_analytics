It’s not like the regular firming cream. Not as moisturizing. It feels like it just sits on my skin instead of absorbing in like the other one did. It just takes a lot to feel as moisturizing. They made a new version of their regular moisturizing cream and got rid of the old one so i hope they don’t get rid of this old version too bc it’s just not the same. Not sure what the peptides are doing in this new formulation but it’s not feeling great. please keep the old version
