The photos were taken before and after 8 days of wearing this serum, morning and night. I have acne-prone oily skin and I was nervous to try this as this contains Kombucha. But my skin wasn’t irritated at all. In fact, lots of post-acne dark spots I had are now gone!!! I will continue to wear this daily and I’m so excited to see my clear skin after finishing this bottle. I’m very glad I achieved this result with affordable skincare product. I’m also happy to see Sephora Collection launching skincare products with cleaner and vegan ingredients. Dark Spots are Gone in 9 Days
