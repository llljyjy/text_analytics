A patch of dark spots came out on my forehead last year from being in direct sun, and I would say they’ve faded at least 50-75%, not very visible anymore. Now, if it was just from fading w time or the product, I don’t know. But this is at a great price, doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin, am on my 2nd bottle. It has a great lights scent, so be aware it is not fragrance free It works, great value, didn't irritate
