I don’t think it’s a necessity, but it is a nice topper. It hydrates well, and it makes my skin feel super soft. I will say that my under eye is less puffy. I do believe by doing this often you’ll see a change rather than a one and done situation. I add these mask for fun in my routine, and to relay, but they do a good job at hydrating. nan
