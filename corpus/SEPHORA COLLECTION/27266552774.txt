This is the first lip mask I’ve bought, so I’m not exactly sure what it’s supposed to do but I’ve just been using it as a gloss. It dries fairly quickly and I find myself reapplying a good few times when I wear it for the day, but it looks very pretty on its own or over a lip tint oil. It has a very pleasant scent. nan
