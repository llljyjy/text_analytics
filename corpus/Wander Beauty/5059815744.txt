This goes on VERY glowy but eventually dries down to slightly less glowly, plus can be tamed with a powder. It may be too much for summer but is great for fall and winter. It leaves the least white cast of any mineral sunscreen I’ve tried, so that is great.  I also love that the “tint“ isn’t really a tint at all....it’s more just a non-shimmery blurring. Would take this over Glowscreen any day. I wear this over my moisturizer and under concealer and blush and haven’t experienced any pilling. I do get a slight burning sensation when I apply but not sure if that is just me. It goes away after a few minutes. I do worry about the percentages of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide - they seem very low. I haven’t used this yet when I’ve been outside a lot, so we’ll see. I wish you got slightly more for the price, especially since the low percentages of SPF make me use more than I normally would.Overall, I am enjoying this product and would encourage people to try it. A great option
