Loved this when I first got it. I got it at Marshallâ€™s for $49.00, and even at that price it is a splurge. I have taken all the precautions with it, and I am still seeing color fade from it a little after each wash. I love the hair and skin benefits, but for the price, it should definitely hold up longer.  (And the one I bought has a zipper) Disappointed as it was a splurge item
