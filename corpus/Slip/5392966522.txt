Pure Luxury! Wow this pillow case is so with the price. And yes I do know it’s definitely pricey. It’s the best silk pillow case I’ve ever had the pleasure of putting my face on. Silky, slippery, and soft. It stays cool even on hot days. I have had mine over a year. It has never stretched out, nor has it ever ripped or faded. To wash it I turn it inside out, zip it up and wash it on delicate in warm water in a small load. I dry it on warm and delicate. That’s warm, not hot! Common sense prevails. If it’s expensive and delicate, then care for it as such and it will last! It really is worth it. Pure Luxury!
