So I bought two of these. One for myself in pink and one in black for my partner. So far I have only washed it once (in a slip wash bag…air dry) I’m curious to see how it hold up…as it seems like slip has a problem with tearing/ripping/zippers etc. So far…I have noticed that my skin isn’t as dry in the morning…and I think it’s because the pillowcase is allowing my skincare to sit. My hair also seems to be less frizzy…which is great! I love the colour, I love the feeling on my skin. So far so good. Will update. So far so good
