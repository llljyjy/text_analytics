I read the reviews and purchased this in a dark color. I’m happy with how it blocks light and feels soft and cool on my skin. Yes, during the daytime a tiny bit of light gets in at the bottom but I think that’s true of any fabric sleep mask. I’ve had this for 4 months now and don’t notice the elastic stretching out or stuffing moving around. I wash my mask weekly; I zip it into a fabric pouch before I put it in the washing machine and let it hang to dry. The stuffing stays put and the silk gets refreshed. This is comfortable and feels fancy, and after reading the reviews I’m pleased with the quality. nan
