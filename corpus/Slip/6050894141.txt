all these 1 star reviews for ripped pillows but ive had my enveloped slip pillow cases for 3 years and there isnt even a stitch out of place. i take them all over the country for work- that is to say im not exactly gentle on them either. i hand wash them every 2 weeks with a boujee dish soap by saje.  its just a thing you need to do to take care of silk correctly. my pillow and this case is my home away from home.  it stays cool, it keep my hair feeling nice. it keeps my skin smooth. it was a game changer for me and i havent slept a night without it since. handwashing is the best thing you can do for this case. do not wash in a machine.  if youre paying 200 for pillow cases, then take the time to care for them. HAND WASH ONLY PLEASE YOU GUYS ARE BREAKINGMYHEART
