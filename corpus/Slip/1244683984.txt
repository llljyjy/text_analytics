I have thin, fragile hair that breaks easily. I had always heard that sleeping on a silk pillowcase would minimize damage, but I was hesitant due to the price. My only regret is not buying this sooner! Wow. I cannot believe the difference this makes. I used to always wake up with frizzy hair and could never understand how some people can maintain a blowout for 3 days. Now I can. While I still have the usual “bedhead“, my hair is relatively smooth when I get up and I can extend my style for a day or two. Considering the amount of money I have spent over the years in search of products to help me get healthier hair, this was well worth it. IT REALLY WORKS!
