This is my favorite present I have ever bought myself. I have had zero issues with mine but I also hand wash it in woolite or use a delicate bag in the washer and hang dry m.. if you do not take care of them properly they will fall apart they are silk you can’t just wash them so not sure if that is the issue with some of the others? I am about to replace mine just because I like to replace every year to two years. I have bought one for my mother and she bought 5 more. My hair stays fixed and since I have super long hair all the way to my butt it does not pull it out!! So it’s great!! Highly recommend just make sure you take care of it properly and it will be your most favorite purchase My best friend
