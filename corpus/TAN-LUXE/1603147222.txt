MY FAVE for tanning my face. I buy this body one instead of the face one because you get more and it doesn’t break me out or anything so why not! I tried it on my legs once and it was patchy so I think it’s best for small sections, in my opinion. Or I’m not good at applying. I self tan my body and use this on my fave under my makeup. I put it on in the morning before work, by the time lunch hits I’m tanned! I’ve used it as a spot treatment too for spots I missed on my body with my St. Tropez, and that works too. I’ve gone through 2 bottles! Love it. nan
