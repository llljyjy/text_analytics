Really nice, glowing color. I was a bit worried about how small the bottle is when I first got this, but the product is very easy to spread. It doesn’t take much to build a nice color. Just be mindful of how you’re applying. I was a little sloppy with my application so it did end up streaking a bit, but I think this could be avoided with some more attention and precision. All in all, I do think it’s a step above Jergens which is what I used before. Not perfect, but close
