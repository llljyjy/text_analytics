so have found this product great for up keeping a good tan. Doesn’t have that “fake tan” smell. I couldn’t give this 5 stars because I have sensitive skin and it did make me a little itchy. ( I get itchy with almost all self tanners) The color was great though. If it wasn’t for my sensitive skin I would wear this all the time! nan
