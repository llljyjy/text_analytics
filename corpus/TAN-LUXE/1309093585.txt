I have used the drops and love them so though i’d give this  a try. Huge fail, it’s thick and spreads horribly. It left a weird line around my hairline that was not cute. I’m not a rookie when it comes to applying self tanner on my face nor body. I just did not like this at all. Also, the whole idea it to look tan, I did not see results from this product. Go with the drops, they are very good. nan
