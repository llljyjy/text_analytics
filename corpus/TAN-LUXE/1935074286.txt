I bought this last summer, used it once, didn’t love it and moved on to try other self tanners. I revisited it again this week because I didn’t want to use a mousse (so tired of the mits) and now I’m obsessed. I am already planning on buying a second bottle so i don’t run out. I personally think this smells fine, but I am not sensitive to scents/self tan smell. I learned the hard way you definitely want to make sure not to get distracted mid application and leave the lotion on your hands for an hour before finishing and washing them— it made my hands look wild. That being said, after two days they were back to normal, and if I had exfoliated them more than once I think it would’ve only taken a day. The tan lasts quite well on the skin and looks natural and glowy. The lotion itself makes my skin soft and hydrated when I’ve first applied, but my skin is not dry generally. I think I would prefer it if the texture was slightly more substantial, but the lotion/oil hybrid texture works so well I don’t think I’ll branch out to try the thicker consistency offerings available. Gave it a second chance, love it now.
