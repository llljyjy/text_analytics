This works beautifully. I’m naturally fair skinned and this looks like a natural tan that can be increased in depth depending on how often you use it. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because of the smell. It’s not bad at first, but as it marinates on the skin it smells like yuck fake tan. So I put it on before bed and shower the smell off in the morning. If they would get rid of the smell it would be absolutely perfect. It works! But smells while processing.
