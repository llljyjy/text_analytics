Best self tanner I’ve ever used. So easy to put on and impossible to screw up. I’ve been using this for years and have tried every other tanner. I also like the gradual from Tan Luxe but the butter is my fave. You can find giant bottles on sale at HSN that make the price more bearable. I use it year round Amazing. Don’t listen to the haters
