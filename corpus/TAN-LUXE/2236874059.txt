So, I’m skincare obsessed and don’t like to wear a lot of makeup. Having a gradual self-tanner that doubles as my daily moisturizer and keeps my skin naturally glowing is amazing! It’s easy to use, doesn’t smell and leaves my skin sun-kissed and radiant. Plus the skincare ingredients rival those of moisturizers double the price! The dream moisturizer!
