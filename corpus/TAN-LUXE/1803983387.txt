Another win from Tan Luxe. This is great for fair skinned people or those new to self tanning. It is much more forgiving (zero streaks when applied with a mitt) than The Butter, and develops more slowly than The Gradual or The Water. It dries SO quickly and doesnâ€™t stain my clothes so I can apply and go about my day with no worries. I am pretty pale and one application gives me a slight glow and two is when I really start to see some color. It is not at all orange-y and looks very natural. I have sensitive skin and this does not cause any irritation. Even though the consistency is so light, it leaves me feeling moisturized. As a bonus I LOVE the glass packaging - it feels so luxe and looks great on my vanity. The pump dispenser is much cleaner/neater than the tops of The Butter or The Gradual. I am so happy to add this to my rotation of TL products! Buy This!
