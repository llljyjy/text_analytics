This is my go-to for fake tan drops. Its so easy to mix in with lotion. For those with blotchiness, you need to work on your technique and not blame the product. Hint: first put on body lotion in the areas that are typically culprits for blotchy areas that you donâ€™t want to look tan ( forearms, ankles, behind the knees, etc) and then use with the lotion with tan-luxe. So easy to use
