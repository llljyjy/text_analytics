I actually got a sample size (smaller than mini) of the light/medium face drops and LOVE IT. I am absolutely going to purchase. This actually tans me! I love that I can just mix it in with the products I already use on my face. I am Greek/Italian, but get quite pale in the winter months in Chicago. I thought I would need medium/dark due to how tan I do get in the summertime, but light/medium has worked just fine for me! BE SURE TO WASH YOUR HANDS after use (learned that the hard way) but I seriously will never go back to any mousse or another brand.product. Tan Luxe has my heart. Hoping for the same results from the body drops! AMAZING
