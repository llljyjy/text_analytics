Truly life changing. I use about two drops mixed with a thick moisturizer, and I cautiously apply all over my face and neck- be sure to rub into hairline! This stuff is great, there is a mild smell depending on how many drops you use, as well as how thick the moisturizer your using is. The smell goes away after a day. I don’t have very problematic skin, so I can’t attest that this works with all skin types, but it has never broken me out, or changed the texture of my skin. I’ve even used the face drops mixed with body lotion, and rubbed that into my body and it works just as well. I highly recommend. This doesn’t change the color of your eyebrow hair either lol I have dark hair though, so Idk about lighter hair. Loves it Holy Grail Product!
