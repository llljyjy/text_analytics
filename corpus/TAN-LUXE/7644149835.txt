After St. Tropez discontinued their line of anti-aging moisturizer / self-tanner I was never able to find anything that stood up.  I like this product because I can still use my moisturizer and I don’t have to replace it or add an extra layer.  Some people said they got a few pimples after applying, and I did as well, but I used the Fresh Amazonian Clay exfoliator and it got rid of those in a day.  If you use a drying exfoliator I think it will balance this product.  What is less than ideal it the packaging!  Since it’s a giant glass vial I keep it in the cardboard it came in because one misstep and thats splat onto the floor. Works well- a bit pricey
