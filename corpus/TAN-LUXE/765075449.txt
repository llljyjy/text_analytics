Wish I discovered this sooner! Works much better than the Tan Luxe water or other water sprays - meaning I can see noticeable color using the dark shade the morning after I apply, not days later. Application is easy - I mix 2 drops with my face serum nightly (I use SK retinol so have to use the drops nightly due to expedited exfoliation) and get a pretty glow in the AM. This serum absorbs easily, and thereâ€™s no smell like the Isle of Paradise drops! Keeper
