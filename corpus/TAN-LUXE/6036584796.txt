Did not like this. I definitely broke out and it was very difficult to get it even looking. I’ve used st tropez tanning water for a while and I misjudged that it would be a similar application process. I thought I had taken care to really rub it in and get it evenly distributed but the next day I had like 7 discoloration spots where I hadn’t done a good enough job. It was so embarrassing I was really hesitant to try it again. This time I used one drop and really rubbed it in. In this case, I broke out pretty bad and while I didn’t get any discoloration (I used hardly any to get any real color payoff) I did get a shadow in my hairline that wouldn’t go away until I used  glycolic acid on it. Which I don’t think was good for my baby hairs. I’m a pretty experienced self tanner and tan my face twice a week. I thought this was a great solution to saving time but I’ll stick with the tanning mist by st tropez nan
