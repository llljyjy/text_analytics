Due to the mixed reviews regarding this (and the knowledge that clear self-tanners can be a mess) I held off on buying this for a long time. However, this past weekend, I was stuck on a trip without any self-tanner and picked this up on a whim at Sephora. I’m middle eastern with light-medium skin olive skin, so I picked up the medium/dark shade. Based on the reviews, I wasn’t expecting much, but wanted a little bit of color. I am SO happy I bought this. Save for one careless spot on my foot where I missed, this applied BEAUTIFULLY all over my skin. Its a gorgeous golden brown shade, not orange at all. This isn’t the darkest self tanner I’ve ever used, but the color it gave my skin is exactly how I look when I tan in the summer, a deep tan golden shade. Due to the fact that there is no color guard, this doesnt get stuck in pores on your skin, so it looks completely natural. I’ve been unimpressed with the last 3 or 4 tanners I’ve used, but this is my new go-to. Yes its pricey and clear but a little bit goes a long way (1-2 pumps per arm leg etc), and if you apply carefully in the mirror you’ll be left with a very pretty tan. If you’ve had your doubts, give this a try! I am very very happy I did. Bought on a whim- Happy I did!
