Love the color it gives. People don’t even ask if I’m using self tanner they always assume I was in the sun! Smell is bearable (self tanner smell is really bothersome to me) It is a little drying to the skin so I definitely use a light moisturizer on top to maintain and on my dry spots before applying. Difference between Iles of paradise & tan lux is Tan lux- color is better + fades better - dries out skinILES- fades pretty ugly/splotchy smells not great nan
