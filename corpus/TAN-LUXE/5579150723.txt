I mix a few drops of this self-tanner with Cerave body lotion and it does distribute well (I have not used on it’s own). There are a few spots the following day that are probably obvious self-tanning application mishaps, but likely that’s a “me“ issue. There is absolutely a smell, and to me (as a 31y/o millennial who has been enticed by self-tanners for many moons) it is directly associated to self-tanner. When I am using, I get a little self conscious of hugging my loved ones because I feel the smell is so obvious that they will know that my natural-looking tan is very unnatural (noting here that yes I think it looks quite natural!). I hate painting my nails, and this absolutely stains my nails no matter how much a scrub my hands after application. Short nails or painted nails it is when this product is in rotation. Bonus: it has never rubbed off on clothes/sheets! Tl;dr: expect a self-tanner scent, use with a lotion such as Cerave, does not transfer to clothing, expect one shade darker and nothing dramatic (I’ve never had a friend say “omg you look so tan!“ which to me is the ultimate test in the dead of winter in New England). Good but only if you accept the downfalls
