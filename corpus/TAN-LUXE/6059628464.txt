I had a sample of this and it dried my skin out pretty badly and broke me out a little bit. I’d give it 2.5 stars because it gave a nice, natural color though. I have dry skin anyways, so it may work out for someone with normal or oily skin. I will say that you don’t need much to cover your face, neck, and chest, especially if you use a face mist right before because it helps it spread more easily. I’m really sad it didn’t work for my skin because it has some great ingredients. Not for dry skin
