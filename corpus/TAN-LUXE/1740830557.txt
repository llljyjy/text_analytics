Got this in a sample- instantly fell in love & purchased the whole bottle. This stuff makes my face look incredible. It gives me a glow, a slight tint of color, and smoothes me out. Not too drastic that it doesn’t match skin on rest of my body. Since using this daily I no longer need to put on makeup (i use light coverage or tinted moisturizer) only concealer & some primer. Best part- I’ve been using it 2 weeks and it looks like no product is out of the bottle. This will last months & worth every penny. Huge game changer & time saver for this busy mom of 2 little ones. GAME CHANGER
