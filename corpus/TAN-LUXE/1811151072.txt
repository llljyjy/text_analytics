11/10 recommend. I have really sensitive skin so most products make me breakout, but these tanning drops are phenomenal. I like to mix with moisturizers from the Ordinary before bed. Iâ€™ve tried the Isle of Paradise and St. Tropez ones but would recommend Tan Luxe. These really make your face a glowing, natural tan (depending on the amount you use) with no stickiness or smell.  Wash your hands thoroughly after! Highly recommend even if you have sensitive skin!
