I have incredibly fair skin. This gave me some color but i only noticed because i was wearing a tank top and tanned around it. This did not make my skin soft or glowy. This was a waste of 60$ for anyone looking to be tan. If you are fair skinned and want a small incredibly tiny touch of color to not look like a ghost but youâ€™re not interested in looking tan.. then try this. It was not sticky at all and i was able to apply without a mitt and got dressed right after it dried without being uncomfortable. I will most definitely be returning this hard pass
