I received this supplement free from Hum Nutrition for my review, but I’ve actually been using it for a couple months now. I’m 44 and starting to experience symptoms of peri menopause and I think these are helping. It’s hard to tell because my symptoms aren’t super extreme, but I do feel like my night sweats have been lessened and my cycle-related insomnia has been a lot better. So these have basically become part of my daily routine! If you are struggling with menopause symptoms, they are definitely worth a try! I think they help!
