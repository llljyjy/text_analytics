I always have a doubt about vitamins before I take them but I can honestly say I see a difference after taking these. I don’t take 3 a day I just do one in the morning and one at night. I’m younger and have pretty decent skin so I didn’t think I needed to overdo it. But after just a few weeks I’ve seen such a huge difference in the brightness and just the overall look of my skin. My redness and pigmentation has started to get better slowly too! Definitely think it’s worth a try. Definitely worth a try!
