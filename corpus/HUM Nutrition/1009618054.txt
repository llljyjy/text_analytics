I’ve been taking this supplements since it arrived and here are my thoughts. I’m 46 and having perimenopause symptoms. It sucks! I can’t say anything else about the symptoms. I have a very sensitive stomach & these didn’t cause any issues. I love that these are vegan, estrogen & gluten free. I also like that the pills themselves aren’t huge. I think I need to take these longer to see more benefits but I have noticed less sweaty nights. I’ll definitely continue to use them but so far I like them & have seen some  positive results.
