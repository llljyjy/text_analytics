Wouldn’t recommend these. Yes, they smell awful and they don’t taste great but that’s not even the biggest issue with them. They don’t do anything. They aren’t relaxing, don’t lower stress or create any sense of peacefulness. Save the $30 and instead spend it on something that can actually help you relax. Only giving 2 stars because *maybe* with continued use they may do something over time. Either way I don’t think it’s worth it. nan
