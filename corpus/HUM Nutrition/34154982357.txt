I have been taking the Womb Service for a week now and I am happy so far.  It can be hard to find a prenatal + DHA that is vegan.  Knowing that all the ingredients are clean is a plus and having so many of the essential nutrients is crucial for any woman whether you are pregnant, trying to conceive, and a woman in general. There is no fishy aftertaste with the DHA which is a plus! As my husband and I are looking at trying to get pregnant soon these vitamins are a great way to help set my body up for success and improve my overall health to get ready for conceiving. Great for any woman - pregnant or not!
