Not 100% sure if they actually do anything but it seems on days I take one before bed I do actually fall asleep and sleep better than I typically do. I have a really hard time calming down enough to fall asleep so I’m going to keep using them! Plus I do really like the taste it’s kinda like a cherry medicine but in a good way, not like harsh cough syrup lol I kinda like these
