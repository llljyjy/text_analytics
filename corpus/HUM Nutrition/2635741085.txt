I was so excited when I saw HUM Nutrition was coming out with prenatal vitamins. I’ve used their products for several years and have been loyal to the brand. This was the one thing missing from their line.I’m happy that there’s no weird smell or aftertaste like other brands seem to have. I don’t mind that it’s two separate capsules. I like that this was formulated with OBGYNs so I know I’m getting proper postnatal care. Some of the values on certain ingredients are lower than other prenatals I’ve used, but some have higher percentages. It’s all in what you’re looking for, but this perfectly suits my needs. The dosage of each included vitamin is just right for me! Finally! This is what HUM was missing!
