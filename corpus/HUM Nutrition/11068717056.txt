I like how easy it is to take and a lot less messy than powders that you have to mix into your drink, plus it doesn’t have a weird smell like some collagen powders do. I feel like my skin has looked more nourished since I started taking it but the difference is subtle and I probably won’t be buying this again since it’s not a very noticeable difference to me. It's alright
