My gut is not the most stable part of my life, I have IBD and pretty much everything irritates me. I decided to try this supplement to help clear my skin and hope that it would not wreak havoc in my stomach. I am so happy to say my stomach was not bothered by this supplement AND my skin texture looks to be smoother than it has in months. Overall I am very happy and am going to repurchase! It works!
