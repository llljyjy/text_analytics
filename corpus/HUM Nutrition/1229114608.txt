Winter time usually wreaks havoc on my skin.While my throat feels parched because I’ve got the heater running, my skin’s been feeling great because of HUM Collagen Love capsules.I’ve been a firm believer in the power of collagen supplements for hair, skin and joint health, even more so now that I am over 40.With a regular Gua Sha routine nailed down, I’ve seen the added benefit of HUM Collagen Love in the past month. While I have been ill the past few weeks, my face has managed to look “glowy” and healthy. My lack of appetite means I have not eaten my usual well balanced meals but you cannot see this on my face! I have also noticed my nails have now FINALLY gotten stronger since getting super brittle from a poor salon manicure session. There are many collagen supplements out there but the key differences for me with HUM Collagen Love are:Easy to swallowNo foul odorGentle on stomach, even on empty stomachNo mess to deal with like in powder formThe combo of Collagen, Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C works!I’ll definitely continue to purchase and incorporate HUM Collagen Love in to my supplement routine!
