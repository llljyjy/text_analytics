I’ve always wanted to try HUM vitamins and I was super excited to try this one out. I had to take antibiotics recently which kills all the good bacteria as well / makes you more susceptible to yeast infections. I made sure I was taking these at the same time and I didn’t have any issues. I love how this is a mixture of probiotics & cranberry as well. nan
