Full of antioxidants, vitamin C, hyaluronic acid and a peptide collagen compound including collagen types I and II,   this will collagen, this is a great supplement to have on hand.  I can’t always afford to eat oxtails (the price on those!!), so getting my collagen in a easy-to-swallow capsule form, with no funky aftertaste is a must have for me.  Collagen is not only fantastic for keeping  the skin firm, but for hair & nails too.  I haven’t seen skin results yet, but my hair & nails are stronger after using these for a month. You need this!
