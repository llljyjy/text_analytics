As a woman over 40 I know how essential hormone support can be so I was thrilled to try the new  Fan Club™ - multi-symptom menopause support from HUM Nutrition! As someone that does not tolerate estrogen, I appreciate about this formula is that it is an estrogen-free, non-hormonal formula. I began to notice results after about a month of consistent use. I noticed that I was much less restless at night and my temperature, which typically is like a space heater, was much better regulated. More importantly, I felt that PMS symptoms like irritability, mood swings and even cramping were noticeably reduced when taking this. There also seems to be a reduction in daily fatigue and brain fog. The addition of probiotics are fantastic as there is a clear connection between gut health and mood, so that is greatly appreciated. While I am not yet experiencing menopause or even perimenopause, I find this to be very beneficial and would highly recommend it! Don’t hesitate!
