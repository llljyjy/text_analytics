I have been looking for a prenatal vitamin to start my pregnancy journey. I found HUM’s 2 step prenatal and love that it is obgyn formulated. It has 23 nutrients for all my and the baby’s need pre and post pregnancy. I like the DHA has no aftertaste. I don’t get a fishy smell or any burping. Also I look for clean ingredients. It’s great it is vegan, non-GMO and no dyes or sweeteners! Obgyn formulated
