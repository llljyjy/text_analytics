I had my gallbladder removed almost a decade ago, and my digestive system gives me problems frequently, so I’ve tried an absurd amount of supplements for bloat and digestive wellness. This is the best I’ve found for the price, by far. The capsules aren’t too big, you only have to take one at a time, and it really works! There’s no noticeable taste or smell with them, and it’s helped with both my indigestion and feelings of bloat. These will be staying in my routine, I haven’t felt this good in ages! nan
