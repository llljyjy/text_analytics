I have wanted to try HUM vitamins for some time now and this was finally my opportunity! The packaging was absolutely adorable and love that it’s recyclable. When you pick the bottles, you think they’re empty because they’re sooo lightweight, but there are actually a month or so supply in them. Can’t wait to continue trying them! HUMMM
