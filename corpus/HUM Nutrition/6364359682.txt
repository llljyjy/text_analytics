I have used many Hum Supplements, they are a brand I trust to do what they say. As a lady in my mid 40â€™s I have just started feeling the effects of menopause, hot flashes included. While I have only been taking these around 2 weeks I already feel more energized and less bloated. These supplements are easy to take and do not upset my stomach at all. A must have for ladies in their 40s-50s
