I have been taking these for a month now . I found them easy to swallow. I definitely seem positive improvements. I am planning to take these as part of my supplements. It is great for my gut and I have not experienced any discomfort or irritation. My stomach is sensitive and I always pay attention on the side effects. These are very gently . My ph has been more balanced than before These are good
