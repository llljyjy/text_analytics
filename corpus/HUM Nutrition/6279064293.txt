I love that these vitamins are capsules and that they donâ€™t hurt my stomach after ingesting. Some vitamins hurt my stomach when in capsule form. I also love that these supplements also contain vitamin C. This is a vitamin I am deficient in so I get double the benefit of fixing my deficiency and improving skin! Definitely worth the price. Seeing less texture and more firmness / plumpness in skin. Great capsule !
