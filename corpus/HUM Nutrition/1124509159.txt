Well, unfortunately menopause, and all the symptoms that come with it, is just something that all of us ladies have to deal with. Due to chemotherapy, I’m dealing with it earlier than most. Thankfully, I came across this supplement from HUM Nutrition. I’ve used their products before and have always been happy with the results. Likewise, Fan Club has yelled great results so far. I’ve been sleeping better, feeling less irritated, and just generally more like myself. Due to my health problems, I can’t take anything with hormones, so this product is perfect for me. I also appreciate that it is vegan, gluten free, non-GMO, and sustainably sourced, with no artificial colors or preservatives. I don’t want to put any more junk in by body than I need to. You only have to take one capsule a day, so it easily fits into my daily routine. I would definitely recommend the product to anyone who is dealing with menopause symptoms! Great results!
