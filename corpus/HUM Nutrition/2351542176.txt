I’m taking these vitamins because I am currently breastfeeding. I like that the postnatal and the DHA come packaged together - just easier than buying them separately. Womb Service is also better priced than my previous two supplements and it’s nice to only take one capsule from each bottle. My other ones were two capsules per bottle for a grand total of 4 - which can be terrible if you’re using them as a prenatal and you have morning sickness. The most important part for me is that it has folate and not folic acid. I have the MTHFR mutation (which over 80% of people have) that inhibits my ability to process folic acid into an absorbable form. Easy Postnatal - love the combo
