ill be completely honest, I cannot tell whether or not this product helped at all with my face. I tend to have random flares of breakouts depending on my hormones/eating/drinking habits but I have been taking these supplements for almost a month now and I dont see much of a change, still have plenty of breakouts but I know probiotics are good for me and Iâ€™m pretty sure konjac root helped with cravings throughout the day so it is not a total waste this is not a miracle product to get rid of acne!
