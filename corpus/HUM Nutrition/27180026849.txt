Hum vitamins are great. I take prenatals to help with hair and nail growth and these do miracles for that. The pills aren’t too big to swallow and haven’t given me any nausea or heartburn, although it helps taking them with food.. These have all the best nutrients for those trying to conceive and who are pregnant. The price is not too bad either for these. As with anything you take though, consult your doc first but no complaints from me. Love the brand Hum. Great vitamin
