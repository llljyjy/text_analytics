I have wanted to try HUM Nutrition for awhile. I already takes beauty, skin, nail multi vitamins but have wanted to consistently take college for sometime. I can always tell how quickly a beauty vitamin works by nail growth. I do think the price point is pretty steep. I don’t think I would want to pay this every month. I do feel like it’s making an overall difference in my skin. nan
