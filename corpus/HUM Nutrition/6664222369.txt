I am absolutely loving this supplement.  I have been In perimenopause for approximately 2 years.  I am so happy to finally have a supplement that helps with all the side effects of perimenopause.  My mood swings have improved and I am sleeping better. I take the pill in the morning with my breakfast and never had an side effects from the pill.   I highly recommend this supplement if you are going through perimenopause. Great Supplement for Perimenopause Symptoms
