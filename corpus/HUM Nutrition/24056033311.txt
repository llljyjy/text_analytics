I’ve been trying these gummies for close to two weeks now, and so far I’m impressed! First off, they taste really good - almost like an Orange Creamsicle. They also have some great ingredients like hyaluronic acid, Vitamin C, and Vitamin E. Since I’ve only been taking them a couple weeks I haven’t noticed major differences yet, but I do feel like my skin has been feeling less dried out (a continuous problem for me during the winter). I can’t wait to see how they work in the long run! nan
