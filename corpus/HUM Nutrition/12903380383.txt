I’ve used this before this trial again, I am actively working out and drinking lots of water and taking other supplements, of course I will see a difference… you will see something if your other habits are borderline healthy. No complaints here, I will say it does have an odd after smell/taste sometimes but it isn’t too unbearable personally. nan
