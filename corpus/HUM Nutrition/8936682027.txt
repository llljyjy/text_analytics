I’m prone to getting UTI/yeast infections no matter how clean and healthy I am (darn diabetes) - so I was on the market trying to look for something that could better help with my vaginal health as a probiotic. And I found one that I feel has improved that! I would give this a try if you’re looking for something or something better; there’s no taste/aftertaste when taking the pill and it’s easy to take too. Try it!
