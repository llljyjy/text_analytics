These are a real game changer! They are very effective as they dramatically reduce those uncomfortable menopausal symptoms. My sleep has improved. I can rest lot better at night. I no longer turn around constantly in the bed totally tired, restless, and frustrated because I am unable to sleep after a busy day. Now I slowly drift into a pleasant and peaceful rest! The next morning I wake up feeling refreshed, renewed and motivated which I love!I have also noticed that I am lot less irritable and my mood swings are controlled. I can focus more and I am more alert too! My hot flashes have also diminished.I will definitely recommend them! Hum Nutrition products have always worked great for me, and “Fan Club Menopause Support Supplement“ is one of them! nan
