I’ve been taking this probiotic for the last few weeks and have been pleasantly surprised. I have acne prone skin but have been struggling mostly with hormonal acne around my jawline, and while I haven’t noticed a difference in my skin per-say, I’ve noticed a difference in how I feel overall. I have an extremely sensitive stomach that hurts pretty much everyday. I experience intense bloating and have been wanting to take a pre/pro-biotic for a while. Since using this, there have been days in a row where my stomach hasn’t hurt at all! Since I have hormonal acne, I didn’t expect to really see a difference in that, however, if you experience an upset stomach basically everyday and seem sensitive to things like gluten and dairy, I recommend trying this out! nan
