Def not a magic pill for flatter abs or weight loss but I do feel like it makes a little difference. I have been taking it with a meal at night for the last 6 days because that’s when I feel like I can’t sleep because of my digestive issues and I have to say I have noticed a difference on how I don’t have any discomfort or wake up bloated anymore. This isn’t to lose weight but more for metabolism reboot or for better digestion. Going to Keep using it. nan
