I have been trying to include more supplements and vitamins into my day as someone in their 40s who deals with acne and thinning hair anything is worth trying!  So being able to add this HUM supplement was super easy, itâ€™s convenient to bring along with me to work or while out running errands and it brings a nice change to my countless bottles of water I try and consume every day. Great to take on the go!
