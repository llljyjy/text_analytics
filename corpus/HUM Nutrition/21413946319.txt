This product restored my confidence & self esteem. I have hormonal acne & have tried COUNTLESS products in an effort to keep it at bay. I’ve been through physicians, dermatologists & internists that have given me several various methods. I’ve tried every possible OTC regimens too. Treating acne is difficult because it takes a significant amount of time to notice a difference. I’ve been using Daily cleanse for 3 months now & I haven’t had a single outbreak for about 9 of those 12 weeks. It turns out I was selenium deficient. This vitamin contains 200mg of selenium. If you suffer from hormonal acne I suggest you get a thyroid blood panel done. This vitamin has restored my confidence! Cured my adult hormonal acne
