This is a good vegan prenatal supplement. All 23 nutrients in this vitamin support maternal and baby health. Particularly, this supplement has all the folic acid you will need which is extra important in the first months of pregnancy. The DHA supplement has absolutely no fishy taste. The vitamin supplement has a very odd smell. I’m not sure if it’s the capsule or the ingredients. It’s only bothersome to me when I’m taking it. I don’t notice a burpy aftertaste. Overall, this is a stellar prenatal option, albeit a little pricey. Good, a weird smell with the vitamin portion
