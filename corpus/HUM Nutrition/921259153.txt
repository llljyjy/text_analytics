I have been wanting to find a supplement to help relieve my perimenopause symptoms. I love that this is vegan, estrogen-free, small-sized, has no weird smell, and is so easy to swallow without any side effects. I have a sensitive stomach so I was happy that I didnâ€™t have any issues at all. What I noticed from taking this for me is that it helped my mood swings, irritability, and sleeplessness. I will have to take it longer to see if it helps with other symptoms, but this is what I have noticed so far and am pleased with it. Nice supplement
