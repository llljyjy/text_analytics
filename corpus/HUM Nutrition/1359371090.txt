I initially bought this to help lessen the appearance and/or prevent further freckling on my middle-aged skin during outdoor exercise (I apply plenty of sunscreen every morning, too). I didn’t expect the plumpness and and glow after only a few weeks of taking two capsules every morning! I’d cook with more turmeric but my husband is not a fan of the spice. I’m happy, then, to get its anti-oxidant and other health benefits in this concentrated supplement. And my skin is living proof it is having a positive effect! So much more than cellular sun protection
