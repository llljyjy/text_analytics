I believe it’s been doing what it said it would. Enhanced nail growth. Smoother skin. I’ll keep you posted once I finish my bottle but so far, I love the results especially on my skin. I take 2 tablets in the morning on an empty stomach and 1 tablets before I go to bed. Consistency is key for results. But I think out of all the sups I’ve ever taken, this is by far the fastest acting hair skin nail I have EVER taken. Love it
