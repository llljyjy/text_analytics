I have definitely been impressed with Hum Nutritions Womb Service prenatal vitamins over the last couple of weeks Iâ€™ve been taking them. I can tell a huge difference in the condition of my skin and nails since using the vitamins, noticing that my skin is clearer and my nails are growing longer and stronger. The only thing I wish was different is the aftertaste / scent of the vitamins, but I will continue to use. Good Prenatal!
