I work out a lot and gym clothes are often not made of breathable fabric…inevitably leading to a bit of an upset down there, but since I’ve been taking these supplements, I can’t say I’ve been experiencing any issues with discharge or overall vaginal health. I’ll continue to use this going forward! nan
