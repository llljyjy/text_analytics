I like this product, I think it’s a good blend of hyaluronic acid, vitamin c, and vitamin E. I’ve never had a supplement with hyaluronic acid before so I think it’s cool they added that to this! I will say though that they’re hard to chew, they kind of stick to my teeth a lot. They taste good though! nan
