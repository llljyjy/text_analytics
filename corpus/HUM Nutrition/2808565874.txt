I love Hum supplements so I was excited to receive and try this Skin Squad one and see if it helps with my skin since my skin has been so bad lately. I have been taking these supplements for about a week now and honestly so far so good. My skin has been breaking out a lot and since using this I did notice my break outs are slowly disappearing and my skin looks smooth. Iâ€™m excited to see more results in the next few days. But so far I do really like it. Great!
