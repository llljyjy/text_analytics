Love that this is a vegan formula. I’m currently in my TTC journey & have started prenatals in preparation for our baby! I’ve only take one other so far but I’m glad this one doesn’t make me nauseous or have that gross fishy taste that lingers. The separate tablet for DHA is not a problem because the one I took before this was the same way. It’s a bonus & I appreciate having it available in a pack for me! Also, it hasn’t backed me up (which was an issue with the previous one I was taking) so that’s always a plus! 23 nutrients for baby & keeps this future mommy happy because it’s easy to take & pleasant!
