So the 2nd week I saw results on my clear clean face and used the bathroom regularly. But then the 3rd week life & work got the best of me & I started to stress out. Week 4 arrived , bottle is now empty and both of my cheeks and forehead are covered in acne!! (No I am not on my period or was going to get it) I thought this supplement would continually detox my skin and body but it just got worse , It’s No good! Thank God I can put a bit of concealer on my forehead and hide the bottom of my face with a mask! Doesn’t work on Acne prone skin!!!!!!!
