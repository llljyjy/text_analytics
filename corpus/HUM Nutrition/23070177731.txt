So I already love Hum supplements (a couple of favorites are Moody Bird and Flatter Me) so I was very excited to try Fan Club, which I have been taking doe the past 3 weeks. I have noticed a huge decrease in hot flashes and night sweats...a HUGE difference.  I also have noticed that I am sleeping much sounder (maybe because I donâ€™t feel like I have to use the bathroom as much as usual during the night). I'm already a fan!
