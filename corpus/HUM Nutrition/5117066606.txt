I’ve been taking these prenatal supplements for a month now and love the positive effects that I’ve been seeing in my energy, hair health and skin! I love that they contain only clean and vegan ingredients safe for me and baby. The DHA supplement has no fishy taste and does not make me feel sick like others have in the past. Would definitely recommend to all expecting moms! Clean Ingredients for Me & Baby!
