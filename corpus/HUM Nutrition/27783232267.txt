I’ve been trying a bunch of prenatal vitamins and I haven’t really found many that have worked well for me yet. I have been giving the HUM nutrition vitamins a try and so far I’ve noticed a difference. It may be too soon to tell but I have a good intuition about it. I love the organic and natural ingredients. Great so far!
