Gifted by Hum. I have not been using this long enough to say for certain if itâ€™s helping clear my skin. However this is a great probiotic. You can take it on an empty stomach and does not cause upset stomach. I am a huge fan and will continue to take these. I used these while taking antibiotics and they helped a lot! Awesome probiotic
