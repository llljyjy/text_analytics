I have been dealing with UTI, it would go away when I take antibiotic.  But then it comes back even though I tried to drink a lot of water, and I have vaginal discharge and strange yeast infection. I believe this product really helps me with my vaginal itch and notice i donâ€™t have that much vaginal discharge within this two weeks I have been taking. I will absolutely recommend and continue to buy it. Life Saver!!!
