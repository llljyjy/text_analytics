I was really surprised at how easy it was to incorporate these pills into my vitamin regime. Ever since I turned 40 I’ve been feeling tired, sleepless, and what feels like always irritated. These pills are a temporary fix to that. I feel like they have helped a bit with my mood swings and the discomfort of waking up feeling bothered.  I’m halfway through the bottle and I feel like this could be a long-term commitment. I recommend. Natural and easy to use
