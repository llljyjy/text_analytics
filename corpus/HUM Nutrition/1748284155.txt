I am 36 and still have hormonal acne that appears around my mouth/on my chin. In the last year it had gotten to the point where I always either had a new painful, visible spot pop up and/or a spot that I messed with was taking forever to heal. Once I started taking these, within a month I had not developed any new hormonal acne. Iâ€™ve been taking them for 4 months now, and my face has been COMPLETELY clear. They are pricey for me, but totally worth it. Hormonal Acne Completely Gone
