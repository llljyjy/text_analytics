I actually get a lot of bloating after I eat and after a year of trial an error, I couldn’t actually figure out the actual reason, so digestive enzymes help a lot. I’ve tried the HUM Flatter Me and I actually feel lighter, less bloated and have tons of energy. One thing that I would change, is to make the bottle smaller, use less plastic, since it seems so wasteful when only 1/3 of it is full. nan
