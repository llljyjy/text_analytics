I am always hesitant when it comes to supplements especially when they’re diet based or catered to your diet. However, I’ve been a big believer in HUM Nutrition. I’ve always had good results in different supplements I’ve tried from the brand. With this specific supplement I personally didn’t notice any flattening of the stomach, however it did help with digestion. I wouldn’t feel bloated after certain meals. So I really liked that aspect of these supplements. nan
