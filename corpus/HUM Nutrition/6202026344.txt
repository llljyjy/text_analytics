I have been loving these supplements. I feel like my acne has been less prevalent and my acne scars have started to fade a bit. I feel much more comfortable wearing minimal makeup/foundation now. My only issue is that the capsule smell and taste so terrible. I basically have to throw them to the back of my throat so I won’t taste them. Overall, I love the results, but not sure if I would repurchase as I’ve tried skin vitamins that do not have that taste. nan
