I have been taking probiotics for a while now, but I switched to these last week & they have been fine. I don’t necessarily notice a huge change in my skin (maybe because I only have taken them for about 2 weeks) but honestly my skin isn’t too bad to begin with.   My skin is glowy though! I love how probiotics make me feel though so these have done the same and helped me with my bloating and stomach issues. Recommend these for gut health!! Great for gut health & skin
