Let me start off by saying: I have a wrecked digestive system. It has caused me problems for years to the point of debilitation. I’ve tried everything from “eating clean and healthy” for 6 years to colon cleanse pills, to elimination diets, other probiotics, supplements, etc.What I first noticed is: I didn’t hate swallowing these pills. I appreciate that there’s no taste and they’re really small. Secondly: I liked that it’s recommended to refrigerate because that means the probiotic cultures are alive.If you can tell from my before and after photos, everything else speaks for itself. I don’t have as much discoloration nor blotchiness on my face and I just look healthier. Maybe even glowy. But it’s only been 17 days so let’s wait and see if it’s from this product or not. So good so far, but let’s wait and see
