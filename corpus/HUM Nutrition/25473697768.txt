It’s a Vitamin Gummy NOT CANDY PEOPLE!! Why do people expect to have a vitamin that’s exactly like candy? Yea the taste isn’t like a skittle but I think it’s really yummy. I cannot swallow pills and appreciate companies trying hard to get their vitamins & nutrients into a great tasting vitamin- I’m sure it ain’t easy!!  So for everyone on here blasting the taste- go  buy  pills to swallow? Hum does a great job! give them a try!!!
