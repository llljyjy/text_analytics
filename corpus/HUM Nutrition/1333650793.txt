I go through phases of poor sleep or insomnia so I was hopeful that this Mighty Night supplement would improve my sleep.  The fact that it also includes ingredients that benefit your skin was an added bonus.  I tended to take the supplements a few hours after dinner and I did find that I slept soundly without waking in the night or having difficulty falling asleep.  Also, I didn’t feel groggy or like I had to fight to wake up the next morning.  I can’t say with any certainty that it made a noticeable difference in my skin (I have a pretty extensive skin care arsenal and routine) but it didn’t hurt! This review is for Mighty Night supplements
