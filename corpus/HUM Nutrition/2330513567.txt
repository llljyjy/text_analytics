Ok, I’m in my 30’s. You might think this isn’t a supplement for me. After years of pain and never ending periods, I had a partial hysterectomy. I’ve started using supplements to help balance my hormones and hot flashes. I really think these are making a difference. I feel slightly less irritable and seem to have better temperature regulation. Maybe it’s all in my head, but for me, anything is worth a try. I think these work!
