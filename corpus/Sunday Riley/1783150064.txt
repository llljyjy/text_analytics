Very thick but smooth gliding cream. It smells sweet - vaguely like cherry vanilla (very gentle scent) which is so pleasant and relaxing. (I actually wish they made a body lotion or body oil with this soft scent.) I have extremely dry skin which develops patches of dryness, flakes, redness, and rosacea in winter, especially around cheeks. This has prevented that. Usually I need to use a humidifier at night to make my skin more moist in winter but this year I didn’t! So to me that’s clear effectiveness. I use a decent scoop of this (it comes with a beauty spatula to prevent touching it with fingers) but if you aren’t nearly as dry as me, you’ll definitely use less. Even with my massive scoops, I’ve had it for a month and it’s only 1/3 gone. Bonus: It does not cause pilling when I put my mineral SPF on. Great for Dry Winter Skin
