Because of my oily skin, large pores and a shiny face are constant problems. For me, this serum works incredibly well. I obtain even skin tone and skin that looks healthy. The packaging on this is the only thing that bothers me. It’s a dropper bottle, however, it lacks a tiny suction mechanism that would prevent spills as you apply the product. If you’re not cautious, it gets everywhere and is really messy. Great product but not great packaging
