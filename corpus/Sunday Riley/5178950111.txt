I love Sunday Riley-but not this product-yuck! I was looking for a PM moisturizer and thought I’d try this because I love Good Genes and Luna Sleeping Oil. I even love the Pink Drink. I don’t mind the smell but when I first applied Ice my face became cold but then it got hot, like clam-y hot so I thought ohh, it’s working...the next morning I had cystic acne on my chin & jawline so I waited until that cleared up and tried again, like a FOOL! Definitely returning this. This ICE ain’t so nice -for me :) Not Nice Ice
