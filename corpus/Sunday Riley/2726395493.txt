Needing to incorporate vit C in my skin care regimen. In past my sensitive skin did react to vitamin C. So I stayed away. Decided to try again and purchased the moisturizer. Afterglow is rich. Too rich for my liking. I certainly don’t slather it on. Doesn’t absorb quickly into my skin. No reactions, great. Yes, extremely moisturizing. My skin glows after I apply it. But haven’t seen any additional glow to my skin since using. Very low tolerance for the scent. I will have to stick to my water cream which is a much lighter consistency. And my skin feels much softer. I would certainly think those with dry skin would benefit from afterglow. Too rich for me. Cannot tolerate the smell. nan
