I have acne-prone skin and still love this serum. It feels so luxurious, after 5 or 6 weeks sun damage started to fade.  I have a few cheaper brands that are good but none fee as wonderful when applied. I use a prescription RetinA and Sunday Riley feels so good when put on the morning after.   It just takes a while if u you are using it to reduce sun spots.   LOVE IT. It is a  little too pricey though. FEELS LUXURIOUS AND WORKS
