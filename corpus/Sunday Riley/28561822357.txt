THE SMELL OF THIS PRODUCT IS FOUL. I’ve used way better vitamin c’s & this one just isn’t it. It just makes your face look oily. The smell was so strong, gross, fish like, that I had to take it off immediately. It made me so nauseous. Not worth the money. Glow Recipe has a better vitamins C. FOUL SMELL
