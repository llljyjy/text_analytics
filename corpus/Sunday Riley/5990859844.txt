sunshine in a bottle! I’m a big fan of the SR Vitamin C serum and was excited about this new product! It’s a great AM moisturizer to add to your routine for a touch of brightness! It’s light, doesn’t irritate the skin and layers perfectly with other products! gifted by Sunday Riley sunshine in a bottle!
