I’ve been against SR for so long because of the PR debacle they had and swore I’d never use them again. Fast forward a couple years and I have to give credit where credit is due. This stuff is straight up legit. I’d been using a rx strength tretinoin for years and thought I’d never stop. During the pandemic I ran out and thought what the heck let me switch to something otc and did some research. Wow, this high dose retinol not only works better and with less irritation but has some amazing antioxidants as well. I couldn’t be happier!  New HG! nan
