I’ve never used a product like this before but I’m obsessed! I’ve been using this for about 3 weeks now and it’s great for my oily/combination skin. The first thing I noticed right away is that it helps with my oily T zone. My face wasn’t nearly as shiny/oily in those areas as it normally is. Within 3 weeks it’s helped with my breakouts. I also deal with a lot of redness in my skin and it’s helped to even my skin tone, though it doesn’t eliminate the redness. I would highly recommend for anyone with oily/combination skin. So happy!
