I have been using this serum for about a week now and I feel that the redness in my skin has gone down a bit. I have very sensitive skin so I’m always hesitant to try new skincare products but this has been very gentle and hasn’t broken me out. It’s made my skin super soft and doesn’t make my skin oily either. I’m excited to continue using this serum to see how my skin improves Lovely serum!
