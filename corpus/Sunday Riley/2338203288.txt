Okay y’all! I was a little skeptical at first, there are a lot of Niacinamide based serums on the market. But this new one from Sunday Riley hits different. It’s actually quite nourishing and has an almost milky texture. If you have clogged pores, deal with congested skin and often have discoloration! This is something you’d want to try incorporating into your routines!!! Unique to the market
