I love this product so much. It is NOT a beginner retinol but it is gloriously effective. People complain about the smell, but I like my actives to smell like actives and this formulation is really strong so that comes with the territory and I donâ€™t mind. The only reason I am not repurchasing this repeatedly for the rest of my life is the oil in it. It does cause congestion and has a bit of any oily finish. If you have dryer skin and need the extra moisturizing oil this is your hero product. But like most Sunday Riley, this is not for oily, oily-ish, or acne prone skin. It clears up my hormonal breakouts, but overall is too much for my trouble areas. I am honestly heartbroken because I love this product so much. Amazing! but oily skin beware.
