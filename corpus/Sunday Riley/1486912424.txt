I love the original CEO moisturizer, so I was sure i will like this glowy version, but i didn’t know I will love it this much! The packaging is beautiful and sturdy, and I really like this type of the box as I can repurpose it instead of throwing it away (I’d rather have products come in sturdy packaging/boxes or no box at all). I love that it comes with a spatula. The cream itself is very nice and had medium weight. It absorbs into the skin well, leaves the skin soft, bright, hydrated and glowy (but not the type of looking oily). The effect on the skin is long lasting. The cream smells like neroli and the scent is pretty strong, but it disappears after a while. I prefer this over original one
