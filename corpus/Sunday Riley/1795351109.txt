This is a super nice moisturizer for the mornings! I love adding vitamin C into my routine and it’s been a nice addition. I have dry skin and it wouldn’t be thick enough to use at night but for the morning under spf it’s perfect. Definitely helps to smooth out and brighten the skin. Also gives an amazing glow! nan
