I developed hormonal acne when I was pregnant with my daughter, and it left behind awful red spots (post inflammatory erythema) on my face. As someone with previously clear skin, this was really frustrating to deal with. I started using Good Genes three times a week, after applying my Clarins serum & Biossance Squalane+ Vitamin C Rose Oil, and have seen a drastic improvement in my skin. The spots have almost completely disappeared, and my skin is clear and glowing. I cannot recommend this product more! Cured hormonal acne spots!
