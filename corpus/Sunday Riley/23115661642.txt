I have an oily and thick skin. My main area of concern are pore dilatation,  uneven skin tone and sporadic acne. SR lactic acid is effective and pleasant to use. I have tried the Ordinaryâ€™s version previously (which gives decent results) , but I am high on olfactive and sensory experiences. I appreciated the serum scent which is citrusy but not overwhelming, the lightness of the serum on the skin, and how quickly it is absorbed. You will notice rapid results. Since I started using SR serum, my skin appearance is dewy and my skin tone is more even, which allows me to use less makeup. I have had very few blemishes ( 2-3) in a 28 day cycle. I am impressed enough. Just ordered the salicylic serum will keep you posted. Sunday Riley Lactic Heaven
