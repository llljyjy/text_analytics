I got this moisturizer as a substitute for the purple tatcha as it was sold out and it has honestly only been okay, i’ve been using it for like three weeks and with acne scarring i haven’t seen any results. I also noticed that this product fully dried tends to pill? (I’ve fixed this by applying some snail mucilin lotion before this one) Overall it smells good and has a cool applicator but i probably would not repurchase. only okay
