I was really hoping I would like this eye cream. It’s made my dark circles worse, I’ve developed milia, and my undereyes are SO dry. Makeup now looks horrible under my eyes. I tried holding out to see if it was maybe just taking some time, but it’s been about 3 weeks to no avail and only getting worse. Do not buy this product. I don’t have sensitive skin, just normal/dry and this definitely does not work for me. I’ve never seen my under eyes look this bad! Do not buy! Awful looking undereyes
