Niacinamide is a skincare ingredient I look for in my products, so I was super excited when I heard Sunday Riley had released a dedicated serum! I’ve been using this every other night, but I know that many of my other skincare products already contain niacinamide. I would recommend this if you currently don’t have the ingredient anywhere else in your skincare routine. (Gifted by Sunday Riley) nan
