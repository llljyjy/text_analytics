The sales associate swore by this product. I told her my skin concerns were dryness and uneven skin tone. Not sure if she actually took it into consideration but she said this made such a difference in her routine… It honestly made no difference in mine. My mother also used it and saw no difference either. Don’t bother. it’s just expensive water.
