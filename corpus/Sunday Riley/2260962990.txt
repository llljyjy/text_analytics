Wanted to like this product but itâ€™s just not right for me. It made the skin below my eye super dry and peeling. My skin also became very sensitive even to a gentle touch by my hand. Maybe it is not meant to be used every day... and if you have sensitive skin it might be best to stay away from this product. Not for everyone
