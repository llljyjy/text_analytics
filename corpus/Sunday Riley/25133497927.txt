I recently tried C.E.O. Afterglow Brightening Vitamin C Moisturizer and was absolutely impressed. This moisturizer is packed with vitamin C, which helps to brighten, hydrate, and protect the skin. My skin felt softer, smoother, and more radiant after just one use. After using this moisturizer for a few days, I noticed a visible improvement in my skin tone and texture. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a brightening and nourishing moisturizer. nan
