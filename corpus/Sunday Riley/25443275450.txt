I am fan of niacinamide and I always want the serum which is not only gentle plus gives glow to my skin. So after using this serum in my morning Skincare routine i can say It helps to brightens my dull skin plus soothe my redness. Its so gentle doesnâ€™t irritate my skin. The water-based texture is so light which gets sinks into skin nicely and is not sticky at all. Ingredients are plus for me. nan
