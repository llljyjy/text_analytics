The cream is silky smooth, and lightweight. Only a small amount is needed to cover the whole face. It spreads nicely and sinks into the skin quickly. I have dry skin and the product is absorbed into my skin completely and does not leave behind any unwanted sticky or greasy residue.  A little bit goes a long way so this container of face cream should last for quite a while. Iâ€™m not noticing any difference now, but the cream gives my skin a hydrated feeling and smooths my skin. Will continue to use it for best results. nan
