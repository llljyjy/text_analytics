I’m a week into using this cleaner and I like it so far ! However , I feel like I’m not getting really clean because it’s not making bubbles. It’s a gentle cleanser and I love that my face feels moisturized after applying washing. I don’t get red like I do with most cleansers since I have sensitive skin and no irritation. I’m not sure if it’s worth the price just yet. Nice Gentle Cleanser
