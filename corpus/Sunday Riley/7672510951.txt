I was kind of scared at first of using retinol on my skin. I have a very sensitive skin and I suffer with hormonal acne. However, I find this gentle enough to not irritate my skin and with consistent routine, I noticed a slight improvement on the appearance of my dark spots and some redness around my face. Iâ€™m looking forward on seeing more visible results in the future. So nice indeed
