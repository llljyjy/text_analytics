This Brightening Vitamin C Cream I has a thicker bright yellow color and texture, it has some citrusy fragrance, that dissipates quickly, but it might bother you if you are extremely sensitive to scents.I have used it as day and night cream with a good performance, it leaves my skin feeling fresh and glowing, not shiny in appearance, It does not give me a sticky or wet feeling, which I prefer specially when I do my make up.My skin feels smooth, soft, and looks plump & flawless and what it is wonderful for me, no dryness at all, I love that it keeps my skin moist for a long time. nan
