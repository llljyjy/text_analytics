Another winner from Sunday Riley. My preferred C.E.O Afteglow paired with the Luna oil at night before going to bed waking up to Radiant and youthful looking skin. The formula is very moisturizing with soft satin like finish. I am a huge fan of Vitamin C skincare has I struggle with hyperpigmentation. This moisturizer helps to keep my bright and clear.
