Definitely saw an improvement in my skin texture after about a week and half of use. I have no breakouts either. I guess the Vit C gave my natural barrier some immunity. I suggest adding a Vit C to your skin care routine every single morning and this one from Sunday Riley is the best one to use. My skin looks better than ever!
