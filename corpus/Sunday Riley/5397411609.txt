LOVE. I went from oily skin to super dry, flaky, red rosacea pregnancy acne prone skin - nothing has worked. All my old products (also from Sephora) have irritated my sensitive skin.  I switched out my serums and moisturizers for this oil! My flakes are gone. Redness gone. Skin is glowing and finally HYDRATED. My acne is pretty much gone too. This is worth every penny. Holy grail. And the smell is great - itâ€™s on the natural earthy side but I love it personally :-) acne/ rosacea/ dry pregnancy skin approved !!!!
