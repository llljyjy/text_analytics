I got this in a set with the Auto Correct eye cream. This serum is very hydrating, if you’re oily you probably won’t even need a moisturizer in summer when using this. A huge plus is that this doesn’t smell like hot dog water, but has a nice faint orange scent to it, not overpowering at all. I did notice my skin was super glowy when I used this, and I mean SUPER glowy. Works great for my dry skin. creamy glowy goodness
