Sunday Riley C.E.O. Glow Vitamin C & Turmeric Face Oil is a must. I’m always a fan of a good vitamin C serum in my skin care regimen. And my love for turmeric has grown so much over the past two years. So the fact that these two ingredients are in this oil and supplies. I’ve always wanted to try evening primrose but never got to trying it. So it’s great that this ingredient is also in the soil. You definitely can smell the evening primrose as soon as you apply, like straight out of the bottle. The scent is very strong, but if you can get past that then you’re good . This oil works great with acne prone skin. And eyes sometimes suffer away hormonal acne,  evening primrose it’s a great acne Defense. I could tell a huge difference in my skins radiance and brightness after a week‘s use. I mixed it with my moisturizer. It wasn’t too hydrating, or more so it wasn’t overly hydrating mixing the two products. And I applied as well at night by itself. Overall it’s a great product. Great Product
