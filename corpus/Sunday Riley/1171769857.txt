The packaging is luxurious and even comes with a spatula for the moisturizer. The formula itself has a light scent and is bright orange. I was worried the fragrance would irritate my skin but it actually didn’t. It’s very creamy, soothing and the next morning my skin is super bright and truly has that Afterglow! Love that it’s an active moisturizer which makes it a one and done product. nan
