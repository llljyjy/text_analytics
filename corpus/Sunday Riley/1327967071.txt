I’ve used this mask a handful of times in the past year, but for some reason when I used it this week, my eyes got super swollen and I got a reaction on the spots where I placed the mask. I can see the outline of where it was. No idea why all of a sudden I got this reaction, maybe it’s me. If your skin is sensitive, stay away from this stuff. bad reaction
