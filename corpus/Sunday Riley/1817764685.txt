I have really enjoyed using this serum. Niacinamide is a wonderful ingredient and really helps my skin. I like that this serum is light and watery, so it plays well under my other products. The smell isn’t strong but I do wish it wasn’t scented as essential oils can sometimes be irritating. I received this complimentary from the brand but I would recommend this if your skin likes niacinamide. nan
