I’m not a huge fan of oils, so I prefer mixing couple drops into my moisturizers.  When adding it into my moisturizer I can really feel the difference in terms of hydration, it gives my face that extra boost. This oil is pretty light and doesn’t leave the face feeling sticky or heavy. I would say overall this gives the face a nice boost of radiance and hydration. There is a natural scent to this product, but it is not too overpowering. nan
