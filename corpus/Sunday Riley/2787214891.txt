I got a sample of this months ago and at first, I was very skeptical about the product. I thought it was over hyped and too pricey for what it was but when I finally tried it, I was in awe. I have combo skin with VERY large, clogged pores. This instantly plumped my skin and gave it a beautiful radiance. I use it at night so that when I wake up in the morning, my pores look clean and visibly smaller because they aren’t as clogged. I have to wash my face in the morning to get that layer of dead skin off because it DOES gently exfoliate my skin and leaves it soft and smooth. This is one of the few AHA treatments that I’ve tried that doesn’t irritate my skin and actually helps the health of my skin. I don’t really get dark spots anymore so I can’t really say if it helps with that. It does make my skin very smooth though. For reference, I’m 28 and get smile lines pretty easily and this helps soften those lines. Needless to say, I bought the pack that has the full size and travel size. It was such a deal. ride or die
