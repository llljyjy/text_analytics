I was a little skeptical that this oil would actually do anything for my skin, but after a week or so of using it I’m a believer. I have very sensitive skin (I can look in the mirror the wrong way and my skin freaks out) but this oil doesn’t irritate my skin and absorbs very easily.  I feel like it’s definitely evened out my skin tone and gotten rid of redness - I suspect it’ll take longer to see an effect (if any) on fine lines, but here’s hoping! I’d definitely buy it again. I find the smell really pleasant, but it is strong and it does linger a bit, so beware if you’re sensitive to fragrances. I use it twice a day - a few drops mixed with my moisturizer in the morning, and a few drops applied directly at night. I'm a fan
