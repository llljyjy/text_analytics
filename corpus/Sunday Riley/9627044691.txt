Ok so I struggled with acne scarring as well as small breakouts here and there when it’s that time of the month. First things first, this product smells….earthy but clean. Also it will bring minimal acne to the surface however it keeps my face in a much better state than it’s been. It’s an actual oil so it helps with my dry patches but it’s not soo oily that my face becomes greasy. buckle up for the show.
