I have mixed feelings about this moisturizer. Before trying I was reading some reviews and noticed quite a bit on the scent. Didn’t really think much of it till I smelled it myself and boy it wasn’t it. After using for a week, I did notice my skin had a bit of a brighter complexion but the hydrating aspect of this moisturizer was missing. Overall Emmy experience was ok! nan
