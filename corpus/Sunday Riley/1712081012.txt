I received this product from Sunday Riley in exchange for my honest review. The special ingredient in this product  is Vitamin C  (THD Ascorbate), an antioxidant that brightens skin and helps with anti-aging. The THD ascorbate form of Vitamin C has a longer shelf life, penetrates deeper and is less irritating to sensitive skin than other forms of vitamin C. My thoughts: The look and feel of this product is completely luxe. The product is encased in a box like a prized possession. When you lift the box cover, you reveal a beautiful heavyweight jar of the cream. At the bottom of the box, there is a special spot for the spatula. Not only does it come with that thoughtful spatula for scooping out the cream, but it’s also a very nice spatula. This one feels heavy, thick and sturdy!The texture is nice too. It feels soft, airy and smooth, almost like a whipped texture. It glides very easily on my face and absorbs quickly. This makes my face feel soft. I can also feel my face more moisturized and hydrated. The color surprised me. It is a dark neon yellow color. I think this stems from one of the ingredients, lutein, an antioxidant derived from marigolds that has a deep yellow color. Once applied to my face, the color disappears. There is a scent although It doesn’t smell like fragrance. To me, it smells a bit like sunscreen.Vitamin C products usually irritate me or break me out in some way but I didn’t have any irritations with this one. After using this for a week, I noticed my spots and redness fading slightly and my complexion looking a little brighter and more radiant. The change is subtle but I’ve only used for a week. I can’t wait to use this longer to see even more of an effect! Makes skin feel soft
