I genuinely love this product! I received it complimentary from Sunday Riley for reviewing purposes. I’m not the best before and after photo taker, but left is 3 weeks ago and right is present day. I’ve been using this product as part of my day and night routine for the past three weeks and I do think i’ve seen differences in my skins overall redness. I have also noticed that during the day, my skin is less oily than usual. I have super oily skin during the day, so it’s definitely something that was obvious to me. The only thing I didn’t like about the product was the dropper as it didn’t seem to hold onto the liquid completely or dispense a normal amount. Otherwise, I loved this product and will definitely keep it in my routine! nan
