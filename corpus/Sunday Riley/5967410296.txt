Okay! This moisturizer is great. If youâ€™ve ever been to Florida and stop at the orange centers and get oranges and the orange perfume, it smells JUST like this. IYKYK!!! The smell brings back great memories for me. It feels great on the skin and really hydrates. A little goes a long way! ya need it!!!!
