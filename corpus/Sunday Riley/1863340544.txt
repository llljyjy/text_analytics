I received this product complimentary from Sunday Riley. The packaging is beautiful. It comes with a very high quality spoon so you dont have to put your hand into the cream. The cream is a very yellow color which I was not expecting at all. It also has a very strong smell but, that did not bother me. A little product goes a long way. I totally noticed a glow immediately and my skin feels so smooth and hydrated. I couldnt believe how fast I had such a beautiful glow. If your looking to glow, this is it.
