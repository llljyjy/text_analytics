This is my new favorite day cream! I love that this is a lightweight moisturizer with vitamin c to simplify my routine. Being able to eliminate that serum step definitely helps me get ready faster. Thd ascorbate is a very stable form of vitamin c that will help against environmental damage and targets signs of aging like wrinkles and dark spots. This also has ha and allatoin for hydration. The yellow color is natural from lutein which is an antioxidant derived from marigolds. The only ingredient I am not loving is the essential oils. Most people will not experience any irritation, but some do so just keep that in mind. Overall I really love this cream! Lightweight!
