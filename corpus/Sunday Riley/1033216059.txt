This is the second bottle I have bought and the last time I buy this . The bottle is deceiving in that inside of it is a tiny plastic bag that contains a small amount of product. The bottle itself makes it seem as if the amount of product youâ€™re are getting is the amount of the bottle. Wrong. You are paying an exorbitant amount of money for a tiny bag inside that bottle. When you think you are done open  the bottle and you will see the bag. You then can cut the bag open to get the remainder of the product. $85 for this? Never again. Love the product but not goons get ripped by this company again. Tired of getting ripped off
