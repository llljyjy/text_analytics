I’ve been a long time user of Sunday Riley’s vitamins C products and this was just as good as the others. The moisturizer has a nice lightweight texture that absorbs easily and dries down with a non-greasy satin finish and makes a glowy base for makeup. There’s no pilling when layering my spf or makeup afterward. The vitamin c brightening effects will take a bit longer to notice but in the meantime, this will be a great moisturizer for the warmer months. nan
