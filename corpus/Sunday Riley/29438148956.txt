This set is a GREAT value! I use Sunday Riley skincare products religiously so when I had the opportunity to purchase this set at $104.00 during the 20% off sale, I jumped on it! This set gave me 3 more bottles of products I use on a daily basis along with a fourth I’d been wanting to try.. at a fraction of their retail price! If you’ve been wanting to try Sunday Riley or if you just need to restock your skincare, I highly recommend this kit! I’d rather pay $32.50 for each product through this kit at $130 than to pay $85 each—$65 for Autocorrect—if I were to order them individually! Aside from the fantastic savings, my sensitive skin handles each of these wonderfully! No breakouts, dryness, irritation, or clogged pores! Sunday Riley is easily a top favorite of mine! excellent kit!
