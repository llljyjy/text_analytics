I was gifted this product in exchange for my honest review. I have been using this serum once a day for the past 2 weeks. I took before and after photos. The first picture is my “before” and the second is my “after.” I don’t notice a huge difference in my acne scars or pore size, but I’m not sure 2 weeks is enough time to see a noticeable difference. I like the texture of this serum. It’s a pretty purple color, almost like poi. I don’t like the dropper. The serum is very liquidy and the dropper dumps way too much out with little control. Otherwise, the packaging is very nice and this could make a great Christmas gift for a skincare lover! nan
