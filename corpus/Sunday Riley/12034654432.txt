I’ve been using this for 3 years and it is worth every penny. I never had a beauty routine prior to using this. But after receiving a sample I immediately saw a difference in my skin. It was plumper and smoother and has faded my dark scars. If I didn’t constantly pick my face, I would have no scars at all haha. Yes it’s expensive but it has transformed my skin and I get so many compliments. My skin is smooth and always ready for makeup! before and after photos don’t lie. it works!
