I’ve been enjoying this niacinamide so far. I’ve noticed that it’s toned down my redness a bit already and my skin has been looking brighter (using about 2 weeks). I have dry, very sensitive, acne prone skin and I haven’t had any issues with this. I do notice my skin feels a bit dry the next morning after using this so occasionally I will skip a day so my skin doesn’t become to sensitive or parched. Sunday Riley never lets me down! nan
