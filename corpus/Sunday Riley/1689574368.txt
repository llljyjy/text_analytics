I have perfect skin and generally not sensitive to different creams so I like to splurge on different sample sets to try them out occasionally. I’ve used the eye cream and tumeric oil before from Sunday Riley and thought I tried more of their products.  Unfortunately I used this set once and it caused my face to have tiny bumps everywhere! It’s been one week and my face is still not like it was! nan
