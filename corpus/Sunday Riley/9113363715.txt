I always find myself coming back to this oil and it’s the only retinol/anti aging product I’ve used consistently. I started with sample sizes and then the combo with Good Genes, but I think it’s the night oil that really delivers.It helps a lot with hormonal/stress acne and redness. When I skip using it, I definitely notice I get more blemishes and break outs. I’ve used exfoliating products that give similar results, but those end up drying out my combination skin and giving me eczema flare ups around my nose. I don’t have any such problems with this product, my skin always feels moisturized and hydrated after I use it. I couldn’t swear that it’s made a difference with wrinkles, but it’s certainly not hurting. Because I need to use so little of it, I’d say a full-sized bottle probably lasts me around a year. It’s more than I would like to pay, but I think the cost per use somewhat justifies it. Works Reliably
