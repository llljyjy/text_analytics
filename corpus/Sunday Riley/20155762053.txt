I got the full size after I used a sample of this because I thought it was so good. It was not as great as I thought. The weather has made my skin super, super dry and this did not help. It felt like I had not put on any moisturizer. I dont know if it’s because it’s winter now & when I used the sample it was during the summer, but it really does not help. For the price, you would expect it to be better. I’ve had to use a hyaluronic serum to help keep moisture to my face and started using a diff moisturizer. Gave 3 stars bc maybe it works better during the summer than winter just because my skin does get really dry during winter months. Not very moisturizing for super dry skin
