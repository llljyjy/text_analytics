My initial thoughts on this oil is that it hydrates really well. I’ve used it as the last step in my evening skincare routine. My face felt so soft in the morning.  My skin is sensitive to vitamin c and after a few days I noticed a little irritation. I’ll continue to use it a few times a week because I enjoy how my skin felt overall. Only 2 to 3 drops are needed. It has a light citrus scent that I find pleasant Nice for helping with texture.
