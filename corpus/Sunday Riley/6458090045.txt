The first time I bought this was from an actual Sunday Riley rep in the store. I fell in love but didn’t want to get hooked on a pricey product so once I finished the bottle (which lasted me a full year), I tried other options.NONE of them worked like Good Genes. My skin looked more even, plumper, and was ridiculously soft. It also helped with my acne as well. I use it once a day every day and it has never irritated my sensitive skin. I don’t use a full pump, just half, and the first bottle lasted me a year.Because my skin looks so much better I use less/lighter makeup - so it did kind of save me money in that sense. Honestly Worth the Money
