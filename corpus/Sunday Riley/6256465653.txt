This is a really hydrating alternative to acne pads. I have combination breakout prone skin that isn’t too sensitive (but I try to use fragrance free hypoallergenic ingredients in general) and this serum / treatment / mask gives me glowing skin in the morning. I noticed I have less whiteheads and sebum plugs! This combined with Luna oil is a really great combo. I’m almost 35. love this & Luna oil!
