I see people fussing about the empty tube, ya get .5 oz so yea the tube seems empty but that give you the space to mix it up before you put it on. I’m 40 dealing with some weird acne and this knocks it out. I do not smear this all over my face just hit the bad spots and let it work it’s magic. Reliable
