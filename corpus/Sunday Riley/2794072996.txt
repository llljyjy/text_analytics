This is my favorite face oil and I use it every day on my face, neck and on dry patches on my body.  The large container is a must for me.  I suffer from extremely dry skin but I have acne on my chin and around my nose.  I do not use this oil and my thick, hydrating cremes on my bad acne areas.  I use this oil a couple times a day w a thick hydrating creme, Skin Food sometimes La Mer when I am sick of the savory smell but never on my chin and my nose and I like to hydrate my skin before using Vitamin C serums and Retinol creams also.  I like to put this on w no clothes on so I can be sloppy and giving to my skin.  My skin is looking younger than my age and I want to thank this oil for helping me. My Favorite Oil
