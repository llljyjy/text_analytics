A great lighter alternative to the original CEO cream. This moisturizer is lightweight, absorbs quickly, and leaves a satin finish - not too dewy but not matte, just a subtle sheen. It definitely instantly brightens & smooths. I wore it this morning over a different brand’s Vitamin C serum and didn’t have any issues. I noticed it pilled juuuust a bit when I put on my sunscreen, but it may be that I didn’t let it dry down enough first. I did wear makeup today and I think this cream helped prep my skin for a super smooth makeup application. I can’t speak much to results yet, but I am pleasantly surprised by this one!⁣ nan
