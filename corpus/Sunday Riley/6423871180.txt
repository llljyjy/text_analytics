If you have sensitive skin this is probably not for you. I had a bad reaction by using a very small / thin layer - my skin is very irritated to the point that the top few layers of skin have come off. Have used other sulfer products with no problem (e.g. Kate Sommerville Eradikate). Not good for sensitive skin
