I’ve used this on and off for years. When I was living in New York I loved it for Glow and hydration in the winter but it was too much for the summer. When I lived in Florida it was too much for me pretty much all the time, and now that I’m in Dry Colorado I really love how much it balances moisture in my skin! nan
