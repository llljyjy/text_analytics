I love how this moisturizer keeps my skin well hydrated while also adding beautiful radiance to it. Its lightweight gel formula soaks in very fast and doesn’t contribute to my t-zone oiliness, which is super important for an AM moisturizer. I’m also impressed with how it gradually improves my skin texture - my pores and whiteheads seem to be less noticeable. And last but not least - it smells so delicious (kind of citrusy-fruity). Overall it’s a wonderful moisturizer that both feels and works great! Hello healthy glow!
