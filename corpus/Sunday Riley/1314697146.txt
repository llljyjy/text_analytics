As someone who is trying to learn more about skincare, this is a great way to explore this brand. While I don’t see major changes in my skin, my makeup looks so nice lately. I have been using all of the products and my skin isn’t dry or sensitive - I often get hives from some skincare ingredients. A great way to explore the line!
