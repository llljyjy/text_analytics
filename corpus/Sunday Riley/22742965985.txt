Using this at night makes my skin radiant the next morning… I’d be using it regularly if only I weren’t counting pennies and it weren’t so darn expensive. (The price is the reason I docked a star.) As it is, I hoard it to use the night before major events, and especially if I know I’ll be taking pictures. Goddesslike glow
