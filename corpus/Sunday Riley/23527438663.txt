This is a wonderful infused oil that is really effective! Youâ€™ll find healing ingredients such as Alpha-Bisabolol and Pomegranate Oil while also seeing huge improvements in overall brightness with ingredients such as Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate. It does have quite a bit of fragrance but it is a nice scent. The oil itself brought such a gorgeous healthy glow to my skin. The product is quite heavy and you really only need a small drop or two. I love how healthy and bright my skin has looked after using it. Glowing and Lovely
