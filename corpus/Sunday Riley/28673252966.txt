I really wanted this to work for my skin! Unfortunately, that was not the case here. It did do well to control some of the oiliness in my T-zones. But in the 2 weeks I used it (Am & PM) it didnt show any improvements on my pores or texture. As you can see in my Before and after, it did help with the oiliness of my nose. The product itself, absorbs great and easy to apply with the dropper. Unfortunately, this didnt work for me
