I’ve been using this stuff for nearly 4 years now and it’s a staple in my skincare routine. It has helped get rid of my problem areas and maintain clear skin! Anytime I run out I go into a frenzy and run to the nearest Sephora. People need to get over the smell because it isn’t that bad and your skin will thank you! been using it for years now and I still love it
