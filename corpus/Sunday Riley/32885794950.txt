This is the moisturizer everyone should have in their daily skincare routine!!! It’s just so good! I’ve been using it for almost 2weeks now, and my skin is radiant, it’s glowing unprovoked, it’s more hydrated than it’s ever been during the winters. The texture has become smoother and softer, I can visibly see the brightness, because it was so dull prior to when I started using it. To say I’m impressed would be an understatement. And I love that it smells & has similar ingredients to the vitamin c & turmeric facial oil. Gifted by Sunday Riley Absolute must have!!!
