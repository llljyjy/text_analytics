I would not recommend if you have sensitive skin. I used it for two nights and cause bad irritation around my eyes. On the morning of the last time I used it I woke up to peeling under eyes and eye lids. I was so sad it didnâ€™t work out because I use/love two other of their products. Not for sensitive skin!!
