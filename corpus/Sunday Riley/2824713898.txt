I had been buying the UFO oil for a few years and while I liked how it felt on my skin, I didn’t notice a huge difference. My mom let me try her Good Genes one time and I loved the instant plumping effect and dewy finish. I ended up splurging on my own bottle and so far it’s definitely been worth it. I have ridiculously finicky skin that breaks out if the wind blows the wrong way but I haven’t had any issues with this product (or any Sunday Riley products for that matter). I’ve been using Good Genes for a few months now and it seems to have helped even my skin tone. I’m 22 so I bought it to just generally improve the appearance of my skin, but my mom really likes using it in combination with a retinol for wrinkles. The main thing I love is that immediate improvement you can see-- the day after using it, my skin is always bouncy and glowing. I use it a few times a week, and I don’t need too much to cover my face and neck, so I think the bottle will probably last me a while. Either way, I think it’s worth it. It’s definitely the best Sunday Riley product I’ve tried so far (as compared to UFO oil, Lunar oil, and CEO serum). Worth the money
