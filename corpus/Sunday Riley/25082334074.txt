I’ve been a big fan of Sunday Riley’s Good Genes and Luna Oil, and this one is my new favorite! The 10% niacinamide concentration doesn’t make this serum irritating or sticky on the skin at all. Instead, it feels watery light and instantly hydrating. I’ve used many other niacinamide serums in the past and have enjoyed the benefits of niacinamide, but none of those serums feels as nice or hydrating. This serum also contains many other beneficial skin actives.  After consistent use for a few days, my skin is looking healthier and clearer. The enlarged pores on my forehead are slightly less noticeable, and the one red acne mark is healing faster than usual (gifted by Sunday Riley for my honest reviews). nan
