A nice employee at my local Sephora gave me a few sample to try, I was debating if I wanted it because of the price. But once I started using I instantly noticed the difference and loved it. I bought the full product right away! It makes my hyperpigmentation from acne scar disappear. Yes, it is a bit pricey but the little goes long way so it’ll lay you for a while. It’s definitely worth the price. nan
