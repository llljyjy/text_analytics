I have been using the B3 Nice 10% Niacinamide Serum by Sunday Riley for a few weeks as part of my skincare routine. There are many benefits to incorporating Niacinamide into your skin routine so I have enjoyed this serum. It helps pores look less prominent and my skin looks smoother overall after using. It is also beneficial for redness reduction and dark spots. I had zero irritation or breakouts while using this product. The texture was lightweight and easily absorbed into my skin. I don’t have oily skin to comment on the effectiveness of that aspect, but it also didn’t make my dry skin areas feel drier, so I was happy about that. nan
