Obsessed! I like the texture, luxurious and rich but fully absorbs into my skin (I have combo/oily skin). They say you should start to see results in about a week and I really have! I noticed my dark spots from acne have been fading much faster than normal. I also use good genes a few times a week and I feel this is better at fading dark spots that that product. My skin feels hydrated and happy all day. Gives a smooth finish that my makeup sits on top of really well. I love the smell of neroli so the smell makes me happy but not something everyone will like, itâ€™s very herbal/floraly, smell it in person before you buy. Very happy with this product! nan
