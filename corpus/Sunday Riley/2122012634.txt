I have been loving the Sunday Riley B3 Nice 10%  Niacinamide Serum. I use the serum twice per day, morning and evening. Since using the serum for the past two weeks, I have noticed improvement in the appearance of dark spots on my face, neck and chest. My skin texture is much more smoother as well. Niacinamide is great for oily/dry skin to help diminish the appearance of pores, smooth skin texture and support the skins natural moisture. Definitely recommend adding this serum to your skin care routine. I wash my face, use a toner, serum, eye cream and followed my moisturizer with SPF. Great serum to add to your routine!
