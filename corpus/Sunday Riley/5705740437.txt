I love this cream. It’s thick, heavy and smells wonderful.  I have dry sensitive skin and it loves a deep skin drenching cream and this does just that. It’s perfect for a night cream, I use this with a few drops of the UFO clarifying oil at night and it’s the perfect combo. Subtle glow from the vitamin C in it also, which is a nice bonus.  I was new to Sunday Riley but after CEO and UFO I am now a forever costumer. Very expensive for a cream, especially the larger container, but that’s something I’ll have to deal with because I do love this product. Deeply moisturizing
