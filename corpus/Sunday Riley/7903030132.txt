This serum entered my life when my skin was at its worst in YEARS. I was experiencing a lot of acne, dullness, and an impaired skin barrier. Because of this, I had to start off really gently and didn’t notice much going on until about the second week of use.If your skin responds well to niacinamide, I think you’ll really enjoy this serum. It’s a lot less sticky than others I’ve tried and it absorbs really well. I tend to reach for this at night mostly since it is so expensive and it’ll have the most time on my skin to make a difference.After a coupe of weeks, my acne has just about all the way cleared up and it’s helping tremendously with hyperpigmentation that was left behind.If I had one critique, I’d love to see this in different packaging. The product presentation is stunning, but the dropper makes it difficult to measure out precisely. I also don’t like the idea of air getting into the formula either, especially at this price point. Other than that, this is a win!gifted by Sunday Riley Great Experience!
