I really love the results I have seen from this moisturizer. I used the SR Rich Hydration Vitamjn C cream and was interested to see the difference. Indefinitely think this one gives more of a glow and I saw an overall brightening to my entire face. The texture is a little thinner but still hydrated my dry skin. The only drawback is the scent - it feels stronger and almost floral. Itâ€™s a great Vitamin C moisturizer and the scent goes away after a bit. nan
