Pros:+ lightweight (won’t make you look like a shine monster)+ spreadability (a little bit goes a long way)+ effectiveness (helped reduce the size of my breakouts and my hyperpigmentation after about 2-3 weeks of using it)Cons:+ price (I think there’s similar, if not better vitamin c treatments)+ smell (if you’re into floral scents, you will love this, but if not, it’s REALLY strong - reminds me of jasmine) -> this was my personal reason why this product isn’t for me, the smell is way too strong and it lingers for quite a while after Not too bad, but its scent is STRONG
