I splurged on this and I wasn’t disappointed. I have been wanting to dabble with retinols for a while but was concerned because I have sensitive skin and in the summer spend time outdoors. I feel like this is the perfect way to get the benefits of using a retinol without the negatives of irritated, red or peeling skin and extra sun sensitivity. I use it at night and it has a calming scent. I have definitely noticed a smoother, mote even and glowing essence to my skin after using this. If you’re hesitant about trying a full blown retinol, start here and I doubt you’ll be disappointed. worth it!
