I’ve been using B3 Nice 10% Niacinamide Serum for the last two weeks and it’s been my favorite serum to use in the daytime, I was dealing with a lot of hormonal acne and it’s helped with the post acne dark spots fade. Also, my pores have minimized and I have a lot of redness after I do my skincare and it’s been helping with smoothing the redness. Dries down Matte/perfect for acne prone skin!
