I have been using this for about 2 months. I cannot use it every night - usually 2 nights on, 1 night off - or else my skin gets too sensitive. That said, I have noticed an honest to goodness improvement in the fine lines under my eyes. They aren’t gone, but they are DEFINITELY less deep/defined. If you have sensitive skin or if you also used vitamin C in the mornings, be warned! This product packs a punch and you’ll need to moisturize well. 100% worth it though, and I will forever be repurchasing this one. Actually Makes a Difference!
