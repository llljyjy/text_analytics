After about 2 weeks of using this I have noticed a huge difference. My redness has reduced so much and my skin is radiant. My pores are smaller and I love the healthy way my skin looks right after washing (I canâ€™t remember the last time that happened!). I use this at night and good genes in the morning. I use just a tiny amount and it blends right in -- no staining pillowcases at all as others have mentioned. Of course I wish it was cheaper, but a little goes a long way and this stuff actually works. Actual great results
