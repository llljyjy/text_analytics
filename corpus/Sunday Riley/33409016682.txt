I was excited to try this cream because I am already using same oil serum. Packaging is very beautiful and it’s come with little applicator and it’s so helpful. Texture is so smooth and creamy. When I applied it first time I feel like it was heavy I have normal combination on dry side skin but it penetrated so easy and left my skin hydrated and glowing. Skin looks brighter after a week of using it. Good ingredients and good price point. Definitely will last long. The only thing it has herbal kinda scent and little bit strong for me. nan
