I don’t necessarily have dark under eyes but due to deep lines/little fat it does appear sunken and shadowed so I’ve been on the market for an eye cream. Based on all the great reviews I requested this as a Christmas gift. I’ve since been using it morning and night for 3 months and I’d say I notice zero difference. This may have a temporary brightening effect due to the pearlescent colors however this does nothing to depuff, plump, smooth, or brighten my under eyes. For the price I expected much more. I don’t have wrinkles just deep tear trough lines but for such a pricey product I expected to see some change. Also the lid falls off every time I pick it up no difference
