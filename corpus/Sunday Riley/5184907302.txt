I’ve been testing this product out for a few weeks now and have been enjoying it! It’s water based so it’s very light on your skin but it also can get a little messy around the bottle if you’re not careful. I didn’t really like how watery it was because of this but I’m used to it now and prefer it because it soaks up into your skin faster. I had some allergic rashes on my face and I’m not sure if this serum helped make them disappear faster but I’d like to think that it did. I’m not a fan of the smell but you get used to it, plus the scent goes away after I put on the rest of my skincare products. nan
