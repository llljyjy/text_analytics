I really enjoy using this cream. It has a thick texture, but sinks in quickly. It makes my skin soft and plump. The only thing you should be aware of is a strong herbal scent since it contains a lot of botanical extracts. I don’t see any brightening effect, but it’s a nice antioxidant deep hydrating moisturizer. I think it would be too much for oily young skin, though I’d definitely recommend it for a combo/ dry aging skin. The packaging is luxe, and it comes with a really handy spatula. Good for aging skin
