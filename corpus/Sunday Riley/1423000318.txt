This is one of the best ceramide filled moisturizer on the market. I started using this as a winter moisturizer but as another year went by I realized I kept getting drier. I had gotten micro needling treatment and just could NOT seem to fight the dryness. Well I pulled this out of my arsenal of products and itâ€™s the only thing that did the job. So now this is def in my summer routine as well. Go feel this for urself especially if u r in the over 50 age or just have extreme dryness that nothing helps nan
