I really wanted to like this, because one of my best friends uses it and she saw great results, but I am afraid that this isnâ€™t for every skin type. My skin is very sensitive but with the time and care I am able to tolerate a lot of face products but not this one. I tried using it for 4 times and as soon as I apply it my skin looks amazing, glowy, plump and it smells great but a few hours pass by and it makes me breakout like crazy. I do love the Luna face oil, that one worked wonders for me. Not for sensitive skin
