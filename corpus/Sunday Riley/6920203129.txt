I am used to using retinol products on my face and eyes so when I gave this a try I was absolutely disappointed. I KNOW that they cause dryness to get the skin used to it but this way too far. I tried everything. Using it every night to get my eye skin “used“ to it, alternating days, waiting some days but the irritation would just increase to an alarming rate for a long unbearable period or just come back after alternating days. I’m really sad this didn’t work for me, as the SundayBrile Face serum worked great on my actual face. The constant prolonged irritation isn’t going to work for me, and I don’t want to look like I have bruises on my face. Burning, dryness, and inflamation
