I was kindly gifted C.E.O Glow by Sunday Riley for my honest feedback. I am someone who uses a dedicated vitamin C in my routine and have been doing so for years. I’ve wanted to get C.E.O Glow for sometime as I’ve heard great things about it. What I like about it it is uses THD ascorbic acid, a more stable form of vitamin C. THD  stimulates more collagen than L-ascorbic acid, so you tend to enjoy better anti-aging, more plumping, more firming, and more collagen production with this ingredient. I’ve been using this for 10 days now and can see a slight improvement in my skins tone and texture. I always use other forms of treatments such as retinol and exfoliating products just not at the same time. I believe the combination of using various treatments will help you increase results. This leaves my skin feeling soft and not oily. I love the packaging of Sunday Riley’s products as well but would still like to see all vitamin C products stored in opaque containers even if they are not L-ascorbic bases. I cannot wait to finish off the bottle and see the difference in my before and after shots. I have also be concentrating on a sun spot and a acne scar to see how they look at the time I finish the bottle. nan
