I was really excited to try this out and used my points to get it. To be honest, I didn’t notice any difference in my skin. Also, the fake orange scent was so awful I did not enjoy putting it on my face and was happy when I finally used it all up so I could throw it away. There are so many better products out there for less money... And they don’t smell gross. Definitely won’t be purchasing. Awful orange smell
