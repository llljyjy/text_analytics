I really wanted to love this cream, I’ve been using it for a week and I really feel my skin is brighter and healthier.  It delivers what it promises.  I’m giving it 3 stars because it’s very yellow in color and it stained my clothes and my pillowcase.  Do not use white if you are going to apply this cream on your neck.  And another negative point for me is the smell… unfortunately I find the smell very bad. I love Sunday Riley products but this one is not for me. nan
