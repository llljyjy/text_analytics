I’m only a few days into using this face oil, but I love it! I was a bit aggressive the other night with a facial scrub and was left with really dry and irritated skin. I put a few drops of this on and instantly felt relief. It’s super calming and moisturizing. Read that this is also good for dark circles, can’t wait to see how it treats my under eyes!
