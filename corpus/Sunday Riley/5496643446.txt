im not sure if im useing this wrong? because i bought it the first time and forgot about it that how littel it worked for me then i recived it in a ipsy glam box full size. and once again nothing...... i mean i can see a glow but as far as texture goes i still have bumps and texture . maybe its not mixing well with my cleanseridk not worth the price tbh. i hate the hype $$ not worth it
