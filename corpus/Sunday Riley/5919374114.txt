OMG! This serum is so good!  I was gifted by Sunday Riley to provide my honest review. I have sensitive skin and this doesn’t irritate me at all. It has improved my skin’s overall brightness. I do see my skin texture is more fine and smooth after using it. I have some little dark spots and acne spots here and there and now they are gone! (forehead and face). It also improved the appearance of my facial redness. Highly recommend! Works so well
