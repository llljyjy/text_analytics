I have always had puffiness/dark circles (so does my mom, my sister, my grandmother...pretty much everyone I’m related to...). This is the best product I’ve ever used for under my eyes, making concealer application super smooth and easy. I think the closest thing I could compare it to would be a Lancôme eye serum pump that came out years back (purple-pump-caffeine-type thing). The Sunday Riley is fantastic but it definitely has a time limit and needs to be reapplied if you have crazy puffiness/dark circles like I do! Best Thing!
