I have the most sensitive skin in the world, and had fairly bad acne for years. This product as well as a consistent skincare routine changed my skin. It does have a smell, so if you’re smell sensitive you might not like it but I don’t mind it. I have been using it every day for a year and a half now, and I have noticed such a difference in my skin. I still get small break outs from period/mask wearing but nothing like I did before this product. Love love love it. game changer
