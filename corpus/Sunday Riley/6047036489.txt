I recently got this serum and it has become one of my daily staples! I unfortunately forgot to take a before picture but have used this product consistently at night for two weeks now. I’ve noticed a huge improvement in the texture and evenness of my skin. First of texture- this serum has made my skin so soft to the touch. It literally feels like baby smooth! I’ve had a lot of small hormonal bumps on my cheeks and this has cleared a huge chunk of it. For evenness- I’ve noticed my skin has seen reductions of my dark acne spots and now has a nice glow to it. I wake up and my skin feels supple and smooth. Definitely going to continue using this! LOVE LOVE LOVE! So happy I came across this!
