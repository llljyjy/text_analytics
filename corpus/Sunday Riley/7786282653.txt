I LOVE sunday Riley’s products so was very eager to use this. I am allergic to horse hair and tree nuts so was a little skeptical to try this when i got it in a pack with other products, but horse chestnut is something completely different so i did a patch test, saw no results and gave it a go. After two weeks of use (i started off every other night and worked up to every night) my eye lids started to PEEL. My right eyelid in particular would be super red, swollen and SO dry. I obviously threw the product away and it’s been over A month since i last used it and my eyelid will STILL not chill out. I would just stay clear of this! Not worth the risk. Ruined my eyelids
