I’ve been using B3 Nice for a couple weeks now and really enjoying the results. I’ve had a lot of acne and dark spots from acne scars because of pregnancy and I’m already seeing a difference in them fading. I’ve had a lot of redness as well, mostly around my nose and cheeks and those have calmed down a lot as well since using. Can’t wait to see what my skin will look like with a couple more weeks of use. Love this product! Great addition to my routine!
