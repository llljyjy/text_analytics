This was on sale and I am a fan of Sunday Riley. I wasn’t prepared to love it but I do! Excellent for my dry and winter challenged skin. Even though it’s a little more than I would like to spend I use so little and only at night so I expect this to last awhile. Feels cool when applied has a light scent and is super creamy. Will be a staple in my skincare! Miracle for my very dry skin
