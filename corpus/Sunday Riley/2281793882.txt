I am a fan of the Sunday Riley CEO Glow Face Oil, so I was excited to try this. After trying this, I can say that I’m a tiny bit confused with this product because it’s so similar to their other CEO moisturizer. The main difference is that this one might be a bit better for oilier skin types, but other than that, they are quite similar. If you have that one, I don’t think it’s necessary to try this one. With that being said, as a stand alone product, I think it’s a fair product, but it is quite pricey. The texture is nice and it gives your skin a nice sheen, but honestly, I prefer their serum or face oil. nan
