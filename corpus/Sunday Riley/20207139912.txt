Iâ€™ve been trying new retinols obviously not all at once BUT this is my favorite by far. The blue tansy scent is my absolute favorite!! I love massaging this into my skin with a gua shua as well! And occasionally using Good Genes in conjunction with this oil! My skin looks amazing and glowy the morning after! Definitely try! MUST HAVE!
