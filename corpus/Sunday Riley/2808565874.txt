This was gifted by Sunday Riley! I love this face oil. I love the ingredients in it because it helps with my acne spots left in my face. I use this oil with my guasha and it works together so perfectly! This oil also leaves my face and skin feeling so hydrated and moisturized which is perfect for my skin because it has been so dry lately! Overall I love this brand and product! Amazing!
