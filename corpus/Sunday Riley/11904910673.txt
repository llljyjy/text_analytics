This is a nice, thick cream that’s *very* moisturizing. Note that it has a very distinct golden color which didn’t stain my skin but could stain white clothing/pillowcases, etc. I think those with drier skin would prefer this, because it was a bit heavy for my oily skin. I noticed some subtle brightening, but nothing too significant after a week. The scent is not my favorite, very strong ginger scent. Hmm.. just ok
