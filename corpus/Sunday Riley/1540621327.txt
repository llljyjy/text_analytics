Ugh, I LOVE this cream! As someone with normal to dry skin that lives in the desert, this is perfect for me. Itâ€™s so thick and dreamy and leaves my skin feeling plump and juicy and protected. And it smells like delicious almonds with a slight coconut touch (all natural fragrances). I love that it contains ceramides! Highly recommend for those that love a super luxe cream. nan
