I received this complimentary from Sunday Riley First the packaging is amazing the glass bottle was so cute! The product it’s self felt amazing in my skin. I applied it after I washed my face and the serum goes on very nice. My skin usually feels dry after washing and this just adds the life back to my face before I apply other products. The pump is the perfect size to add the right amount to cover the skin and it isn’t a super thick product so it barley feels like anything is there after use. I enjoy using this in my daily routines. The product itself is purple which is a cute touch and overall my skin looks and feels so much better since using this product. Clean skin feel
