Let me tell you  the moisturizer is amazing!!!I have tried numerous creams, serums and oils over the years. So far, I really like this one. It is lightweight and leaves your skin feeling fresh and glowing.It absorbs quickly into the skin without any greasy feelings. It has a light scent which I like.This is my new must have. It goes a long way too. It takes very little to cover my face, neck. I really do like the way my skin is looking and love the way it feels on my skin. I am using it morning and evening and already see huge improvement. I highly recommend it. nan
