I drug my feet on buying because of the price but after using a trial size bottle of it, I knew it was worth the cost. The fragrance is very light and citrusy, the texture is light and smooth. This serum is oil solvable and absorbs super quickly - a fraction of time that it takes the vitamins c serums from Glow Recipe, Summer Friday, and Scentuals. It leaves a natural looking finish that moisturizes and brightens my skin without being too glowy. I do not experience any pilling when layered under Fenty Hydravizor, The Ordinary HA moisturizer, Tula face spf or my makeup. This is by far the best Vitamin C serum I have ever used! Worth The Money!!
