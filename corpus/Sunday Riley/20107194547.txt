I’ve been using Sunday Riley’s newest C.E.O. AfterGlow Brightening Vitamin C Cream.. and oh my stars.. I am obsessed! Where do I even begin? The gorgeous packaging, or the beautiful orange color, and silky consistency.. or how about the fact that it smells like freshly squeezed oranges. My skins radiance levels have increased drastically, along with tone and moisture levels. My face looks and feels so nourished, healthy, and hydrated.. and the best part of all is that gorgeous glow it gives the skin. This has got to be my new holy grail summertime moisture by far. Absolutely recommend! 10/10 chefs kiss amazing! My New Holy Grail Moisturizer!!
