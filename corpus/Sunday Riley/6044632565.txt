I love  Niacinamide in my skincare, as I have very dry and dull skin. I was a little afraid at first due to it being 10%, but it didn’t irritate my sensitive skin. The formula is very light and absorbs quickly into the skin and doesn’t feel tacky. I don’t have enlarged pores, but I do have redness and I have noticed improvement with it. The glow this serum gives my skin is lovely and my skin looks very healthy and moisturized. *Gifted By Sunday Riley. nan
