Ok so I’ve only used this product once, but I have some very strong initial thoughts right off the bat. First off, it’s packaged beautifully. The box, the jar, the label, the spatula - all of it is very high end looking. The consistency of the cream itself is great! Not too thick and not too thin. I feel like it would work well for all skin types. Now for things I don’t like: the cream is BRIGHT opaque yellow and even after you blend it in, your face color is a little off. The color also transfers to site towels and pillow cases. The smell is also very reminiscent of sun screen even though there is no SPF in the product. I can get past the smell but I can’t get passed the color. Would reconsider if it were a white or more translucent color. nan
