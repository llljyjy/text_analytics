In my early 40’s, wanting to slow these wrinkles and fine lines down some. Read reviews here. This is not working for me. I’ve been using this for 2 months with no results in fine lines or wrinkles. It has made my face softer and that’s it. Not worth the price tag as I can achieve that with cheaper products. I didn’t break out with this, but I was using a high dose retinol product before. I stopped use of it due to it quit working after a year and decided to try this. No results for me with lines/wrinkles
