I am so glad that they came out with a smaller container and I very much enjoy this product but I do have to agree with a lot of reviews I have read that for $20 it should be a full container and it’s actually only about half full and I don’t understand why what’s going on with the factory but I wish they’d fill it fully because it would make it a lot more work the money but the product is so darn good I’m not even going to dock a star for not being a full container and I would buy this again nan
