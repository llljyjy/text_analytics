Loving this moisturizer! It has a medium lightweight consistency that is hydrating, doesnâ€™t feel greasy and absorbs nicely into my oily skin. I love the yellow color and light scent that is kind of fresh floral to me. It is brightening and I really love the healthy glow it gives my skin. This moisturizer works well with my other skincare products and wears well under makeup too. Plus, the little spatula it comes with is perfect! nan
