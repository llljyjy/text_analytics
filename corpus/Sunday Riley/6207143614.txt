This is my first time ever writing a review for a product. Received ICE with the Sunday Riley night time kit. The smell repulsive and horrible I ended up throwing. To me it smells like play dog mixed with mildew. Who knows, maybe I got a bad batch but I will not buy again, not worth ever smelling that stench. nan
