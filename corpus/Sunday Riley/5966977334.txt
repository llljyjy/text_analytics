What a difference this makes! My face has always struggled with dark spots and redness. The harsh desert winter takes those to a whole new level. I’ve been using the Sunday Riley B3 twice a day (max recommended) and can tell that my skin tone looks a lot more even. My hairstylist today even complimented how clear my skin was! Love love love it! This is my first time using this strong of a serum. I felt tingling for the first couple of times I used it but no longer do.It’s quite expensive BUT I do think it’s worth the splurge if you are able. Another thing is that the bottle doesn’t have a stopper. So when you pick up product, it drips everywhere if you don’t immediately catch it with your hands.*complimentary from Sunday Riley Works! Expensive but it works!
