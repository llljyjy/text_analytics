I absolutely love all Sunday Riley products. I was so excited to get this and try it considering it’s a new launch. I must say I love the texture and consistency of it but I’m not a huge fan of the smell. It has an extremely strong scent and unless you are OK with that I might be a little bit too much. I have very sensitive eyes so this is irritating them. Unfortunately I won’t be able to use it as much as I would like. This would probably be an every few days cream for me. Strong scent
