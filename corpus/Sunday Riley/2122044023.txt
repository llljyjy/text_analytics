I’ve purchased Juno two or three times. It’s a staple in my skincare routine! It is very hydrating, without feeling too heavy. I’ve also used it to help heal the occasional sunburn. This is a workhorse! My only complaints are minor: the slight smell of chamomile can smell a little weird. Also, I’ve experienced pilling when layering over thick moisturizers, but that might be more the fault of the moisturizers--it’s typically the creamy rather than gel-based moisturizers that cause this.
