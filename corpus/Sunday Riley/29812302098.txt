I been trying out the new Afterglow Vitamin C Cream from Sunday Riley for a couple weeks now and I’m loving it ! I have dry skin so I’m always looking for a moisturizer to quench my skins thirst and this one Def delivers deep hydration! It also plu.ps my fine lines and my skin looks brighter and more radiant! I’m a huge fan of Sunday Riley products and this one is a keeper! Love!
