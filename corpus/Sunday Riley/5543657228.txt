As others have mentioned, this moisturizer broke me out like crazy. At first i wasn’t sure if this product was the cause, so i stopped using it until I’d finished up some others. I tried this again and the same thing happened, numerous tiny breakouts, seemingly permanent large pores, and a few really big and deep breakouts. I am hoping I can return this. If you are even remotely acne prone, i would stay far away. Not for acne prone skin
