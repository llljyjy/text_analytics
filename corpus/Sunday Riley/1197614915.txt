This product was gifted by Sunday Riley. I have normal/combo skin with some fine lines,  dullness,  dark spots and texture.  I’ve used this for a while now and I’m liking it.  The texture is nice since it’s somewhat thick but not too heavy and it blends in easily.  I’ve noticed a slight improvement in my skin looking a bit more radiant and my skin does feel nicely hydrated. In the areas where I’m more combo,  like my t-zone, I’ve noticed I have to go more sparingly with this because it does seem to make me a bit more oily than normal in those spots but my “normal“ areas it works really well.  The scent to me seems a bit chemically but it’s not too bad. Overall this is a nice cream,  you may need to experiment a bit to see how it would best work for you. Improved Radiance
