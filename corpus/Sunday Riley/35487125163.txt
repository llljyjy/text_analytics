So the product is super oily ofc and it does leave your skin oily but i feels so good on the skin and makes your skin feel suuuper soft after. I have large, super oily skin with a lot of blackhead and whitehead and after two weeks of using this Iâ€™ve seen improvement. Not as many black and white head like before and my pores are visibly smaller. I;m in love! It does have a sort of strong sent but not that bad. But if u are senative to sent than u wont like this. Love
