I have read bad reviews about this product, and I decided to write my experience. I have used it for over two weeks now (day and night). It came with my Allure box this month. I see improvements in my under eyes area—the product hydrate the area well. Every time I apply, my skin sucks the cream. I recommend giving this product a try. I’m thrilled with these results planning to keep using them. As usual, Sunday, Riley did it again! Great product! Visible Result in a week
