The A+ Retinol and the UFO Oil in this kit have made some dramatic changes in my skin, and I am really glad I got this kit since it introduced me to these items. I will re-purchase them again, although I only spot use the UFO Oil on problem areas and it will last most likely a year. The retinol has definitely made a difference in my skin. I look significantly more luminous and glowy and some fine lines have softened, become less noticable. I will keep using this retinol! It is fairly gentle for being a stronger product than the CeraVe retinol I started with. I am very happy with the changes. The Saturn mask does not seem any different than other run of the mill clay masks, the cleanser is also just a cleanser, and since there are affordable options that can produce the same results, I would not buy those two items again. I have not been able to use the Good Genes product enough to know if itâ€™s very beneficial to me, because I have been building up my retinol use and using non-retinol days to avoid actives and ensure I am not damaging my skin barrier. This photo shows my skin on the left on 2/15/22 and on the right on 3/12/22, so less than a month of use! Sorry the light quality is not identical. But I feel you get the idea, my skin is so much more even, some darker spots have also disappeared! and my skin looks more luminous and hydrated, less fine lines and tight areas, less breakout for sure. For reference, I am almost 40. Found a couple holy grails in here!
