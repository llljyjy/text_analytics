This is one of the most awesome products I have ever had. I have dark spots on my face and was using this for 2 weeks and it’s almost gone rn. I have found that is making a difference and I Did tried This is a great light serum. The best product ever, all the same serum as that first time I had tried it. My skin, after one use overnight, was incredibly different and smoother and softer. My skin really needed this. Also, a little goes a long way. I highly recommend treating yourself to Sunday Riley’s product, it is so amazing. You will get all the benefits of vitamin c but it’s more gentle. I feel it’s definitely worth and I will keep using this. LOVE! Love
