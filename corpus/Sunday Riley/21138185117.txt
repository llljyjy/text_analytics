I absolutely love the CEO Glow face oil. I’m on my 4th bottle! For reference, I’m 42 with dry/combo, aging skin. I have some old sun damage and this has absolutely helped with the appearance of my dark spots. The big, dark ones have faded quite a bit and some of the lighter ones have disappeared completely. I use it after cleansing, eye cream, and a light moisturizer. This really seals everything in. It has that “oil“ feel when going on but it’s so nourishing and soaks in completely after about an hour. If you don’t like greasy feeling oils, don’t give up! It’s worth it. This has really helped with the evening of my complexion and my skin’s dryness. It’s one of my forever products! I would recommend it for everyone! Fades old sunspots and evens my complexion
