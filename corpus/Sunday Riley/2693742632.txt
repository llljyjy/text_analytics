Love me a Vitam C  Moisturizer and this one from Sunday Riley is no exception. Itâ€™s top notch. The formula is lightweight and absorbs quickly and non sticky.  The C.E.O Afterglow is brightening  and hydrating. A small amount goes a long way. I would definitely te it for its performance and luxurious formula and results. So Lovely
