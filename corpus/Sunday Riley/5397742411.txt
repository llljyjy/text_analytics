I’ve been looking for a good Vitamin C skincare product for a while, so I was super excited to try out this C.E.O Glow Vitamin C & Turmeric Face Oil. I’d heard great things about this prior to trying it and I wanted to see if it lived up to the hype. (Spoiler alert: it does!) My skin is GLOWING the morning after I apply this, and it seriously helps my makeup have this lit-from-within-natural-glow look. I’d definitely recommend checking this out. nan
