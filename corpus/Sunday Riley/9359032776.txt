I have been a massive fan of the oil from the same range for many many years, in fact I’m actually using it right now, so I was very very happy to find out that they were coming out with the cream version of the oil! I’m not gonna lie the color is beautiful! I seriously feel like this is one of the most stunning textures I’ve ever seen in my life and yes it does indeed hydrate your skin to the craziest extent ever! nan
