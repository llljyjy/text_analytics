Less is more here. The formula is a DARK midnight blue, so you can actually see if this serum is not yet absorbed. There is a definitive, floral aroma to it which (although not unpleasant or overpowering) it has a different kind of scent, like essential oils which not everyone likes and honestly did take me some getting used to.A few drops goes a long way. It’s a rich, powerful night oil that takes a minute to absorb, but once it does, my skin feels soft and smooth, dewy and ultra-hydrated.It’s not an inexpensive product by any means, so if you’re someone who is sensitive to scents or if you’re turned off by things like unusual colors, perhaps view some of the photo/video customer reviews first to gauge if it looks like something you could get used to vs. something you’d buy and let sit on your vanity. intense hydration, intense midnight blue color
