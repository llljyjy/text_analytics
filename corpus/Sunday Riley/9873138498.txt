I usually never write reviews but I had to... when I first started using this product (first 3 days) I was in love! I thought I had found my moisturizer! The glow, the scent, the ingredients, all AMAZING! Until the first week had gone by... my whole entire face broke out in milia :) I’ve never experienced this before. I do have sensitive skin and am cautious of what I put on my face, but given that this product claims it is for sensitive skin, I gave it a go. I’ve used other Sunday Riley products in the past with zero problems, but the results with this are horrifying. My entire forehead and neck are currently covered in bumps. Since then I’ve had to stop using. Don't use if you have remotely sensitive skin...
