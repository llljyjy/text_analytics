The serum is great for acne prone oily and combo skin. I notice my T zone is less shiny and pore size has reduced too. It may be too strong for my cheeks so I tend to focus the product on the center of my face. I Love the bottle and packaging. Feels fancy when I use it every-time. Gifted by Sunday Riley. Good for oily tzone
