Definitely a fan of Sunday Riley. I liked their lactic acid serum and the Vit C oil. This B3 serum comes in the similar packaging. Product itself was nice to use, played well with other serums, and was less sticky than other B serums. The only thing I would change is that the dropper didnâ€™t seem to hold the serum well.  Probably a random defect in the dropper. Will continue to use. nan
