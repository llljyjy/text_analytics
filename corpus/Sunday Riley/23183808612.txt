For full disclosure, I’ve used this product maybe three times  so far. The smell is decent, but the product itself feels nice. Since I’ve used it after cleansing as instructed, my skin has been enjoying it so far. Definitely provides the hydration my skin is looking for! Will update if there is a change. nan
