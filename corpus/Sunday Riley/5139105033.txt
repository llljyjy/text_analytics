This niacinamide serum applies really nicely to the skin and absorbs quickly. It’s lightweight and layers great under my moisturizer and makeup. I’m noticing my skin is brighter, and I’ve been using it only for 2 weeks, so I’m excited to see what the long-term results will be like. New favorite by Sunday RIley
