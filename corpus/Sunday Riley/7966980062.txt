This is the best vitamin C product I’ve tried! When I finished the bottle, I decided to try another brand, and it hasn’t worked like this. Yes, it’s a little expensive, but it is worth every penny. When I started using it, my skin completely changed, something that hasn’t happened with the serum I’m currently using. I can’t wait to get my hands on some Sunday Riley again! 100% recommended. Can't live without it
