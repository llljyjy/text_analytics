Upon opening the product, the citrus scent is amazing! The bright orange color is also beautiful. I love that the product comes with a spatula to apply it. It makes a little bit go a long way! After a week of using the product, I did break out a little bit. It’s unclear if it’s from the product, or other reasons. I do think it’s a very hydrating cream and enjoy using it. Amazing scent!
