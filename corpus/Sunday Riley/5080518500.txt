I only use this face oil in my evening routine to avoid photosensitivity. I was expecting it to smell extremely strong due to the turmeric, however to my surprise it didnâ€™t smell strong at all. I applied 3 drops onto my face and massaged away. My skin was glowy afterwards and within a few minutes I could see that it was quickly absorbed. The next morning I noticed that my skin felt smoother and softer. Some of the bumpy texture I have felt smoother. I noticed within a few days that the dry patches around the corners of my lips and nose were hydrated. I received this as a gift from Sunday Riley. nan
