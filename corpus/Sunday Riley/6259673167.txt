I had this stubborn seborrheic dermatitis that even prescriptions wouldnâ€™t clear up. It did take several weeks of using this morning and night, but it cleared it right up! Just ordered a second bottle and it will be part of my regular routine. I took off a star because of the price, but I do love Sunday Riley and will always pay more for products that really work. worth the price for me
