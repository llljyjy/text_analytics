I received this complimentary from Sunday Riley in exchange for my honest opinion. I love products that contain vitamin C. This brighten cream did not disappoint. It made my skin glowy and healthy and gave my skin so much hydration. My skin looks more plump and healthy. Love the consistency of this cream and its been my go to morning face cream since I received. Definetly worth a try imo. go to daytime moisturizer!
