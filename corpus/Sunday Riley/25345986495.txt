This moisturizer is a must have if you have very dry skin or use retinol in your skincare routine. My skin barrier was completely ruined when I started using prescribed tretinoin a couple weeks ago. None of my moisturizers were ever able to moisturize my skin from the flaking I was going through, except for this. It completely changed my skin even after the first application. My skin doesn’t even get tight or dry after washing my face. My skin looks so much healthier and the redness I used to have on my cheekbone area has vanished.It does leave a very dewy, non-greasy, finish so I prefer to use it at night. It does have a strong scent that stays on for a while after application. To me it smells like candy and play doh. It doesn’t smell bad but if you don’t like fragrance in your skincare it might bother you. SAVED MY SKIN
