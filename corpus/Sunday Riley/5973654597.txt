The color is just absolutely gorgeous, a daisy-sunshine yellow lightweight cream. Fairly strong citrus scent, but I ADORE the way it smells - as does my fiance. He loves anything with Vitamin C that smells “orange“ (his words) so we are currently fighting over this lol. Overall works very well for both radiance and brightness, keeping our skin plump and hydrated! New favorite vitamin C cream!
