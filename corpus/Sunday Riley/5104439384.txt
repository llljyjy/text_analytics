Niacinamide works really well with my skin and I was curious to try this new serum from Sunday Riley. So far my skin is loving it. I was a bit worried about the high concentration of Niacinamide at 10%. But my skin hasnâ€™t had any issues so far. My skin looks glowy and hydrated. This product was gifted by sunday Riley. nan
