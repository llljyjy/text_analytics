This oil came in a very nice package, the bottle was pretty as well but thatâ€™s about the only thing that really stood out to me about this product. I had very high hopes for this based on the hype I had seen from it on the internet and the price point. However, this left my face unchanged and somewhat worse after a week of using this. It has a terrible smell that I was okay with if the product would have worked. Even though this is an oil it still left my face extremely oily, like too oily... unlike other face oils I have used in the past. It also did not help with any acne and made my skin texture very bumpy and gross. Using this at night also made my skin texture horrible in the morning. Not worth the hype
