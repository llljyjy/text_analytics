I received B3 Nice 10% Niacinamide Serum Complimentary from Sunday Riley and I am absolutely shocked at the efficacy of this product ! Iâ€™ve been using it for two weeks and the results have been extremely pleasing ! I normally suffer from acne , hence hyperpigmentation is a common after effect I have been dealing with for years. The dark spots definitely appear much lighter now on my skin, and my skin has less texture, and pores appear much smaller. Please note that my sensitive skin has tolerated this product extremely well, and the vibrant, bright, youthful complexion has been complimented by my co-workers, which makes this NOW a permanent staple in my skincare arsenal. a must have in skincare !
