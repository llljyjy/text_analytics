I was excited to try after glow and it did not disappoint. I love the texture of this cream and the glow it gives me after it is applied. It feels hydrating and I was impressed with the brightening effect. After a couple days of using it, I noticed my dark spots had lightened which I didnâ€™t expect. I am loving this and will continue to use it! nan
