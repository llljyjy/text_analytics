I’ve been using this product for about 2 weeks now. I am really enjoying it, it gives the skin a beautiful hydrated glow. I have noticed a little difference in my dark spots and I’m definitely less oily. The texture is a bit runny and I’m not sure how I feel about the smell of the product but it’s not a big deal. nan
