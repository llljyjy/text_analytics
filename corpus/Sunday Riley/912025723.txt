I honestly haven’t had this product long enough for any before and after pictures. I will say that I do enjoy the Sunday Riley products I have tried. This creamcomes in a pretty jar, which doesn’t bother me, personally, but it isn’t the best way to house a face cream, especially one w/ Vitamin C. It does come with a very nice little spatula, so that’s a plus! The cream is thick and looks and feels so beautiful, albeit a bit orange. A little goes a long way. Use sparingly to begin is my tip. It is hydrating. It also has a scent, just a heads up. If you’re sensitive to fragrances, this is citrusy. Although it appears to be natural and dissipates, it doesn’t bother me, but I wanted to make sure to point that out. Overall, I would say if you’re interested in a facial moisturizer with vitamin C and claims of brightness and a glow and hydration, then this is a nice option. If you enjoy other products by Sunday Riley then this is definitely a good bet for you. So far so good…! Glowing Hydration in a Jar
