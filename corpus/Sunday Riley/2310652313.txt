What a transformative product. Within a couple weeks of using it I noticed a smoother texture, smaller pores, and brightening effects. I tend to have combination skin and this product seems to help matte me, particularly as I’m not often wearing makeup during the work week. I’ve also noticed improvement in some of my post-acne dark spots. The only thing I’m not a huge fan of is the applicator because I’ve accidentally spilled a bit of the product a couple times and there’s been residue on the rim of it, which dries and crusts quickly, wasting some of it. Otherwise this is a fantastic product. Smooooooth Operator
