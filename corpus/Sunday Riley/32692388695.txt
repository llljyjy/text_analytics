The packaging of the C.E.O. Afterglow Brightening Vitamin C Moisturizer is beautiful. It also come with a mini spatula which is a nice touch. It is hydrating and makes my skin look dewy. I have worn it under makeup as well. It has a pudding like texture and a little bit goes a long way. I enjoy using this moisturizer and am hoping to see some long term benefits. Another winner from Sunday Riley. Hydrating Vitamin C Moisturizer
