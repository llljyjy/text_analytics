This product isn’t bad by any means, but its nothing special at all. It’s no better than a drug store acne product, and it smells like rotten eggs from the sulfur. I’d be completely ok with smelling like eggs if it worked any miracles, but it doesn’t. Plus, the tube is only half full at best so it’s a waste of packaging and misleading. Literally get the same results from Clean and Clear acne spot treatment, which cost way less. Over priced and over hyped
