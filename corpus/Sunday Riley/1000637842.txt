Gentle but start by using maybe every two days. I do notice a difference in skin texture and brightness. Hyperpigmentation won’t change in a month. Wrinkles and lines that have been around will not go away. They will be softened and any further creasing will be eased. Remember serums help but aren’t miracle workers. Do all the work. Wear SPF, nutrition etc it all factors in. skintastic
