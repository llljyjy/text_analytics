Complimentary from Sunday Riley. I have been using this serum for around two weeks now for both AM and PM in my routine and I have noticed my redness has gone down a lot as well as the size of my pores. The formula is thin and liquidy, and it absorbs quite quickly. I use it before moisturizer, and I have no sticky residue. Good part of my routine
