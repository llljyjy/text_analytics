The yellow-orange color cream looks really pretty.  I was worried that it’ll stain clothes or linen but I didn’t experience any.  The gorgeous cream is lightly scented.  To my nose, it smells like some sort of root but it’s not offensive.  After serum application allowing it to dry, I apply a thin layer of the cream to my face and neck.  Using my palms, I continuously pat for full and better absorption.  The cream makes my dry face feels hydrated with a nice healthy glow.  I’m loving it so far after a week of use and will continuously incorporate in my skincare routine. Healthy Glow
