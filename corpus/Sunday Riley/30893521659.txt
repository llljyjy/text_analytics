This brightening moisturizer provides the ideal amount of hydration, absorbs rapidly, and works wonderfully under makeup. I use it in the morning and occasionally at night, and as a result, the pigment spots on my face have nearly completely vanished. Itâ€™s an ideal brightening cream for the winter. nan
