I’m glad I got a sample because I almost bought a whole bottle. I cannot get past the smell of this, it’s awful. I’m going to try it for a few days but that’s probably all I’ll be able to handle, if it’s not magic in a bottle it won’t be worth it for me. I’m not sensitive to smells at all, but all I can smell is like… dirt and oil, that’s slightly rotten lol. I don’t even know how to describe it. If they can do something about that I’m sure it’s a good product, feels nice on the skin and didn’t take long to absorb. The Smell… ugh!
