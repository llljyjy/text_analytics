I’ve had this since late September (it’s March) and have been using it a few times a week since. I have normal type skin and I’ve noticed truly no difference to my skin and it hasn’t done anything for my acne. It hasn’t done anything negative, it’s just truly so neutral of an experience. I’m near the end of the smaller size bottle and won’t be repurchasing. 5 months of use, really no effects.
