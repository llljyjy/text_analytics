Love the texture and smell! I use this during the day or at night, it make my skin feel hydrated and plump. I usually breakout easily and this did not do that. I will continue to use and provide an update in the future. Iâ€™ve had my eye on this for quite sometime and finally pulled the plug, it was worth it! A must add on to your skincare regimen
