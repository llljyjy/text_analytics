I can’t get over the strong, sugary/sweet fragrance in this moisturizer. It lingers and is awful! This is also WAY too heavy and thick for my skin. I started breaking out within 2 days of use. It’s hard to rub in and get it to absorb no matter how little you use. Too heavy, too greasy, too much fragragrance!
