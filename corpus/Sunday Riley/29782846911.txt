Sunday Riley recently gifted me their C.E.O. 15% Vitamin C Brightening Serum. It has a really nice, light citrus scent, and is more like a  lightweight lotion than a serum. I use just a couple of pumps in the morning and evening; itâ€™s easy to apply and quickly absorbs into my skin.  After just a few weeks I am seeing incredible results: my complexion  is noticeably brighter,  and my dark circles and age spots are much more diminished.  In addition, my skin looks and feels firmer and hydrated.  This is another great product by one of my favorite brands! Great Brightening Serum!
