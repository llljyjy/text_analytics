I have been using this face oil for a week now and love having it in my morning routine. I use this after washing my face but before I put on any other serums or moisturizers. I have extremely dry skin and never found any oils to help with the hydration that I’m looking for and that my skin needs. However, I have notice that my skin doesn’t look as dull already and my skin texture has improved! I pair this with the CEO serum and I love the scent of both of them. I’d recommend this to anyone wanting to improve the brightness and texture of their skin! Fast Results
