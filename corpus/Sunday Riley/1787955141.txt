I absolutely love this cream! It is so luxurious and thick - perfect for the cold winter weather. It really plumps up my skin and brightens the tone of it. I’ve been using it every morning as part of my AM routine and my skin soaks it in. The cream does have a pretty strong earthy/herbal-y scent which may deter some people, but I don’t mind it. The cream is also a bright yellow color but I have not personally noticed any staining on my skin from it. Highly recommend! Gifted by Sunday Riley in exchange for an honest review. My skin loves this cream!
