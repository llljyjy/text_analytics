I tried this as a sample originally and fell in love. It minimizes your pores really well and gets rid of any blackheads under the skin. I have pretty sensitive skin and it doesn’t cause any irritation. I use one pump at night a few times a week and have noticed an improvement in texture. It’s pricey but no other lactic acid has performed the same in my opinion worth it
