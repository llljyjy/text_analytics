I own both the CEO serum & CEO Glow oil (2 bottles - one of the best facial oils I’ve used) and like both of them, so I was excited for this launch. I have not tried the original CEO cream, so I can’t compare them, but:I love the texture of this cream - it’s not as light as a gel cream, but not super rich either. It feels very balanced and absorbs well on my normal/combination skin. I don’t find it heavy or greasy at all. I love the bright color & find that it actually helps to see where you’ve applied (although it does sink in - it doesn’t leave your skin orange). The color helps add to the brightening effect, too. The smell is gorgeous to me, but may not be everyone’s cup of tea - it smells just like orange blossoms! Not oranges, but the floral blossoms from orange trees. It’s a naturally perfumey scent (orange blossoms are used in lots of perfumes), and I love it. This pairs wonderfully with the CEO serum & oil for PM, and does not make sunscreen pill in the AM. I find it looks quite dewy if you use it with the CEO serum, but more satin if used alone on just washed/toned skin. It also gives a similar glowy effect as glow drops/glow primer under makeup - you can see it glowing on my hand. I really like this and would repurchase. Lovely for AM & PM
