I’m a giant fan of this vitamin C cream! I love that a little goes a long way and it absorbs into my skin quickly without feeling sticky or greasy. My skin feels smoother and my skin tone looks more even. I love using this on days that I’m wearing makeup because it preps my skin beautifully for foundation. I also appreciate the quality ingredients they use! New favorite vitamin C cream
