I love this product.  I’ve been trying many of the Sunday Riley products lately with the smaller sets and have moved it all.  This oil works as well as the Clarins double serum and has the same beautiful effect on the face.  I love the glow on my mature skin and I love the smell.  I read the reviews of some who hated the smell so it’s obviously personal preference.  I recommend trying it in the store if you can.  They have all the products in display for you to sample and smell.  I combine this with the 15% vitamin c cream and my skin looks great.  I’m glad I found it.  I have sensitive skin with rosacea and my skin has done well with all the Sunday Riley products I’ve used. Love this glow
