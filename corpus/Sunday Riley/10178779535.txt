Sunday Riley has done it again with their ceo after glow brightening vitamin c moisturizer and I absolutely love it. The formulation is not too thick so it blends seamlessly into my skin without leaving residue. It has a light scent and effective ingredients to help smooth and even skin tone while minimizing pigmentation. Great formula
