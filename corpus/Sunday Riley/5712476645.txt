I’m a huge skeptic when it comes to spot treatment/masks since they rarely work for me. However! I am just LOVING this product. The smell isn’t bad at all, but the trick is! Use it as a spot corrector instead of applying it as a mask to get more bang for your buck. I use this every other night, especially when my acne feels irritated or for a quick fix if I am going out the next day. I also leave it on overnight and see a HUGE difference after I wash my face in the morning. My acne is less red and less bumpy. I will rebuy when I run out! My magic potion!
