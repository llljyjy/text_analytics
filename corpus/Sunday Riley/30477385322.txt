This CEO Afterglow cream is such a gorgeous color and rich texture. I love applying it, as it always feels luxurious on my skin. I know some people aren’t huge fans of the scent, and even though it is pretty strong, I actually really enjoy it. I’ve been using this cream for just over a week, and I don’t know that it’s really provided many results in terms of appearance (L is before, R is after) but I do like the level of hydration it provides. Giving it 3 stars because while it is a nice face cream, I haven’t really noticed any visible difference in my skin, and for this price, I need at least some results. Nice cream, just not sure if it’s $65 nice
