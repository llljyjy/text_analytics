Very thick, almost hard to spread on face.  Not a great scent, I canâ€™t see buying, especially for the money! but tried the sample.  Would not recommend for young skin or with acne.  I have mature skin and trying it as a night cream, hopefully skin will be nice in the morning! a night cream only, very thick
