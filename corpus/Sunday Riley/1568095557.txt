The smell was so unbelievably strong (and in my personal opinion, unpleasant) that I honestly couldn’t take it. I applied it twice and that’s a no for me dawg!!! Taking back. Also honestly doesn’t feel great on my skin.. it’s a bit itchy, and I don’t really have sensitive skin. Was really enjoying their night oil, so may go back to that… just shows that cost effective (but still pricey) doesn’t work when it’s the same line of products. Also, the Sephora girl told me to put the oil OVER/ON TOP OF my moisturizer.. is this true??? Worst smell ever!!
