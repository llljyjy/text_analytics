This product works so well for my weird combo skin. I have a really shiny, textured and oily forehead along with dry cheeks/chin/nose. I use this product as the last step in my night time regimen. I put a thin layer on my forehead and a pretty good amount on the rest of my face. It does a great job at sealing in the moisture, and by morning my skin feels hydrated & itâ€™s glowing! My combo skin Best friend!!
