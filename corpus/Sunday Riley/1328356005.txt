I finally found my ideal day cream for winter! This is not too heavy, absorbs quickly & feels super moisturizing. It also gives this lovely radiance that even comes through makeup, so your face has this soft-light glow about it all day! I love that it contains Vitamin C which is so important for regenerating skin, & the smell is luscious - just like fresh orange blossoms. This works beautifully under sunscreen or makeup and feels pampering. Lovely day or night, great under makeup!
