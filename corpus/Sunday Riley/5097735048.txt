C.E.O Glow has been work well for my dry skin. in the winter it’s even harder. I have been using more facial oils and finding that they do very well with helping my skin with a bit of a glow. This Sunday Riley one has been very nice to use. I like that it has key active ingredients that I know are clinically effective. This one contains a combination of vitamin C and turmeric as well as evening primrose oil. The synergy of the three really help to visibly brighten my skin and add hydration plus a little bit of a glow. I have been using this on my face and neck morning and evening for the past week. It feels good on my skin and doesn’t cause any irritation. I like that this oil can be layered with any other vitamin C product as well. This is a good one to try. Effective moisture that works for my dry skin
