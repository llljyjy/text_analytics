This was a splurge but I am happy I got it.  It’s a lovely creamy texture and rich so you don’t have to use a lot!  Was looking for a Vit C cream that could double as a moisturizer under my daily sunscreen.  This feels great on and no irritation, plus it leaves skin smooth and glowy vs greasy.  Great recommendation from the Sephora staff! nan
