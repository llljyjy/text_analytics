Iâ€™ve been using Sunday Riley B3 Nice 10% Niacinamide Serum for about 2 weeks. The thing I noticed the most was more evenness to the pinkness of my skin. Before it was more splotchy, and now it seems even. along with that my dark spots are slightly faded. I like this product. Complimentary from Sunday Riley. Nice
