Sunday Riley gifted me this product to test, honest opinions are my own.I have been a fan of the original C.E.O. moisturizer for a few years now so I was excited to try the new Afterglow formulation! I’ve been using Afterglow as my am + pm moisturizer for 2 weeks. My face absolutely feels more hydrated, radiant and smoother thanks to Afterglow. I am pleased to start and finish my days with the most radiant glow.This vitamin C and anti-oxidant rich moisturizer looks thick (and somewhat scary upon first glance of it’s bright yellow color) but isn’t greasy at all! It’s got a medium thick weight gel like texture that absorbs well into the skin and surprisingly does not stain.I love how the package comes with a scooping wand so you don’t have to dip your fingers into the container. A little scrape of product provides wonderful coverage of the face, don’t forget to apply to your neck and décolletage! Afterglow may not be for you if you are sensitive to fragrance or prefer fragrance free skincare. I don’t mind the strong herbal/floral scent from Neroli and Sweet Orange Peel Oils - my husband actually likes the smell as he finds it calming before bed. Will def be using to the last scrape out of the jar. Winning Vitamin C moisturizer for me! Glow With Me!
