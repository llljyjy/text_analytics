I’ve been using the B3 Nice 10% Niacinamide Serum for about two weeks and it’s been a good experience so far. I enjoy the lavender hue of the serum and the viscosity, it absorbs quickly into my skin. I’ve noticed that my skin feels less oily and my pores look less congested. I’ve heard that high concentrations of niacinamide can potentially irritate the skin, but I didn’t experience that at all. I haven’t noticed any major changes to my age spots, however my skin does feel calm and more balanced. Lavender goodness
