I have been using this Niacinamide Serum for almost two weeks now and it has worked wonders for me already. I have large pores and oily skin and using this serum regularly has visibly reduced the size of the pores and made my skin look less oily. I also love the fact that itâ€™s water-based and with 10% Niacinamide in it. My skin is looking more radiant and clear using this serum A must in my routine!
