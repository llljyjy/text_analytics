The beautiful packaging and pretty pink formula first caught my eye, but sadly that’s all there is to this product - just looks good as a collectible on your skincare shelf. I am definitely skincare oriented trying to take care of my skin as best as possible, so I use essences daily and was excited to switch it up with a new essence I hadn’t used before. I have had good results from other SR products I’ve used in the past, but this one was not happening for me. I literally could not feel or see any difference like I have with other essences I’ve used. I didn’t experience any adverse reactions, but definitely no positive results either. Doesn't Really Do Anything
