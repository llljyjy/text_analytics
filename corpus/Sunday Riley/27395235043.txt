This gel cream is not as light as I would hope for, like Tidal, but it does go on well. It keeps my skin moisturized and my it feels so soft,  glowy and radiant after application. It does have a very satin, but siliconey/primer finish on my skin. I think this would aid nicely in makeup application. It’s also pretty fragranced with the citrus oils, so careful if that’s not your thing. Luckily, it doesn’t bother my skin. I think I prefer CEO cream to this one, but I do love the beautiful ombré packaging! So radiant and glowy!
