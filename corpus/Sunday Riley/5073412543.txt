I paid $85 for this bottle that barely brought any product in. Felt like I used it 4 times and it was gone. Literally NOT worth it for your pockets. It does give a glowy look but you can achieve that with the oil version. You get more for your money. and cheaper  and worth the money. Not this !!! nan
