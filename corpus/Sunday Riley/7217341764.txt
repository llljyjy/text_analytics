first off, the ingredients in this are amazing!! the vitamin c was what drew me in initially and what made me want to try it. aside from that, it’s vegan. the moisturizer itself is relatively lightweight and left my skin feeling moisturized. i have hyperpigmentation from acne so i’m hoping these would minimize them in the long run. nan
