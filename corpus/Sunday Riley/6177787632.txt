The Afterglow cream is my new favorite Vitamin C skincare product! I love how lightweight it is and non-greasy, so I am able to use in the am and pm. It wears under my makeup beautifully.  I have noticed my skin texture is much smoother as well as more plump and radiant. The scent is also a big plus because some Vitamin c products donâ€™t always smell good, but this one has a light floral scent. Love!
