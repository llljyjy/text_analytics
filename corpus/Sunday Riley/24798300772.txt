I absolutely loved this eye cream for the first six months. After 6 months I started waking up with dry flakes all over. I swear it gave me more lines. I am so disappointed. I loved it at first, it helped my dark circles, puffiness and fine lines. I use to wake up with bright eyes no matter how much salt or sleep I had the night before. Sadly, I will not re purchase. Worked for 6 months then gave me lines.
