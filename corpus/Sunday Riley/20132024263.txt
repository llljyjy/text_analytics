Do NOT use if you’ve ever had acne, or acne prone skin. I havent had pimples/acne in 15 years without using any acne care products. I thought I didn’t have to worry about acne anymore. Wrong. I have super dry sensitive skin, which is why I tried this. My forehead is now covered in countless little bumps. Theyre also red and irritated. Tbis is tragic. AVOID if you have sensitive/acne prone skin
