I have been using Good Genes for over 2 years and love it for keeping my skin healthy, fresh and quickly eliminating breakouts. Seriously, feel a pimple coming on? Apply GG and it’s like the breakout is blocked from fully forming. I recommend this product to anyone I know who complains about a breakout - because it actually works! Yes, it’s expensive. I was apprehensive initially too because I had extremely bad acne in my teens and have tried so many products, even prescription medications, that never really worked. But GG is so worth it to maintain clear, healthy skin. Some reviews have commented on certain batches having bad smells or making skin overly dry... That has never been my experience. It has a soft lemon smell and the texture is thin and allows you to cover a good size surface area with just a pump or two. I apply after washing and toner. A plus! The BEST for breakouts.
