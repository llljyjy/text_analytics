Before I start my review, I’d like to applaud Sunday Riley for including such soothing and calming ingredients in this serum. For starters, I HATEDDDD the packaging :(. I’m not sure why but just after using this once, I started seeing crusties form around the rim of the bottle. Also, the dropper would leave so easily without even applying any pressure to it which caused it to leak a lot. While I did have high hopes for this serum, unfortunately, it did little to nothing for me. I did not see any brightening to my face and my dark spots were just as they were before: dark. I don’t have oily skin so I can’t speak for this controlling shine but from what I could tell oily skin gals would enjoy this more. Overall, for a product, I’ve been using for more than 2 weeks I expected better especially since I’m halfway done. nan
