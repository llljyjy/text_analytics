I have acne prone skin with some dark spots so I’ve been on a hunt for a product like this that can target my effected areas. I’ve been using this products for over 3 weeks now and I can say I’ve seen such a difference in my pores. My pores look smaller and my some of my dark spots have faded. I like the formula of this serum, which is water based because it quickly absorbs into my skin I don’t have to wait to long for it to dry. You need this!
