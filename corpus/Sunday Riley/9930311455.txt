Ooo where do I start. I LOVE this product. Super moisturizing and very rich in quality. A little goes a long way but it literally glides on your skin. After using my skin feels so moisturized. Smells really good but the scent is super strong. Not perfuming. More of a citrus smell. I love the color, itâ€™s super bright. Leaves my skin so radiant. LOVEEEEE
