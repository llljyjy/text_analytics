I have normal to slightly combo skin. I was looking for a face oil to a) mix into my moisturizer to provide a more “lumie“ glow and NOT break me out or b) act as a “capstone“ on my skin routine to lock in my essences and serums. I love that this oil doesn’t have any real actives in it - it just is an antioxidant packed oil that adds additional moisture and glowiness to the skin. This face oil is not sticky and the bottle is really pretty! Although I think the price is worth it for what I’m getting, I do think there are probably less expensive options out there for you if you’re just looking for a face oil without actives. Great as a luminous mixer in moisturizer
