I received this product as a gift from Sunday Riley. I’ve tried other oils from them so I knew to expect a product with a strong smell and one that really sits on the skin. Even after using a moisturizer I feel like it leaves my skin pretty oily for awhile. Not necessarily a bad thing, just something to keep in mind. My skin is generally sensitive to vitamin C products so I only use this at night. I’ve used it for the last week and half and have noticed my skin is visibility brighter. I tried using on my neck as well but had a bad reaction so I now only use it on my face. I would be careful putting it on your neck if you are sensitive to vitamin C products like me. nan
