Man, I decided to splurge and remember liking this cleanser when this line first came out. I didn’t realize the formula and packaging changed. It’s nothing like I remember and is more of a gel consistency than a clay based cleanser. The packaging is so cheap especially at this price point. It got really gross and mildewy like no other cleanser container I’ve ever had before. So disappointed at the quality. boooo..
