I absolutely love this product!   I’ve been using it for two weeks and feel like the quality of my skin is quite improved.  Niacinamide is a staple in my routine and this brand did a great job with the formula-works great with my sensitive skin.The packaging is fabulous and the tint is cool (a subtle purple to complement the design).  It also has a great consistency that my skin eats up so quickly!  For me, niacinamide never really leaves a dewy effect and it’s the same for this brand. However, I think that has more to do with my skin type which is quite dry.  I use this every day and am so happy to have had the opportunity to try it!  This is my first Sunday Riley product and I’m so excited to add to the collection Supple, clearing skin
