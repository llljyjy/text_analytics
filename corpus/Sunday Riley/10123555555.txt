I actually love the way this oil feels! It’s officially the Vitamin c that my routine was missing but now has. It’s an interesting oil as I don’t feel like it leaves your skin feeling oily and I want to say if feels like it absorbs pretty well. I feel like it’s an added step my skin actually needed it leaves my skin looking and feeling healthy and glowy. I also really like the ingredients in this. Nice vitamin c product.
