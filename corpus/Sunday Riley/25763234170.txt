I am a big fan of vitamin c, so I was excited to try this moisturizer out. I think that this does a good job at hydrated my skin, I am combo skin type so I don’t need something that is super heavy. I do think my skin has a nice glow to it in the morning after using. I will continue to use it and hopefully it’ll continue to improve my skin texture. nan
