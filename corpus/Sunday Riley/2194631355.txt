My biggest skin woe is enlarged pores. I’ve tried different serums and it’s sometimes hit or miss. This B3 Nice serum by Sunday Riley works wonders. I’ve noticed the pores on my face have drastically diminished which I’m so happy about and also my skin has an overall nicer texture. I highly recommend it! Thanks for the gift. Awesome
