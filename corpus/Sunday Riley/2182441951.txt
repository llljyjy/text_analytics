I think I am now on my 8th bottle of Good Genes that I purchased with my own money.  I have tried almost every other lactic acid from high-end to drug store.  Nothing compares to this product, it has to be the other ingredients in this formula.  Even my 10 year old son told me my face feels so soft and smooth.  That was after I put this back into my routine.  Seriously, wonderful product. Great results with texture (I use it daily).  I will not go without Sunday Riley Good Genes. Best lactic acid treatment!
