I haven’t used this long enough to speak on long term benefits but first impressions…wow. This stuff feels luxurious from the packaging to the texture to the scent. I’ve used tons and tons of moisturizers and this one impressed me how perfect the moisturize/hydration balance is. Because of how nourishing it’s feels and the vitamin c, I think it’s especially perfect for minimal routine days where I just want to throw in a hydrating serum, moisturizer and keep it pushin. It gives you a bit of an immediate glow as well. nan
