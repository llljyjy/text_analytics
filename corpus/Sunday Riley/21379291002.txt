I normally don’t have problem skin but as of recent, I have been having issues of dry skin especially under where my mask sits. My skin is definitely the type to breakout when it’s dry. I went in looking for a daily moisturizer and came out with this on a whim. I applied a generous amount morning and night for maybe two days and my skin is completely transformed. My pores are almost nonexistent, my skin is glowing, and baby smooth soft. omg I love it
