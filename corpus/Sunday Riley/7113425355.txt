I purchased this to go along with my jade roller and it said the best thing to use the jade roller with is oil. I couldn’t be happier with the Sunday Riley C.E.O Glow Vitamin C + Tumeric face oil. It says you can use both morning and evening and I thought that it would be too much, but it’s not at all. I don’t have dry skin I have combination skin and this product makes my skin feel luxurious and some days I just do my skin regimen and don’t wear any makeup at all. My skin looks great. Purchase this you won’t be disappointed. my new go to for my skin regimen.
