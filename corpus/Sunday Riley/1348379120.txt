I’ve only been using this for 4 days but I have seen great results. I don’t have acne but I do get hormonal breakouts on my chin and I recently had a facial that has my chin purging so this was recommended. The smell is very earthy, like basil and moss. It does go away after a minute or two and I do like earthy scents so that’s not a dealbreaker, but if you’re sensitive to scents or really hate earthy/herbal scents, you might not like this. My chin breakout is slowly clearing up and the pores on my nose and cheek area are almost nonexistent. This really does make my face look clearer and it’s non drying. A little goes a long way, so 3 drops in the AM and PM will do So Far So Good!
