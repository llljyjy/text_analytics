This is not a miracle product but it WORKS! I’ve used this product for 3 years straight now, and earlier this month I stopped using it (all in all, stopped for around 3 weeks). I had been dealing with a breakout and for some reason I thought it might be my SR UFO. Oh ho ho was I wrong! My skin has rapidly declined, for the first time in ages I was getting clogged pores and tiny little irritating whitehead pimples around my nose and between my eyebrows. I mean ALL over. Ultimately I started using it again and everything cleared right up. I had a really poor diet (around the holidays), and hit my time off the month and I suspect that’s what actually caused my breakout. I will never doubt this oil again!Like I said, this is not a miracle product, but used in conjunction with a healthy skincare routine it is a wonderful, clearing product and I would highly recommend! 10/10 3 Years Later! Still LOVE
