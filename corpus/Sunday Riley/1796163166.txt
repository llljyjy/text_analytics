ICE is the only moisturizer I’ll now buy. it’s perfect. Definitely makes skin baby soft--noticeable difference. And, I can’t describe the heavenly smell. It smells like ice--not a fragrance, though, which I would be allergic to. Don’t be put off by the price. A little bit goes a long way. I use it in the summer, too, but most of you would love it for winter or a nighttime cream. I have super dry skin. Dry Skin Heaven!
