I received the Sunday Riley C.E.O. Glow Vitamin C & Turmeric Face Oil complimentary. The scent  may be a tad off putting for some. I personally did not mind it. It dissipated after a few minutes. My skin absorbed this oil fairly quickly. It left a beautiful glow on my skin yet I didn’t feel oily. I’ve only been using it for about 2 weeks so I cannot wait to see the results in a months time.
