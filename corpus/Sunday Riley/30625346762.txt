I’ve used this for about a week now and I’m really impressed. This is my first experience with a Sunday Riley product so I wasn’t sure that to expect. I use this moisturizer in the AM (it’s fine to use at night-I just have a different PM routine) and it sits really well with my makeup and other AM skincare products. It instantly gives my face a great radiance and plumpness. It’s already greatly improved my overall skin tone and texture. Gifted by Sunday Riley. Love this
