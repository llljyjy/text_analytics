I’ve always heard good things about Sunday Riley, so was excited to try this. The packaging was very luxe feeling, and I love the size of the dropper and how much control you have over how much comes out (very little comes out per squeeze). The scent, as others have mentioned, is a bit spa-like, and I found it to be a strong herbal smell that I didn’t particularly like. It was a bit intense to have on my face, especially at night when I am more sensitive to scents while trying to sleep.This certainly improved radiance and brightness in my skin, but almost too much. I have oily to combination skin that has been drier due to the winter weather, but this was too oily for my liking. I was only able to stand using it a few times before giving up. It’s just too strongly scented, and I believe it made me break out. If I use just a tiny amount it is more bearable, but that doesn’t really give me the glowing effects I wanted from this. I think it would work out better for drier skin types that are not acne prone whatsoever.This product was gifted in exchange for my honest review. nan
