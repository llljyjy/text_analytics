Sunday Riley so kindly gifted me this serum to try! I really love it so far. I have sensitive, redness-prone combination skin and this is such a good serum for that skin type. The niacinamide helps with my redness and helps reduce my oiliness. Itâ€™s very calming and feels nice on my skin. Great for combo, sensitive skin!
