This oil is really nice. It gives a natural glow and it doesn’t make my skin feel sticky. I can put products on top of it without any issues. I only use a few drops for my face and neck. I love that it has vitamin C and tumeric to help brighten the skin. I have dark spots so I’m looking forward to see how my spots fade over time. It also has jojoba oil which gives a protective barrier that keeps moisture in the skin. I use it in the morning and at night. I think it’s easy to incorporate into a skincare routine. Natural glow
