I was really excited about this product but then I wanted to return it... I decided to stick with it and have seen some visible brightness in my skin after a week of use. Pros - Purchased for 50% off Not as irritating as other highly concentrated vitamin C products Doesn’t burnSaw a significant improvement to skin brightness after a few days. Cons -I wouldn’t pay full price for this product when I can mix vitamin C into other products myself and it’s much cheaper. -the orange smell make it feel cheap to me-my skin peels/sloughs off if I use this under makeup or with any silicone products nan
