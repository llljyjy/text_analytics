I love this vitamin c cream!! I’ve been using this every morning for about a week and I’ve already noticed such a big difference in my skin. My texture feels more smooth and I’ve already noticed some brightening in my skin, making my skin glow. This cream has such a nice texture and beautiful color that absorbs quickly into my skin. There is a very strong fragrance to this cream, which I don’t mind but if you have sensitive skin or don’t like string fragrance you might not like this one! Must have for bright, glowy skin!
