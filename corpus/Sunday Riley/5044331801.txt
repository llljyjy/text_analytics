I honestly really like this so far - to start, it’s just pretty lol. It’s a milky lavender serum that isn’t too thick or watery and doesn’t really have much of a scent. I’ve been struggling lately with breaking out from trying tretinoin and so I have active spots and healing redness. I’ve used this both day and night after my essence and before moisturizing and haven’t had irritation issues, or issues with my makeup pilling afterwards. My skin is typically on the drier end so I haven’t noticed many differences there, but the serum feels nice on the skin without making me more oily and I do think it is reducing some redness gradually. I’m going to keep using and see how it goes as my skin settles. complimentary from Sunday Riley Looks and feels nice
