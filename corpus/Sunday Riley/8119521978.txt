I was gifted by Sunday Riley! I have extremely sensitive skin but have been wanting to incorporate niacinamide into my skincare routine to help with redness and skin texture. When I initially used this, I had a breakout on my cheeks, but it cleared up within a week and a half. Now my skin is looking better than before— I do feel like my pores are minimized, and I have slight reduced redness overall. Best of all, my skin wasn’t irritated by this! I am not sure if the results are significant enough to justify the price though. The dropper is also faulty— the serum leaks out without squeezing at all, and as a result, the serum has gotten all over the bottle. It’s still usable but just a little annoying! My pics show my skin after the first few days of usage then about 2 weeks after. nan
