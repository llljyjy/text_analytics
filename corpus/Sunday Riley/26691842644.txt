This serum is lightweight.. The consistency is just right, not too thick and not too watery.. The color is like lightly purplish.. This serum soothes and calm my skin, it also helps me lighten my dark pimple marks.. It absorbs nicely and kinda feels hydrating..This product doesnâ€™t sting on my dry and a little bit sensitive skin.. It doesn't sting!
