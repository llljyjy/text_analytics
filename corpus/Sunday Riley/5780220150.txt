I do like that it is niacinamide product. I find that they work better when my skin in helping remove my post acne dark spots. I really would like to see how much further it’ll take my skin because I do have some dark spots. I need to even out my skin tone and I wanna do it as soon as possible and I think this product it’s gonna be really good for it. Must try
