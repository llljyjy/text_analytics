Sunday Riley has hit another home run with this one! I generally use this about 4 times a week, rotating with Retin-A, and I love the results. I have extremely hormonal, acne-prone skin and have had no issues with breakouts while using this. And, yes, it is pricey; however, a bottle lasts FOREVER!! Well worth the splurge! Worth the splurge!!
