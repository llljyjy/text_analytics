I started with a sample of this product and then purchased the mini size. I can’t believe how much I love it! While the scent turns some people off, I actually like the herbal scent. I feel the oil is both nurturing and healing for my skin, which is a bit tumultuous at the moment. At 49, I’m dealing with more sensitivity and dryness than ever before and am turning to facial oils for help. While the Saint Jane Luxury Beauty Serum is a bit heavy for daytime use, it’s perfect for using before bed. I love that it has full-spectrum CBD and botanicals—plus it’s cruelty-free. I just finished my first bottle, which lasted quite a long time, and will need to repurchase another to get through our Midwestern winter. Love this luxurious serum. A must-have for winter!
