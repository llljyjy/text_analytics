Very easily became my favorite spf on the planet. I am super picky with sunscreen and have been alternating between Biossance and Saie. Saint Jane has completely removed Saie from my sunscreen routine. I was using Saie because of the mild tint that applied sheer. However it is extremely oily and has a terrible smell. I altered my morning routine so that I could use Saie without my skin being too oily. But when I switched over to SJ I didn’t need to alter my routine at all. It has the perfect natural finish. So in conjunction with my routine I get a beautiful natural dewy look rather than an oil slick. It absorbs beautifully into the skin. It has a light and silky smooth texture. An unbelievable fragrance. The light tint leaves no residue and works great on all skin tones. I had a small breakout a few weeks ago that was caused by eating dairy and it left scars on my face. The scars were taking a while to go away even with additional treatments. I’m convinced that this spf helped with repairing my skin and reducing the scarring. A week after daily use, those scars quickly started to fade away. And any remaining pimples I had started disappearing. Although this product does not advertise that, the ingredients such as jasmine, green tea, and desert rose are all known for helping reduce acne and scarring. Everything else in my routine did not change when I started using this which is why I feel this is what helped my skin. I also use this before applying my Bareminerals tinted moisturizer and it helps grip that onto my skin well and has minimal transfer into my mask. This product does so much for my skin I will never give it up. It also gives great moisture without being greasy which is why the Saie will not be repurchased. I can touch my face after application and have no residue or oil on my hands. I’m convinced this wasn’t made my cosmetic chemists but a powerful sorceress It’s literally a magical elixir in a bottle
