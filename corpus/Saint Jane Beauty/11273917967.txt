I’m loving this product! It gives me such a flawless canvas to work with when doing my makeup. I love the texture of it, it’s not that silicone type primer it’s more light cream. My favorite feature about this product is that it’s a moisturizer, SPF, and primer all in one! So you’re oily you don’t have to add so many layers of different products and if your dry the moisturizer is hydrating enough and because the texture of more a cream not silicone it works amazingly with your skin type too. Amazing product!
