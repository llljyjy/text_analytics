This sunscreen has such a nice consistency, it’s a bit like mouse texture that blends really easily. It can double as a makeup primer too! It doesn’t feel heavy or sticky on the skin and there is no white cast either. It has a light floral scent that is not too overpowering. I wish the SPF was higher since I feel like SPF 30 would not be enough for daily wear, maybe only on days I stay indoors. Also I noticed applying too much would cause it to pill. nan
