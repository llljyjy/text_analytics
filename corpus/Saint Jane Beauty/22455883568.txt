it’s like a dry-ish putty type texture, blends in so well and comfortably sits on skin. doesn’t leave that gross ghostly white cast, it does add a bit of yellow to your face so it will make your face appear lighter but it’s not as horrid as the milky white cast that majority of spf leave behind. i absolutely loathe sunscreen so when i tell you this one is great, believe me lol love this spf
