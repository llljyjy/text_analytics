I have oily/combination skin and have been on the lookout for multi-functional skin products. This sunscreen doubles as a primer/moisturizer and has been a great addition to my daily routine. Under foundation, my skin looks so much more poreless and wears decently throughout the day. definitely worth a try and would recommend! nan
