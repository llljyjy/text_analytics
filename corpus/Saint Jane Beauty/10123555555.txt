This is hands down a new favorite among mineral sunscreens and maybe even chemical. The formula is soothing to the skin, not greasy, lightweight, and I experienced no cast. It goes on the skin really smooth and does have a bit of a blurring/mattifying effect for those no makeup days. I often find myself wearing just this and mascara. The sunscreen itself has a tan color to it which I feel helps it really blend into the skin seamlessly. I also haven’t experienced any issues wearing it under makeup and so far no piling. I’m definitely a fan! Phenomenal luxury sunscreen.
