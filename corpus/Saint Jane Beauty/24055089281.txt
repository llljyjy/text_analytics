I’ve tried a few things from Saint Jane and haven’t been disappointed. I was a little nervous when I first opened this up and squeezed it onto my face because of the yellow color as most sunscreens usually leave a white cast on my olive and tanner complexion as an ethnic woman, I was still glad I tried it because there was no sign of cast anywhere to be found! I don’t have large pores so I can’t say much about that, but my skin definitely feels smoother and moisturized. It did seem to blur out some imperfections, of course not completely, so I’m happy to say that this worked great for me and my blemish prone/oiler skin. It’s honestly a good multi-tasking sunscreen that I would wear every day and for the price, you can’t beat it! I was REALLY surprised in this product, and I will be using it more! I haven’t tested it under makeup but the way it feels, I think it would work beautifully! I’m impressed! Ethnic Olive Skin Sunscreen Approved!
