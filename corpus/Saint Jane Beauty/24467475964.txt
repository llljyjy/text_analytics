Firstly, the packaging was enough to swoon over. But I cannot say enough good things about the effectiveness of this cream! The texture, the light scent, the absorbency, the GLOW! On top of all, it calms my cheeks when they are flushed from mild rosacea. Iâ€™ve been using it for about a month and I can tell a difference in the tone and texture of my skin, as well as overall softness. Such a beautiful and well-balanced night cream! Keeping it as my secret weapon for glowy, soft skin! Love this addition to my nightly ritual and will definitely be buying again, although I think this pot will last me quite a bit longer. heavenly. does all that it says & more!
