After using this product a few times I’m hooked. I never heard of Saint Jane until I tried these samples and now I can’t get enough. I’m definitely going to need a bigger bottle.  The multi-use product is perfect for traveling as it’s a Moisturizer, Primer and Sunscreen. It’s a triple threat staple that doesn’t leave you looking ghostly. It provides an additional glow without being greasy. And it smells nice. It’s Tinted but quickly absorbed and becomes translucent. The packaging is beautiful too. I didn’t really notice a difference in my Pore size but with my skin protected and moisturized, that didn’t matter. I’m a woman of color with combination skin. My skin is also sensitive. I did not experience any adverse reactions. Tripe Threat
