This feels like a luxurious daily face moisturizer and not like sunscreen - which is my ultimate goal when looking for a product like this to use every day. From it’s amazing smell - which made me think of a boulangerie - to it’s perfect and light texture, this is a great product. Plus it doesn’t feel thick on your hands after applying. I also love the sleek black packaging which adds to the whole experience!If you’re looking for a new daily SPF moisturizer - and truth is we all need one - check this one out. Great, Lightweight, Lux Daily Moisturizer with SPF
