Where has this sunscreen been all my life?! This sunscreen is ahhh-mazing and then some!!! It has a tint to it so it’s really nice that there IS NO WHITE CAST over here since I’m already a ghost. It feels so silky and even hydrating because it was soaking in before I finished even rubbing it in! It does have a slight fragrance but it’s not bothersome in the slightest and I’m very sensitive to fragrances. You can tell this was so thought out and I’m so happy I got to try it out. I was able to try this out thanks to Saint Jane Beauty in exchange for my honest. This blurs pores, acts as a primer, moisturizer, and sunscreen in one. Like hello?! Holy grail!!I give it a 12/10 and will definitely be repurchasing when I run out. I literally recommend this to every and anyone. I also never burned when I had this on so there is something in here that besides the SPF 30 that is different than other sunscreens. It’s not sticky, no white cast like I said, and no burning sensation! It’s inspired by sun worshipping desert rose, hibiscus, and jasmine’s resiliency against UV rays, heat and environmental stressors. nan
