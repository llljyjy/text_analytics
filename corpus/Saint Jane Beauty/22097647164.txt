Ever since moving to California, I quickly realized that using sunscreen is quite important. I really like this sunscreen because not only does it work well for my skin, it leaves my skin feeling silky. I’ve struggled with eczema throughout my life and it gets worse during the summer, I noticed when I use this sunscreen, I don’t get flare ups on my arms when I go outside from the sun. nan
