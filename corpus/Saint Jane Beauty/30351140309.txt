First, off this sunscreen smells AMAZING. Next as a woman of color there are so many sunscreens that leave a white cast on my skin but NOT this one. This says pore smoothing and they weren’t lying. It filled my pores and when I tell you that my skin was so soft and smooth after I applied this. I couldn’t stop touching my face that’s how amazing my face felt. Definitely will be adding this to my skincare routine for sure Definitely a MUST have
