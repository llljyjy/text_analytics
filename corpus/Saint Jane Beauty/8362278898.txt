OH. MY. GOD. I have used many well-known night creams before (what I can only assume is) divine intervention lead me to Saint Jane’s beauty, and while the previous creams did their job, none had given me that je ne sais quoi that I had been in desperate search for. Enter Sacred Sleep Overnight Repair. The packaging is so enchanting and luxurious, it really immerses you in the complete skin-pampering experience. My skin concerns aren’t anything major; I am valiantly fighting the lines of aging, I have dark circles under my eyes, and my skin is prone to dryness. Due to the retinol in this cream, I anticipated some purging at the beginning of my use, and I am happy to say that I experienced none!!!! I am just in awe over how gorgeous my skin looks now, after two weeks of consistent usage at bedtime. For the first time ever, I understand and see what it means for your skin to look “energized“. My skin is so bright, clear, and an even, glowing tone; no discolorations, however miniscule, appear anywhere on this gorgeous face. My skin looks and feels so soft and refreshed, and the lines around my eyes have diminished greatly. The cream itself is a pretty lavender (or should I say violet!?) color, but it does not transfer that hue to your face. The smell is very herbal and light, not unbearable. Sorry this is such a  long review, I am just absolutely in love with this product and could probably write a huge collection of love poems on it! I feel like I’m leaving out more information, but really all you need to know is that it is worth every single penny, and you are only hurting yourself if you don’t buy this immediately!!! I will forever buy this product and my goal for 2022 is to try ALL of Saint Jane’s products!! Truly sacred!!
