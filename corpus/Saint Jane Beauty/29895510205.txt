This is an AMAZING sunscreen. I have tried different sunscreens and this one is by far the best. It leaves my skin so soft and gives me that blurred look I love. I have combination skin so I go from looking matte in the morning to oily later in the day so this product has definintly helped to prolong the oily phase. If you are looking for a sunscreen that is lightweight and leaves your skin so soft and blurry your pores this is the sunscreen for you. I highly recommend it. And the price point is great.
