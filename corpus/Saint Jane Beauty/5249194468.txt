Wow! Is all that comes to mind when I applied this sunscreen and rubbed it into my skin. This Saint Jane sunscreen is all that it’s hyped up to be. It blended so beautifully on my brown skin and the scent is very pleasant and luxurious. It did a great job at smoothing out the skin texture and prepping for makeup if you decide to apply. Overall I’m very pleased & would highly recommend. This deserves all 5 Stars
