I love this sunscreen! It goes on so smoothly, you can hardly tell you have anything on and NO white cast! I was surprised to see the shade of the sunscreen (yellowish tint), but it works SO well! It works beautifully under makeup as well-another huge plus! Safe to say I have fallen in love with this product and cannot be without it. *gifted, but opinions are my own A must have!
