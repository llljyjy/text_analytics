Sacred Sleep Overnight Repair is the 6th product I have tried from Saint Jane Beauty (I’m slightly obsessed). I wasn’t certain what to expect as I have never used products with retinol. This formula has a very subtle scent and feels surprisingly light on the skin. I have been applying this cream to my forehead, fine lines near my eyes and to my neck before bed 3-4 times a week. I have sensitive skin and thought that I may experience stinging or dryness but I haven’t. Sacred Sleep leaves my skin feeling baby soft and super hydrated! nan
