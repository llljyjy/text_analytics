This is a new brand for me, but why not give it a try? It comes out looking thick, but it is super easy to blend and leave NO white cast! i love this mineral spf gives me a natural finish. The best part is the clean formula and reef safe. It is pretty lightweight, and I love the subtle floral scent. nan
