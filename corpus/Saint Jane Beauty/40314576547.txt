I love this Pore Ritual with sunscreen, it is not a heavy product, it leaves my skin very light and non-greasy, and with a very soft texture, it can also be used in the skincare routine before makeup, and protects the skin from rays uv, without a doubt it is a product that I recommend 100% and that shouldnâ€™t be missing in your makeup. This can't be missing in your skin routine!
