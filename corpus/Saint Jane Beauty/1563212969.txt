I decided to try a few Saint Jane products during the recent sale and I just received my products this morning. I bought this cream, the c drops, and the new retinol night cream. I immediately used this cream in my morning routine and fell in love instantly. The consistency was more watery and emulsion like, which I absolutely loved. It didn’t feel heavy at all even with my 5 layers of other products (yep). The scent was a very natural and clean herbal smell that I didn’t think would offend anyone. This is going to become a staple item I repeatedly purchase during sales for sure. It’s just so much better than many creams at a similar or even higher price point. BEAUTIFUL EMULSION
