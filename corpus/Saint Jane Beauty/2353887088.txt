This sunscreen is amazing! The packaging is cute. Leaves your skin feeling hydrated and glowing perfect for a day at the beach or to layer on makeup. This has you covered. It is non oily, easily absorbed by the skin and does not leave a white cast. Oh and did I mention it smells amazing. It is light and pleasant smell of Jasmine. Highly recommend! amazing!!!
