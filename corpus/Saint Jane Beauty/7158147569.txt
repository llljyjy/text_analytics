This is a really nice sunscreen! I am always slightly scared to try new sunscreens because I am dark-skinned (Fenty 480). However, I was pleasantly surprised! It blends into the skin very well, and leaves behind a nice glow on the skin. I didnâ€™t see a huge difference in the way my pores looked with it on, but it looked great under my makeup. Pleasantly Surprised!
