I’ve always had trouble finding a daily sunscreen that didn’t make my skin feel greasy or heavy, specially a mineral one. This SPF if lightweight, applies SO SMOOTHLY and leaves the skin feeling soft, hydrated and GLOWING! Even thought it’s not meant to provide coverage it blurs my pores and imperfections so I can skip my foundation on really hot summer days which I love! My search is finally over!! TRY THIS NOW!!!!!!
