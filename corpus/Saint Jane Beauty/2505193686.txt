The Luxury Sun Ritual is the best thing I never knew I needed. It is so much more than just an SPF. It is an all-in-one product that I use every day. My skin is typically very sensitive. This is the first pore blending product that I have tried that I can use daily without risking a slew of unsightly breakouts. I have been a devout fan of many of the Saint Jane products for the past two years. I am unable to pick one favorite product, but this sunscreen has officially made it into my top three favorites alongside their Luxury Beauty Serum and the C-Drops Vitamin C Brightening Serum. If you are looking for a quick way to freshen up your look while protecting your skin from the sun, look no further. My daily routine takes less than five minutes and I love the way my skin looks and feels. Don’t hesitate, get yours today. You’ll thank me later:) Summer’s new best friend
