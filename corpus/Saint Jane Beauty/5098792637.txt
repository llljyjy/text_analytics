I really adore how smoothing this is! It gives the perfect canvas if you wanted to apply makeup on top. The color I will admit did scare me as it’s lighter but it really does blend in so well! I didn’t experience any white casts. The product also thankfully doesn’t have an overwhelming sunscreen smell. This has become my go to for sunscreen! No white cast.
