I bought two of these because I need this gloss with me all the time - one for my desk and one in my makeup bag.   Gloss doesnâ€™t even do this product justice - its more like a balm, treatment and high shine gloss in one magic tube!  My lips feel and look better with each use and I love the barely-there color!  So HAPPY it is now at Sephora.   I hope they start to sell all the shades....cause they are all divine One is not enough!
