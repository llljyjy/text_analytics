This is my favorite face sunscreen of all time. I, like many others, have been on the search for the sunscreen that ticks all of my boxes and this is it. It does not leave a white cast, it’s reef-safe, the scent is lovely, blends beautifully into skin, gives a “my skin but better“ effect that is natural to dewy, it doesn’t pill over skincare or under makeup. This product doesn’t claim to improve skin in any way, but my skin has absolutely improved since I started using this. I have fewer breakouts and the texture/tone of my skin has evened out. The only thing that would make this product better would be a higher SPF. I still highly recommend and will continue using this indefinitely. The Best Face Sunscreen
