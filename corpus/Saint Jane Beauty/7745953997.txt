For reference, I am in my mid 40s, I have normal to dry skin in winter and normal to combination in summer. I have fine lines and wrinkles, enlarged pores and hyperpigmentation. I always use sunscreen (not in the past, therefore the hyperpigmentation and probably most of the wrinkles) so it needs to work well. I heard good opinions in BIC so I needed to try it.PROSBeautiful texture: It looks thick but it isn’t. It spreads so effortlessly and beautifully over the skin. Physical sunscreen: it has 10% Zinc Oxide, which is a very nice amount for a mineral sunscreen.No white cast: this formula does not leave a white cast. It has a light tint to it, but it is invisible after spreading. It may show up in darker skin tones though, but it is so light that probably won’t.It is a hydrating formula with natural finish, that didn’t make my skin look shiny at the end of the day.It works great with my skincare and under my makeup, not peeling off.It blurs the pores appearance: it doesn’t make them disappear but it helped my pores to look less visible.It smells so good! I love the scent of this sunscreen. It comes from some of the extracts in the formula, because it doesn’t have added perfume. Gorgeous packaging: it comes in a beautifully designed bottle. I love how luxurious it looks.Clean at SephoraReef safeCONSThe price. It is expensive but it is so good! I purchased it during Sephora Savings Event to make it a little more affordable. It is worth it though.It is best for dry to combo skin. For those with oily skin, this may be too moisturizing.I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador. Gorgeous!!!
