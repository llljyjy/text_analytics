I’ve been using this as my primary sunscreen for the past two weeks and I’ve been loving my results so far! It’s lightly tinted, which is great for giving a flawless complexion and erasing any redness, and really smooths out my pores! I love how bouncy and bright my skin looks after using this. It also makes a great makeup primer! Great for blurring pores!
