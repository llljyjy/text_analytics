This product is great, I know it’s marketed towards women but men need great products as well.  I appreciate that this product serves more then one purpose as it’s moisturizing, pore smoothing and a sunscreen.  I noticed that my pores on my nose were noticeably smaller which tends to be the one problem area on my face.  Typically, sunscreen products leave a white cast on my skin but this product doesn’t leave anything but a silky smooth texture that isn’t overly glossy or oily.  I would recommend this cream to anyone as it simply works and makes the skincare routine way simpler.  Healthy skin is beautiful skin :) A SKINCARE STAPLE
