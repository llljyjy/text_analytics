So, I’m not gonna lie I’ve been testing this product for a solid week now and I’m actually really impressed by how moisturizing and a white cast free the sunscreen is! I am a massive fan of CBD products and this is actually my first product I’ve ever tried by this specific brand, but I must say I’m definitely impressed, in the photo you can see the sunscreen layered under my tinted moisturizer and my cream bronzer and that’s it! This stuff smells nice, I’m not necessarily sure about the soothing properties of this product but it’s definitely a very nice moisturizing option for people like me who can only wear mineral sunscreens! I would give it 4.5 out of five stars! :-) nan
