It can be hard finding a sunscreen that does not give a cast when you have melanin in your skin. I’ve purchased many sunscreens that make my skin look white after use. But this pore smoothing SPF 30  from Saint Jane does not do that at all! My skin feels so incredibly soft after use and I love that it’s a primer, moisturizer & sunscreen in one! This product is going with me on vacation next week! Melanin Skin APPROVED!
