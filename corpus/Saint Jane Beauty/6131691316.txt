This is such a nice serum but there’s definitely a learning curve to using it. The high percentage of vitamin c makes this incredibly effective. I made the rookie mistake of adding it into my routine without thinking of the percentage increase from my last serum so I did experience some sensitivity initially but it went away after about a week. The formulation also feels a little odd initially because it’s more of an oil than a serum but I have oily skin and didn’t have any issues with the oil absorbing into my skin or being any greasier during the day. This serum has done so much for reducing my skin texture and any acne pigmentation and even as I’m reaching the end of the bottle, it’s still stable with no oxidization or changes. The only thing I’m hesitant about is the price. This is definitely a luxury serum, the packaging is beautiful and feels expensive, the serum is really effective and shows results quickly so if you have the money or want to splurge then I’d say go for it. I’m still not sure how often I’ll repurchase knowing there are other serums that are just as effective but cost less and just take a little longer for results. nan
