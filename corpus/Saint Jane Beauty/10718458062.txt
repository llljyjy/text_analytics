In love with this product!  At first , I thought the price was steep but this replaces other products in my routine.  This primer/spf/moisturizer is not at all greasy on the skin and feels hydrating on the skin.  My foundation wore well for 12 hours with this primer.  Cannot say enough good things about this product!  Iâ€™m sharing before, after and complete makeup look using this product. Best makeup/skincare hybrid product this year!
