I’m constantly try out different sunscreens, trying to find the next best one and I can’t really believe I’m saying it but I think I have here...If I did a blind test, I would have no idea this was a sunscreen but instead a really silky, hydrating and luxurious moisturizer. There is literally zero white cast, it’s not even about massaging it in until there’s no white cast as with most othe sunscreens, there is no white cast from the get go!The formula is so lightweight and silky feeling on you skin. It sinks right in and leaves my look looking smooth and radiant.So happy I discovered this gem! Game changer!
