After using this product for about 2 weeks I have not stopped. I love this as a sunscreen and as a primer before applying makeup. It really helps blur my pores and gives me smooth makeup application. It is lightweight and does not leave me looking oily or greasy. I will never go back to my old sunscreen. New favorite in my routine!
