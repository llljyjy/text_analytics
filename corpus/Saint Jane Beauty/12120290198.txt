I’ve had my eye on this sunscreen for a while and quickly added the gwp promo size to my cart when it was available. This is my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador of the gwp sample as well as the full size that I purchased direct from the brand (it was sold out at Sephora for the longest time) after using the sample for a few days. This is a sheer, lightweight, subtly tinted, silky smooth, lightly hydrating, physical sunscreen (10% zinc oxide) with a faint floral scent that spreads easily (and without a white cast), absorbs smoothly, wears comfortably, and delicately blurs the pores on my nose, all while imparting a lovely (and non-greasy) soft glow to my complexion that comes through makeup beautifully on my now drier-leaning combination skin. I have a few sunscreens I incorporate into my daily routine; this one is being added to that rotation. It’s a love for me. Highly recommend. From sample to full size, it's love!
