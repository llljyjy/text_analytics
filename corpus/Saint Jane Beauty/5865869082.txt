I’ve been using this sunscreen for a few days now and I really like it! I have a medium-tan complexion, a semi brown Asian. And this sunscreen does not leave a white cast. I have tried so many that do and this does not! It’s a tiny bit thick but doesn’t have a scent and it was easy to blend. I had no issues with it and really liked this sunscreen! Love it
