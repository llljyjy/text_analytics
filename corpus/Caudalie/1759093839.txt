Absolutely love it. I am 49 years old and have used other Caudalie creams in the past. Love the brand. I decided to splurge in this moisturizer because, hey, 50 is fast approaching and I need to up my skin game. I have been using it for the past three months—together with the Caudalie Resveratrol serum in the am and the Khiels Midnight Recovery Oil in the pm (a longtime favorite—oh that lavender scent!) and have seen a marked difference in my skin.  My skin feels hydrated and firmer and looks more radiant.  Spots have faded more than with any other non prescribed product.  It feels slightly heavier than other Caudalie creams when you put it on, but absorbs quickly and does not feel sticky. Definitely recommend as part of a mature skin care routine.
