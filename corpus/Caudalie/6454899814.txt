When I watched the latest episode of “And Just Like That,“ I was floored when the plastic surgeon told Carrie about the 2 different type of aging: skin that sags or skin that hollows. Just like Carrie Bradshaw, I sadly am a hollower. My skin has lost it’s radiance and suppleness over the years. Add environmental factors and the fact that I used to smoke, and it’s easy to see why my skin is the way it is. But that doesn’t mean my skin has to stay that way. Thanks to products like this luxe skincare serum by Caudalie, my skin can still look fabulous! Caudalie’s Premier Cru Anti-Aging Serum made my skin feel bouncy again! It hydrated my skin so well, I noticed a difference after just one use. And the more I used it, the more my skin soaked up all the powerful ingredients and benefits that make this clean beauty product an automatic allstar! I only applied 2 pumps at night, and that was plenty for my whole face and neck. My skin just drank it up! In the morning, my skin looked dewy and fresh and just WOW! It just makes my skin look and feel so good! Caudalie’s Premier Cru Anti-Aging Serum helps with all my skin-related issues, like my fine lines and wrinkles and my dull, lackluster appearance. After using it for a few weeks just at night, I tried it during the day. It worked really well under my makeup. It wasn’t sticky or tacky either. And the smell is just divine! It’s not at all strong, but it has a spa-like scent that’s sublime! This super serum by Caudalie is everything I want in a serum! I highly recommend this to anyone looking for the perfect serum for their face! Super Serum
