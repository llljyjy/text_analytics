I saw a video of Kourtney Kardashian talking about this product in a YouTube video posted by Harper’s BAZAAR in 2019 where she shows her night time skin routine. She influenced me to purchase it. I’ve used it a couple times and it is decent. Makes my skin feel so soft afterwords. I use this once a week. I apply it with my fingers, which I don’t like. I just don’t feel like purchasing a brush to apply the mask. Overall, good product. Great Clay Mask
