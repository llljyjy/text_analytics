Listen, I own 30 moisturizers literally so I’ve tried a lot but this is my new favorite for a few reasons. It is so hydrating I can just use a small amount for my full face unlike other moisturizers where I keep going back for more. I love that it’s a squeeze tube because I have long nails, and the packaging is small so I can bring it with me in my bag, not to mention super cute. The smell is fine I can take orLeave it but it def is not a problem at all. It also doesn’t feel oily on my skin at all it’s super lightweight but hydrating as well. I keep reaching for it! Def recommend! My new favorite moisturizer!
