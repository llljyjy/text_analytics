I’ve been enjoying this rich and creamy textured cream, applying it nightly after washing my face and alongside the serum. It also has a beautiful scent of bergamot, sweet orange, mandarin and lemon wood, but it’s virtually unnoticeable after being applied and settled. It’s not at all too heavy for my combo skin type, and offers very efficient coverage that feels great, so I like to use any extra to work it down to my neck. It never irritated my skin or left a greasy or heavy feeling, and I woke up to softer, smoother, and plumped skin. I make sure to always apply my SPF in the morning, especially since this contains AHA which can increase your skin’s sensitivity to the sun. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Amazing Aromatic Night Cream!
