I started using this because my dermatologist prescribed me benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin and tretinoin for my acne, and those dried out my face so much, so I went to Sephora and asked for a super gentle, moisturizing cleanser and the employee recommended this. It smells really good but also mild, and it reduces redness so much in my face after taking off makeup. It still cleans my face, but also feels like it’s doing the bare minimum (in the best way) to keep my moisture barrier intact with my prescriptions. I’ve already gone through a bottle, and it lasts for quite a while. I used this with the FAB Ultra Repair Cream, and it restored so much moisture into my skin. I’m going to use it with the Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream now (since the FAB is quite heavy for me now), so I hope it still goes well. Definitely a staple:) nan
