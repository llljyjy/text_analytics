Great Face Mist! I used the product morning and night. I really like how the mist dried quickly while helping my skin glow. The scent, however, was really strong sort of like Vicks rub. I also like how it came in a sturdy glass bottle. I would recommend  this to a friend despite despite strong smell. Great Facial Mist
