#freeproduct #trywithtopboxThis eye cream isn’t a bad product, but I didn’t find it to be worth its cost.  I used the cream consistently 2x/day (morning and night) for about 1 month, but haven’t noticed a meaningful difference in my under-eye area (see pic, though note that in the bottom/after picture, my skin is less pale because I had used Tan-Luxe self-tan drops).  I also don’t like the metal application tip—it seemed to just drag against my delicate under-eye skin rather than nicely or smoothly apply the product.  No noticeable scent and the cream is a good consistency (not watery or too thick), so no concerns there.  The box also mentioned a “gift code” on its interior for a discount from Caudalie (see pic).  I’m all for good deals, but this presentation gave me cheap cereal-box-prize vibes.At first, I applied the product generously around my entire eye area (including upper eye lid), and pretty quickly ended up with two stubborn zits below one of my eyebrows.  I have oily, acne-prone skin, but never in that area, so I think it was just too moisturizing in that area for my skin type.  I would suggest oily-skinned people be careful.  That said, when I forgot an application before I had to wear makeup, my makeup did not apply as smoothly and my under-eyes looked more dry/cakey than they did with the cream.  So overall, I found that when applied sparingly for my oily skin, the eye cream provided benefits, but applying too much caused problems, and there doesn’t seem to be any longer term improvement in my under-eye area.  Given the $79 price point, I will probably switch to another brand of eye cream. Not enough difference to justify the cost
