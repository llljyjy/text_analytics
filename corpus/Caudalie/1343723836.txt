I love most Caudalie products, but this was a miss for me. I have sensitive skin, and this would leave my skin quite irritated unfortunately. I tried it off and on for a couple months and couldnâ€™t build up a tolerance to it. Used it on my chest instead and backs of my hands. Darn. For someone with combo skin, it was not greasy at all and provided adequate moisture in the winter. Will keep looking... Irritated my sensitive skin.
