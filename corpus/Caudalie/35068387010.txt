#freeproduct #trywithtopboxI gave this product several weeks to see what kind of changes my skin would go through.First impression: amazing packaging. I loved the pump. When putting the serum on, it is very sticky as it dries. That was annoying to me because texture is a huge deal.My skin did feel hydrated and smooth after using it, but the feeling was underwhelming. I didn’t see an increase or decrease in everyday blemishes, clogging, or dark spots. I am relatively young so I couldn’t check for wrinkle difference.  As a hyaluronic acid serum, I think this would be great as an addition to your routine with a heavier moisturizer. On it’s own though, I unfortunately didn’t see any differences besides some moisturizing for my skin. Not sure it's worth the price.
