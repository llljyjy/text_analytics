This product was being raved about all of the internet so I decided to take my chances. I have dark spots and scarring from bad acne and was hoping it would help speed up the process to brighten them up. Nope. Clogged my pores and caused horrible breakouts in areas that I’ve never had acne before. I’m talking about painful acne did took forever to heal. It was the only new thing I’ve introduced to my skin and I used it consistently for weeks? I didn’t want to believe that this product was what was destroying my skin but it did. The fragrance in this was so strong too, so this is not for sensitive skin or acne prone individuals. not for sensitive or acne prone skin!
