After using Premier Cru moisturizer for the past few weeks, I am a huge fan! My skin, especially my face, had been extremely dry and tight due to the extreme weather but I am finally seeing a “hint“ of my summer skin. I use it twice a day, once in the morning and again at night. Now it’s softer, more dewy, has a smoother texture and I can finally apply my makeup without seeing tons of dry patches. It absorbs quickly, has a delicate scent and so far has not clogged my pores. I highly recommend this product. #freeproduct Farewell "winter" skin!
