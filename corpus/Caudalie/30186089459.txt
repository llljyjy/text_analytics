I #gotitfree this cream from #trywithtipbox in exchange for my honest reviews . I use this in the night  as my moisturizer and it provides the perfect amount of moisture. It’s light, but covers well and makes my skin feel great! A small amount of this creme goes a long way and can be applied with serums. I’ve been getting so many compliments on my skin lately. it does not feel heavy on the skin and has no greasy feel. Great texture
