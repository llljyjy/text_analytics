I am getting married in 5 months and wanted to see if non drug store products would help my skin. My sister uses products from Caudalie so I thought Iâ€™d give it a try. Anyways after just 1 week I noticed a difference after using this toner. I have always suffered from bigger pores and noticeable blackheads and now they are almost gone. I also noticed my skin texture is more even. This product also smells really good. nan
