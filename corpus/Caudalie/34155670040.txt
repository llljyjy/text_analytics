I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox for my honest review. I liked how the smell was not overbearing and almost nonexistent. I used this product in the mornings and evenings before using the serum that I received with this product. As a moisturizer, this product was not disappointing, however, I have yet to see the lifting effect and reduce the fine wrinkles. Maybe I have not used the product long enough, so I will continue to use this product to see if anything changes. I loved how the product was vegan! nan
