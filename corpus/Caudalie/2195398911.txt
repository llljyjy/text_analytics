The oil control when using this and the serum together was amazing, but I was not able to layer ANYTHING on top without it caking up and flaking off, I even tried multiple sunscreens, but had the issue each time. Super disappointing. This was so close to skincare gold, but not if I canâ€™t layer even SPF! Flaky if you layer anything over it
