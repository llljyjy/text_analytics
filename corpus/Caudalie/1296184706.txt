Great cleanser! I used to have oily combination skin, and now my skin seems to be a bit drier.  ￼ I happen to be in the store when the rep was there and she was good lol I purchased the cleanser and I don’t regret it at all… It takes up all my make up and leaves my skin feeling refreshed. I will definitely continue to buy this. it’s not oily and it is easy to rinse off. New fave
