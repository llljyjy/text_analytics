I received this product complimentary for my review. I’ve been using it in the morning and at night after applying my toner. This cream is the best! It is a nice cream texture not too thick. A little goes a long way for me. I apply it in my face and neck. It absorb quickly and doesn’t leave my skin feeling sticky or greasy. It definitely has hydrated my face so much during this dry cold weather. It’s really been a life saver. I have noticed that my skin is smoother and more supple. I don’t have a wrinkles yet, but hopefully continuing to use this cream I won’t ever! I also like that you can buy a refill when you are finished. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Obsessed!
