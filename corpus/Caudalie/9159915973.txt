I love Caudalie products because they deliver what they promised. Everyone knows they are clean, vegan and their products are recyclable. I was super excited to try this serum because I have some expression lines on my face and Iâ€™m looking for products that help me maintain my overall look. This is part of a new line that promises to reduce aging signs as well as helping with loss of firmess. I used this on my night routine because the texture is very rich for my oily skin and leaves a glow in my face that during the day becomes oily. It has a nice scent like almost all of their products though for some people it can be a little strong but personally I love their scents, they are part of the experience of trying luxury skin products. I will recommend this with my eyes closed. I received this #freeproduct from #topbox but my opinions are not unbiased. #tryitwithtopbox Amazing!
