One thing I invest in is my skin and Caudalie Premier Cru La Creme Riche is the perfect addition to my daily skin care routine.  There are several things I love about this product.  There is a slight tint to it, which I appreciate because I can see where I am applying it to ensure I covered my whole face.  The cream is thick which means I need just a tiny amount on my finger tip, that I dab all over my face, gently disperse and allow my skin to absorb it.  While it is super rich and creamy, it does not at all clog my pores or feel heavy on my skin.  It has a very pleasant fragrance and feels like silk on my skin.  After several weeks of use I have noticed a more even skin tone, hydrated, supple looking skin and the confidence to go out without makeup.  My skin glows and I have been complimented on my youthful appearance (I am 42 years old).  Even when I do put on foundation, wearing this cream underneath does not affect my makeup in the least.  I apply this product every morning whether I put on makeup or not.  Finally, I love that I can save some money and simply buy a refill when I run out.  I highly recommend. #freeproduct Impressed!
