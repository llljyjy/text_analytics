It cleaned my skin and removed makeup well without stripping it. That said, I wear very little makeup, so it worked ok for me. I will not repurchase because I prefer a gel cleanser. Also,I felt like I had to double cleanse with this one. I like products that stand alone. Great as a double cleanser..
