Everything about Caudalie Premier Cru says luxury.  The container it comes in is a beautiful deep purple and is a good size.  The cream insides is a thick, luxurious cream and it’s exactly what I need to help hydrate my skin, especially in the winter.  The price point is a little high but I’m excited to see what it does for my face.  So far, I love! #freeproduct Luxury
