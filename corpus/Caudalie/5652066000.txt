Ok… soooo! First of all Let me start off by saying.. I was skeptical about trying this firming cream but thank GOD I did. I know everyone’s skin is different and responds differently to products. But this right here worked sooo well for me, my skin felt firmer , tighter, and I don’t meant tighter as in dry, I mean tighter as if ya girl got a facelift or something. I tried it back in April and fell in love, it hydrated my skin too. (I tend to have dry skin sometimes bc I do use a lot of salycic acid products for any blemishes that may come up. But anyways! I hope this works for you the way it did me ! You will LOVE this!
