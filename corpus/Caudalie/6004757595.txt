This is the best product you can get that works wonder ! My face pigments easily when I have an acne scar or sun spot as you can see in these pictures. I started getting pimples heavily on my cheeks, chin and some on my upper lip during the time I had to wear N95 face mask religiously at work and the scars healed but are still noticeably there. So I decided to do my research and came across this serum and gave it a shot. This time I had document my face the first time I used the serum to today. I really wanted to see whether this serum would actually worked and I’ve gone through a lot of dark spot serums and this one works !! Today is my second month of using this product. The picture on the left you can see I have noticeable dark spots on my cheek and my chin/side of chin. The right photo with my face turn you can clearly see a huge difference in the appearance of my dark spot. It’s slowly lightening up my dark spots and I’m excited to see the end results ! Try it, you will not be disappointed ! Expensive but worth every penny !
