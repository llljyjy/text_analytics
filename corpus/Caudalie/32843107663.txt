I received this #freeproduct to #trywithtopbox and, Wow! I have to start with the packaging on this, a small tube, nothing amazing there, right? Wrong, it’s the applicator on it that wins with me right off the bat, a flat metal tip, (can easily be removed for cleaning) to massage the eye area, so soothing, & cooling. This is my favorite eye cream packaging to date, full stop!Now let’s get into what the product actually is, and does, this has multiple patented anti-aging ingredients, along with a pearlescent appearance that instantly makes the eye area appear brighter. This absorbed very well, and moisturized the eye area amazingly well. I used it in both my am & pm routine. I am really impressed with this eye cream, another one I will be holding onto for the long term.  The pearlescent’s do such a great job of instantly brightening the under eye area too, which is such a nice addition. Love this applicator so much
