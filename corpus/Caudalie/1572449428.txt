After Peter Thomas Roth discontinued Despot, I have been searching for a quality product to balance my complexion because I have hyperpigmentation and acne scars. I have tried various products, but they were either too harsh on my sensitive skin or made me break out. I had heard about this product, so thought I would give it a try. I have quickly become obsessed with it. I have used half a bottle so far, and I have noticed my complexion is more balanced and my skin is glowing. I did not get this as a promo or sample, so trust me when I say this is a phenomenal product I highly recommend, especially since it does not irritate my skin. The Perfect Complexion Balancer
