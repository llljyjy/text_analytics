I received this #freeproduct with #trywithtopbox for my honest review. I have to say I’m a big fan of serums and have used all kinds from different brands but nothing stands out quite like this one from Caudalie! While it is quite expensive, I think it’s worth it for the high quality and best ingredients you can get on the market like TET8 technology, Hyaluronic Acid and Tightening Sugars that all come together to create this really nice serum. I’ve been using it for over a week now and I really love it! First it’s really light, and not sticky or super thick like some serums. Second it does an amazing job to hydrate my dry skin and plump up fine lines, while making my skin glow as well. I like that it comes in a purple glass pump bottle as well Amazing
