So good. I’ve gotten small sizes of this cleanser from Sephora favorite boxes and rewards points and i need the full size ASAP. I never really realized much from the cleanser when my skin was at its best. Now that I’ve been struggling with Acne and blackheads around the sides of my face and cheeks from wearing a mask I’ve noticed how magical this is. My blackheads are starting to clear. My face feels clean but not too stripped. This has helped me clean my face better than any of my previous cleansers. It’s a winner. blackheads and acne will disappear
