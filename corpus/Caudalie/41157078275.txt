I’m really impressed with the quality of Caudalie’s Vinergetic C+ Instant Detox Mask. I’ve noticed significant results on my skin, in just one week of regular use. I typically apply some, first thing in the morning and a little again at night before going to sleep. It’s refreshing to apply and satisfying to take it off, plus there’s no fragrance and the environmentally responsible use of recycled glass and plastic in the manufacturing of the product is respectable. This is one of the top masks that I’ve ever tried, and you only need to use a little bit at a time, it will last a long time. I also want to say that I love the woodgrain cap on this product! Overall, I would definitely recommend this product from Cuadalie over any other brand of mask. #freeproduct #tryitwithtopbox Excellent Detox Mask!
