I recieved this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox for my personal use.  I rarely have issues with Caudalie products and this time is no different.  There is no discernable fragrance in this thick rich night cream. I donâ€™t often wear night creams due to eye irritation, I have had no problems with this cream.  I use it with the dark spot serum and love the way my face has been brightening and healthier looking in the morning.  I will continue to use this product as my new fav night cream!
