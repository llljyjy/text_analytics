I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox and have been using it a little over a week. My first impression was how luxurious the bottle is.  It’s quite heavy and the sprays the perfect amount of mist on the face. It’s been rather hot and humid where I live so I’ve been using this not only as a toner but to freshen up during the day. It makes your skin look refreshed, even after sweating. It has the faintest botanical scent and it’s the perfect pick me up. My skin looks and feels clear after using this such a short time. I can’t wait to see how my skin looks after I finish the bottle. This product is worth every penny! Worth every penny!
