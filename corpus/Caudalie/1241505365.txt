I usually love Caudalie products. This one is terrible. I got small white pimples all over my cheeks. I don’t really breakout anymore (as I’m getting older) and never on my cheeks. Read reviews and saw others had the same problem. This was the only product I added to my skincare routine. Stopped using and within a week, skin started to clear up. Very oily, hard to wash off. Caused bad breakouts
