My skin leans towards being drive and I live in Denver so I always need intense moisture, especially at night - I was previously a devoted customer for the LANEIGE Water Bank Moisture Cream, but I needed to find something new when they changed the formula recently so I gave this a try. It is even better than the old LANEIGE formula and I am officially converted. It is a thicker consistency but still soaks in fast enough to apply makeup over the top, plus it does not cause any breakouts for my sensitive skin. I condensed from having a daytime and nighttime cream into just using this one because it is so versatile for what my skin needs. New Favorite Moisturizer
