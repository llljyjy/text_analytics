I have been given the opportunity to try Caudalie Premier Cru Eye Cream for a few weeks now, and I can see a difference already. It’s a buttery soft, scent free Cream that helps with my eye puffiness and dark circles.  I keep it in my mini fridge and use the metal tip, it soothes and cools under my eyes and helps with my crows feet. I dab it on my laugh lines around my mouth, It’s hydrating and plumps up my skin making my fine lines less noticeable.  It’s vegan friendly, fragrance free, the metal tip is removable, promotes hydration and radiance. Thank you for letting me #trywithtopbox #freeproduct Brighter Eyes
