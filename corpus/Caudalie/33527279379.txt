I received this product for free from TopBox Circle and Caudalie in exchange for my honest review. This Caudalie Premier Cru The Rich Cream is very luxurious and feels amazing! It has a nice thick creamy consistency and it absorbs quickly. It has a very nice light scent that isn’t overpowering. I apply it to my face and neck in the morning and in the evening. It is very hydrating and it doesn’t make my oily skin feel greasy. It makes my skin look radiant and healthy. I love that the jar is refillable. I would recommend. Very Hydrating!
