Pros: Lightweight, absorbs well, & smooth textureCons: Pills, strong smell, not very moisturizing I was recommended this cream by an Sephora employee, and it felt really smooth so I gave it a try. However I think the ingredients don’t mix well with other products I use, and it immediately pilled while applying it. The smell is nice but strong, so if you don’t like fragrance I wouldn’t choose this product. It’s also marketed as an intense moisturizer, but seeing as it pilled right off I never got to see the results. Pilling + Strong Scent
