So I was extremely happy to get the opportunity to try this anti-aging moisturizer. It is suppose to target the eight signs of aging with its breakthrough Tech8 technology. And after trying it for a few weeks in my nighttime routine… I do think it’s pretty amazing! It is a very luxurious, rich cream that is very hydrating and has made my skin look plumper w less noticeable fine lines. I enjoy using this cream. And look forward to seeing the results after using for longer. And lastly I absolutely love that it is a recyclable jar that you can refill or re-purpose and reuse! I wish more companies did this! #freeproduct #trywithtopbox nan
