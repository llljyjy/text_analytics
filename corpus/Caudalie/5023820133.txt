From a personal experience, Iâ€™d give this 1 or 2 stars- BUT I think maybe that this product line was just not the right one for me and my skin woes. I think if either living in majorly humid area and struggle with mild acne or youre someone with very oil skin and struggle with acne that this might work for you! nan
