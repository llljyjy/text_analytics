The texture of this moisturizer is great.  It’s right in the middle of not being overly thick or liquid so a little does go along ways . It absorbs very well . The smell is a little different,  it’s not fragrant but it’s a little off setting but luckily it’s not pungent.  I used this for 3 weeks now and my skin itself is visably softer and helped smooth some trouble dry spots . So far I’m impressed. Pretty good moisterizer
