I thought the Caudalie products I was using were great, then I decided to try this-I ordered off their website so I could redeem points at the same time. I’ve been using Caudalie products for years with very noticeable results and success, so I thought I’d give this new cream a try. Within a mere few days of receiving my order and trying this cream, my dry, red winter-parched skin was gone.  Blotchiness was gone, small pimples disappeared. I had soft, evenly toned skin, so much so that I went without make up. What a difference. I don’t know how, but their products keep getting better. Highly recommend! Perfection in a jar
