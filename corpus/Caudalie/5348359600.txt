Very okay. Not worth the price, doesn’t feel like anything. It smells pleasant and doesn’t feel harsh but doesn’t not remove makeup at all. It’s kind of moves it around but nothing comes off. I can’t think of a anything positive but the smell and the fact that it’s a clean brand. First aid beauty is stills clean brand and can offer the same product at a lower reprice point. Ehhh
