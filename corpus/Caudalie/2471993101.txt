“I received this product for free from Caudalie and TopBox in exchange for my honest review.“ I have always had dark circles under my eyes which has made me very self conscious. I have tried so many different types of products to reduce the look of always being tired when I’m not to no avail. Let me tell you after trying, Premier Cru Eye Cream by Caudalie for 3 weeks I was utterly shocked by the results. Not only have my dark circle lighten drastically but my eyes no longer look so tired like I’ve been sleep deprived. My eyes look brighter and bigger. I’m no longer self conscious when I have no makeup and I couldn’t be more thankful. So little goes a long way. What I like about this product is that the cream really absorbs in deep into my skin leaving it moisturized and hydrated without leaving a sticky feeling. I’ve been asked so many times recently what is it that I’m using? My answer is, Caudalie Premier Cru Eye Cream you have to try it! #TryWithTopBox #FreeProduct My Holy Grail of Eye Cream
