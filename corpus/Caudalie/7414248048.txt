I have dry skin and dealt with extremely dry patches around my eyes for a few months. No matter what I did, they wouldn’t go away even using aquaphor and hydrocortisone creams. I was going to give up when I started using this serum and it cleared up within a week and hasn’t come back so long story short this is one of the best things that happened to my skin nan
