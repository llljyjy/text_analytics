This serum is pricey but wow it’s worth it. I’ve tried so many products over the years of having acne scars and textured skin with minimal results. I’ve gone through a bottle over several months using nighty and seen my acne scars basically disappear. Lightens dark spots, evens out your overall tone, it’s not sticky and it smells good. If you are debating getting this use this as your sign!! Amazing
