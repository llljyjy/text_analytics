I received this moisturizer as a trial with an order.  It has a nice scent that is fruity.  It stays for a while so it might be too much for really sensitive skin or noses.  The texture of the cream is mid range; not too thick but not liquid either.  I would buy this if it was on sale and I recommend it. Lovely Moisturizer!
