I’m basing my review off the kit with the eye cream, serum and this moisturizer since they don’t seem to have that listed as a product anymore. I have dry, delicate, sensitive skin and I’m also getting fine lines and wrinkles at 33. I wanted to love this line but I didn’t. The serum smells like smoke. My SO jokingly asked me if I had smoked a cigarette (I don’t smoke) and I was shocked that he thought it smelled the same. It smells like perfume mixed with cigarette smoke. Very odd. After using these products for almost two months I do seem to have more blended skin, meaning I still have the fine lines and wrinkles but they’re not as bad. And now I have bumps all over my forehead and cheeks, because I think this is still too irritating for people with sensitive skin. Though it’s still a more natural product, it’s not all natural and there are still ingredients I consider undesirable in it. Would not buy again and intuitively didn’t feel good about using it on my skin. Haven’t even finished all the products, so glad to have poured $80 down the drain. nan
