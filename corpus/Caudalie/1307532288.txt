Overall I was so disappointed in this product! I originally tried the sample size which I loved, but the full size is just not living up to my expectations. It’s a gel like cream that is hydrating, but I don’t see a significant difference in hydration. I definitely don’t see a difference in fine lines or wrinkles. I’ve had better results with Olay eye cream. Save your $$
