I use this product exclusively for moistening my skin between steps in my beauty routine. Wash, spray, tone, spray, essence, spray, ampoule, spray, serum, spray, mask, spray, treatment, spray, moisturizer. (Not that I do every step every night but that’s the basic idea)It helps every product sink in and be more effective so my skin is left plump and dewy and SO hydrated. The moisturizer — and before bed, an oil — helps lock it all in so I wake up with the softest skin, even in winter.I’m on my fourth can of this and I will never be without it. It’s just enough to help but not so many ingredients it interferes. It never, ever feels sticky. So good. So, so good. How many times can I say “so good”?!
