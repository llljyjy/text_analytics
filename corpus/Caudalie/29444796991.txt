I was lucky enough to get Caudalie Firming Cashmere Cream as a #freeproduct from Caudalie and #trywithtopbox for my honest opinion. I used this along with Caudalieâ€™s Resveratrol-Lift Instant Firming Serum for about a month now. It started out slow,but around week 3 started seeing visible results. My fine lines are slowly getting thinner and slightly less noticeable! And this feels absolutely AMAZING on my skin! My skin has such a beautiful, soft glow! And for the first time in years all my dry patches are gone-even on the creases of my nose! I also like how this is vegan,and made of 97% natural ingredients! I highly recommend trying this! Feels so good!
