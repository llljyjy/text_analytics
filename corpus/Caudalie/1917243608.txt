I don’t know what was going on with my face but it was not happy and super stripped.  My normal moisturizers were not cutting it--like for at least a weak I was super dry and no matter what masks, face wash, and moisturizers I was using, nothing helped.  Until I remembered I got this #freeproduct that I was desperate and tried it---it totally reset my face.  It was soft, moisturizing, it was the perfect texture and consistency.  Since using this, I haven’t had any problems---I liked it so much that I gave it to my mom---really nice quality skin care. Reset my face.
