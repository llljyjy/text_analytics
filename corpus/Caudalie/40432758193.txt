I received this eye cream free from TopBox Circle and Caudalie for my honest review. I love that this cream feels luxurious and rich. It goes on smoothly and the consistency of the cream allows you to not have to use a lot which I love! I tend to have puffy eyes in the morning and dark circles quite frequently. Over the last year or so I have noticed that the skin around my eyes is thinning so I am very careful to be gentle when I am applying any eye treatments. This has a silver applicator that is very cold so it feels very soothing. It feels almost like a rose quartz or Jade roller temperature wise. Oddly the cream comes out of the back of the applicator which I wasn’t expecting. You can’t really use the silver applicator when applying the eye cream because it pulls and doesn’t apply evenly. I like to dab the cream under my eyes gently until it is fully incorporated. Then I use the silver applicator for the cooling effect. I have noticed that my eyes aren’t as puffy and fine lines are beginning to be less noticeable. You can also use this as a lip contour! I definitely would recommend this eye cream, it is well worth the prestige price. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox nan
