About a month ago, I walked into Sephora with plans to buy a spot treatment, but met an employee with the same type of skin as me. They convinced me to do away with spot treatments, and instead use a serum that will help eliminate my acne and also keep my skin looking young and smooth. Spot treatments tend to be too trying for my combo skin, so this serum was a great substitute. After a month, I already see a huge improvement in my skin. My acne has lessened, and my skin is nice and soft. I see a lot of reviews about this product giving people more breakouts, but that happens to me whenever I try a new skin product (it’s just our skin adjusting). I noticed a few white heads appear after my first few days of using this, but they were completely gone after a week. If this happens to you, I highly encourage you to give this product a chance and wait at least one week before writing it off. It’s so worth it!! The serum I never knew I needed
