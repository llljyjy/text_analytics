I began using this moisturizer 2 weeks ago and have started seeing a significant difference. It has helped fade my dark spots and it helps keep my skin super hydrated this winter. It is a thick product, but I enjoy a thick moisturizer at night. I wake up and my skin is super soft. I would recommend this to people with dry or combination skin. #freeproduct moisturizer
