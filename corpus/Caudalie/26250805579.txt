I received Caudalie Premier Cru Dark Circle Correcting Eye Cream, complimentary via Topbox Circle, in exchange for my honest review. I LOVE the applicator on this product. It stays nice and cold and works similarly to a face roller, which helps with those circles. The skin around my eyes definitely seems a bit brighter and softer after using this regularly. I’m not sure I’m seeing much change in the dark circles or faint crow’s feet but I’ve only been using it a few weeks. A little goes a long way with this cream and I’m hoping to see continued, improved results.  I like that this has no discernible scent, unlike other products in this line. Thank you for the opportunity. #FreeProduct #TryWithTopbox #Caudalie So Far, So Good
