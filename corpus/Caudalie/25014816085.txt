I’m actually stuck on giving this product a five star rating. This moisturizer does work well but I think it feels heavy on skin and leaves skin feeling dewy. It does make skin have a glow to it so I guess you could say it works. I think this product would be better for using in the colder months because I don’t care too much for the appearance it leaves my skin overall. My skin does feel hydrated and my dry patches appear less noticeable. I use this moisturizer before I apply my makeup and again before bed (once I remove my makeup). I do see a noticeable difference in my skin. It feels smoother and soft. nan
