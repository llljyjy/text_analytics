Instant Results! Caudalie Premier Cru Anti-Aging Serum is unique in my opinion, because I acts instantly to plump skin and fill fine lines, while still having long term active ingredients. The serum is light weight and absorbs fairly quick. I like that I can actually feel it working. It tingles slightly. I definitely see the instant results and they last pretty much the whole day. Ive only been using for about a week or so, so Iâ€™m not sure about long term yet. The price seems a bit on the high side, but a little goes a long way, and the instant results are priceless IMHO. Highly recommend! Instant Results!
