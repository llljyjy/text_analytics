I received the beauty elixir mist free for my honest review. I wasn’t very excited to try this face spray because the smell is very medicinal. I did finally try it and it’s very refreshing on your face. The smell went away for me after about an hour. It is a great addition to my daily routine and I will definitely keep using it. Remember to really shake it before you spray your face. I definitely recommend! #trywithtopbox Refreshing!
