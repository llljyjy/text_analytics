I understand this is a little pricey but I just had to try it out and this is actually my second bottle. On a hot day I spritz this on and Iâ€™m immediately refreshed. I can automatically smell peppermint and rosemary and really does lift my mood. I use it for everything from a toner to a setting spray. Worth every dollar. Pay For What You Get
