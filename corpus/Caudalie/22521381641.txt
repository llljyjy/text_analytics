I’ve only been using this product for a week, but so far I am in love with this moisturizer. I have very sensitive skin and struggle to find anti-aging products that don’t cause redness and breakouts. This cream gives me a really nice glow, plumpness, and even complexion without looking oily (or that weird fake glow/mica-shimmer iykyk). The consistency is on the thicker side but it absorbs really well and feels very moisturizing. Worth the expense imo to feel confident and beautiful without foundation. Really nice glow!
