Unfortunately, these made my under eye bags lookEven worse. I was only using at night and would wake up with worse puffiness and darkness than usual. I have problems finding an eye cream that works on my sensitive skin, and sadly this was another one to add to the list. Didnâ€™t work for me. Worse dark circles.
