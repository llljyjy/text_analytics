I received Caudalie Vino Perfect Brightening Glycolic night cream as a #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox in exchange for my honest review. After just a few weeks of applying this night cream after Caudalie’s Serum I cannot believe how radiant my face and neck looks! This extravagant cream is thick and glides on your face and neck and not too greasy which is perfect for my oily skin. You really only need a dab of this cream it’s so powerful, like a secret cream in a bottle. The dark spots on the side of my face I was so conscious of, are diminishing, my skin looks radiant and the rosy smell of it lingers throughout the day, it’s refreshing. Five stars for both serum and night cream. I’m a caudalie lover, love all their products, im sure to tell all! Sure to please
