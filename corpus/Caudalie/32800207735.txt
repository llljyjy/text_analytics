I received this #freeproduct  from #trywithtopbox and I have to say I really love this cream. The texture is thick and I was a little scared to use it because of me having oily skin but it absorbed nicely and did not leave a greasy residue feeling on my skin . Iâ€™ve been using it for about two weeks now and it has improved my textured skin. I use it every nice and it smells lovely. Ive always been scared to try night creams but this one is amazing, I recommend 100% . It have brightened my complexion within the two weeks Ive have used this would definitely buy this product.#freeproduct#trywithtopbox. Lovely cream
