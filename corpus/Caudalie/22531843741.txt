I have combination skin (very, very oily on the nose, chin and forehead), and i have also acne prone skin since two years ago. My acne is most definitely hormonal, and i tried SO many cleanser, both drugstore and high end, even the very good quality brand from my esthetician. Nothing really worked, and i always had pimples at the bottom of my face. I bought this without any hope, but it changed my skin. After one week, my skin improved so much! I will be purchasing this product again. A life saver
