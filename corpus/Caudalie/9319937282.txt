I have to say this is one of the best serums I have tried. This absorbs very quickly and does not leave my face sticky or greasy. I have been having some winter dryness and this has helped with hydrating that area as well as the rest of my face. My whole face is so moisturized and plump now I love it! I used this every morning and most nights. The bottle is great, (purple is my favorite shade) the top locks with a twist.  I will be picking up more of this! I did receive this product for free for my opinion #freeproduct Amazing!
