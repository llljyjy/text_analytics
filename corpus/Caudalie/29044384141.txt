I was gifted this from TopBox. I have been using it for bit now. I love the metal tip applicator to help apply and depuff if you keep product in the fridge. Over all the fine lines around my eyes have smoothed out more. I also used on my laugh line and right in between my eyebrows where I have fine lines. All areas have some definite improvement. I have had no irritation, redness or breakouts. I really like the product.#trywithtopbox #freeproduct Happy with this
