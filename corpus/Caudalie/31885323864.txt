I received this Caudalie Cru Anti-Aging Serum for free from Topbox in exchange for my honest review. This serum does exactly what it claims to do and gives my skin instant hydration. I’ve been using it for about a week now, morning and night. It has a subtle, fresh and herbally scent which goes away once applied. It absorbs well into the skin but it does leave a slight tacky feeling. I was very happy to see Niacinamide as the fourth ingredient on the ingredients list because it’s one of my favorite skincare ingredients for my acne prone skin. So not only does this serum provide hydration for my skin, it also helps combat my blemishes. #trywithtopbox #freeproduct Instantly hydrates
