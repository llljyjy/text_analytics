Just didn’t work for me. I suffer from hyperpigmentation, and if this would’ve worked, I would have accepted the price. However, it seemed to make absolutely no difference. It doesn’t even feel like it’s able to penetrate my skin. It does leave a nice glow since it doesn’t fully get absorbed into my skin. I gave it two stars opposed to one because it feels nice. Didn’t work for my African American skin
