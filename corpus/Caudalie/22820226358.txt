I received this product in exchange for an honest review.  After trying the product, I was amazed at the results.  I can easily say that this is a luxurious and high-end product.  The formula feels nice in contact with my skin, very creamy and smooth.  Just as a suggestion without detracting from the quality of this cream, a fragrance-free option for all skin types would be fabulous ... Some time ago I began to notice that when I use scented products in most cases they give me a bit of a rash .  Not so with this wonderful cream that has brought great benefit to my skin.  If there was a fragrance-free option, it would be very acceptable for all skin types.  However it has been a great solution for me… .. I recommend it 100% for its fast action, benefits and access in various chains …… This is a wonderful product! Awesome
