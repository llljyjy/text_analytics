#tryitwithtopbox sent me this #freeproduct for review. I used Vinoperfect Brightening Glycolic Night Cream as directed on the label which is only during night time. I noticed, initially, that this product purged my skin. My whiteheads were being extracted so my face was looking extremely texturized. I also felt like my skin dried out a lot more than usual even when I applied moisturizer with every use of this product even if I apply it beforehand. One thing that I like about this product though is the formulation because itâ€™s a nice balance of thickness and spreads easily across my skin. I would only recommend this to a friend who can tolerate a strong chemical on their face. I advice to do a skin patch test first and to ease your way in first because it could potentially dry out your skin or further irritate it. Could Be Too Drying
