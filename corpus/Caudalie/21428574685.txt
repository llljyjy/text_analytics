I’ve tried a lot of cleansers over the years, and this instantly became my new favorite! I got it as apart of a pack of Caudalie products in mini sizes as I’d already found success with their hand cream, and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked everything in it. I have naturally very clear skin, but am prone to dryness, and start feeling it immediately after showering. Using this cleanser regularly followed by their moisturizer soothed my skin and made it more pristine than ever before! One pump also goes a long way, and you have enough for your face and neck. Finally, the scent is light but present, and feels clean without being overwhelming. 5/5! Favorite New Cleanser
