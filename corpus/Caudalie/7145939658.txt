I received this cream for free from topbox circle for my honest feedback. I’ve been using it for close to two weeks as my nightime cream. It’s thick and extra moisturizing. I’ve noticed a big improvement in the few dry spots I have and less crepey skin where it is applied. It’s definitely worth the price if you can afford it. The scent is subtle but fresh, and it works as advertised. I definitely recommend. Decadent!
