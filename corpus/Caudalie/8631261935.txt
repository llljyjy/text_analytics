Premier Cru The Eye Cream is absolutely spectacular!  This lightly tinted cream instantly brightens the eye area.  I’ve noticed significant lift and smoothness all around my orbital bone after a several weeks of use.  A really great part of this eye cream is the tube has a flat, cold, metal applicator that cools and soothes puffiness while also distributing the Premier Cru deep into the delicate skin around the eyes.   I have accidentally rubbed it into my eyes and found no eye pain, irritation or redness from the eye cream so it’s super gentle.  I use it at morning when my eyes are puffy and I could use a bit the lightening effect this cream provides.  I use it after washing my face, toning and a good serum.  It always sinks in leaves no trace. I have really noticed my eyes looking younger and very diminished fine lines and hollowness.  This makes my eye makeup go on smoothly and look spectacular for the entire day.  I strongly recommend Premier Cru eye cream, it is the best I have found! #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Must have!
