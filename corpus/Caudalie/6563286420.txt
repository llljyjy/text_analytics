They made such a point to emphasize that this is the same formula with new packaging and that is a straight up lie. I used to love this because of the rosemary smell and the soothing feel. I just sprayed this on my face and my skin is still stinging thirty minutes later and my eyes were on fire. This is literally just mint, is smells sooo strong and hurt to put on! Not only that but the packaging is so cheap, it used to have a nice metal cap and now it is cheap, easy to bend plastic. This was always a splurge for me because I thought it smelled nice and was relaxing, even if I didnâ€™t feel like it did much, but they completely ruined this product. NOT THE SAME FORMULA!
