I love this cleansing oil as a first cleanse! Have been using it this way for years. It feels great on the skin and it doesnâ€™t irritate my skin even if I leave it on a bit too long. The bottle looks small but it lasts forever if you use it as directed (3 pumps for the entire face) The only cleansing oil I repurchase!
