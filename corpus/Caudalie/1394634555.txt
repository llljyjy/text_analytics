On my second bottle! My facialist said I needed to start using cleansing oil, as my other pricey fancy soaps were drying my skin and making my pores huge. I tried this one, as they told me in the store it was really natural. I absolutely love it, and my skin changed dramatically. I tried another brand while traveling, and it left a oily film. I went back to this brand because my skin feels clean afterwards. nan
