Even though I have oily skin, I love an oil cleanser as a first step in makeup removal. I have been using this cleanser for a little bit and I like it pretty decently. For the price, it is great! It removes makeup well, leaves the skin feeling soft and not stripped, and it just feels very luxurious. The only negative things I have to say, and which is why I gave it 4 stars, is that it is fragranced and the spread of the oil isnâ€™t enough. The fragrance is not terrible, it kind of smells like strawberry poptarts in all honesty, but the texture of it means that it needs at least two pumps to truly get to all the makeup. It is oddly too thick. I will more than likely rebuy this however! GOOD cleanser!
