I received this #freeproduct from TopBox Circle and Caudalìe in exchange for my honest review. The first thing I noticed was the gorgeous packaging. The purple and gold makes it look very fancy. The serum comes in a beautiful glass bottle with a pump. It’s very functional and contains a generous amount of serum. I was very excited to use the serum because of the TET8 technology and instant tightening sugars incorporated in this amazing serum. After continuous use over a 2 week period I did see an improvement in skin texture. It appears much softer than before. There is also a slight difference in firmness. My skin is considerably smoother and moisturized. It also appears brighter and more radiant. I really love the serum but not the price attached to it. I would love to purchase but it’s definitely out of my price range I will continue to use and hopefully see additional improvements. I highly recommend if you’re seeking great results. #trywithtopbox Serum that Delivers Results
