absolutely hate this product. donâ€™t buy it. I bought it because my local sephora was out of the one I usually use and the salesperson recommended it. it pills horribly and my skin does not feel hydrated at all after application. it really has a disgusting feel to it - makes my skin feel really dirty and gross - it comes right off! Save your $$!!! terrible product! not hydrating and PILLS
