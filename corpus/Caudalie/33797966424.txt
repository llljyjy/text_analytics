I received this #freeproduct for my honest opinion thanks to #trywithtopbox. I would first like to start off with the bottle its in. It is so pretty and the color of it is beautiful! I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I am really loving the results. It has made my skin feel more hydrated and much more younger! The scent is not too strong and smells good! I loved it! :) Hydrating!
