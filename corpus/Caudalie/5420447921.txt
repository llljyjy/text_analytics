I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion, as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador.  I love that this is alcohol free and is gentle on my dry combo skin. I apply it using a cotton ball after I wash my face. It doesnâ€™t leave my skin irritated or tight but soft and hydrated ready for the serums I put on after it. nan
