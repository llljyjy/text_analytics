I’ve been using this for about two months now. I love it. Vitamin C makes me break out like crazy so I wanted something that gave the benefits but not the break out. This serum is light, smells good, and leaves my skin so soft. I have noticed my skin tone evening out and becoming more “glowy”. The price is hefty but I don’t think I could go back. nan
