This Caudalie premier cru anti-aging cream moisturizer works well for my skin as a nightly routine. The scent is not overpowering. The cream itself is not too thick nor thin, just the right texture to blend smoothly into my skin and provide the moisture that it needs during the winter months. #freeproduct caudalie cream
