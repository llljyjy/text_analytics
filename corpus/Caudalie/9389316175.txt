I received this #freeproduct from#trywithtopbox for my honest review. I have been using it for over a week now and I just in love with this cream. The applicator is so cooling and smoothes out the cream very nicely without any pulling. The cream has noticeably helped with my dark circles   and I have  definitely seen improvement over just a week. The cream has lightened them as much as it can since mine are hereditary but I have been using it in the morning and evening religiously and itâ€™s really good. I highly recommend it for anyone looking to decrease their dark circles. nan
