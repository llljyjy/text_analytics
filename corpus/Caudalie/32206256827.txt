I LOVE this product! First of all, the packaging is so pretty. I’m also into the environment, so the fact that when you use it all, you remove the caddy and replace it in the jar. I used this for 4 full weeks before I reviewed it. It not only left my skin super hydrated, but it also lightened my dark spot a little. It didn’t completely remove it, but the fact that a cream can lighten it makes me super happy. I received this product for free from Top Box Circle in eschange for my honest review. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Love
