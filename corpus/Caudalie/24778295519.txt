I received a sample of this cream which means it did not last long enough to judge whether it does all that it claims to do.  On the positive side, there is virtually no scent and I did not experience any tingling/burning/irritation which can sometime be an issue with the delicate skin under the eye.  However, even though I used a small amount, I found that it did not entirely absorb and my under eye area was a bit tacky after using it.  Not an issue at night, but not great in the morning when I wanted to use concealer under my eye.  Because of the tackiness, I will not be buying this cream as I have another that I use which absorbs completely. Sample size trial; pros and cons
