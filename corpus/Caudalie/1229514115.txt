I don’t have high hopes when it comes to eye creams. When I tried this for the first time, I “wow”ed out loud. They’re not lying about the brightening effect—my purplish dark circles were noticeably improved. It also diminished the appearance of the fine lines at the corners of my eyes. Wears nicely under concealer, too. I do mix in a tad of moisturizer to prevent creasing if I know I’ll be wearing makeup all day. For reference, I’m 40 with fair skin that’s in pretty good shape, and I have very noticeable under-eye circles when I’m not wearing any product. Surprisingly good
