This was my first time trying this or ever hearing about. I received this #freesample from #TopBoxCircle and feel in love with how it felt on my combination skin. I used it in the morning and at night for the first week then used it whenever I needed that refreshing feeling. After applying the setting spray after my make-up in the morning I used the setting spray and I used it even before bed with a classic face.The scent is refreshing to my all my senses. It had a mint/lemony smell. I felt like I had a facial whenever I used it. Glad I was able to experience this and will purchase more when this bottle is finished. AMAZING REFRESHNER
