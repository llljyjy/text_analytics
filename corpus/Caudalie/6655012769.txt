I needed a new spray toner and thought i would give this one a try. The spray can is really easy to use and pretty unique packaging (but also not very eco-friendly). It doesn’t irritate or smell, but it also probably doesn’t do much for the skin either. I don’t know that I would repurchase, but if i was in a pinch, it’s not a bad mist at all. Not bad, not amazing
