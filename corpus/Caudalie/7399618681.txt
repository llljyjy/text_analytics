Here is a review on the overall product including: packaging, formula, smell, and the results. Packaging: The frosted packaging gives a luxurious feel and looks great on any vanity or bathroom. I really liked how the pump locks once it’s turned. This makes it convenient to be able to travel and avoid the product spilling in your bag. Fórmula/ texture: The texture is lightweight. It feels refreshing and non-greasy. It feels incredibly hydrating and I used it both day or night. It absorbed quickly on my skin and it was easy to apply a moisturizer shortly after. It was also safe for my sensitive skin. Smell: This product had a very nice scent, it wasn’t overpowering or unpleasant at all. I look forward to applying the serum daily. Results: Shortly after applying the serum, I felt a tightening effect. It has worked well with my skin and has minimized a few lines on my neck after a few weeks of using it. Overall, I would highly recommend this product. It’s hydrating, refreshing, and minimizes wrinkles. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox 100000% recommend
