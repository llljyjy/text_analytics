I received this product for free from Topbox in exchange for my honest review. Let me start by saying this is a great mist. I have used it on my face fresh and clean without makeup to just freshen up and also with makeup as a setting spray and it works so well. It doesnâ€™t leave any sticky residue and my skin does not feel tacky after using. It is easy to use also just shake it up close your eyes and spray.  My skin always feels fresh after applying. I did deduct one star because the scent is a little too strong in my opinion. This really is a high-quality product. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Great Product
