I don’t have too many visible signs of aging yet so that part is preventative and I can’t comment on it… BUT this feels like the most nourishing moisturizer I’ve ever used. It’s thick, creamy, does the job and manages to stay light weight enough for me to wear during the day. I’m also a big fan of resveratrol as a supplement so this product is a big win for me! My favorite moisturizer EVER
