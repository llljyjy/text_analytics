My skin loves this. I have sensitive skin and I live in a desert climate, with summer approaching my skin was starting to get irritated as my old cream (Tatcha) didn’t keep my skin hydrated all day but this definitely did. It does not leave the skin heavy, it is absorbed very well.I can’t wait to try all the products. Very good in desert weather
