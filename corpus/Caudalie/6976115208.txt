I have combination skin, more on the dry side than oily.  This serum is very gentle.  I use it during my morning and night routines.  It has a beautiful rose scent that doesn’t linger.  It has a milky-like look but is thinner.  While it absorbs, it gives my skin a tight feeling and glossy look. My skin doesn’t feel sticky.  I haven’t had any skin issues with this serum.  It is like it was made for my skin.  I really like it and will continue using it. Regarding the package, there wasn’t a cover on the top of the bottle.  It is a beautiful glass bottle with a twist dispenser. Twist to the right to open, press, and dispense, twist to the left to lock in place.  It has a six months expiration code.  I truly recommend it. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Hydrating Seum
