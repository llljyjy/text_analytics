This Premier Cru serum by Caudal√≠e has been wonderful for me so far.  The ingredients, including niacinamide, grapevine shoot extract, and grape seed extract, are so nice for anti-aging and I love that the serum is free of parabens, phthalates, silicones and is vegan.  The serum is light in consistency, almost like a very light-bodied lotion.  It absorbs beautifully and immediately makes my skin feel softer and more hydrated.  The scent is very light, and smells faintly floral like roses to me.  I love that the brand uses patented technology to combat aging, and the serum feels very premium.  I look forward to seeing more long-term results with continued use. #freeproduct Lovely serum!
