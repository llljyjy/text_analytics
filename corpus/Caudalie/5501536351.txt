Iâ€™ve been dealing with dull and uneven skin for quite a while now, and upon using this brightening glycolic night cream I have seen amazing results!! This night moisturizer smells so fresh!! I love how it absorbs into my skin not leaving a greasy feel or residue. My pores have shrunk due to using this night cream it actually controls my shine and also my skin is brighten and even toned!! Even Toned Happy Skin!!
