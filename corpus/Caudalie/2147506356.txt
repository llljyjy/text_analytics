I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox in exchange for my honest review. I am giving 4 stars only because the applicator gets a little messy/dispenses too much product. Otherwise this eye cream feels great/cooling when applied. It didn’t do a whole lot for my crow’s feet after 3-4 weeks of use, but drastically improved my dark circles and puffiness. Under eye skin texture and appearance has definitely improved Worth the price
