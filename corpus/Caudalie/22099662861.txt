I’m not afraid of fragrance, but this is overpowering. I didn’t even use it generously and it was too much for me. I also didn’t find it to do very much for my skin. I felt a little bit of moisture after applying but it’s not something I could sleep in. I have had my eyes on this for a while, so it’s disappointing. Especially as something that is supposed to be for dry, irritated skin. very fragrant.
