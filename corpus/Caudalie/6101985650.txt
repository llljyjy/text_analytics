I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox.  I didn’t know what to expect, but I definitely didn’t think I would experience any immediate results. My skin actually felt quite a bit smoother after only one use, but I didn’t notice a pore tightening affect and the smoothness of my skin was only temporary. I tried this yesterday afternoon and this morning, my skin feels back to the way it normally does.  The instructions say to use 2 times per week but I think I would have to use it daily for a noticeable difference. For that reason, and because it is so heavily scented, I wouldn’t recommend this face mask. nan
