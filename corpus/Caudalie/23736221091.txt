I still get pimples here and there, but it leaves a nice cold fresh feeling on your face without leaving you dry or feeling overly tight. Itâ€™s just right and has a nice mild scent ( not over powering). I have combo skin and occasionally break out a little bit here and there but this felt great and I would totally buy again. nan
