I wasn’t sure if I was going to like this. I initially just wanted the serum but I got a value pack that included the moisturizer. Honestly, i breakout super easily, but I started using the serum in the morning and the moisturizer at night and have seen a major improvement in my skin. It takes a bit of time for the moisturizer to sink into the skin and should be applied after you wash your face. But I’m going to buy a full sized because I really love it. Highly recommend, cleared my breakouts
