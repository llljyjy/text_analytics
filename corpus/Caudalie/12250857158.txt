I already love a few products by Caudalie. I love this packaging and texture. It is a pump bottle and the texture is thin and applies well. It helps my combo (dry to oily) skin type feel and look more balanced. My skin is also more firm and feels hydrated and nourished. It creates almost a perfect base before applying makeup and sunscreen.The only thing I did not notice was it didnt help my dull skin tone as I hoped it could brighten it. I used this exclusively for over 2 weeks. I still reach for this New Premier Cru Anti-Aging Serum over my other skincare currently. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Smoothing
