I have been using this moisturizer in combination with Caudalie Resveratrol Lift Firming Serum and my face has been living the results!  I am mid forties for reference and losing volume and elasticity. I have definitely seen a reduction in my fine lines and a more supple feeling and looking complexion. This moisturizer is thick and does go on a bit heavy, however, absorbs into your skin very nicely leaving a dewy soft glow.  I have stopped using my foundation this summer and have received many compliments about my complexion. I will definitely purchase this again!  #freeproduct Luxurious
