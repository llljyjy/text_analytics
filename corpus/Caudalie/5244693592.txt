Amazing mask. It is really instant detoxing. My skin got irritated and burned from using Ordinary ascorbic acid. I was feeling burning sensation even two days after using it. I also developed some painful rough textured patches and tiny bumps on my skin. Everything I was applying on my skin would revive this burning sensation. Anyway, I applied this mask and left for 10 min hoping that it will detox my skin. It really did . Burning and redness was gone immediately after I washed out my face. I applied BeautyBio Zenbubble Calming gel cream afterwards. Combination of both healed my skin. Love it. it healed my skin
