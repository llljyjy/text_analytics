I really REALLY wanted to love this product. I used it for over a month, and it broke me out so horribly. My redness and scarring just kept getting worse and worse. I tried to power through! The more I used it in the mornings, the worse it made my skin. Iâ€™m not sure if my skin is just sensitive and reacted poorly, but I was so upset. I hope this works for others, but sadly it was a no from me :( Broke me out SO bad
