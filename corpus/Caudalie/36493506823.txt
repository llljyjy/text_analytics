I received this #freeproduct from #TryItWithTopBox in exchange for my honest review.  Caudalie Resveratrol-Lift Firming Cashmere Cream has the perfect silky texture and creaminess to it without the heavy residue.  It quickly absorbs into the skin leaving behind soft, visibly smooth, and hydrated skin.  There is a faint herbal scent that disappears quickly and does not linger for any migraine triggers.  This cream lives up to its cashmere name as it feels luxurious and supple.  I can see this being a holy grail for people with dry/dehydrated skin but it might be too rich for oiler skin types. nan
