This toner smells lovely but it was drying and left my skin feeling tight in certain areas. I wasn’t sure how my skin would react with the alcohol content. It wasn’t terrible but it certainly wasn’t ideal or worth the money for me personally. If you have very oily skin it might work better for you. nan
