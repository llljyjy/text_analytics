I loved this cream! I only purchased a deluxe sample with my last order, which gave me 3ml of product and lasted approximately 2 weeks of twice daily use. I saw minor results after 3 days in the way of firmer skin (depuffing) and an overall brightness. I don’t suffer from super dark circles but a slight discolouration due to lack of sleep and aging. By the end of the sample there was a fair reduction in my crows feet and the small creases under my eyes. This is the first product I’ve used to actually minimize the lines below my eyes in any way. It’s good to keep in mind that when it comes to dark circles not a single product on the market can fix them if it’s hereditary- if the cause is aging (I.e thinning of the skin) or lack of sleep, then this product will absolutely help! Having said all of that it’s just way to pricey for me to justify buying this - but if you’re okay with spending this kind of money on an eye cream this one is absolutely one of the best out there. Amazing!!
