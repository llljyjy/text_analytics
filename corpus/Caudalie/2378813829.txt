This stuff smells ok (although I can also see how it might be slightly off-putting to some).  Unfortunately, I haven’t seen a tremendous difference in my skin since I began using it ..but then again, I use it only at night as the very final step in a somewhat fairly comprehensive skincare regimen.  As a final step moisturizer, it definitely leaves my face fairly greasy, so I don’t think I could ever use it during the daytime as a moisturizer under makeup — I’m afraid I’d be a huge oily mess.  But as a nighttime moisturizer, it does the job.  I bought it as part of a threesome (a package which also contains two other caudalie resveratrol lift products besides this one, a facial serum and an eye serum), and when I’m done using this particular jar of the moisturizer, I won’t be re-purchasing.  It hasn’t wowed me enough to re-purchase.  I have, however, really enjoyed using the resveratrol lift SERUM, which also came in that package.  I use the serum every night as part of my skincare regimen and really like it.  It’s not nearly as heavy or greasy as the cream (obviously, since it’s a serum), and supposedly resveratrol is excellent for skin, so I feel good using it.   I might re-purchase the serum, if it were available on it’s own ….but I’ll have to make that decision when I run out of this.., nan
