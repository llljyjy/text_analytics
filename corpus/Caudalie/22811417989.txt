I use this product every night but I will say it is not as hydrating as one would expect. It is a very, very thick night cream. I bought this because my skin was peeling due to acne medication, and I will say it did fix my peeling and my skin is now supple and soft. Still, it leaves a bit of a sticky, oily sensation on the skin and I would understand why some people do not like this.If you have extremely dry, peely skin and you need something to help it heal, Iâ€™d recommend this. nan
