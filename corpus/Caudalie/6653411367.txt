This product will forever be included in my skincare routine; I am so happy I found this mist & decided to give it a try! Because wow!! I know that because of this stuff, I am able to treat my acne as aggressively as I am without destroying my skin barrier! After applying my chemical exfoliate, I drench my face in this mist & then apply a face cream. I know this product makes all the difference, because once I ran out & was only relying on my face cream to help moisturize & protect, my skin was unable to handle my frequent acne treatment without causing irritation. As soon as I repurchased this product & starting using it again before a moisturizer, my skin barrier healed right up! Thank you Caudalie for this life saver!! Just Buy It!
