I received this #freeproduct from #Tryitwithtopbox and Caudalie in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using Caudalie’s Premier Cru serum for just shy of a month, and it’s been a wonderful addition to my skincare routine! My skin feels hydrated, plump, smooth, refreshed, and balanced. It plays well with my other products, which I appreciate, and doesn’t irritate my skin or eyes. The serum smells slightly floral and fresh but is clearly not an artificially fragranced product. I have combination skin, and this serum doesn’t dry me nor make my oily spots oilier. The packaging is beautiful and functional. I’m giving this four stars simply because of the price point and how often I’d have to repurchase. A little bit of product does go a long way, but using this for my daytime and nighttime routines would be a little above my budget. However, if this is within your budget, it’s a lovely serum, and I highly recommend it. Lovely Serum!
