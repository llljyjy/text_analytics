LOVE this product. I was originally using the hyaluronic acid from the Inkey list which is also great, but this one is less tacky and just feels so smooth on my skin. I put it on right after the shower or after I wash my face when my skin is still wet and it locks in the moisture quickly and never feels sticky! Iâ€™m on my fourth bottle and will keep using it twice daily! BEST hyaluronic serum out there
