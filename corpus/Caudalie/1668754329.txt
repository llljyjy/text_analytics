Mary refreshing and provides a light hydration to the skin, tones the skin, and tightens pores. Use after cleansing the face for best results. You can also use throughout the day even over make up. Iâ€™d like to use it first thing in the morning unclean fresh skin followed by a moisturizer and SPF. Great skin refresher
