I was 9 weeks postpartum and my skin was so dry that my face was literally peeling everywhere. I tried so many moisturizers and I just had to keep applying them throughout the day because they would not last. I tried using this as a last resort and it actually works great as a moisturizer. I do not have to reapply at all during the day and my face has gotten so much better. no more peeling (unless I don’t put it on). I do not care to look to see if it helps with dark spots or not. I’m just happy I don’t look like a shedding lizard anymore. Actually a good moisturizer
