I recently received this eye cream for free from TopBox Circle and Caudalie for my honest review. I have to say I apsolutley love how this cream feels. It goes on so smooth and the consistency of the cream allows you to not have to use a lot which is great. I also love the silver applicator that is very cold so it feels very soothing. I like to dab the cream under my eyes gently until it is fully absorbed. I have noticed that my eyes aren’t as puffy and fine lines are beginning to be less noticeable. I definitely recommend trying it. It’s worth it. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Works Great
