I’m a little jealous of all the people sharing their great experiences with this serum. This is one of the most expensive skincare product I’ve gotten and it did absolutely nothing for me. I started using this at a time when I was breaking out a lot more than usual which meant that there was plenty of hyperpigmentation to work on but I’m done with the bottle now, two months later and really no change. I did like that it felt nourishing and because of its creamy texture, a little goes a long way. Unfortunately for me though, I wasted my time and money. nan
