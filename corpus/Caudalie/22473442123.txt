Bought this because I desperately needed a face spray with fragrance to cover the horrible smell of a sunscreen and ended up falling in love with this product. I get beautiful glass skin when used in combination with my other products but keeps the oil production on the lower side. The smell is pleasant and dissipates after a little while. I don’t think I can live without this spray. My pores appear smaller as well. It’s also perfect for setting makeup and can spray throughout the day if needed Never thought I needed a face mist until this
