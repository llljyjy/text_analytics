i received this product from topbox to review, and honestly for a clay mask i definitely like it more than i’ve liked any other clay mask. I have dry skin so this product wasn’t exactly made for me, but it definitely does what it claims. I felt my pores were minimized and cleared of extra grime. And it’s definitely less drying than other clay masks i’ve used so that’s a big plus. overall if you like clay masks i’d recommend it! #freeproduct #trywithtopbox good for a clay mask
