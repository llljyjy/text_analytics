This stuff is amazing. It’s light feeling, moisturizing, and makes under your eyes feel nice and refreshed. I’ve tried a lot of products and think this is finally THE ONE! I’ve noticed a definite reduction in my dark circles and under-eye bags in just the two weeks I’ve used this cream. You only need a little, and it absorbs into the skin and is not greasy which is a plus. I love the lightweight and soothing feel as it goes on. It doesn’t irritate my eyes at all. Highly recommend. #freeproduct It works!
