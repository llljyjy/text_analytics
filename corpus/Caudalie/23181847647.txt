I’ve been using this for about a month now and am a fan, but not for the reason I bought it. I originally purchased the set, and enjoyed the mini moisturizer + eye cream!The serum hasn’t diminished my vertical forehead lines a ton, but does plump them and the rest of my skin up. It absorbs very well into the skin and brings luminosity to it as well, which is great since I can’t tolerate vitamin c at all. The most surprising benefit I’ve noticed has been the improvement of my dark acne marks! They have lightened up almost entirely since adding this to my routine. I also have not experienced breakouts from this product. The formulation is excellent, the benefits have been great, but the price tag is steep for a product that doesn’t improve fine lines as well as advertised. great for those who can’t tolerate vitamin c
