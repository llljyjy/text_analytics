This is a great serum, when I use it I notice fewer breakouts and definitely helps with smoothing. When I use it and follow up with a night oil, however, I do notice dead skin peeling off. Which I love, but Iâ€™ve never seen a serumdo that on my skin! So I subtracted one star because the instructions say to use morning and evening but I would definitely recommend against use in the morning, and also the smell is very strong. nan
