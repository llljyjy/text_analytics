Incredible cream for oily/combination skin. This cream truly brightens my complexion and leaves my skin feeling silky smooth and hydrated. Itâ€™s lightweight and perfect alone or worn under makeup. I have worn it at night and find my skin looks and feels visibly bright, plump and radiant. The packaging is also very convenient, needing only a micro turn to open and close the lid, making the application seem even more luxurious! Paired with the vinoperfect serum, my skin has experience brightening results that no Vitamin C has ever achieved for me! Trust the Harvard science - this stuff works! Move over Vitamin C!
