for reference: i have combo skin that is extremely sensitive. this product is not heavily fragranced and looks a pale pink color when applied. the consistency isnâ€™t super heavy or thick either, and all you need is a thin layer - which means it will last you a long time. i leave it on for ten minutes and there is no burning sensation or any feeling of discomfort. once you wash it off, you will immediately notice a difference after the first use. pores appear smaller and face looks fresh and feels smooth, without feeling tight or stripped of moisture. it also has helped with my redness and promotes a healthy glow. i use this once a week and can notice a significant difference in just a month. it lives up to the hype - buy it! :) amazing
