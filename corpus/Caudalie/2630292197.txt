I didn’t expect to love this product as much as I do. I found trail size while waiting to check out and thought I’d give it a try. What I LOVE is that it makes me skin look hydrated and refreshed without looking dewy or oily (a very fine line for me). However, and it pains me to do this, I had to take a star off because the smell hits my nose wrong. On paper, I love everything this should smell like but I have to hold my breath a few moments after spraying. A lot of people love the smell so I know I’m the outlier. But the product works so well - I’ll always have it on hand! everything but the smell…
