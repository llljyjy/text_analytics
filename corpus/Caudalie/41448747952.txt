I used the cream day and night in the morning and evening, to eye and lip contours.I didnâ€™t notice a scent and it absorbed fast. It felt very moisturizing and in the morning it helped with depuffing the undereye area. The applicator has a metal tip, that is removable and is nice and feels cold. It worked fine also under the concealer. I really love using it and I will continue using it. I would recommend it to a friend  #freeproduct I really liked it
