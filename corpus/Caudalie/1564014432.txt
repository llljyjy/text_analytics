wonderful glycolic essence, I love this product. It smells nice and feels nice on the skin. You can use it night and day but it is a bit too expensive to use it twice a day therefore I only use it in the morning.  I wish the price is not so much.  I donâ€™t know if I can afford it again. Great glycolic Essence but a bit pricey
