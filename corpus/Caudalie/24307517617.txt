I suffer from oily skin and enlarged pores. When I started to use the Caudalie Instant Detox Mask, I was completely shocked. Not only did it show a nice smooth surface on my skin (because of my pores) but it also made my skin feel less oily. I also learned that it would be a great idea for someone with my skin type to use this in the morning instead of nighttime. Unless you want to use it both times. The reason for that is that my skin gets oily even overnight no matter what I do. To sum it up, great product for oily skin and enlarged pores, great for soft smooth skin, and also a great product to keep excessive oils at bay. I did receive this product as a #freeproduct from #Tobbox. Where has this been my whole life?
