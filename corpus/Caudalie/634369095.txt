I’m thrilled with this new cream from Caudalie. It instantly made my entire face feel refreshed and rejuvenated.  After using it for weeks I saw improvement in my fine fines. The plumping effect helps minimize them (especially on my forehead where I get them most.) After cleansing I normally feel my skin tightening which is not pleasant.  By applying this cream both AM and PM my skin doesn’t feel tight or dry.  The cream truly is rich but I didn’t have any issues with breakouts. Rather, it has made my facial skin healthier looking than ever. I appreciate that you can get refills for the jar. This eco friendly approach is very appealing to me.  The scent is so lovely and lingers after putting on the cream.    #freeproduct #trywithtopbox nan
