Packaging - attractive minimalistic packaging - spa like. Mister works excellent - a nice fine mist.Scent - none that I can tell.Performance - this is not much more than water, so it is not a treatment product. I live in a dry climate, so I use it to pre-mist my face before applying serums and lotions (the same idea of wetting a sponge so it can attract more moisture). Can also be used as a setting mist. If I worked in an office, I may keep it in my desk to refresh due to drying AC. Fantastic staple
