I have used other Caudalie products in the past but I’m new to this Anti Aging Cream. I have been using this product for the past couple of weeks and so far I like it. I’m in my 40’s and have dry, dull skin. I also have some dark spots and fine lines. This cream is very rich. I only like to use it at night before bed because it tends to feel greasy and doesn’t absorb right away. However, when I wake in the morning my skin feels more hydrated. There is little to no scent and I appreciate the ingredients being “clean”. So far I have noticed improvements with my skin concerns for those reasons I would recommend. #freeproduct Very rich
