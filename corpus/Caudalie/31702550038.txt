Caudalie Premier Cru Dark Circle Correcting Eye Cream is a lightweight cream to use around the eyes and lip contours for anti aging! This cream goes along way when applying it so you only need a little. It is smoothing and hydrating as well. It helps with puffiness, brightening, fine lines and wrinkles and dark circles. Apply it to the eye area and smooth it around your lip contour morning and nightly. It is natural, vegan and fragrance free and safe to use. It is made with viniferine, to brighten the skin, and a blend of pearlizers, for luminosity and younger looking eyes. The tube is very easy to use and even has a removable tip for easy cleaning and application. I highly recommend the Caudalie Premier Cru Dark Circle Correcting Eye Cream for making my eyes and lips look and feel younger and brighter!I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion! nan
