Gifted by Caudalie and Topbox Circle I received the Premier Cru Rich Cream. It is a rich luxurious cream that is deeply nourishing.  My skin feels so hydrated and moisturized.   I like using it this time of year (winter), when my skin is more dry.  It does have a fragrance and I prefer fragrance free skincare products.  It is supposed to help correct signs of aging.  I am hopeful with continued use I will see my fine lines diminish.  I like that it is a clean brand and planet positive.  Key ingredients include hyaluronic acid and tightening sugars from honey locust.  #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Luxurious Cream with Fragrance
