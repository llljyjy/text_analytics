I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox I’ve been using it for a week! Thank you for giving me this opportunity to try this product for my honest review! I was gifted by @topbox & @caudalie this amazing products. This glycolic night cream it a heavy cream texture at my first impressions when I open it, but after I apply it on my face, it surprises me, it doesn’t feel heavy at all, very easy to apply all over, not greasy! After it absorbed, my skin feels so soft, moisturized, not oily! After a week of using I can see my dark marks are more even & smooth and more radiant! I love this night cream scent! Like some fruity scent! So comfortable! Because it contains AHA, so it can be only using in the night time routine, At the morning time routine must follow with sunscreen product at the last step! My skin has a bit of acne marks. I look forward to keep using it to reduce more of my acne marks! Brighten night cream
