I received this #freeproduct with #trywithtopbox and Iâ€™ve been using it for more than two weeks! Although it has glycolic acid it did not sting at all and it worked perfectly with the vinoperfect serum at lightening my dark spots! It also has the same fresh and fruity scent as the vinoperfect serum. The only reason I gave it a four is because it left my skin a little sticky. Worth your money!
