A great night cream that is not greasy but moisturizes your skin! I got this #freeproduct to try on from #trywithtopbox. It is hard for combination skin to choose a night cream that is not causing pimples and does not dry your skin. The texture is like ice cream, very smooth. I tried this with the dark spot serum, it gives you another layer for not only brightening but also moisturizing your skin. I live in an apartment and the heater makes my skin very dry, but my face feels still moisturizing when I woke up this morning. Love this night cream!
