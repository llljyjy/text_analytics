I received this #FreeProduct from #TopBox in exchange for my honest feedback, all opinions are my very own.  I am already a fan of Caudalie products so when i tried out their Premier Cru anti aging serum it was no surprise that I loved it. The serum is very easy to apply, thanks to its pump dispenser. I use 2 pumps but could probably get away with just one in order to preserve every last drop. The consistency is creamy, but not as creamy as a traditional moisturizer. It glades on so so smoothly and with it being so dang cold in Florida right now my skin just drinks it right up, leaving behind a healthy glow that screams “Look at me!“ After using the serum for almost 2 wks, the radiance was definitely noticeable. Even long after I applied the serum, I could tell my skin was softer and less parched/dry. Though I follow it with a cream moisturizer, I think on most days when its not so darn cold outside, this serum could be enough by itself. Also another great thing: this serum formula plays well with makeup, which is a must for me! I use this in the am and at night before bed. Overall this is an amazing product and I will continue to use in hopes my pesky expression lines and crows feet remain plumped and smooth and my complexion continues to glow! Hands Down Fabulous!
