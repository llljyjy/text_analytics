This cream is incredible. Topbox provided it to me for free in exchange for an honest evaluation. It’s suggested that you apply it in the morning and evening, but I only use it at night. Your skin will be well hydrated after using it. The consistency is rich and thick.Alittle goes a long way. The fragrance is quite mild.I’m a sucker for a good moisturizer, and this one has quickly become one of my favorites. #freeproduct Amazing!
