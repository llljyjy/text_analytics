I am a big fan of Caudalie skincare products. I use this serum in the evening to replenish my skin. I pat the serum into my skin, then add a night moisturizer or face oil to lock in the benefits. The subtle scent is wonderful and relaxing. The serum feels very good my dry skin and absorbs well into the skin. Looking forward to keep using it. #freeproduct Nice serum for dry skin
