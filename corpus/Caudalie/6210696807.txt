I received this Vinoperfect Brightening Glycolic Night Cream as a #freeoroduct from #trytopbox and I absolutely love it! This was my first experience with the Caudalie brand and I am very impressed. I use this cream at night and it goes on so smoothly and has a nice light scent. I’ve been using it for a couple of weeks and my skin tone is more even and bright. I’m definitely a fan and will use again! Perfection in a jar!
