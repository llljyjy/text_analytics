I hate that this is so expensive because it’s really great! If you have dry or irritated skin in any way, this is amazing. It’s also really good for the cold weather months. I use it every night and would use it every morning as well except I try to use it as little as possible because it’s so pricey. It is pretty heavenly on your skin :) nan
