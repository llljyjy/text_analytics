I like foaming cleansers and I really wanted to like this one as I have had great results with other  Caudalie products. Unfortunately, This cleanser irritated my skin and caused severe breakouts on both cheeks, chin and forehead. I has to use a cortisone cream to calm my skin and only use the Caludalie Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil. In less than a week, my skin calmed back down after I stopped using it. Iâ€™ll be returning the product. Too irritating
