This product is amazing. It is silky, spreadable, lightweight and super absorbant. I struggle with perioral dermatitis and this didnâ€™t give me flare ups. Plus, you get a lot for the price and a little goes a long way. It is made of clean ingredients and gives me an instant firm and glow. I find no residue left over, unlike many moisturizers that make me feel sticky afterwards and sit on top of my skin. Lightweight, Silky, Clean
