I actually like the serum but it hasn’t even been 1 month since  getting it and it’s almost gone. I’ve only been using 1 pump a day.. I think the serum was not filled all the way. I refuse to  believe a serum that’s encouraged to be used night and day will only last 20 days when used once. So using it twice a day will last you 15 days for 80 dls.I don’t feel I can go to sephora and return it.  So I don’t know if sephora sent me a used package or it was packaged like that from caudalie. Either way. Waste of money. This is the first negative review and I’m so disappointed. Used serum!
