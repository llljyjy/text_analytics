I truly love this mask! I have oily skin and when I use this, it sucks the oil out of my pores and makes them visibly smaller. I also find it to have a nice tightening effect. I struggle with acne and ever since I’ve been using this, I’ve noticed that I’ve had fewer outbreaks. There’s a nice but faint fragrance and all you need is a small layer so this will definitely last you for some time. nan
