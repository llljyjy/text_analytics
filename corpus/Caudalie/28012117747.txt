Love this cleanser so much. I feel like it deeply cleans without stripping, and is gentle at the same time. I feel like it’s really good at preventing break outs. I just wish the bottle was bigger or there was more product because it’s expensive for how little you get… hence the 4 stars. great but needs more product
