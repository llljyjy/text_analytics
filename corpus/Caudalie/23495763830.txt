I received this product #freeproduct and when I opened it the first thing I did was try it on my face without makeup... I forgot to shake it lol... the smell is of essential oils... I quite liked the product... then I’ve been using it after putting on makeup and I think it’s the step I like the most, it leaves my skin hydrated...I liked it a lot...thanks to #trywithtopbox for letting me try this beautiful product nan
