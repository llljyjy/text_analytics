This moisturizer is absolutely lovely if you have combo skin, more towards the oily side. It applies so smooth and sinks right in and gives me plenty of moisture through the day (for summer time) and keeps my oil mostly gone! So many other moisturizers clog my pores by the end of the day but this one hasn’t. It has a nice, subtle, earthy smell. I love that it’s also clean at Sephora but don’t understand why it has to be such a tiny tube of only 40mls! It’s hard enough to find good enough products for acne prone skin, if there were bigger options to buy it would definitely be 5 stars from me. Fantastic Summer Moisturizer for Combo Skin
