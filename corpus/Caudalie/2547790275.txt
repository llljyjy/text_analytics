Worth every penny! I had awful hyperpigmentation after a reaction to a face scrub and this stuff saved me. Within two weeks the dark spots were noticeably reduced. Because this serum acts like a vitamin c serum I would recommend not using it with any other active product — like ah acid — if you have sensitive / reactive skin. nan
