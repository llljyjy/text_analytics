This serum is so expensive….but when I tell you it is the ONLY serum I’ve used that is non- irritating on my sensitive skin, not greasy and it works. I’ve tried so many different dark spot correctors, vitamin c serums from so many different brands and I always come back to this one. Dark spots where??? Another positive is, it does last you a while and a little goes a long way. The simpler your routine with this the better. I cleanse, tone, use this and then follow with moisturizer. Hate the price, love the product
