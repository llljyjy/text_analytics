Received Caudalie premier Cru dark circle from #freeproduct #topbox for honest feedback in exchange. I used it in the morning and at night for almost a month and I can see some remarkable improvement with my dark circles. The puffiness was much better, and the circles are starting to fade. My favorite part about it is the applicator which makes it so easy to apply. My skin absorbs it so quickly, without sticky oily residue, so you can definitely use it under makeup. Love it so muchâ€¦.!!!
