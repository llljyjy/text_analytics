I really liked the old formulation of the SOS Intense Hydration Serum and went through many bottle of it as it was product I never liked to be without with my dry, sensitive and maturing This was my first time trying the new formulation and I was skeptical about the reformulation, but I found it to be even better at adding instant hydration to my skin without causing any sensitivity. I use it as the first step in my morning skincare routine after cleansing with a gentle cleaning water and it instantly adds the hydration my skin craves. After allowing it to sink in for a minute, I follow it a tiny ( 1 drop) amount of the Caudalie overnight recovery oil on my forehead and cheeks and finish my routine by applying Skin Fix triple lipid barrier cream. Ten minutes later I’m ready for makeup or not depending on my day. This is a product that I just wouldn’t want to be without. I’ve tried other serums but with my sensitive skin, I tend not to want to “mess with success“ when I’ve found it and this is a product that I never want to be without! Never want to be without this!!
