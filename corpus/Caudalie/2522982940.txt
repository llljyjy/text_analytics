I don’t normally write reviews but I love this stuff and needed to let others know! I’m a nurse and my “maskne” had gotten out of control. At the end of a 12 hour shift I’d come home with my face feeling like an oily mess and I swear like 3 new pimples each time. This serum has SIGNIFICANTLY decreased the severity of my breakouts as well as the number. I’ve also noticed a decrease in the size and number of blackheads on my face too. I put it on at the start of my day and the end and it makes my skin feel sooo smooth and clean. It has been my holy grail and I highly recommend it!! Also - a little goes a long way, you only need one pump for your entire face so the bottle has lasted me a long time. My holy grail!
