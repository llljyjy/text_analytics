I can’t wait to put this on at night! You need very little to cover your face as it’s a rich and creamy. You might feel a tingle for a minute or two but that’s the glycolic working it’s magic. Not much of a scent either. I wake up with the smoothest, softest skin. After about a month your skin looks firmer and brighter. I use on my décolletage as well. I use every night and doesn’t dry out my normal skin even in the winter months. nan
