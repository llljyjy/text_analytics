Wow what amazingly moisturizing is this Caudalie Premier Cru The Cream, is smooth and thick, nourishing and hydrating. Has a pleasant light fragrance, and spreads on very easily for a nice full coverage of face. absorbs very well and fast. Definitly enhance your skin tone, blurring your skin. I have been using it for a 2 weeks now, Iâ€™ve noticed visible skin improvements (like dark spots, firmness, dull skin) I love it!!. Really It makes my skin so beauty and soft!! Highly recommend. I received this product in exchange for an honest review.  #tryitwithtopbox amazingly moisturizing
