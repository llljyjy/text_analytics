I’ve been looking for moisturizer that is non irritating towards my acne prone skin and this product is everything I’ve wanted and more! It’s super easy to apply and absorbs well onto the skin. it’s gentle to use after cleanser and I love the smell of the product. I personally found that it alleviated my redness/itching more compared to clinique moisture surge or tatcha dewy skin cream. Accutane approved!
