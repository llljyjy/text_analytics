I love Caudalie and I wanted to love this. Sadly, it doesn’t clean out every bit of mascara (I don’t wear a lot of makeup and not even waterproof). I started to see some clogged pores on my chin, which never happens... I wanted something more hydrating then micellar water for the winter months but sadly, this isn’t it. Doesn't work out for me
