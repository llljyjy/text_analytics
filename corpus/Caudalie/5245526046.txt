This is a very good face moisturizer. It is medium thick so a little definitely goes a long way! This cream helps to keep my skin looking radiant and hydrated. Being that is is a thicker cream, you will have to blend it into your skin very well which means that this cream will last you a good while. I used this cream on my face and neck as directed every morning and evening. I didn’t use any of my serum’s because I wanted to see if the product delivers on its claims on its own and it did! My skin looks bright and youthful. I have gotten so many compliments on the look of my skin! I simply love the packaging and that it is in a dark glass jar. I don’t have wrinkles so I cannot attest to that claim. I was given this product courtesy of Topbox Circle for my honest review. #trytopbox #freesample Radiant looking skin!
