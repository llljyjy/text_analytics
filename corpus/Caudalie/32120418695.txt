This is a perfect winter cream. I love the thick richness of the cream as it leaves my skin feeling amazing without feeling too heavy. I have generally dry skin and I feel like this adds the necessary moisture and hydration, in addition to targeting signs of aging. I also love that it repairs the skin barrier. This one product does so much. I also love the gentle scent of rose! Overall feels luxurious and leaves the skin feeling and looking wonderful. Received this #freeproduct through #trywithtopbox. nan
