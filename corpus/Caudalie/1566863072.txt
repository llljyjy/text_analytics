I received the Caudalie Premier Cru Dark Circle Correcting Eye Cream from Topbox for an honest review.  I really enjoyed using the eye cream, it is very moisturizing. I have not noticed any drastic results in my under eye area, but have only been using for a week. The cream is unscented, the applicator is a little difficult to smooth out the product completely , but it’s very cooling on the under eye area. I’m hoping to see more results from the eye cream with continued use.  I would recommend this product if looking for a new eye cream that is moisturizing. Moisturizing
