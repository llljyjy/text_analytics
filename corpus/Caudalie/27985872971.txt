This is a well made product, super gentle and efficient. It feels like a treat as you are doing it and afterwards.  It is very calming and easy to use.  The texture is so gentle, feels therapeutic. The pump is poor quality but I can deal with that.  The bottle itself is very nice.   The scent is super gentle, you can barely smell it, it is a nutty clean smell.  Yes I do recommend it, yes I will buy again. Good creation
