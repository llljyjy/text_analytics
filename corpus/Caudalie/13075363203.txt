I’m totally floored by Caudalíe’s new formula for their Premier Cru serum.  I have always had reactive, sensitive skin, with a lot of redness, and anti-aging products usually make all of these problems much worse for me.  But I’m 43, so I’ve continued my quest for an anti-aging line that wouldn’t make me look like I have a sunburn.  I put this serum on before bed, and honestly, I wasn’t expecting any miracles.  But that’s just what I got.  I woke up the next morning, and could actually see a difference.  My skin was firmer, clearer, plumper, and softer.  My skin tone was more even, and best of all- there was no redness!  I’ve been using this for almost a week now, and I wake up every morning and look in the mirror with delight for the first time in a very long time.  Caudalíe nailed this one- for me, it does everything it claims and more.  Finally, an anti-aging skincare line that is powerful and gets results, but is gentle enough for sensitive/reactive skin.  I highly recommend this product! An Anti-Aging Line for Sensitive/Reactive Skin!
