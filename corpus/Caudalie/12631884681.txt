#trywithtopbox I received this as a #freeproduct and so happy I got to try it. This stuff works so good. Iâ€™ve only been using it for 4 days but can see a huge difference in my winter skin. I can see the difference after only a few hours of applying it. My skin soaked this serum up. My skin is bouncy and feels refreshed. A little bit goes a long way. The scent is very light and refreshing as well. Would definitely recommend and would love to try more of this brand. So hydrating and refreshing
