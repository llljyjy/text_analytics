This was my first time trying a Caudalie product and let’s just say I am blown away. At least this eye cream is FABULOUS!  I did receive this product complementary in exchange for my honest review and I’m honestly in love with it! I struggle with dark circles as well as bags under my eyes and I saw improvement after ONE use. I love the nice creamy consistency but the BEST part was the metal applicator! I put mine in my mini beauty fridge and look forward to it soooo much every day. It’s a must have that I highly recommend. I feel like Ive tried every eye cream ever and I haven’t seen this much improvement ever actually. Thank you topbox and Caudalie! Incredible! Bye dark circles !!
