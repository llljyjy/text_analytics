A friend of mine gave me a nearly full bottle of this that she wasn’t using, and it’s quickly becoming one of my favs! It’s so refreshing- I use it to perk up my skin midday and it feels so nice. It’s so refreshing and smells nice, plus it leaves my skin so happy and dewy. Probably going to need my own bottle when this one’s gone!! Refreshing and leaves skin so dewy
