I received this gift from #trywithTopBox as a #freeproduct in exchange for a review and have been using it daily at night after my shower for about a month. It’s not long enough to tell if there are long-term benefits to this serum, but I do like the way my skin feels immediately after application. The serum is light and absorbs well and does not pill under any of the moisturizers or sunscreens I’ve tried on top. The light floral or rose scent is pleasant and not overpowering and the packaging is simple but classy and looks good on my vanity. While I do think it’s a lovely product overall, in my opinion it’s not special enough and doesn’t give as much immediate improvement to justify the steep price. I think it’s only because it’s a brand name that people would pay premium for, but I’m sure you could find the equivalent in a more budget-friendly brand as well. Good product, but could find more budget-friendly
