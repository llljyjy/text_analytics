I am a big fan of Caudalie.  I love the precision and care they put into their products; it’s clear they make every decision about what to include in each formula very carefully.  They take so many factors into consideration, too, so their products are vegan, plant-based, and always 100% cruelty-free!  I love that I can trust them not to harm animals just to make me look a little younger.  So I was delighted to have the opportunity (#freeproduct) to try two Caudalie products from their new Premeir Cru line:  The Cream and Eye Cream.  I have been using both products for the last five weeks, and I have to say, I think I’m even more in love with this brand!  Products in this line target the eight most common signs of aging, and claim to reduce fine lines and wrinkles, increase firmness, elasticity, and radiance, brighten dark spots, boost hydration and plump skin overall.  And while I can’t say that I noticed specific improvements in each of those areas, I certainly have been noticing that my skin looks better, somehow.  Clearer, brighter, more hydrated.  I only use The Cream at night because it’s fairly thick and occlusive, but it feels very smooth and silky on my skin.  It doesn’t absorb right away, but takes a minute.  It has only a light scent that doesn’t irritate my skin or my nose.This product has been a dream to use.  Without question, I will continue to use it indefinitely.  Eight is my lucky number, and this stuff targets eight signs of aging.  Coincidence?  Who cares?!  And something else I am really excited about is Caudalie’s refill and recycle program.  Not only is all Caudalie packaging recyclable, but you can refill your glass jar with a new pod refill.  Just another reason to love Caudalie!  Really, I can’t recommend this product enthusiastically enough.  Try it and I’ll bet you’ll fall in love, too!  #trywithtopbox Eight is my lucky number!
