I was excited I got to review this face cream. It was love from the first time I tried it. Its so smooth and absorbs into the skin quickly, leaving face hydrated and glowing all day.  After a couple day of uses this product I noticed it visibly reduced my fine lines and my skin appears plumper after every use. The fragrance is not overpowering. I use it during the day and at night after serum and it works well with all my products as well. #freeproduct#tryitwithtopbox nan
