I use this as a toner in the morning and to refresh my skin on no makeup days. I have oily/normal skin and this feels slightly astringent, enough to keep oil at bay, and doesn’t irritate my skin at all. I’ve been using this for years and love it. The smell is very herby and natural. It may not be for everyone, but I love this stuff! nan
