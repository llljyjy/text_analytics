Loved the spray, but the spray function broke after about a month and a half. I had to toss it because I couldn’t get it to work anymore. But, this is a great mist and didn’t cause any breakouts for me. I used this right before I applied my face serum and it really worked nicely with it.I recommend this product, but they’ve gotta fix the spray function. nan
