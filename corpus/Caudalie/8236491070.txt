got this #freeproduct from#trywithtopbox. I have used caudalie products in the past and have always liked them. I thought this was a very good eye cream. It had very little fragrance and it was not to thin. The cream had a nice consistency and I like that the tube had a flat cooling metal applicator to put it on with, it helped with puffiness. The cream definitely smoothed out my creases and blended in really well without any irritation to my eyes. My only caveat is that it is a smaller size for the 79.00 price tag, otherwise I think itâ€™s a great product Hardworking eye cream
