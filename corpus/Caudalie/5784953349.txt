This serum has a lightweight texture that’s easy to apply and gets quickly absorbed into the skin. Leaving a smooth finish that’s good for laying with other skincare products. I have been using this day and night for about 5 weeks and I like that it’s kept my skin looking smooth without any texture and in balance. It has a list of 27 ingredients including niacinamide (4th), plant extracts, and fragrance (towards end of the list). It has a very subtle scent that’s barely noticeable. nan
