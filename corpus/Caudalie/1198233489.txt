It feels weird to be writing a review of canned water, but here we are. That said, I LOVE IT. (let me remind you, I’m still talking about a can of water) It’s been a surprisingly great addition to my skincare! I’ve never used a facial mist but got a recommendation for this one; I spray it between layering skincare (except Retin-A! Water deactivates it. Or tears a hole in the space-time continuum. I can’t remember, but it’s bad) YOU GUYS. This is going to sound weird (because still, can of water) but putting serums and moisturizer on damp skin has vastly improved the texture and look of my skin. Plus, and I have to assume this is the grapeness part, it’s really soothing. Tbh though, I’m skeptical about the grape claim. For funsies my husband and I tasted it; it tastes like water. From my tap. I guess I was expecting something a little more Welch’s, while secretly wishing for something a little more Two-Buck Chuck. Soothing, actually helpful for skincare!
