I received this #freeproduct from #trytopbox and I’m so happy . This brightening glycolic night cream works well for dark spots and hyperpigmentation. I use this together with the serum and it works magic . This night cream is lightweight but hydrating. It soaks into my skin nicely and it’s not sticky at all . I can definitely see my skin looking brighter and my dark spots and hyperpigmentation is fading . I highly recommend this product if you have uneven skin tone . nan
