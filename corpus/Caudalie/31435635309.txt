I bit the bullet and splurged with the highest of expectations and after only a couple of uses I can confidently say this facial cream sets itself apart from any I have every used. FYI: It has a mild rosy scent, but not too overbearing as it fades nearly 15 mins after application. Despite being outrageously expensive..it’s important to note that a little goes a very long way. You only need a pinky scoop for decent coverage. I’m thinking that it may be best to forgo purchasing other serums and toners, and just use this from now on. May end up saving more money in the long run as this moisturizer addresses all my skin care needs thus far. Strongly recommend seeking out a sample or give it a shot and return it if you’re not satisfied! You get what you pay for!
