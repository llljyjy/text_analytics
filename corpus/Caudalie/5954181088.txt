Since using Beauty Elixir Face Mist, I  see a major difference in my pore size. I spray my face and neck immediately after washing to help calm and close my pores. My face now has a natural, balanced glow. The smell is so refreshing and mellows to a light, fresh scent. Iâ€™m going to put it in the fridge once the weather warms up to cool my face on hot days. Thank you for providing a quality product. I recieved this as a #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Refreshing and smells amazing
