A wow serum. I was having a bad breakout from Charlotte Tilbury setting spray(stay away). So, I decided to use a sample of this as I had good experience with other serum from Caudalie in the past. It made my skin heal about 70% in just 24 hrs. It is pricey, but definitely considering buying it in the near future. Strong healing property
