I had a really great experience with this cream. It was very moisturizing and I didn’t experience any breakouts or skin irritation! It’s free of dimethicone, which was a huge plus for me! l like the fragrance - it’s not heavy, it’s refreshing and light, but it may be a put off for some people. Another great experience w/ Caudalie
