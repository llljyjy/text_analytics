#freeproduct #trywithtopboxI received this product in exchange for my honest opinion because I am well known for giving an unadulterated and unwavering opinion to my friends and followers.  Usually, I have a pretty easy time in reviewing products as they are either great or terrible. This particular firming moisturizer just wasn’t as easy. To begin, I love vegan products but it has been my experience that alternatives never work as well as the original and I found that to still be true in this case. The resveratrol is a vegan collagen alternative which does work to a degree and has some benefits but the original is still king and I would have preferred to see that in this product. However, this product kicks behind at moisturizing and leaving skin feeling like a billion dollars. It is the hyaluronic acid content and the way they have formulated the whip of the cream. It feels like you are wearing silk and your skin just had a big tall glass of water. This does have a higher price point and I would buy it simply for the hydration and skin conditioning but it wouldn’t be my go to for collagen benefits. Feels like cashmere on skin!
