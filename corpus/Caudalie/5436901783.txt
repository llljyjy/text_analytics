New favorite for underneath my eyes. Under my eyes often looks tired, dark, and baggy. However, this has helped brighten it right up. I am noticing the lines underneath my eyes fade away and the area is much smoother and firmer than before. I use this product in the morning and evening right before (sometimes after) my moisturizer. The applicator that comes with the product is also unique and cool which helps with any under eye swelling. 5 stars. #freeproduct New favorite
