Wonderful moisturizer. I was looking for a moisturizer for dry skin, that had anti aging components, and that was in Sephora’s clean category. I almost didn’t buy it because of some peoples comments about the smell. I went into Sephora and smelled it before purchasing. It’s slightly florally but not a bad smell. Totally worth it, my skin feels so soft and also has a bit of a glow. I use this in combination with the sos serum. nan
