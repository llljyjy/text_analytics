i’ve never had a face mask go on so nicely. i feel no irritation at all and my skin has always been so sensitive. definitely worth a try! it doesn’t leave your skin feeling dry either. definitely not a very good price considering the size (expected it to be bigger for some reason) but other then that! nan
