I was able to try Caudalie Cru Anti Aging Cream Moisturizer and I’m highly impressed. I use this cream day & night as part of my skincare regimen. I noticed my skin overall is hydrated and appears more plump. I really enjoy the fragrance of this product as well. It’s definitely a splurge but worth it. A little product goes a long way too. I received this product as a free sample in exchange for my honest review. Results you can see
