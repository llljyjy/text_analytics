Just started using a new tretenoin formula and using this as a toner in the morning has helped with sensitivity. Spray and let dry down a bit and proceed to add Maelove The Hydrator Serum really Amos up moisture level and calms skin down so I can proceed with the balance of my skincare. Great when using tretenoin
