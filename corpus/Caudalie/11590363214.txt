I have tried and loved other Caudalie products and this one was no exception. It has little scent, absorbs quickly and leaves the skin very hydrated without leaving it greasy. I thought that because it was heavier and more nourishing it could cause me breakouts since I have combination skin but quite the oppositeâ€¦ I use it at night and I feel my skin smoother and more radiant. I like that it has the refill option. #freeproduct Great Rich cream
