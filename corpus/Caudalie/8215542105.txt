I love this moisturizer because it’s one of few that’s moisturized enough for my dry skin even in the winter months. It only take a small amount to cover my whole face so the price is more then reasonable. I found it to absorb easily and didn’t have a bad reactions with my somewhat moody hormonal acne. I highly recommend and will be repurchasing. Wonderful
