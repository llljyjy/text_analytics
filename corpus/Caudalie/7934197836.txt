The Caudalie Beauty Elixir Face Mist really helped sooth some of my skin flair ups and had me feel like my skin was clean and prepped for any other products that will be going on during my skin care routine. The only downside I have about this product is how strong the smell is. It smells quite herbal, and despite that being a scent I love, for me, this was too strong of a smell for going directly on the face. nan
