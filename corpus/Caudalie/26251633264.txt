I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox to try on my daily skincare routine, and I know I am always excited to try Caudalie products.I apply it at night after Caudalie Vinoperfect Radiance Dark Spot Serum, the texture appears thick and rich at first, but it feels light and non-greasy on my skin.My skin has recently become very dry, so this cream provides additional hydration and moisture that my skin requires. For me, the scent is pleasant and soothing. This cream gives my face a matte finish with a natural glow, which I like. My skin feels smooth in the morning, and after repeated use, my skin appears brighter and healthier. Rich cream that gives natural glow
