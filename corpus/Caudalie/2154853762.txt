I was so looking forward to trying this Caudalie Premier Cru: The Eye Cream. And it did not disappoint. I am new to the Caudalie brand. I have some fine lines and dark circle correcting needs.Ingredients include Viniferine anti dark spot treatment found in grapevine sap, Tet8 co-patented technology created with Harvard Medical School in joining Resveratrol and Honokiol green extraction of Magnolia to addresses (8) visible signs of aging such as Crowâ€™s feet, puffiness, lip wrinkles, fine lines, elasticity, nutrition, hydration, and radiance. This Tet enzyme repairs the skin by reversing the aging process. And a blend of pearlizers for eye brightening. I like how it is light diffusing to help with the appearance of aging.   Plus the ingredients to help address the signs of aging. Working on the outside and inside at the same time.It has a luxurious feel. I love the metal applicator of this product. Massaging tip. The metal tip is removable for easy cleaning. It feels so wonderful to pat into the skin. Smooth and cool on the skin. Non-irritating. Fragrance free. Easy to incorporate the cream into your skin. It does plump and brighten the eye area. I like how it is safe to use on the eye lid as well. It feels very nice.  Great luminosity in providing radiance around the eye area. Great product with anti aging benefits plus hydration.I am impressed with this product thus far and highly recommend. I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox to try it and give my honest review. Luxurious feel - great science backed ingredients
