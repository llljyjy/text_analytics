I love Caudalie skincare products and I’m very happy with those products that have tried. I have never tried the Premier Cru line and I’m very excited to receive this Premier Cru The Eye Cream for free from #trywithtopbox This product is unlike other products I have used previously, the tube comes with a very special built in applicator. This is super convenient for me to apply the eye cream cleanly and precisely. The flat surface of the applicator acts as a massager to help smooth and even out the cream for greater distribution. It also helps massage the skin around the eyes in order to smooth out those unwanted fine lines and wrinkles. This great feature of the applicator allows me to gently massaging and relaxing the skin and muscles around the eye contour.By using the cream consistently with the use of this new applicator nightly, I can see quite an improvement in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Those lines looks a lot smoother and firmer, and less visible than before. My under eye bags also looks improved as the skin looks flattered, more plumed and less tired.The cream is very smooth and creamy, and it works surprisingly well and effective in keeping the skin moisturized, hydrated and very well nourished. Thanks. nan
