Beautiful. I usually avoid products with hyaluronic acid because they usually overdo it in my opinion, and HA can be very irritating if it isnâ€™t humid enough (without humidity HA will actually suck water OUT of your skin). or because it may cause other ingredients to penetrate your skin more deeply. This is extremely soothing due to the grape water, and I absolutely love it. My skin reacts to everything, but Caudalie has been very gentle. I would recommend this brand for reactive skin. Sensitive, reactive, redness prone skin.
