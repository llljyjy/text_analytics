I. LOVE. THIS. Nothing has worked for my dark spots. With melanated skin I thought you would need something potent. I have tried so many vitamin C serums, exfoliants, etc. All of them break me out or make me wear sunscreen that breaks me out or makes my skin sensitive or red or bumpy....this doesn’t. This is a sun-safe dark spot corrector. Aka you don’t NEED spf with it (but obviously still wear it). And not wearing spf DOESN’T worsen your dark spots. It may be pricey but it works well for me and I’m definitely restocking when I’m out! I have oily skin and this absorbs quickly and doesn’t make my skin feel oily, clogged, or heavy. I love it! brown skin girls--you need this!!
