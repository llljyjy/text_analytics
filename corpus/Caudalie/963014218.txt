I received #freeproduct of Caudalie’s Vinoperfect Brightening Glycolic Night Cream from #trywithtopbox. This is an excellent, luxurious treat for the face and neck. It has a clean, fresh scent. It makes my skin smooth and immediately hydrated upon application. I’ve noticed my face is much brighter and my dark spots are fading away. It is also great on the backs of the hands to keep them bright and fade dark spots. As usual, I am highly impressed by Caudalie. nan
