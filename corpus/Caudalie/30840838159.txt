I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox in exchange for my honest feedback. This night cream is thick and luxurious! A little goes a long way. I applied every night after cleansing my face. Waking up to radiant and softer skin! Noticing my dark spots are less visible and my skin is looking so much better! Non irritating and be sure to use SPF every day as this contains AHA and may increase skin sensitivity to sun. Light scent to night cream and pleasant. Loved it! Wonderful night cream!
