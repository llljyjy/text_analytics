Caudalie Resveratrol-LiftFirming Cashmere CreamThese are newest creams in the facial care line of Caudalie Resveratrol-Lift. These creams can be implemented in your nightly routine. I like it because it is a vegan alternative, it contains collagen and hyaluronic acid, which gives my skin a lot of firmness. This cream also contains grape oil enriched with omega 6 and olive so my skin feels very soft in the mornings. Most of its ingredients are natural, plus I enjoy its rich aroma of chamomile and lavender. It’s my first experience with Caudalie and I’m very happy with the results after two weeks! Winner winner !
