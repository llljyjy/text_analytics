I got this Caudalie Premier Cru Rich Cream and I loved it. It is like a whipped Rich, creamy moisturizer. I applied to my face and neck as well as my hands almost daily in the morning and evening. It is gentle and lightweight but felt a little thicker. My skin absorbed it quickly without having a greasy or oily residue after. It has a good light scent that is not too overpowering. It made my skin feel so soft and newly refreshed and just so nice. Highly recommend. I love the Caudalie brand and this one is a very good and very rich Cream that I will continue to use. #freesample Loved it!
