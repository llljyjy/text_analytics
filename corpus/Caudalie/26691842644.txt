I have a dry skin and this product makes my skin moisturized and hydrated.. Also waking up in the morning with plumper skin.. Im using this product twice a day, morning and evening.. This cream actually feels good on skin and it feels luxurious.. You only need a little amount of this cream for your face and neck coz a little goes a long way.. So easy to apply and spread on skin.. My skin feel so soft, smooth and glowing.. This product has light pleasant smell that fades away in a minute or two afrer applying.. The packaging looks nice and comes with a dark purple glass bottle.. The cream is thick and rich that melts on skin without sticky feeling or tacky and heavy.. A very lightweight light cream.. Iâ€™ve been using it for two weeks and im loving it.. Good for dry skin!!
