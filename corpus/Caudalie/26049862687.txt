I have oily skin and trust me this works best for oily skin too. I’m not sure if someone who has oily skin, already tried it or not. But this works best because the texture is not thick, the same as Kiehl’s and it absorbs well plus gives a natural glow. I like this moisture. Good for oily skin toooo
