Not happy with this eye cream. I hesitated to purchase because of the price (on a pension) but  the cosmetician had me sold. I have yet to find a Cream to help the bags under my eyes. I feel way older than I really am. The one thing I did love was the applicator. I’m the Queen of creams and I was so disappointed to find this didn’t help. Lesson learned nan
