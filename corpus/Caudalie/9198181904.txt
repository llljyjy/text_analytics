This is a wonderful serum with a very lightweight smooth and silky texture. I love that it is unscented and from the very first overnight use I noticed a significant difference in my skin. It definitely made my skin tighter and brighter. My uneven skintone is barely noticeable. It can be used day and night but Iâ€™m mainly using it as part of my night time skin regimen. So far I love it and i cannot wait to make this a skincare staple to my beauty wardrobe. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good anti aging serum. Magic in a bottle!
