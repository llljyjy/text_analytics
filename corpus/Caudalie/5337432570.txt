This is my new holy grail. Originally received as a sample and was hooked, I just had to purchase. Lightweight yet so soft, smoothing, and silky on the skin. Creates a bright youthful glow. It really is radiant. A little goes a long way. Perfect in the morning and at night, as well as under makeup. It smells so nice too, if you don’t mind a pear like scent. It’s worth noting the set that comes with the toner, full size serum, and moisturizer is the same value as the serum alone. (which are nice but the serum is by far superior). Love this stuff! It really is radiant.
