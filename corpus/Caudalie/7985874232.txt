I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox about 2 weeks ago. I’m using it with  the serum and I can see visible difference in my skin. Dark spots are diminishing and skin is more brighter and glowy. I am hoping that it would work on my acne marks too. Texture is little dense but that’s make it perfect for night time use. Scent is not overpowering and doesn’t feel greasy on skin. Definitely recommend to everyone who needs some solution for dark spots. Worth it
