Personally I would not get this again, I like how it’s a lightweight gel because it’s breathable. But like a lot of the reviews, the product came off when I was putting face sunscreen on. This hasn’t happened before with any other moisturizers. So I wouldn’t not suggest it under makeup, maybe on its own. nan
