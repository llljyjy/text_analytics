I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox in exchange for my honest opinion. This face and neck Premier Cru cream claims to target and visibly improve the 8 signs of aging.

I love the rich thick texture and the very light but pleasant scent. Another thing I really loved about the product is the beautiful purple jar is refillable. I think the label sums it up beautifully as it states...“Beauty from the vine. Effective, natural and eco-friendly.“ Beauty from the vine
