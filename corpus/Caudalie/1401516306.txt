I really enjoy this product. I have been using this product since it was a Sephora birthday gift (will assume 5+ years now and more). I am aware that they changed their formula recently so I was a little concerned about whether it was still a good product for my skin, but after trying the new formulation, no issue here.Overall, I find this serum great for giving you that even toned, glowy skin from within. I have on occasion noticed that it had helped with some new blemishes I get on my skin but for the old ones that I have it did not change much. With that being said though, I have sensitive, combination and eczema skin and for a long time I wasn’t able to get anything onto my skin without getting some sort of reaction, so this product really changed my skin care game, and was really the beginning for me. Though I really enjoy this product and stand behind the 5 stars, I would say that price for the amount you get isn’t a lot and often wished that I could get a larger size of this. In addition, because of the texture of the product, to get the remaining few drops out can take some work but I hate to waste so I make do the best I can. I have over the years tried to replace this product with other products to see if I could go cheaper but in the end, I still end up coming back to this product. staple product for me for 5+ years
