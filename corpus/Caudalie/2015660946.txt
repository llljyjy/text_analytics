I used this product for a month, honestly didnâ€™t notice a difference.  It gave me two of the nastiest pimples ever, one on my cheek under my eye and also one along side the bridge of my nose.  I finished the whole bottle and have been using the moisturizer so I believe it was this that gave me those gross pimples.  Not worth the money ! Ehhhhh
