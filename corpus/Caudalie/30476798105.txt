I could give this product 10 stars I would! It is the best facial product I have ever used, EVER. I have combination skin now more on the dry side, with many fine lines. This is a light to medium weight cream and I use it at night. Refreshing light natural fragrance and I have borderline sensitive skin and have never had any sort of reaction to it. Itâ€™s perfect as a top layer night cream, I layer it over a vitamin C serum. Love it!! #trywithtopbox #freeproduct Wonderful product
