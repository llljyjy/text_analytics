I received this product for free from top box to try it out and give an honest review! Pretty good stuff, absorbs grease from the skin very well. Perfect for oily and combination skin, maybe not for dry skin. Great for use before applying makeup, and also perfect for maintaining a healthy, controlled skin without excess oils. I use the product during the afternoon hours, twice a week. The smell isnâ€™t great, I prefer fresh or scented products for my face, however it does get the job done. I give it 4 out of 5. #TryWithTopBox #FreeProduct Good for oily and combination skin!
