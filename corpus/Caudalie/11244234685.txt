I haven’t used a clay face mask in ages before I purchased this during the sale, and the results after washing this clay mask off was certainly shocking. First of all, the fragrance is minimal, expected of a face mask, and the texture is smooth and thick which makes for an easy spread. After 10-15 minutes when it dries it turns from a orange shade to a milky sage color, and becomes hard to the touch. It’s easy to take off, and when the face is pat dry, the smoothness of the skin, and lack of noticeable porous texture is pretty stunning. Now this isn’t going to take away texture, but what I found was that on my cheeks where the pore is quite visible, had looked to be cleaned and therefore not as noticeable. I do periodically exfoliate but this had an immediate result and my skin felt smoothed and uniform across the face. Now I am always skeptical of products and reviews that have hefty claims of taking away pores or shrinking them, but at the very least this made my skin look uniform in terms of porous texture - it was still there but looked cleaned and therefore less noticeable. Definitely a once a week mask I will enjoy! Perfection
