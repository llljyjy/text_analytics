I’ve been using this product for a few weeks now and this Caudalie Premier Cru La Creme Riche is amazing and has the right consistency and texture and moisturization, it makes my skin look and feel so soft and plump after using. This refillable jar, has a lovely light fragrance to it but not too strong. Known to target 8 signs of aging. It helps to improve the look of my skin’s firmness, tone, smoothness, clarity, fine lines and deep wrinkles. I’ve been using it for a few days, day and night and I can see and feel the difference in my skin’s overall appearance. I highly recommend. My facial friend
