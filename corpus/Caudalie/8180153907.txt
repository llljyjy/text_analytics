I have never tried a firming cream or antiaging products before. I have been using this for about a month & a half. I was skeptical that it would do anything but I have noticed a definite difference in my skin. My wrinkles & lines are not as deep as they were before & it seems to have plumped up my skin. I use this every night with the Caudalie Lift Serum. It is very lightweight & has a very faint scent. It moisturizes very well&  I have had no issues with irritation or breakouts. I would definitely recommend. I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox It works
