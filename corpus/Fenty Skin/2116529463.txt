only downside is the smell. it doesn’t smell bad, just extremely strong and i tend to shy away from fragrances. nothing beats the FAB coconut water cream but i like that this has spf in it for gloomy days where i don’t want to wear a separate sun screen. i reach for this on days where i know i’ll be indoors mostly, but still want sun protection just in case! fragrance is very strong
