Bite Beauty agave lip mask was my favorite all time lip mask, since Bite Beauty went out of business I haven’t found anything that compares until this product. The texture is more of a salve but not as wavy as Vaseline, great to wear to bed. The scent is generically sweet but not overpowering and doesn’t linger. Not hint of mint and no burn like some other lip products, it doesn’t really taste like anything. The one star taken off because it really is tiny and the packaging is a little extra for no reason that I can discern as we still have to touch it, not as hygienic as it presents, like include a spatula would have been good or just use normal packaging.
