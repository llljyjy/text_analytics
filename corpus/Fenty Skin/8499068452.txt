The Milky Toner Essence is a great skincare product to add to your routine. It has a wonderful feel that is, well, divine on the skin. It calms down irritation, inflammation, tightness, creating a protective skin barrier against environmental factors and leaving the skin plump and dewy. Makes my makeup have a nice glow to it. I was a little apprehensive since I’ve only used the makeup brand but I am impressed! A bit pricey but I recommend it. Perfect under the fenty foundation ❤️
