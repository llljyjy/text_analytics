The product is easy to use and I appreciate that the applicator is included in the item as well. The only flaws I have in this product is that the towel is a little inconvenient to dry, it wouldâ€™ve been easier if there was only one side to the scrubber instead of the entire thing getting wet. I only noticed that it had a weird smell that would linger on my face as well directly afterwards. Besides this, the item has left my face with a glow and I will continue using it for better results. Weird Applicator but Good Results
