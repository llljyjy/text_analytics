I definitely like the product but I do not love it. I really like the scent, it’s very freshening. You can definitely smell the scent on yourself after the shower. I really like how easily the bar gets foamy, it truly lathers me. I was blown away by how easily and how much foam the bar creates, a lot more than your typical bar of soap. The only downside I found, the bar does not moisture my body. I think the bar excessively stripped my body of oils. I would have to hydrate with a heavy body lotion. I really wanted to love the product because it works in every aspect except for moisturizing your body. I would recommend this product to someone who is extremely active and wants their body totally clean. I would not recommend using this product on your face, it’s a bit drying. Overall, I would use this cleaner on my gym days. Good Smell
