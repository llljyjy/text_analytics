This lip oil is pretty awesome! I love how moisturizing it is, it doesn’t just provide a protective barrier that wears off, but actually conditions your lips. When I read “lip oil” I was expecting something with more of an oily texture, but this definitely feels more like a classic lip gloss…some kind of runny gel emulsion. I’m cool with that though and have no complaints. It's poppin,’ it's poppin’
