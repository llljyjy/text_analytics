First of all, the scent is heavenly. Itâ€™s so light and fresh and makes me skin feel amazingggg! Second, a little goes a long way which is impressive to me because I have dry and flaky skin that is usually hard to please when it comes to spf moisturizers. But this one is perfect. Earth friendly refillable packaging is a nice touch. Thank you RiRi :D love love love!
