I like this product but there isn’t a lot of it and I don’t think it’s worth the price. It’s nice, it works, it smells good but not overpowering but it isn’t the most long lasting lip treatment I’ve tried and it isn’t the best working lip treatment I have tried. The applicator is a little large for the opening so I have to dip in and out a couple of times to get the amount of product that I want. The applicator is an interesting shape that works well. I wish that there was either more product or that this was a cheeper product, I just wouldn’t buy it full price because I do not think it’s worth it. It's fine
