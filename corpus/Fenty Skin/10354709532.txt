After using this product for the past few weeks I love it. I have not used another lip mask that feels as good on this one. In the winter my lips get dry and they started getting dry and I started using this and the felt so hydrated and soft. The scent is amazing too. I normally use the laneige sleep mask but I like this one so much better. I received this product as part of the sample program but when I run out I will definitely buy it again because I love it so much. I will definitely recommend this product to anybody who is looking for a good sleep mask I love it. A must in my routine
