Received this product from a free sample program. This bar smells delicious like cocoa when you first open it! It’s a really good size for a cleansing bar. The cocoa smell does fade away once you get it wet and smells like a generic soap. I do wish it could’ve kept its cocoa scent in the shower. It gives off a beautiful rich lather leaving the skin soft and did not give me that dry feeling after showering. I’m not a fan of most cleansing bars but I will definitely continue using this one and I’m sure it will last me a while! Cocoa Scent!
