This smells lovely to me but I do love a luxuriously scented face cream now and then. I thought it smelled orange creamsicle-y in a mature way and not too strong, but I can see how it could be too much for some people. Zero white cast. It is light and smooth, not heavy or greasy but it makes me look too shiny. The overall feel doesn’t match the look of it on the skin. I might have repurchased if it was spf 50 but would use mostly on the body. However I ultimately decided it wasn’t worth it because applying it to face, neck, and chest I went through it in under 2 weeks. I also disliked the packaging. will give you quite a glow
