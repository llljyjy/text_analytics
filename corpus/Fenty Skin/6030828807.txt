I’ve been using this for about two month now. It’s okay only. Not travel friendly cause it fall out easily. The product is mehhh… too overly fragrance. I don’t feel like it did much as in sun protection. Will I get it again? Maybe no. I’ll just stick with my Korean SPF. Cheaper and very effective. just okay
