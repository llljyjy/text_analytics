I’m a product junkie, specifically a sunscreen junkie. This is the perfect sunscreen during the winter when my skin needs an extra boost of minimal glow. LOVE this product.  As always Fenty doesn’t miss when it comes to ensuring it works for ALL shades. NO white caste or peeling. Im 471 and for whatever reason supergoop still has a caste. Same with elta my Oily/dehydrated skin loves this
