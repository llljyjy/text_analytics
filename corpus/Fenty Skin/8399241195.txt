I’ll start by saying I’ve been a rouge member for 5+ years and this is the third review I’ve ever done, specifically because this product is just amazing. I’ve tried Tatcha, Drunk Elephant, Farmacy, Belif, Laneige, Fresh, FAB, among many other brands, and this moisturizer is one of the best I’ve ever used. It has well-researched ingredients, is extremely hydrating without feeling heavy on the skin. It leaves a glow that’s hard to find with a lot of products. I see some reviews on here taking off stars because of the packaging: yes, you have to slip the case into the frame when you first get it (it takes about 1-2 minutes to figure out), but then you have a reusable, sustainable, well-made product. The amount of product is standard for most moisturizers and cheaper than most at Sephora, so the reviews complaining about the size do not make logical sense, either. Overall, I will continue buying this as long as I can. Im continually stunned and impressed by all of Fenty’s skincare line. Hydrating, Glassy, Excellent Ingredients
