I have tried tons of AHA/BHA products so I was skeptical that this would be much different or better than similar exfoliants. I was wrong!! I’ve been using it twice a week for about a month. Immediately after using it for a minute, my face is VERY glowy and feels insanely soft. The pores around my nose are less prominent. I also think that it’s gradually fading my acne scarring, but that could be helped by other products in my routine. It’s very small (easily fits in the palm of my hand), but I think I will have enough to last me about a year of use, and you can purchase just the treatment without the applicator, which I will do after I finish this bottle. I received this product complimentary for my honest review, but my opinions are my own. Best chemical exfoliant I've tried
