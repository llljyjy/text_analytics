So this one came to me as a gift from a friend. After trying for a few week, I do like the results but it may not be for everyone. It has a lovely green tea scent and a moisturizing feel that absorbs well with no lingering residue. My skin is happy enough and it’s a good alternative to the Lancome Tonique if you don’t like rose scent. My only real issue is the bottle. It is very difficult to squeeze out (like it hurts my hand) and a bit messy so would I buy again? Maybe... Refreshing, good if it's in the set 👍
