I received this product for free in exchange for a review. Honestly I didn’t want to like this product because of how expensive it is for such a small amount but it actually works. I’ve been having texture issues with my skin and I notice an immediate difference after using it, in addition to long term evening of skin tone and texture. It works better than other chemical exfoliants I’ve tried and a little goes a long way. Overall I would recommend this if you are looking for a good chemical exfoliant. It may be a little harsh for those with sensitive skin. Works better than expected
