Disclaimer: I received this product as a part of a free sample program. I really wanted to like this soap due to ingredients and scent, but the way it made my skin feel was an automatic no. This soap leaves a waxy, dry, tight feeling on the skin. I would not purchase this product again on its own, but I would retry it after getting the bossy scrub as directed. Dry and waxy
