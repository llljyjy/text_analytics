I love this! Not sure if it helps with dark spots as I haven’t had any bad acne flair ups since using it-props to it not causing any breakouts though! I religiously used Fresh Rose Hydration cream as my moisturizer for years, but I have to admit it doesn’t always play well with other products on too (such as spf, which I know is essential). I’m so glad I went out on a limb and picked this up for daytime use. It plays well with products underneath, as well as mixes fairly decently with the fenty skin tint (for when I can’t be bothered to give it time to set, haha). I’ve been using it for a couple months, but today I went to visit a friend and she was super impressed with my skin. She was like, “omg, what are you wearing? You’re totally glowing, are you pregnant?” Girl, in this day and age, not a chance, but I’m clad to know that just this moisturizer alone is enough to get compliments on your complexion. Sometimes if I’ve gone too hard with serums and what not underneath, it can get a little greasy feeling, but nothing a quick pat of fenty setting poder can’t fix Made my friend ask me if I was pregnant lol
