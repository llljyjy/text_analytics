Very nice, I love the smell and the look of it is so cute. I was scared with the word fat in the name because i’ve never seen anything like that in makeup but it’s is very thin once it gets on your skin and absorbs faster than any other toner I’ve used before. I like this one a lot but I’m thinking about buying the other one on this line to use them in combination to see what I think, they could be sisters! Love it!!
