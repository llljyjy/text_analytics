I love this toner. I’m late trying it as I already had a hydrating toner I liked. However over the last few days my skin has gotten so dehydrated and needed a refresh. I went to Sephora recently and saw this. I applied it to my hand and I was impressed at how fast it absorbed. This stuff immediately rehydrated my skin and helped with dry patches. My skin looks just the right amount of dewy and makes my skin feel adequately hydrated on its own. Also, it smells and feels amazing. I literally love this stuff and have moved my other toners aside. Will definitely be repurchasing when I run out. Didn’t expect anything less from a Fenty product. New holy grail
