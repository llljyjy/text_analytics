I received this product in exchange for this review. For more info, I have dry, dull skin. This serum has a lovely texture and I the products component. With it being airless it really helps the product maintain it’s efficacy. And to the vitamin C in the niacinamide brightening my complexion, however, I found that it didn’t really give me any results. I’ve been using it for two weeks and I didn’t day and honestly haven’t noticed any difference in my skin. However, it is a nice addition to my skin care routine and the serum helps my skin feel less dry so that’s a plus for me I think for a different skin type the serum might be better, but I would say if you have dry skin with not much pigmentation issues you probably want something stronger. This product has no scent and it has a creamy texture that soaks into the skin beautifully. I love the product I just wish it gave me better results. A beautiful serum
