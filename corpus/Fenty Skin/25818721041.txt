I really like this lip mask, it’s hydrating and last throughout the night. It doesn’t get all over and doesn’t fade away. You get a lot of product, about 3 regular lip balm tubes worth, so I’m assuming it’s going to last me a while! I received this product as part of a free sample program. Super nourishing!
