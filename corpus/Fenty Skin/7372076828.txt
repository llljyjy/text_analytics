I have oily, sensitive, problematic skin (acne). This mask is everything! I used it on my wet face and massaged it into my skin. The beads dissolved well and didn’t irritate my skin at all. It literally like instantly removed excess oil and dirt from my face. It left my skin so soft and I’m noticing an improvement on my skins texture! I’m obsessed! Obsessed with this mask!
