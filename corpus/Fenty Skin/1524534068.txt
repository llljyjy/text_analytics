Beautiful moisturizer, but if you have oily skin you will be better served by the Paulas Choice Youth Extending spf 50. Its also clear, but as a moisturizer its a better fit for olier skin types. Its less emollient and more lightweight. A watery lotion. It also does a soft set wich makes it a better spf barrier because it doesnt mix as readily into your foundation (that waters it down). It grips a little to the skin.Hydro Vizor is very similar to the Neutrogena Hydro Boost spf 30-50 in the squeeze tube. With both if you touch your face the spf transfers onto your fingers with that oily shine typical of chemical sunscreens. This means that when you apply your foundation it literally mixes into the sunscreen.The Paulas choice has much less of that happening. Even though Hydro vizor transfers onto fingers, the foundations ive tried buff into it beautifully.Hydro vizor is also similar to the PTR Water Drench spf 45, BUT its a little more lightweight, and not as comedogenic. The PTR feels suffocating on me (but its also a fantastic moisturizer) and breaks me out. The hydro Vizor doesnt feel suffocating and doesnt break me out. Its just emollient, wich can be a plus because it makes full coverage, matte foundations look very skin like. Would only reccomend for oily skin if you live in a cold, dry climate. If you live somewhere humid, youd be better served by the Paulas Choice Youth Extending spf 50 fluid, wich is also a moisturizer that goes great under makeup. No breakouts with thag one either. Best for normal to Dry skin
