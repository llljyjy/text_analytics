I recieved this product complimentary from bzzagent. This lip mask is very hydrating. It does itâ€™s job well and is very portable. It smells very good as well. After a few days of use, my lips were visibly softer. The container is great becuase you can dispense a bit of product without contaminating the rest. I really liked it! Portable and hydrating
