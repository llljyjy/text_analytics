I really wanted to like this cleanser but unfortunately it irritated my skin and caused small whiteheads in several areas on my face. I used it day and night for about 3 weeks, along with the Fat Water, Moisturizer and Night Cream. For some reason the Fenty SPF moisturizer also breaks me out, but my skin seems to react well to the fat water and night cream so I definitely recommend both of them!I don’t wear makeup very often so I’m not sure how effective the cleanser is in removing products, but it did smell great, have a nice consistency and made my skin feel refreshed.Oh, one more thing....once you start getting down to the last 1/2 of the tube then it does become a bit difficult to squeeze it out the tube so that’s a bit inconvenient. Wanted to love it, but not for me :(
