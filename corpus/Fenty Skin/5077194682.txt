I just got this today and I love all three.  The face wash incredible,  it smells amazing , only need a tiny bit it foams up a lot and it works great on my sensitive skin .the fat water is a good priming hydrator for the moisturizer which is the best moisturizer I’ve ever used it smells amazing,  doesn’t leave my skin stinging or red and my skin looked glass after using all three Amazing
