I received this product from a free sample program and I really like it. The fragrance is nice and sweet and not too strong. It cleansed my skin very well and I did not feel like it dries me out. I have very sensitive skin and it did not break me out!It’s a great product however I’m not sure if I would purchase it as it is on the more expensive side. nan
