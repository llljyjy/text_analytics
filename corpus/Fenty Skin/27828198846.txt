I’m not one to stay with one product, I always like to try new things. With this face wash it’s different! I have super sensitive skin and this doesn’t burn or leave it tight. I’m about to buy my third cleanser. Also, I think the whole line is great for sensitive skin as well. I use the fat water and sunscreen. Favorite face wash!
