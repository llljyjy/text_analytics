I really love this moisturizer. I wanted something with SPF to cut down my routine in the morning and this worked great. My skin feels hydrated and soft. Works well under makeup too. I have sensitive skin and had no adverse reactions, even though it smells good. I do wish the refills were more affordable. Love it
