Makes your lips look so plump and juicy, it’s the perfect hint of color. Makes your lips look better and alive. Only bad thing is that it’s drying. Made my lips peel. Never had this problem w any other lip oil/ gloss. Still gorgeous tho, it smells cheap and kinda nasty, think Claire’s makeup. The applicator is amazing tho. like it
