I was was a little nervous to try this since I have normal to dry skin and the acids with the applicator looked like it might be irritating. But this is so gentle yet super effective. I immediately noticed my skin looked brighter and more even. It did not cause breakouts for me and I think improved my fading acne marks. This might be a little bottle but a few drops really go a long way with the applicator. I would say this should last at least 6 months. I would recommend using this in the morning before applying makeup since your skin will be so smooth. If you have dry skin I would try this only once a week. I received this product from a free sample program. Great results!
