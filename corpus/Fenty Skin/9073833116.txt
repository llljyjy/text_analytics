After using this product for a couple weeks, I’ve seen a huge difference in the texture of my skin!! I had a bad breakout recently that left me with dark spots on one cheek. After using this treatment, the dark marks faded by a lot! My skin looks very clear! I wish I would’ve taken pictures but I was caught by surprise when I saw these benefits. This product smoothens my face every time I use it but I will say that it had little to no impact in helping manage the appearance of my pores. Considering the smooth texture on your skin this leaves after use, I would highly recommend you moisturize after using because it adds to the luminating affect and makes your skin EXTRA smooth. For the price, I wish the bottles would be just a tad bit bigger. As far as the smell, personally it smells strong and it’d be awesome if they offered in a fresh scent to exaggerate the refreshing feeling you get after using this product. I would recommend this to friends and family if they’re looking for a good exfoliator for their face, but I definitely think this should be bought with a moisturizer and maybe when it’s on sale and/or family members/friends that just want to maintain their skin care, but not for those who have a serious acne/skin problem because the product is limited! I’d rate it overall an 8/10! I received this product as part of a free sample program and I’m grateful to have added it to my skincare tools! Great luminating exfoliator option! Pros and cons
