I’ve been using this with my morning and night skincare routines, it feels really good on the lips and smells amazing. It is on the thicker side but not too thick or sticky for me personally. This has been really hydrating for my lips too, which are chronically dry and peeling no matter what I do. If you’re willing to spend a bit on a lip oil, I say go for it with this one. nan
