Love this! I wasn’t sure what to expect texture wise because I’ve never used a lip oil but it’s neat. It’s almost like a slick balm. It smells very sweet and of course like cherries. It hydrates for a good amount of time. I really like the wider applicator on this and think overall it’s a win. Lovely hydrator
