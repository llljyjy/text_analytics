I love this moisturizer. It is one of the few spf moisturizers that doesnâ€™t bother my eyes. It leaves my skin soft and hydrated.I took off one star for the dispenser though. It only works when the product is new and the container is full, after I used about half of the product I had to disassemble the dispenser to get to the rest of it. I wish this came in a tube or a even a jar. Great Product, poor design
