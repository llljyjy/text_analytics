Received this product as part of a free sample program. You can smell the scent of the soap before even popping the top on the box! It smells amazing and lathers very well. I have small hands so the large puck size has caused me to drop the soap multiple times to the point it now has a few cracks on it.It gives me a ‘squeaky clean’ feeling which I’m not the biggest fan of. After using this bar, depending on my mood - I may oil down so my skin doesn’t feel stripped or I’ll do a second wash with a moisturizing body wash. I think it’s great to layer with another wash but I can’t use it on its own consistently. Great to Lather & Layer
