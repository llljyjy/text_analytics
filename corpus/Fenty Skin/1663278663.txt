This liquid exfoliating treatment from Fenty is simply disappointing. I’ve tried it on several occasions, noticed no immediate results but moderate irritation. I don’t think apply this with a texturized mitt is gentle enough for delicate skin types and certainly you’d want to leave exfoliating ingredients on the skin longer than the usage instructions suggest.Not a fan. Disappointing
