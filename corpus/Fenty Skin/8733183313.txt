I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I honestly love this lip oil. Itâ€™s not sticky at all and leaves my lips feeling moisturized for a long while. The cherry scent is nice, but not overwhelming. Lastly, the applicator is a flat-ish head that is very nice to use. Overall, I would definitely recommend this lip oil. Great Lip Oil!
