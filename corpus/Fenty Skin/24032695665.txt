I was so excited when this Cleansing Bar came. First of all, it smells so good. It smells like a blend of shea, coconut and vanilla and was not overpowering/overbearing at all. I loved the size and shape of the bar, it was easy to handle for me and I  absolutely love the lather that it had created. The only thing that I didnâ€™t like was that it made my skin a bit drier than normal. The overall experience was great ! :)( I received this as part of a free sampling program ) I really love this !
