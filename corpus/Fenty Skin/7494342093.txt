Wow! To be honest, given this was a Fenty’s detox face mask, I want sure what I would expect from it. The texture of the mask is jelly whipped cream like with small chunks of the “cookies” that dissolve upon application. The ingredients are sooo light and fresh that it doesn’t feel heavy upon your face. It feels amazing, refreshing and you know you can except a clear detox face. I am so in love with this!! This is my go to face mask going forward when doing a stay at home spa night. Incredible!! Will definitely be buying more. FENTY DID IT!!
