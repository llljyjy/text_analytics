I received this product as part of a free sample program. At first I wasn’t sure what to think. I thought it was an interesting shape for a soap and I didn’t know if it would provide enough suds and soap to actually wash my skin. I was happily wronged! It has a light vanilla scent and it was very nice to use. I felt it smoothened my skin as well as cleaned it from the amount of soap and made. The picture advertised is exactly what to expect. I feel it will last a while so I’m excited to keep using it! I mainly use body wash products but this soap I would definitely buy and recommend. The soap you didn’t know your body needed
