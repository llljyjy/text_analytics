I received a free sample of this face mask for review. The texture of this was really like a whipped mousse. It’s bouncy. You don’t need a lot as you will get to work rubbing in the “cookie” bits and end up spreading out the mask on your face. It took longer than I expected for the mask to be emulsified on my face and turn grey. I think a regular clay mask would do the trick as well. I did like that the mask didn’t dry out my skin and make my skin feel tight. It rinsed off easily and my skin looks clean. I didn’t love this but it was good. I have sensitive skin and didn’t experience any irritation. Mousse texture
