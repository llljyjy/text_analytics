I got this mask for free in exchange for my honest review. I am obsessed with this! I love applying the white clay and popping the charcoal beads to turn my mask gray. I left it on for 20 minutes and noticed an immediate difference within my skin. I made sure to follow up with a water-based moisturizer and then a cream-based to lock in the hydration and replenish my skin. I love the ingredients and the fact that this has salicylic acid which is perfect for oily or acne. I do not recommend this for anyone with dry skin because this will not help. Great mask for oily skin!
