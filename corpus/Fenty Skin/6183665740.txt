Have been using on my face for the past week.  There is a fragrance so I would avoid if you do not like fragrances.  For me, I find the fragrance light and not offensive. I like the silky consistency of the lotion and it blends in smoothly.  My face did not have any burning around the eyes or breakouts from the lotion.  I personally found it to be moisturizing but as previous people have mentioned it does seem very shiny.  I do not wear makeup on top of sunscreen, so I do prefer sunscreen with tint normally, but on my days off I didnâ€™t mind the shine.  When I wore it to work I  did feel that the shine teetered on looking greasy by the end of the day. This is not a physical SPF, zinc or mineral based, but if you want a basic daily SPF without tint than this may be a good option for you. Nice daily SPF
