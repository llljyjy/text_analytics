-	Did not dry out my skin compared to other detox or purifying masks I have tried -	The soft whipped, spongey, fluffy texture is so much fun and gives playful vibe -	Very easy and fun to apply on skin and wash off-	Those charcoal beans feel so soothing and calming when dissolved into the rest of the product -	Because I am lazy when it comes to face masks, I tend to avoid using masks every day, but this mask feels very comfortable on the skin, so I look forward to use it almost every other day -	Some detox or purifying masks feels so tight, even sometimes hurt my skin, but this one did not give any tight feeling-	The mask in the jar itself does not look pretty though -	I noticed my skin look more smooth and pores look clean and smaller -	It is on pricier side, compared to its quality, but definitely worth trying for its clean feeling afterwards as well as for the playful addition to a skincare routine. Just donâ€™t expect miracle result from it. Much better than I expected
