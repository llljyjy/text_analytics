I received this product though a free sample program but my reviews are always unbiased. I have pretty dry sensitive skin and I spent a week trying this out and I really see a difference in my skins moisture. It hydrates the skin instantly and leaves it feeling so smooth and dewy without any oily residue left behind and it so lightweight which I personally love! All in all I would definitely repurchase this and recommend it to anyone looking for a lightweight but powerful moisturizer to add to their routine I hope this helps! A must for dry skin!
