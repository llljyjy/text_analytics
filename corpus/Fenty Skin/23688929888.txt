I received this product free, and I wish I had more time to use this before I wrote the review. However, I’ve been using this product once daily for 2 weeks and I actually see a difference. Very effective and gentle, I’ve gotten no dryness or irritation. I’m looking forward to seeing what it looks like in 4-6 weeks. I don’t often spend $40 on skincare items, but it looks like this one might be worth it. Great so far!
