I have hormonal acne and my skin needed a little pick up right now. Love a good charcoal mask. I am really loving the Fenty products! It is amazing for any type of skin. I massaged the mask onto my skin until the charcoal beads breaks into my skin. If you are looking for a quick restart for your skin - this is a great charcoal mask to use! Needed this right now!
