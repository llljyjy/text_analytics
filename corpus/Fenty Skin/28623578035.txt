This is the first fenty skin product I have tried and I have been enjoying it! I have used this product for almost 2 weeks now and can say that this product does provide decent hydration and adds a nice plump to the skin. I like to apply it on my face when it is a bit damp to ensure more hydration due to the hyaluronic acid. It leaves a slight tackiness after application but does not interfere with other products I put on afterwards. There is a mild fragrance that does not linger. The packaging is nice with having the audible clicks of when you open and close it. The bottle itself is not a hard plastic, so I like giving it a squeeze to dispense the product compared to shaking it. I received this product as part of a free sample program. milky hydration goodness
