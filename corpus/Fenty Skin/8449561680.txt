Not a fan. I am used to shiseido but decide something new. It is not bad but after Shiseido feels like a downgrade. Feels and smells like a regular shampoo. Terrible dispenser, after couple weeks of using it gets hard to squeeze it out. Have to use both hands and push hard to get anything out. Feels and smells like shampoo
