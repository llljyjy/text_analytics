Fenty cosmetics is my go-to for makeup, but I have yet to try their skincare products. My first impression is that this mask is amazing! First off, the charcoal beads in the mask burst when you massage them into your skin. This indicator helps me know when the mask has penetrated my skin. Most clay masks leave the skin feeling dry or stripped, but not this one. After using this mask for a couple of weeks, my skin feels super smooth, and you can see a visible difference in skin texture and pores (especially the following morning). This mask does not disappoint, and it’s quite easy to use compared to other masks I’ve tried before. Those with oily skin will certainly enjoy this product as well. nan
