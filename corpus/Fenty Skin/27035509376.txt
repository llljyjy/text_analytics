I really love the milky soft texture it has and glides through my skin as I apply it. It hydrates your skin and gives it an instant glow and about a minute it dried up but my skin was clear. It made my face a little red but for me its normal. Perfect for those who prefer little to no fragrance. Definitely recommend Hydrates your skin!
