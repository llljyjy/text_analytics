I’m surprised by how much I like this product! The packaging is cute, and I don’t mind the twist up component at all. As for the product itself, it’s extremely thick and lightly scented. For the wintertime, I think the thickness is a good thing. I do think it’s comparable to using Vaseline though. Also not sure how much of an improvement my lips have really seen besides when it’s on. Great for wintertime!
