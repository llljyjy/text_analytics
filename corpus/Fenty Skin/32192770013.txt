Here’s a bold statement from a lipgloss aficionado regarding Fenty Skin Cherry Treat Conditioning + Strengthening Lip Oil: This is the best lipgloss I’ve ever used, and I’m known for being the one who always has my lipgloss within my reach. The consistency of this gloss is perfect because it isn’t sticky nor is it too thin. It imparts just the right amount of sheer tint of color while making my lips shine and it lasts. Honestly, I’ll never use another after trying this. Exceptional product. The best lipgloss I’ve ever tried.
