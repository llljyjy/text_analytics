After trying this for about a week, I really like it! My skin feels hydrated and I definitely see more of a glow to it. I haven’t seen much difference in dark spots, but I’m sure that’ll change with more continuous use. My only gripe is that it feels a teeny bit greasy on my skin, almost like it doesn’t absorb all the way. Definitely more glowy!
