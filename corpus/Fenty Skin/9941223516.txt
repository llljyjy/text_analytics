This is an amazing mask. It’s exfoliating and pore refining while at the same time moisturizing. It does not strip my skin or make it feel dry after washing it off, yet it keeps my oiliness at bay and I notice a visible difference in my skin. Also, next day my skin feels butter smooth after using this. I love the whipped texture of the mask and the ritual of massaging in the charcoal beads. It’s become my go to mask and I will definitely be repurchasing. I feel like it’s a great price for the amount of product you get as well. okayyyy Riri
