This soap smells nice! It smells just like cocoa butter. Otherwise, I feel like it is just like any other bar soap, which I find tends to strip the skin and leaves me feeling squeakier than I’d like. It’s a totally fine soap but I don’t think there’s anything particularly special about it.I received this product as part of a free sample program. nan
