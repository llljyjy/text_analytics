This product works for what it was intended for, to condition your lips. I got this a few days ago and have used it at the end of the day when I get home and I find that it leaves my lips super soft until morning even and my lips have actually looked better since using it. I do wish it was more cherry scented than it is though. it’s giving me blue raspberry candy (my personal favorite) not cherry. It’s very subtle on the lips too it’s not overly glossy, only when first applying it. Then it’s more subtle which I like nan
