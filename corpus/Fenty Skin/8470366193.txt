I received this product as part of a free sample program. I have some scaring from my struggles with acne and I use a variety of different products to help with uneven pigmentation. Iâ€™ve used this product for about two weeks and seen noticeable differences. I use it every other day as part of my skincare routine. I usually apply all my products by hand, but since this product has AHA it was great that it came with an applicator. Definitely excited to see the long term results!
