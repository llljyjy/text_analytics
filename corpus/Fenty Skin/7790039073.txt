I haven’t been using it long enough to produce very noticeable results, but my skin feels smoother and my acne scarring isn’t quite as prominent. I have pretty sensitive skin so I was nervous to try this, but I’m pleasantly surprised that it didn’t cause any irritation and sunk into my skin with ease. nan
