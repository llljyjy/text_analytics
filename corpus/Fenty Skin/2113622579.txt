I have used many other major sunscreen brands before trying this (Supergoop, Shiseido, Coola, Shiseido Anessa), and I love that this doesnâ€™t clog my pores or give me a white cast. The formula is light but hydrating, It also gave my skin a smooth layer of hydration before make up. The smell is calming with white tea and rose notes. I live in Seattle so this is a great everyday sunscreen for me, but if you live somewhere closer to the equator, or somewhere sunny most of the time, I would recommend going for a higher SPF++ formula. I took a star off because the sunscreen travels to my eyes when I sweat or cry and it stings. Great for everyday!
