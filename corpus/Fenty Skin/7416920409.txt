I was so excited to try this Fat Water Milky Toner Essence since the original Fat Water wasn’t quite hydrating enough to help balance my acne prone/combination skin. This Fat Water Milky does just what it says! It’s nourishing and absolutely helps with dark spots, pores and dryness! The Laneige cream skin toner is one of my favorites, but I only use it during the drier colder months because of it’s emollient finish. This Fenty one feels great for year round use.
