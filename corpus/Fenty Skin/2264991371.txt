I was gifted this item. I used it on my face dry. I massaged my face while exfoliating. It was truly pampering at its finest. It left my face extremely soft with no shine. It was perfect. It does not have a smell. It worked wonder canâ€™t wait to continue using this amazing product! This Mask Is Everything!
