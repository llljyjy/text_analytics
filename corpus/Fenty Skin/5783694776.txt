This mask is lightweight and fun to apply. I find satisfaction in seeing the little charcoal beads pop turning the mass gray. The different place within the mask do a good job of pulling out excess of oil without drying out the skin. When I first applied the mask I didn’t realize her salicylic acid in it and almost forgot to put on SPF – I feel like there should be a sunscreen warning on the package. I don’t think this mask is worth $32 but if you love the brand and you like a good clean mask then go for it.. This mask is lightweight and fun to apply.
