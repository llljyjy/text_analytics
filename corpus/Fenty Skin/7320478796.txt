I received the Fenty Skin Pre-Show Glow Instant Retexturizing 10% AHA Treatment + Reusable Applicator complimentary from BzzAgent for testing purposes. Although this was a free sample, I promise you when I say that I absolutely love this product. When I wake up the next day after using it, my skin looks so clear and healthy. The formula does not burn or irritate my skin, which I was worried about, and the scent is very subtle. I an super pleased with the mitt that this comes with too. It is actually very high quality and exfoliates my face just enough so that it doesn’t cause any irritation. Honestly, I’m surprised how much I love this product, but Rihanna never seems to disappoint. I definitely recommend this product to anyone interested. Rihanna never disappoints!
