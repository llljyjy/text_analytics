I’ve used this on and off for a year or so but was getting some pretty gnarly acne but I hadn’t narrowed it down to this product or other fenty skin products. I started using Tula to balance my skin out, went to add this cream back into my nightly routine because I like the smell and consistency, and woke up the next day with more breakouts. I’m bummed because it smells so nice, I love the packaging, but I just can’t use it. I’ve also stopped using the rest of the fenty skin line and have seen my skin clear up. If you have any kind of sensitive skin I don’t think this will work for you due to the scent. breakouts & fragrance
