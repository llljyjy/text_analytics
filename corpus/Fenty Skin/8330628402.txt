This is a super nice lip oil, non sticky and lasts for quite some time. The scent reminds me of strawberry smuckers, It’s so nostalgic. The only thing I have a slight issue with is that if I use it a couple times throughout the day, my lip will ever so slightly peel but that happens to my lips with any product I use on them so far. So I don’t forsee that being the case with everyone who uses this product. I definitely recommend! nan
