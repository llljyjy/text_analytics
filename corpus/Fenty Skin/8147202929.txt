*Disclaimer: I received this product as part of a free sample program.* To start off, I will say that I was very skeptical about trying this product out. I am, personally, not a fan of bar soap and the way it makes my body feel, so I have been a strict liquid soap fan for years now. I typically feel like I do not get a thorough cleanse of my body and feel pretty dried out after using bar soap. However, this Cocoa Cleans’r Soothing All-Over Cleansing Bar defiantly defied the odds and stood up against my predictions. For one, this soap does not have that overly powerful cocoa butter scent that many other products with cocoa have. Then, the biggest surprise to me was how well this bar soap lathers which gave me the same vibe as if I were to be using my usual liquid body soap. The lather was so good that I did not have to double back to the bar to get more soap to clean myself off with. Lastly, after rinsing off, my skin still felt nourished and not dry which is a soap pet peeve of mine since I tend to stay on the ashy side. From start to finish, I felt like I was having a luxury shower moment.I cannot speak to how this bar soap does as a facial cleanser since I am a bit more reserved with trying out new products on my face, but it is important to still note that this can be a 2-in-1 product which helps to minimize anyone’s body/skincare routine.Overall, I will definitely be using this Cocoa Cleans’r Soothing All-Over Cleansing Bar more often and alternating it with my usual liquid body soap. I am very surprised at my results, and I will probably have to give more bar soaps a try in the future. Turned me into a bar soap fan!
