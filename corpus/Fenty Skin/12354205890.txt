This is my favourite moisturizer. It’s super smooth, not too thick and absorbs beautifully. It really keeps my skin feeling soft, without being greasy. I normally don’t love putting on sunscreen, I’ve never really found one that I love so this having SPF is a huge plus for me. The packaging is super cute, I love how it comes down so it doesn’t get pumped out by accident in my bag. The refills is another bonus, which I think allows the packaging to be higher quality since you only buy the outside once. This is really the perfect moisturizer for me and my skin. nan
