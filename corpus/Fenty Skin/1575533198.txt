Used for the last 4 days and am loving this natural product. It leaves my skin feeling so silky. I’m really impressed with how well it lathered. My only complaint is the bar smells a little like plato, but once it’s wet, the fragrance is very cocoa which I love. I feel very clean after using this. Sometimes cleansing bars are hard to rinse off, but this product leaves the skin really well under water.I would recommend to anyone looking for a good bar soap! Good Cleansing Bar!
