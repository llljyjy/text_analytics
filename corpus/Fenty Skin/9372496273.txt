Really enjoying this make up remover. Gets everything off and leaves my face feeling soft. This bottle has lasted me a pretty long time because you donâ€™t need a ton. When you close the cap a small amount come out. If you were to set in on the counter it would get some on there. I just wipe/use that little bit once I tighten cap. one of my faves
