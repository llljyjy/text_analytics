Its a fun mask to put on i like that it changes colours but it takes forever to break all the black dots and make the mask turn grey its fun but it also feels really gimmicky. It didnt really do anything for my skin either it didnt make it look better or worse. I wanted to like it but i was just left feeling disappointed. Way too expensive for what it is. Im not impressed
