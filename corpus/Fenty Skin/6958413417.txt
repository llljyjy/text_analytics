This soap is very sudsy. A little does go a long way. My husband and I both have been using the soap now for a week. I have extremely sensitive skin, so,  that being said; I haven’t gotten red patches on my face from irritation so good sign lol. I did receive this soap through a free sampling program. I’ve seen the complaints of the price. Giving that I do buy lots of soaps similar to this, the price was actually shockingly cheaper than I expected. I will be purchasing again once this one is used up. nan
