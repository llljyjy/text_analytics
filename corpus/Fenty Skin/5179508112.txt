I received this product through a free sample program. Before even opening the package I could smell the beautiful cocoa butter scent. The bar is a great size, but the round shape can make it a little hard to grip once in the shower so be careful. The bar created a really nice creamy lather very easily. The lather felt really soft and moisturizing. My skin felt soft and was not dry after using the bar. Loving this soap!
