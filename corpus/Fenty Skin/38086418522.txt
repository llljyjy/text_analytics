This is the first time I’ve tried any Fenty Skin products and I was not disappointed. This is the perfect gloss for summer. I try to keep my makeup minimal and this gloss gives just a hint of color and shine. The applicator is way different than any gloss I’ve ever used before. It has a big plush applicator that makes it so easy to dab it onto your lips. This gloss isn’t sticky which I love. The cherry scent is subtle and sweet.  To say I’m in love with this gloss would be an understatement. I will definitely be buying more. The perfect summer gloss
