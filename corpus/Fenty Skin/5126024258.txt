This product works best IF you double cleanse - which you honestly should be doing anyway. A little bit does go a long way, it’s not drying and it suds up really well. I don’t care for the smell whatsoever - I really wish it didn’t have any scent but it’s not overwhelming. You get a significant amount of product for a very reasonable price. I gave it 4 stars because it’s a makeup removing cleanser that you have to use twice to fully remove all makeup. OR you have to use a cleansing balm and then use this face wash to remove all makeup. Good product but I won’t repurchase.
