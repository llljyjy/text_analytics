This product DESTROYED my skin its far from a pore refiner it actually broke my skin out really bad to the point i discontinued using it and this was only in the first couple of days of me trying this product. I am an African American woman, and this product did nothing for my skin but irritate it. There are way better toners, serums, and skin care lines to use thatâ€™s reasonably priced. This is nothing but water and sticky stuff in an ergonomic bottle. Great packaging and concept horrible product.  I have to give this product a thumbs down. Destroyed my skin
