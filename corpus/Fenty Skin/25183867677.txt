I like it! It reminds me of African black soap. Smells very nice! I was scared to use it on my face but I did one cheek before doing the other. It is extraordinary at cleaning. No oil or build up left behind! Iâ€™m an oily girl so this is helpful. I did my regular moisturizer after. Happy to smell this good!
