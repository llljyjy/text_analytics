I really like the lip oil, however it’s not my favorite that I’ve ever used. This lip oil feels more like a really thick gloss than anything else. While that isn’t a bad thing in itself, the problem is that I have to really try to apply the smallest amount on my lips, then spread it. Because the oil is so thick, did you have any dead skin on your lips, it will become easily noticeable after applying the product, not similar to how applying actual hydrating oil would make chapped lips look. I think I would feel more comfortable calling this a lip mask than a lip oil. I will say however, I enjoy both the smell and the hydrating effects of the oil after I use it. The applicator is nice, and despite the cons, I still find myself reaching for it, because when you apply the right amount, it looks and feels good on the lips. nan
