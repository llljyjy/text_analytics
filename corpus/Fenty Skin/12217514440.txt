The scent of this soap bar is SO good! It smells like a soft blend of shea/coconut/vanilla without being too overpowering. I wasn’t expecting this bar to do much beyond cleansing my body, so I was shocked to see it also moisturize my skin & clear some of my body acne. Also love the size of this bar - it is a bit pricey for a bar of soap, but I’ve been using it for a few weeks now and haven’t even put a dent in it. Definitely a good bang for your buck & will repurchase! Only con is that it is so large & a circle shape, so it’s a bit awkward to hold in your hand and use, might be easier to use if it was a rectangular shape. (I did receive this as part of a free sampling program) Scent is amazing!!
