I absolutely adore the minimal, recyclable packaging with the twist top. I use this twice a day. Once in the morning before my antioxidant serum and once at night before moisturizer. When I saw that coconut oil was on the ingredients list, I was a bit nervous to try the toner essence. After two weeks, the toner has helped so much with my dry skin from wearing masks. I did not break out from the coconut oil. I have no new closed comedones, no peeling skin with dry patches anymore.  My skin is very happy, healthy, hydrated, and glowy. I don’t mind the fragrance. It’s a delicious fruity green tea smell. I feel that it fits Rihanna’s personality and her skincare line very well. Tamarind and hyaluronic acid are being highlighted as the star ingredients in the essence, but I think that glycerin is the one you should be on the hunt for in the ingredient list if you have dry, cracked skin. The combination of glycerin, squalane, niacinamide, and Zinc PCA will really hydrate, plump and strengthen your skin barrier, which this toner has and more. My skin type used to be combination oily but gets drier as the season changes and with the mask-wearing. Give this a dry if you have dry skin or acne from wearing masks, and don’t be too nervous about the coconut oil. If the ingredient was formulated into a toner essence, it’s not the same as using coconut oil on your face. Life saver for maskne and dry skin relief
