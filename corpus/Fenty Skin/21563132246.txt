I wish I could give this 5 stars but the face wash is really harsh. I used it one time and I’ve tried like a month apart and every time my face is extremely dried out to the point of peeling and it hurts. So please be careful! I will say on a positive the Fat Water is AMAZING! It’s lightened on of my dark spots on my face! The moisturizer is really great too! I would say just do a small test run before you use the face wash, nan
