I love this lip oil! The glossy pout it gives the lips is so juicy and pretty. I thought it was going to be sticky at first application but it evened out and felt for glossy and hydrating like a normal lip oil. The doefoot applicator is huge and cushiony so it feels so soft. The packaging is so sleek and has the “clean girl“ esthetic and I keep it in my purse now. The last aspect I’ll mention, is the scent. The lip oil is cherry but the scent gives off a more raspberry candy smell, so it kind of brings me back to my childhood which is fun! Juicy, pouty and conditioning!
