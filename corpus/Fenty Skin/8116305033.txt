I love this lip mask! This is the first one I’ve tried that actually worked for me. The hydration lasts all day after I wash it off in the morning. The mask is thick and nourishing but not sticky like the Laneige one. I’m also a big fan of the twist up packaging, it’s much more sanitary and easy to clean than using my fingers or a spatula  If you’re looking to try a lip mask, try this one! Better than Laneige!
