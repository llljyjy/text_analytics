After using this product for a week I absolutely love it! It leaves my lips super hydrated in the morning after applying at night. Trust me when I say a little really does go a long way I use less than a pea size amount and itâ€™s  for my lips. The only bad thing I have to say is it was a little hard to get the product out at first but if you leave the lid on before twisting it will come out easier.more than enough A must for night time routine!
