Recieved this as part of a free sample program. I used it once and it dried the bottom half of my face kind of irritated/itchy and made my regular products (witchhazel toner and moisturizer) burn when applied after, had to use an occlusive on the dry patches the next few days, maybe if used more often you’d get used to it but I’m never sensitive to any products 99% of the time, also, the price is ridiculous, I’ll stick to my basic Cleanser, toner and moisturizer. Not worth the hype, unfortunately...
