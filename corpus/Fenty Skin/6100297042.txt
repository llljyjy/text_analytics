It’s an okay and basic cleanser. The good: -foams up very nice -leaves skin clean without drying it The bad: -too much fragrance, it smells nice but it would be much improved if there was no fragrance at all. It made my skin break out - texture is first weird when you squeeze out. It almost webs before you foam it up -  too thick for the opening. Love the twist cap, but it’s hard to squeeze out meh
