Before I started to use this product my lips weren’t chapped but after my 3rd day of using this I noticed my lip were getting chapped. But after a week my lips went back to normal and I could say that it felt softer but there isn’t a big difference. You can barely “taste” the cherry but when open the product you can definitely smell the cherry scent. I personally love using the Clarins lip comfort oil more than this one but that’s just me there are many other lip oils that are better than this one but you do you bestie :) it isn’t bad but its okay
