Fenty always delivers. This moisturizer is ultra lightweight with a pleasant, clean scent (lightly sweet). Absorbs well after a few minutes and does not pill at all. Leaves skin looking dewy and fresh. It does not irritate my skin at all. Under my primer and foundation, it helps keep the foundation itself smooth and pillowy. The only critique for this product would be in the dispenser. While it is designed to be replaced, the positioning of the lotion pump in the canister is a little low and pressing it can be frustrating. Still I would absolutely recommend this product. Beautiful under makeup!
