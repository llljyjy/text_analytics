I really like this soap. I prefer to use it on my body rather than my face because this contains coconut oil. After using this, my skin definitely feels softer than the other body was I use regularly. The scent is nice but dissipates but I donâ€™t mind. I love the size, although I wish it contained a holder because I only have a standard size container. I really do enjoy this soap and would purchase. I definitely recommend! nan
