I got this to try and was pleasantly surprised that I did find it nice and gentle on my skin, but not too drying, yet I still felt like my skin was clean after. The only thing I found a bit annoying was that the beads were a bit hard to rub into my skin. I also wasn’t too sure how much to use at first so I used too much in the beginning and felt like I was just pushing the beads around. But aside from that, I enjoyed the mask. I felt like my pores felt cleaned after. The dry time wasn’t too long and didn’t make my skin feel too tight or stiff. I can’t say how well it would be for super sensitive skin, but for me I feel like it was gentle enough that I think it would be suitable for most skin types. I have combination skin and so far, I feel like it seems to be working well. I don’t really know if the charcoal does much for me, but overall, I still enjoyed it. I liked how its easy to apply and easy to remove as well. Gentle on skin
