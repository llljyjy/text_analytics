Yeeeeeesss. I definitely noticed my skin becoming softer and my pores are smaller.  I also noticed my skin texture changing. I only been using it for three weeks but I have to say Rihanna doesn’t disappoint. Also I was worried about it drying my skin and it doesn’t it actually leaves my skin a little moisturized afterwards. Non drying.
