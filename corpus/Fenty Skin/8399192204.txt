I am incredibly impressed with this mask. I have been using it once per week after showering and have noticed some small improvement to the texture of my skin. The product itself is creamy and has small charcoal balls that break down as you apply the product. They feel almost like a light massage. The mask dries quickly but doesn’t make your face feel really dry or tight. It rinses off easily and doesn’t leave my face really dry like some clay masks do, my skin feels smooth afterwards and noticeably softer. It is definitely a product I will purchase again in the future. Highly recommend, it’s a treat! What a Treat!
