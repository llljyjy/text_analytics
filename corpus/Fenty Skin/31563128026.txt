I saw Mikayla on Tiktok review this and was very intrigued. I always have chapped/peeling lips because I pick/bite them when I get anxiety or tbh bored. I’ve tried just about every lip product that claims to repair your lips overnight, and none of them have worked. BUT THIS ONE DOES! After probably 2-3 days of putting it on during the  day and at bedtime to wear overnight, my lips are 100% healed, and they look so healthy, soft, and plump! I love the packaging too! I don’t have to use the top of my acrylic nails to get the product out. The only downside is that it’s kinda heavy and sticky, but you get used to it. If you’re on the fence about buying this, just do it! Your lips will thank you! JUST BUY IT!
