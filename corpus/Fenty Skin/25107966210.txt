If youâ€™re a fan of the laneige sleeping mask youâ€™ll really like this lip oil too. It has a thick, luxurious feel that isnâ€™t sticky at all, the only negative to this lip oil is that I donâ€™t love the scent. However itâ€™s extremely moisturizing and a must for anyone with dry lips this winter. Definitely give it a shot ðŸ¤ž
