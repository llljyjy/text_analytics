I really do enjoy this night cream. I have been using it for about three or four months and am just now running out (ordering one rn) I have used nightcream from youth of the people, versed, tatcha. This has been my fave. It leave my face feeling so supple. Itâ€™s like the youth of the people dream mask but less heavy which is like a dream for us oily girls. But yes, give it a try. :) Fave nighttime cream
