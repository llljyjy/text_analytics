The Cookies N Clean Whipped Clay Detox Mask is fun and effective ! The charcoal beads spread nicely once applied to the skin and blends in. I left the mask on for about 20 minutes each time and after rinsing my skin is smooth and glowing. I have not experienced any break outs or clogged pores which is huge for my skin. The packaging is so cute and it has minimal scent. Great clarity
