The only reason I took 1 star off is because the smell took a few uses to get used to. Smells like hair dye or burnt hair? It was off-putting the first time but okay the next few times. OTHERWISE this product is amazing! My skin always feels and looks so good right after using it. It instantly makes my skin tone balance throughout my face and the texture even looks a little better on my forehead. I look forward to the 2 days per week that I use it. Weird smell but amazing results
