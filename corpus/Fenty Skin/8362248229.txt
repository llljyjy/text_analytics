This clay mask is really nice. I like that you don’t need to use a lot of it because a little goes a very long way. This will last me for a while. I enjoyed that it has no scent because it’s going to be good for anyone! It makes my skin feel really nice. I have been using for about 2 weeks now and I can see a difference on my pores. Would definitely buy! Amazing product
