I was skeptical about this one because celebrities skincare tends to be hit or miss but this product is awesome. I use it more as a sunscreen rather than a 2-in-1 moisturizer/sunscreen because I have dry skin but if you have oily skin you can probably skin your moisturizer when you use this. It leaves 0 white cast and no pilling either. The only thing about this sunscreen is that it is highly fragranced with a fruity scent. The scent personally doesn’t bother me but if you have sensitive skin you might not love this one. I also like that it’s refillable although I think the environmental benefits are minimal, but it saves you some cash when it comes time to repurchase. Overall I would highly recommend to anyone struggling to find a sunscreen. My favourite sunscreen!
