Truly not drying at all. Works great at preventing/fighting acne prone breakouts on my sensitive skin. It’s kind of similar to the GR hyaluronic clay mask which is also non-drying and both contain salicylic acid. But this one has a lighter & uniquely whipped texture. Which is unlike any other mask I’ve ever tried. I overall very much enjoy and recommend ! nan
