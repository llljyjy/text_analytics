I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I really like this bar. I love the shape and the iconic FS is very prominent. It has lasted a long time- I use this in the shower every other day for about two or so weeks and I feel like Iâ€™ve barely made a dent in it. I like to use the bar to get a lather on an exfoliating mitt. It smells great, but nothing close to overwhelming and the scent does not last long. I do feel like my skin feels smoother in general since using this product. The only downside it there is a little bit of that bar soap finish on the skin but it fades quickly. I would probably repurchase this! I would love to see other scents or oils used to bring some variety. A great upgrade to bar soap!
