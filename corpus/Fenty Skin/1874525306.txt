I used this product when I traveled recently and enjoyed it. It larger beautifully, you get a real nice foam. The smell is delicious too, sweet and warm. It cl, body, or I even used it to hand wash some undergarment’s. When I used it on my face, I didn’t feel dried out-however it did leave a almost too clean feeling on my body, so I will take a star off for that. Over I enjoyed it and will keep using jtsome Sudsy yummy soap
