I have been trying this product for 2 weeks now and honestly i am seeing some changes. One of the changes I’ve seen is starting with my acne I’ve notice that my acne has diminish a little and i notice that my dark circles have been clearing up a bit but i do know this product wont do miracles to my dark circles in just 2 weeks when i have been dealing with dark circles sense i was 17 and im now 25 but it is unlike anything I’ve tried and I’ve tried many products and i honestly will buy again because i want to see if this can get rid of the in perfection of my dark circles . It already has done amazing by diminishing my acne and even when i have a really acne pro skin i was kinda scare to put this on my face because of it but honestly i don’t regret me putting this on it has help and you should give it a try i love the packaging and how environmentally friend it is and its nice to see that in the beauty industry. Truly a experience
