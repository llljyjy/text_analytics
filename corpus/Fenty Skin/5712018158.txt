This is my first time using a cleansing bar, it smells so nice and feels really high-quality… The bar ladders really well which I appreciate. However, I was not a fan of using this bar on my face, it left a residue behind and when I washed again, my face was dry and squeaky. However, this product is great to use on the body, especially when shaving.￼lefresidue￼ it left a residue however, this product is great to use on the body, especially when shaving.
