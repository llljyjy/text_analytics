I know I’m making a big claim here, but it’s better than the laneige sleeping mask. Starting off with the packaging, it’s convenient and innovative. I enjoy that I don’t have to dip in my fingers in the formula avoiding introducing bacteria to it. the way it feels on the lips it’s incredible. It’s nourishing, hydrating and has little to no scent (which I love). It’s thick, not sticky and will stay on for an entire day /night. The reason I like this better than the laneige because this actually feels like it’s conditioning your lips. Meanwhile the laneige sleeping mask just acts like a barrier. Just be a tad he careful when screwing the bottom to dispense product. A little goes a long way. Better than Laneige sleeping mask
