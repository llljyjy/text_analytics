Those reviews that say this has a strong scent… either my sniffer is malfunctioning or it’s just not true. It has a scent - but it’s a mild, soft, sweet scent not like a strong fragrance. Just me? Ok. Also - I have had backne ridiculously persistent for 10 years. Tried various acne clearing washes and everything just dried it out. I figured what the heck - if this deep cleans my face with only one wash - why not try it on the back. 1 week later, almost totally clear. Whoop whoop! And of course, a little goes a long way with this cleanser which is huge for me. It’s not expensive at all when it lasts a solid 2+ months and is only $25. 5 stars from me for sure. (PS - I have VERY dry skin - flaky, the works - in the winter and this is the only cleanser I’ve used that doesn’t strip it and actually improves my complexion in the winter). My naturally red sensitive face has evened out enough that I go without makeup most days - or very little. Just don’t need it! backne? clear face? MAGIC
