Okay so, I had very high hopes for this product. I am a Fenty fanatic. I recently learned that I need to incorporate SPF into my skincare regimen and went through a few brands; this being one of them. The pros for me: product has a nice consistency, doesn’t leave behind the white cast that most SPF products do, cute and convenient packaging. The CONS for me: it’s only SPF 30 yikes; made my face look oily, not dewy, there’s a difference & my skin was having some sort of reaction to the product. I believe there may be an ingredient that I am allergic to in this formula. Not sure which ingredient it could be because I steer clear of any allergen that is known to me. New allergy I guess? The reaction was small bumps on my face. They were really small but they were all over my face. The last time that sort of reaction happened to me was when I rubbed hydrogen peroxide straight out the bottle onto my face yearsssss back. Please note that I have sensitive, acne prone skin. I have hyperpigmentation (it’s not too bad) & oiliness in my T-Zone area. So, combination/oily skin. I give 3 stars for the three pros that I mentioned lol. I still love you RiRi! Here's the deal.....
