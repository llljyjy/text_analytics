I’ve been a past customer of the Fenty makeup line.  But I had never thought of trying the Fenty Skin line.  The very first time I used it was while I was in the shower; my eyes were half closed as I opened the bottle to wash my face.  Once I squeezed a little in my hands to rub together, I immediately opened my eyes because I could not believe how soft, rich, and utterly delectable (okay, if I can use that word; didn’t eat it) it was.  I was blown away. I typically switch maybe every couple of months different cleanser and moisturizers to try and see what works best for my skin.  This is a keeper for me, along with the moisturizer, fat water, and flash nap.  Thank you for your quality products. Where Did You Get This From!
