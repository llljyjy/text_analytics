I would like to completely edit my review. Update. This made me break out. I was not sure if it was this but I spaced out my use and without fail it causes severe acne. Moreover, it’s not actually broad spectrum, it’s an SPF 15 by international standards, at best. The ingredients are not clean, so the labeling is also false. Watch out for this with Sephora products in general. I would definitely save my coins for Biossance or another sunscreen instead. I would return this if I could. CAUSES BREAKOUTS. NOT CLEAN
