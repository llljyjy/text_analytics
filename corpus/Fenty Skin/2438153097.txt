I’ve been using this product for 2 weeks and first off I love the smell it’s a very soft scent to me and I feel relaxed when using it but I can say the scent doesn’t really stay on my body long. It’s got a great lather but I don’t recommend for everyday use as it can be pretty drying , I was expecting to have buttery feeling skin but it’s just okay but it definitely gets you super clean !! I also think it’s been helping my with my body acne as well. I received this product from a  free sample program.and latherleather Favorite addition
