Once you get past the texture of this mask itâ€™s a great experience. It has a very pudding-like consistency that can be a little hard to get the right amount out without a spatula and the charcoal beads are easy to break apart as you spread the mask on your face. I really loved that this mask was easy to wash off. I was slightly concerned the Salicylic Acid would leave my skin feeling dry but it did not, just left it feeling clean. I definitely see this as a new go-to product to use in addition to sheet masks and will be purchasing it once I run out. New Go-To
