This is SO GORGEOUS. It just melts into the skin and blends effortlessly. It also feels amazingly hydrating and refreshing upon application. It doesnâ€™t feel thick, heavy, greasy or tacky. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this. Taking off a star for the strong fragrance. Will definitely be purchasing their fragrance free version sometime because they knocked it out of the park with this - totally an SPF that I actually want to use! almost perfect
