Not sure this mask accomplishes the task of resurfacing. There is no scent, which is supposed to be a positive but I was disappointed. The charcoal dots were only plentiful on the top so that it looked like cookies and cream upon opening...The majority of the container was the whipped white mask. I wonâ€™t be buying it again. Disappointing, but fine
