Oh. My. God. This is incredible. My lips were chapped and peeling almost to the point of bleeding—four days later, they were soft and healed. It’s much better, in my opinion, than the Laneige lip mask (which is what I used to use). It isn’t very sticky at all (it just feels like a slightly thickened oil) and smells heavenly. It’s a bit pricey, but oh so worth it!! Amazing stuff!!
