Absolutely love it! This is definitely my new favourite face mask. The texture of this face mask is wonderful. After my first use, my skin definitely looked brighter. After 3 days I used it again and my skin feels and looks great. Itâ€™s definitely a great face mask made with goodness for your skin. Would definitely recommend for everyone to try this out. I have normal to dry skin and had no reactions to this. Worth the hype. Will definitely repurchase.
