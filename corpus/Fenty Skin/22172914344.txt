I love the product itself and the packaging is beautiful, but in use, it’s a little inconvenient. Maybe I’m in the minority here but I was initially a little confused on how to dispense the product and the box itself had no instructions. On first use I was twisting the bottom for a long time before any product even came out, and since it had no instructions I wasn’t even sure if I was doing the right thing or if I was breaking the tube. A simple “remove cap and twist bottom” on the packaging would go a long way. And if you accidentally twist too much, the product overflows and a lot goes too waste.  The lip mask itself is super hydrating and nourishing and I do feel like it helps my lips stop getting chapped in the cold air we’ve been having recently. Overall it’s a good product and I appreciate that they were innovative with the packaging, but I can’t help but think a standard squeeze tube would be better. nan
