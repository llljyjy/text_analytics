After using this product for a few weeks, here are my thoughts. I feel like this is a lightly hydrating toner. It wonâ€™t fix majorly dry skin, but gives it an extra boost. The scent is great, but the feeling when it dries is odd. It feels like a skin on my face, so I am not sure how well my moisturizer or serums soak in. Overall, if you need a boost in the moisture department, use this. Great for a boost!
