Juicy and lit lit!!  Those are the words that I use to describe this Fat Water.  Sometimes I use it with a cotton round, and other times I just splash a little in my hands and massage it into my skin.  Either way, my skin is left soft, smooth, and juicy.  The niacinamide in it is slowly clearing my dark spots.  Great job Ri-Ri, this toner doesnâ€™t disappoint. Juicy and Lit Lit!!!
