This is super moisturizing without feeling sticky, which I love. It’s also a really pretty gloss-- it’s pretty clear with a light pink tinge. I took off one star because the cherry smell is very strong and very artificial-- like a piece of candy. I wish it was less strong or at least a little more realistic, because it throws me off of what is otherwise a very good product. nan
