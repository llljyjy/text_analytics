I love Fenty Skin & Beauty. BUT I don’t see the point of this. I don’t find the product to be any better or worse than simple petroleum jelly or a much less expensive lip moisturizer. The packaging is annoying. If you accidentally turn the applicator too many times and too much product is dispensed, it cannot be replaced so it is just wasted. And product continues to be dispensed after you wipe it on ur lips so I find myself using it and very quickly putting the top back on to stop the product from coming out. All in all, this is the one Fenty product I’ve tried so far that I cannot recommend. It's fine but there's a lot cheaper options
