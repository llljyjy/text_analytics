I was at my local Sephora deciding what sunscreen to add to my routine because I was tired of the horrendous white cast my previous sunscreen left. I am so happy that my gut told me to go for this sunscreen, this is the best sunscreen I have ever used and it is now an essential product I cannot switch out in my skincare routine. Perfect under makeup and has never made my oily skin feel overly greasy, even when Iâ€™m at work! a million times, YES
