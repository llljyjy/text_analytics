the lip oil is okay, it’s definitely not the best. it’s more of a gloss than an actual lip oil it’s very thick. i do feel like because it’s so thick it last a long time. you can eat and still feel it on after you’re done. it’s not super moisturizing either. i don’t know if there’s anything special about. it’s also tiny, definitely the smallest lip oil out of all of the really popular ones right now. i’m going to continue to use it because it works just fine but i don’t think id repurchase it. first thing i didn’t love from fenty :( more like a gloss than an oil
