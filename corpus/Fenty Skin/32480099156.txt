so this is my first time using Rihanna’s skin care line and I’m quite happy with this particular moisturizer-sunscreen combo.   I love the idea of a refillable cannister holder. Helps limit waste somewhat.  The product as a “moisturizer“ is very nice & hydrating, it’s a light feel, leaves skin dewy and smells freaking good & having SPF 30 in it? bonus.  My previous line I still love but it was a affordability issue, why spend double for two products and two forms of packaging when I can find it here all in one, it does the job and feels really nice on my skin.  I have fairly reactive skin and struggle with acne still and this product has not triggered any irritation or flare-ups whatsoever as I typically get acne from sunscreen use.  Worth the buy! at least give it a try! especially if you’re looking for a decent sunscreen in a gentle formulation bonused by the moisturizing qualities combined. Best combo of moisturizing and sun protection
