I don’t know how much I can say about its claims, I use multiple dark spot products and I think all doing their part over time. However, there are two spots that are fading regardless. I just think this packaging is super cool and I love how serum-y this toner is, so I just love the texture on my skin and therefore using it every day.I took one star off because it doesn’t unseat my favourite toner of all time.... The Black Rice Hyaluronic Acid Toner from Haru Haru Wonder. It’s like $10 cheaper but doesn’t have niacinamide. Might buy this again to keep niacinamide in my routine after I finish the one from Good Molecules that is less viscose, has niacinamide and is like definitely half price or something. It's a Looker fo' sho'
