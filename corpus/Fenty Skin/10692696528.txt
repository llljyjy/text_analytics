I received this product in exchange for an honest review. It smells delicious before you even take it out of the box. I was obsessed. It doesn’t smell as much once you’re lathering it on the shower. It does last quite a while which is nice. It did leave a slight waxy feel on the skin which I wasn’t a fan of. But I did notice my skin to be a bit more moisturized. Works great
