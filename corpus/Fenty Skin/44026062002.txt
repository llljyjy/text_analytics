I got this full size product as part of a sample program. It has a thick texture, similar to aquaphor vs Vaseline. The smell is similar to those non scented petroleum jelly lip balms. There is no tint added to the lips so it acts as a clear gloss that does not feel sticky or tacky and can be worn during the day as well. For the price, I don’t think it’s a necessity since aquaphor would really do the same thing. The product packaging is pretty cute. Gets the job done but definitely overpriced
