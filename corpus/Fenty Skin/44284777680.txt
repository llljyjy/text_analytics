Recieved this as a free sample, so for a free product it is fine enough. However, if I’d paid more than $20 for it I’d probably be pretty disappointed. It’s just pretty sticky, and honestly doesn’t work as well as my Burt’s Bees regular chapstick. So, if you’re looking for something ultra hydrating for winter, you’d probably be better off sticking with something tried and true. Can't compete with my Burt's Bees
