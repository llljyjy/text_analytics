Save yourself $20 and get vaseline lip therapy cocoa butter. Put my boyfriend through the test too since he has very dry cracked lips and he preferred the vaseline one more. The Fenty one is not hydrating enough; more of a thick glue than anything. But if you want it just for packaging, its overpriced. Save yourself $20
