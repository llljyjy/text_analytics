Product is great. Healed my cracked winter lips. Thicker and longer lasting than LaNiege more healing than Bite. The applicator and packaging is not great. It’s too bulky to throw in your pocket. The twist up mechanism did not work and I didn’t find any instructions on how to get it going. Would have preferred a straight up basic squeeze tube like the Bite mask. Great product
