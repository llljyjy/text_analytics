I bought this set mostly to try out the Hydra Visor as I love the fact that it has spf, and I can confidently say I will be purchasing the full size once the trial size runs out. It makes my face so soft, and my skin absorbs it super fast. I also enjoyed the cleanser and fat water, but not enough to buy the full size. The cleanser foamed nicely and I love how the bottle dispenses product, but it is strongly fragranced and I enjoy my Tatcha cleansers a bit more. I’m not sure what to think of the fat water, it’s nice but it’s too thick to come out of the bottle easily and I think that’s the biggest reason I’m not super excited about it. But honestly, this kit is fantastic value and I highly recommend purchasing this starter set if you are interested in trying out Fenty Skin. Great Value
