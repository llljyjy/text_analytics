I know the scent is an issue with many & I can’t speak for the scent free version but I think this is one of the best sunscreen/moisturizer combinations out there. I’ve tried many because I want as few steps in my routine as possible. My skin stays moisturized all day, I love the feel, though it may feel too oily for some, & it works as a great primer as well!
