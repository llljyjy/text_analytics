I’ve been suffering from dry and darkening of the lips and this lipstick has helped more than anything I’ve tried before. It keeps the lip i and moisturized until you decided to wipe it off. I love the sort of bent applicator and it smells yummy. It’s also vegan which is amazing and extremely important to me. Wow
