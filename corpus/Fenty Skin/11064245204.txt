The honest truth about this cleanser for me was a horrible experience. I used it faithfully along side the other skin care belonging to FS. I have brown combination skin and this product left my skin with flakes. I continued to give this product a chance and of course get my money worth. I regret continuing with this product because now my face is peeling. The FS products is empty and I will not repurchase. nan
