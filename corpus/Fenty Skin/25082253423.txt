I received this product for free to give my honest review and at first when receiving the product I was definitely a little bit skeptical with it. I never used an applicator like this before but it was probably my favorite thing about this product. You can easily slip it on your hand and it’s soft but has some texture that you can feel it helping exfoliate your skin. I do like the treatment its self, it has a soft scent and definitely helped my skin look better especially on the parts of my face that have more oil. I think the only downside is how small the product is (which I understand since you only are supposed to use it 1-2 times a week) but depending on how your skin is you may need more. And getting the product out of the bottle isn’t my favorite, it’d be nice to see the treatment is a slightly bigger bottle with a pump to get the product out easier. nan
