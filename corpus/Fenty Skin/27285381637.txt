I really like the concept of this product but it’s not for me. The texturizing and hydration are great but I’m left with a sticky and slightly itchy film on the skin. The smell isn’t overpowering but still gave me quite a headache. I think it might be best to just stick to using toner and serums in their separate capacities. nan
