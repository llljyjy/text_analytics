This is one of the first milky toners I have tried and I am so happy to have been gifted this from a free sample program because I’m in love! So many toners on the market strip the skin of natural oils so I was pleased to be able to try a more calming and beneficial toner for my skin. This toner is perfect for dull or dry skin, you just apply with your hands and pat into the skin to reveal dewy moisturizer skin. I’m not a big fan of the way the product dispenses because I think it’s hard to get it out in a way that won’t get the product on the cap and make it unsanitary. But visually this is a very pleasing product and it even smells like peaches!I would repurchase if I needed a toner I know worked well for dry skin. In Love
