I received this product as part of a free sample program in exchange for my honest review. I used it about twice a week for a few weeks and am really impressed with the results! Immediately after use my skin felt tighter and smoother. There was less visible texture and shine, it kind of leveled out my skin tone  a little bit and i felt like buffed away some of the smaller bumps on the surface of my skin. I also really like the applicator, it’s course enough to feel like its working but not so rough it hurts to use. Only downside is a slightly chemical smell, but that didn’t really bother me. Surprised and Impressed
