I was not anticipating how good this was going to be. I generally love facial bars to begin with, so I was excited when this launched. It does have a strong fragrance, so I would be cautious if you know your skin is sensitive to fragrance, but I haven’t had any issues and I have pretty sensitive skin myself. This creates a really creamy lather on the skin, and effectively cleans the skin without drying out my skin. You can lather a small amount with the hands and then apply to the skin if your skin is more dry and sensitive, or for more oily skin,  you can apply the bar directly to the skin for the most deep and effective cleanse. I love facial bars to begin with, but this formula is still amazing, and the texture once on the skin is honestly better than some of the high end luxury cleansers I’ve tried. My new love?
