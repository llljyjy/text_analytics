I received this in exchange for an honest review. First off the packaging is aesthetically pleasing. The cherry scent isnâ€™t nauseating like most tend to be which i was pleasantly surprised by! The formula is long lasting, shiny, and very hydrating. I only need to reapply every 5 or so hours which is super convenient for a lip gloss :) Super yummy and hydrating!
