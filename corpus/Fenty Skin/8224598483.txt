this lip oil contains sweet cherry seed oil, barbados cherry + wild cherry extracts, jojoba seed & rosehip fruit oils! this was one of my first times trying out a lil oil and I really liked it! my first impressions were definitely not the best as I thought the lip oil was sticky and felt like a lipgloss but, the more I wore this, the more it felt like an oil! it feels so moisturizing and makes my lips nice and shiney while instantly softening my lips. it has a childhood cherry chapstick scent to it kind of like those kiddie lip glosses I used to own as a child,  not my fave but it’s alright. I was NOT impressed with the packaging as it gave off dollar store vibes which for $24 is just not right. once you took the doe foot applicator out(which I love), you can also see how the lip oil comes less than halfway full, I really really wish it didn’t come with such less product because I really do like it overall, while the packaging and quantity you get is unfair, the lip oil feels VERY nice on the lips, especially if you’re prone to having dry lips (aka me). pick it up if you’re willing to spend $24 on it because it’s definitely worth the hype! nan
