First thing I noticed was the fun texture of this product! Naturally I smelled it because it looks like cookies and cream but it has no smell. The ingredients are great. I applied to my dry skin after a double cleanse, massaged it into my skin until it turned gray, left it on 15 minutes. After cleansing this off I noticed my skins appearance looked more radiant, pores shrunk, and skin appeared firmer. I love the immediate results and will continue using this! fun and effective
