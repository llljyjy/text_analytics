I received this as part of a free sample program and I think I otherwise wouldn’t have thought to buy the product but now since I’ve tried it I really like it and would buy it again! The only thing I didn’t really like was the smell, it smells nice but it was a little too strong for me. Still, it left my skin feel soft and clean—not stripped at all which is something I usually dislike about bar soaps. nan
