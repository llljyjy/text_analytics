I’ve been using this for 2 weeks before writing a review and let me just say I am absolutely in love!!! My skin has never looked so glowy and felt so soft!! It works better than any facial exfoliator I’ve ever used and it shrunk a lot of my bigger pores! I noticed a lot of reviews talking about the scent but I really don’t notice it lol and it is fragrance free so it’s not going to smell like fake fragrance. I would say definitely give it a shot!! Just make sure you wear the hydro visor moisturizer since it has spf or a good spf before going outside cause you can get sunburnt easier with this product yesss sis
