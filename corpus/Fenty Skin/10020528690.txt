Recently started using this product and love it. After using it the first time it seemed to have helped with my pores and excessive shine. The charcoal and clay make this product so worth it. My face felt tight and clean too. I love how when you rub it in it literally is like cookies and cream and turns dark. It doesnâ€™t really have a scent, would be cool if it did smell like cookies though. I would recommend this product to my friends and family over cheaper alternatives. Feels so good!
