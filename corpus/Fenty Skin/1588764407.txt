Ahhh, she finally got it right this time, for my skin at least. I bought the other serum and it was just ok on my skin. My skin favors more moisturizing products and the other serum was just meh. I mix Philosophy vitamin C powder with my moisturizers and I didn’t like mixing it with the other serum. When I saw she released this I couldn’t wait to try it and I love it! I really like the smell, but it’s the kind of smell that some people may not like. It smells like a bar of milk soap. Personally I like moisturizers out of a pump bottle, and this is easy to transfer to one. More moisture! Finally!
