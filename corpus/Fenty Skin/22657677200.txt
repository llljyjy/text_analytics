This essence is so hydrating and soothing. Soaked into my skin very quickly. No residue or irritation. My skin looks great when I wake up after using it at night. This always made it difficult to find products, even those marketed as hypoallergenic/sensitive, that actually worked with my skin instead of irritating it further. I can honestly say that this essence does what it says it will. It not only calms down my skin and prepares it for the next steps of my skincare routine, it also feels like the hydrating, protecting barrier that my skin naturally lacks. I truly feel that my skin is healthier, happier, and stronger with this essence. Because of this essence alone My favorite skincare product
