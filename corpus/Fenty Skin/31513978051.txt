After using this product I noticed a big change in the texture of my skin!! My pores look and feel smaller to me. It also has reduced the size and redness of my acne as well as acne scars. The feeling of the product is very nice. It is a thick serum that is easily applied across the skin. I like the refillable aspect of the product packaging. However, the plastic packaging feels a little cheap. Although I really do like this product, I feel like you could find a similar product for a much less price. Which is the only reason why I gave it four stars instead of five. Great product!! Just too expensive
