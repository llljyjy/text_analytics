I received my latest bottle of this product as part of a free sample program but have been using this ever since it dropped! I use this 3 times a week after double cleansing and toner for a little extra exfoliation. This is amazing for taking away my top layer of dead skin cells and any debris that may be lingering after cleansing. This leaves my skin tone more even and my face visibly brighter! I always make sure to wear sunscreen the next day since AHA’s can increase your skin’s sensitivity to the sun. Overall I highly recommend this product for anyone with congested skin. A favorite in my routine
