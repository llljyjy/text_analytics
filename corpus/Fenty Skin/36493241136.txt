I absolutely love this face mask. The mask itself is the consistency of thick pudding and feels so good going on my skin. Watching the mask change colors as I applied was fun. after 15 mins I rinsed my face and was shocked at how smooth and soft my skin felt and looked great! Fenty cookies and clean mask
