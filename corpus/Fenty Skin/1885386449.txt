I’ve been using this soap over the past couple weeks (just on my body) and what I can say is that it is a decent soap. It smells amazing and has a nice, creamy lather. However, it gives you that “squeaky clean” feeling which I do not like. I usually follow up with a moisturizing body wash and lotion and my skin is back to normal. I enjoy using the soap but if I’m being completely honest, I’d rather pay money for a soap that I know my skins LOVES and won’t get dried out from. *I received this product as part of a free sample program.
