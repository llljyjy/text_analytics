The soap has a nice coco butter scent to it but the after smell gives me a little bit of a playdough smell and I did not really enjoy that, but it didnt ruin the soap for me. Overall,I really enjoyed the cleansing bar, it made a really nice lather and did not leave me feeling dry after I used it on my body which is a big plus for me becasue most soaps tend to dry me out. I definitely think that this can become my new daily body soap because I feel that it is better than dove to me. The only thing that I wish is that the scent was a little stronger becasue I like scented soaps, and just becasue it is a natural scent doesnt mean it has to be so light. But overall I would recommend this other to use. I did not get a chance to try this soap on my face, because I have super sensitive skin on my face, but I also think this would be great facial soap as well for people with normal skin.
