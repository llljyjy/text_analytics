I was not expecting Fenty to have a skin-changing serum, but it has completely changed my face and decolletage. A little goes a long way and you get so much in the 5 oz package so I can use it on a wider area. I also have very sensitive skin that sometimes reacts to niacinamide, so when I didnâ€™t have any issues using the sample I bought the full size. Layers beautifully under moisturizer. nan
