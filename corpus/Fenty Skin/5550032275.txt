This stuff smells amazing first of all. I have pretty sensitive skin as well as a damaged skin barrier due to using too many products on my sensitive skin. This stuff did not hurt my skin and was super easy and smooth to put on. I really only had one issue and that’s that this product was slightly drying even though it’s not intended to be, which I thought was odd, however, it’s a great product and I’d definitely recommend to people of all skin types. awesome stuff by fenty
