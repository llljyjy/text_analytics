This was a fun product to use! It was cool to watch the charcoal beads break open and turn the mask from white to a dark gray color. Aside from that, it did not have a fragrance. I was expecting a cookies and cream fragrance. The mask did not overly dry my face but I don’t think it did much in terms of “detoxing“ my skin. nan
