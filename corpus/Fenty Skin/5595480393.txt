I really loved this product and it was SUPER hydrating on my lips. Better than any chapstick or lip mask I’ve used before (Laneige included) HOWEVER if you break out easily beware. I didn’t realize that this had coconut oil in it, and I immediately got 2-3 small pimples around my lips after one use. So sad because this was amazing and holy grail worthy. I still give it 4 stars because it hydrated so well, but I am returning. this Holy grail worthy, but acne sufferers beware
