Okay so I really wanted to love this product :( It smells pretty good and the tube is small and cute. However, I found that my lips got extremely dry and started peeling. It actually reminded me of when I used to buy those cheap smackers lip gloss back in the day. I ended up needing to use the Laneige sleeping lip mask to rehydrate my poor lips. Not worth it. Ugh So Disappointed
