I received this product as part of a free sample program. I hate to say it but this product is horrible. When I first received this product it took forever to figure out how to get it to work and when I did figure it out I twisted on it for a long time before anything came out. When the product does come out it dispenses way too much and ends up all over the inside cap when closed. Don’t even think about just putting it on using the container it comes in as it just smears all over the package and nothing gets on your lips, it has to be applied using a cotton swab to not make a mess. The product itself is very unpleasant and has a smell like old chapstick. It’s way too thick on and leaves your lips sticky and goopy for hours even after overnight wear. I would not recommend this product as it’s not worth your money or your time. Horrible Product
