Super excited on receiving this lip oil from Bzz Agent and Fenty skin for my honest review. It smells delicious. Perfect lip oil for my always dry lips , love the bulky applicator . The oil is really hydrating and leaves my lips super soft and juicy . Love the packaging and the bulky size of it . Will definitely last me for a while . The hydration stays long even after it dries down . Definitely worth the money and definitely will buy more after Iâ€™m done with this one . I love it
