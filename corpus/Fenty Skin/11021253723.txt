I first bought this to see if it would anyway help with boosting my complexion and PIH/dark spots on my face. I was hoping that this product would slightly help with my complexion and expecting it to cause acne breakouts and/or irritation on my sensitive skin. Sometimes I get surprised by which products my skin decides not to react to. I was speechless with the results that this toner gave me ...and then when my speechlessness recovered I couldn’t stop talking about it!My acne went from roughly 50% severe (average pencil eraser-head sized) and 50% cystic (dime-sized) to 40% severe, 30% cystic (Jan 2022) to 30% severe & 20% cystic (May 2022). This product also lightened up my PIH from a dark brown to a less dark brown and helped (along with rest of my skincare) erase some dark marks. It smells like a tropical cherry and floral combo, sweeter, more tropical, less intense than the cleanser. The smell vanishes within 3 minutes.This toner feels like a loose gel or a serum in my hands. I prefer to use my hands to apply this. Fat water toner has the EXACT SAME texture on the face as the Avène anti-imperfection concentrate. I 100% believe that there were some cosmetic formulators/scientists/chemists shared between the teams behind these products. On top of it, both companies have French connections (Avène is French and Fenty Skin is co-owned by LVMH). You cannot convince me otherwise.The packaging is nice, pretty, and sleek. While I usually prefer pumps for serum, I like this method of pouring out the toner as for me, the toner is too liquid-y to be a proper serum.  I like the quantity, 50 mL lasts ~1.5 months sporadically used (1-2 times a week) and 150 mL is enough for alternate day application on my face for 4 months.A staple in my skincare routine & must-have product in regards to my acne, PIH, and dark marks. Strongly recommend. Did Wonders for my Acne & PIH
