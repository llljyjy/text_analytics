It’s just a bar of soap. The only special thing about this cleansing bar is that it’s from Rihanna’s brand but I stopped buying bar soap for my body many years ago. This was sent to me as part of a free sample program and I’ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and it’s nice. Washes the skin, lathers beautifully, doesn’t make me feel dry but I wouldn’t buy this with my own money, body washes in a bottle are more cost effective and this bar doesn’t have anything that a cheap body wash doesn’t. Not Special
