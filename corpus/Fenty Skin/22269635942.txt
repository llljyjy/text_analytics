I am an avid user of lip masks, and received this product as part of a free sample program. First, I would like to say that this lip mask feels like Vaseline. It is really thick and sticky, and doesn’t exactly allow your lips to glide together. You definitely can’t forget that you have this mask on your lips. As well, the packaging is inventive (the twist top helps with reducing bacteria in your product I’m sure), but is very touchy so make sure not to twist very much at all! All that being said, this product did do what it said it would! It left my lips feeling silky smooth the next morning, and I even felt that the lines in my lips were less prominent. The results are definitely great, but there is some room for improvement, especially in the wear department. For a higher end product I feel as though it should feel a little more luxurious and a little less drug store. Overall, I would recommend this product! Works, but room for improvement
