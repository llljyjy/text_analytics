Sunscreen is one of those textures that feels absolutely awful on my skin; I can generally avoid putting any on for my arms and legs by covering up, but my face can’t exactly wear long sleeves. This moisturizer has such a great texture that makes wearing spf pleasant. It gives me peace of mind every morning I put it on as I’ve had my fill of sun damage as a child. I loved it so much, I gifted it to two more people. I hate wearing sunscreen, so thank god for this.
