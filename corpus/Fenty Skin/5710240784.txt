Love this lip oil! I received this cherry treat lip oil complimentary in exchange for my honest review. It’s super hydrating, left my lips feeling nourished for a few hours and didn’t leave my lips feeling sticky. The taste/smell is pleasantly cherry, not overwhelmingly scented. The color is super natural, just a cute light wash of pink, which I love! Overall would totally recommend :) this lipgloss is poppin’!
