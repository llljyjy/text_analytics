Im usually obsessed with everything fenty like i raveee and tell everyone about it. However this product is not one of them. I was expecting more. If you love the dior lip glow oil this is not a dupe. It is very long lasting but also feels very kiddy like children makeup. My mom compared it too cheap kitchen oil. Love the brand this one isnt it for me. nan
