This is a really nice clay mask. I like that it has the charcoal beads for some physical exfoliation as well as the salicylic acid for chemical exfoliation. If I use this at night, my skin feels nice and smooth and not dried out in the morning, which is great since some clay masks can really dry out the skin. I will have to use this on more long-term basis to see if it really has an effect on the mild acne I have, but from my experience so far I think this is a great mask. nan
