I loved this mask, from the packaging, to the unique texture, to how my skin looked and felt afterwards , it was a good experience all around. I liked how creamy it was like taking it out of the jar I didn’t know what to expect as it felt kind of weird but as soon as you rub it on your face it got so smooth, the little beads in it give a slight exfoliation but nothing crazy. I felt like my pores looked cleaner for sure, skin felt smooth and clear after and it wasn’t super hard to get off which I like. Very cool texture mask
