I have been using this yummy juicy goodness on my lips every day (2 times a day) for the last 3 weeks &I can honestly say I love how my lips look &feel. They have been super soft &plump looking.. also it’s super moisturizing without feeling sticky.. I use when I do my skincare routine in the morning &at night before bed. I love this stuff so much I will have to buy a backup for sure once it’s back in stock. New holy grail lip oil, I legit just wanna drench my lips in it! Ohhh &did I mention it smells amazing. 10/10 !!!!! Cherry goddess
