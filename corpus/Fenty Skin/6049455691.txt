Face masks are an essential to my weekly routine! The Cookies N Clean absolutely did the job. Apply a good layer and having to mix in the charcoal clumps onto the face was nice to integrate into the skin and combine with the overall texture! I will say I loved washing the mask off and having my skin feel nice and clean but also the feeling of a pure product has gently cleaned up the surface after a long days work. I would continue to purchase this product and anything Fenty Skin! Stunning Face Mask
