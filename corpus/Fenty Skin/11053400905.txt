I really like this product, which is pretty impressive when you consider I’m not a bar soap fan! It didn’t leave the weird scummy feeling I have come to expect, I could see it becoming a regular part of my routine. The smell is great and feels very natural. It feels very luxurious and has a very nice lather to it. You don’t need very much to get a lot of bubbles and it will last me for a while, which makes a great deal considering the price. My only real complaint is that it has almost no exfoliation, which did make it so I needed to use sugar scrubs more often, that said is that really too bad a thing? I also used this soap after a fresh tattoo and it was perfect, no irritation and it’s perfectly healed. I would buy this again. nan
