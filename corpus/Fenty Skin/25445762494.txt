I received this product as a part of a free sample program. I was very surprised by how well formulated this product was. It is nice and thick and really helps moistures lips without a strong smell or flavor. I really love the packaging. It has a twist bottom that allows you to dispense the perfect amount per application. Definitely the most clean and sanitary lip mask packaging I have seen and tried. nan
