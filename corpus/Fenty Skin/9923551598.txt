Used this for a few weeks already and while I love it as a gloss, I don’t think it is hydrating enough on it’s own. A little goes a long way, but it shines if you apply it over a balm or after a lip mask to lock in moisture. You will need to reapply every time you eat. I love the plump and glossy look it gives and the sheer formula allows you to apply on top of a lip stain for some color. The scent is pleasant but noticeable if you don’t like the taste. Overall it is a good lip gloss that will lock in moisture but if you have extremely dry lips then look for something with more moisturizing ingredients. Sheer hydration
