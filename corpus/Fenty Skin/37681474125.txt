So I really enjoyed trying this mask out. The texture was nice, it felt cleansing but not overly drying. When allowing the mask to dry for 10-15 minutes it was comfortable, while others I have tried would become itchy and irritate my skin. So I was pretty impressed by how pleasant overall the experience was! The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because of how little of an amount it comes with, for 30+ dollars. I was sent this product in exchange for my honest review. Refreshing!
