After using this products over the last 2 weeks or so my dry skin has been hydrated. The application is easy, the formula fenomenal a bit sticky but non drying. I have noticeable pores on my nose and a bit on my cheeks, but not anymore!! My pores have minimized to the point where I cant even see them, and my complexion is so much more even now.  The product distributes smoothly on the face and it does have a pleasant scent to it however it is not fragranced.The price may seem steep but the bottle is large and will last a long time. I receive this from a free sample program. A must have in everybody's routine!!
