The product really feels like like it gives your skin a super deep clean when massaging this into your skin. Plus, it smells SO good! I was super impressed because it didn’t leave any kind of residue and left my skin soft, and matte! If you have oily skin I would definitely start introducing this into your routine because it makes you face look matte and not overly dry. I’m happy this product feels super lightweight , and you can actually feel it working into your skin, in the best way possible! I didn’t find it irritating, and it didn’t break me out at all. I’m super excited to keep this in my skincare routine and once I run out I’m for sure purchasing it again!! My new favorite mask!
