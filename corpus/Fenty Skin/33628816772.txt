This mask works well compared to others I’ve tried. It cleans as neededand leaves your face feeling moisturized. I did break out after the first use but it could be unrelated. I was personally not a fan of the smell (lack of?) And I can’t stand the LOOK of the mask in the jar. It looks like clustered holes and gives me the creeps. I’d recommend this product to others even though I’m more of a peel off mask person. I don’t think I would buy it for myself but it’s a good product if you’re cool with the type of mask and the higher price point. It works and creeps me out!
