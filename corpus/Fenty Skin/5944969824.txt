I have combination skin and I really love this product!! Compared to a lot of other toners this is moisturizing enough for my dry areas and not too hydrating for my oily ones. I’d definitely buy this product and would tell my family and friends to give it a try!! I received this as part of a “free sample program” Love this!!
