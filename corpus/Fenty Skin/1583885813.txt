Lathers nicely but even when you try scrubbing by your eyes and nose it doesn’t take everything off. I find that I have to go in with a micellar water after to really get my face clean. At first I thought I needed to scrub longer, so I tried doing that the next time but it didn’t work. Not worth it. Doesn’t do the job
