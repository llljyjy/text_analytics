I have been searching for an invisible sunscreen for my olive skin, was using Clinique even better spf for many years and will still use it but probably in the colder weather. I use a couple pumps of this Fenty SPF with a pump or less of my nars foundation and it gives my skin an even and fresh look, without wastage. TRY IT!!
