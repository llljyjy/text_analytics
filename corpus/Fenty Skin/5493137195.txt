This mask is lovely. Itâ€™s so nice to use, the texture of the whipped with the beads inside feels refreshing on your skin. It feels nice while it sets and is easy to wash off. After use your skin feels soft and has a nice glow to it. It smells nice and not overpowering and it only takes a little so you get several uses out of this container. I love that it has clean ingredients. I would recommend this to anyone who likes masks, this is a must try. Refreshing Mask
