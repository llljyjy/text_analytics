This is a really good daily cleanser. I think it is pricey for what it does, but it works really well as a morning cleanser, and also as a part of a double cleanse routine. I like that it lathers up nicely and my face feels really clean after. It does have a fragrance, but that doesn’t bug me, it’s actually quite nice to wake up to. Good basic cleanser
