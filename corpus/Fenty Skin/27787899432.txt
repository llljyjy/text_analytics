I am a sucker for toners so I was estatic to try this product! It is so hydrating and I love the milky texture. I have quite a dull skin so I am always open to trying skincare products that provide hydration and plumpness to my skin. This also pairs nicely with my moisturizer to give me even more hydration. I also saw that it is good for dark spots so I am very excited to keep using this everyday and, hopefully, see my dark spots darkening over time. Love it!
