I liked this serum. It looks like a gel but it spreads like a liquid. It makes my face feel so much smoother and i’ve noticed that my more recent spots have faded out a bit. This product’s packaging isn’t like anything i’ve seen before and i like it! it’s hygienic and it’s super fun to use. you have some control over how much product comes out, which helps reduce waste.I would absolutely buy and use this product again, and i would absolutely recommend to my friends and family. Great packaging and great formula
