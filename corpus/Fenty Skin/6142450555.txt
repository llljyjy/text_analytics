Does what it needs to do! Scent is mild, not over powering and able to be layered with other body care products. The lather up is great and doesn’t take much to get soapy. The product does clarify the skin as it claims, not too moisturizing but doesn’t completely strip the skin. This product will last a while since it is massive. I’ve yet to try it on the face, but happy to know it is geared for full body cleansing. Packaging is eco friendly and if I recall correctly there is a holder for it as well. Would recommend to try for sure during the Sephora sale so add to your list! Worth a try to support Fenty Skin!
