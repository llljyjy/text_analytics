I received this product as a free sample. The reason why I accept this product is because I love free things, but the truth is that I was not very excited about the idea of ​​receiving this product because I thought it would be the same as a lip gloss and I do not like lip gloss, they are very sticky, I don’t like their texture, and when they dry they feel weird.I didn’t know the difference between a lip gloss and a lip oil. But to my surprise, I liked this lip oil. The texture is not sticky. My lips feel soft. It is better than using lip balm, because lip balm dries very fast, and this lip oil can last for a long time on my lips. It is very moisturizing. It adds a nice glow to my lips, and it has the advantage that it doesn’t have a color, so I can use it over a lipstick or tint and add some color to my lips with a bit of glow.I really liked having tried this product, definitely I will use it on a daily basis.Is there something I didn’t like about this product? Yes. I expected that being cherries would have a small aroma to them, but it was not like that, it is not a big deal, but I do think that I should comment on it. A perfect glow without a sticky feeling.
