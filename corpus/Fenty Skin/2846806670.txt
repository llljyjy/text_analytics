I have combination, sensitive skin. My skin usually gets irritated with cleansing masks like these, but I had no irritation or rosacea after using this! My skin felt clean and fresh, not stripped.

As you press it into your skin, the capsules burst and mix with the mousse to create a dark charcoal face mask. Yummy and Cleansing Mask
