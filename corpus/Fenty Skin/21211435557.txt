First and foremost, I LOVE this productâ€™s packaging! It is super easy to dispense and the product does not leak. This product applies smoothly and is not sticky. I have been using it twice a day since receiving it and some of the sun spots I have already appear lighter (I have a medium skin tone for reference). I think this product is great for someone who has tried a bunch of dark spot serums without any results. What I love most about the product is the texture and the fact that there is no residue left on my skin. Watch Ya Tone... A Must Try Product!
