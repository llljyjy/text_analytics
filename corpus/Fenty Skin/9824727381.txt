The product texture is very similar to a mouse and the charcoal beads really add an exfoliating and deep clean when massaging into your skin. I was very impressed when using this product as it help absorb excess oil and clarify my skin! If you have dull, acne prone, or oily skin this is a must have! I would recommend this product to my friends and family. My favorite thing about this mask is that it doesnâ€™t feel heavy on my skin it feels very light and you can feel it working on your pores. I will continue to use this product and purchase when I run out! nan
