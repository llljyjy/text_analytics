I really enjoy using it. It’s pretty thick so expect to “feel“ like something is on your lips. I put this on in the morning after I’ve used the Laniege lip sleep mask. My lips have never been softer. Good thing is, it doesn’t take a lot to get the benefit so it’ll last a while. use this w/ Laniege sleep mask for the softest lip
