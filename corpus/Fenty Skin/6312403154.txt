Obsessed! Finally! I found a lip oil that isn’t too thick and doesn’t dry out my lips. This lip oil is very smooth and hydrating, and on top of that it gives you a perfect gloss look for any style you are looking to accomplish. It also has a thick “duck foot” shape to the lip bristle which works for applying it evenly and smoothly. On top of it feeling like heaven, it also smells like it too. I would recommend this for anyone who has chapped lips and struggles to wear lip gloss because of it. This is for you! Obsessed!
