I was very hesitant to buy this product due to it’s size. One thing I should say that it works, it takes time, but you see results. I also liked the scent and how moisturized it made me feel. My dry skin areas were thanking me for this moisturizer. I do have to say that although it did work, I don’t really think it’s worth your money because there are better products out there. I think that Fenty did a great job, but for someone who is making ends meet, not the best investment. I also think that there are moisturizers that work so much better and with less fragrance. Great Product but won’t buy again
