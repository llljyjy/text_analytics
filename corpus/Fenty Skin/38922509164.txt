I received this product as a free promotion in exchange for am honest review. Overall, I really do like this product and I do feel like it does what it says it does. I took off one start because the application method is a little messy. However, the product itself does leave my lips feeling smooth and hydrated. I would recommend this product if you are looking for a little extra hydration during these cold months! I use it almost every day
