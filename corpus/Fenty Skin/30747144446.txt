What an interesting concept! The texture was a rich, dense mousse that when spread was silky and smooth.  It did leave my skin feeling slightly tight and dry after rinsing; I needed to decrease to 1x a week to prevent over drying. However, it didn’t leave my skin red, irritated, or itchy like other clay masks have done.  It was easy and convenient to use since no mixing was needed, and the packaging was aesthetically pleasing.  I haven’t noticed a difference in clearing my skin or preventing blemishes; however, my large pores are less noticeable after use. nan
