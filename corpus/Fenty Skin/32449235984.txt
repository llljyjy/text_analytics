I really like the actual product and how nourishing and thick it is. However, I find the packaging to be annoying. It’s difficult to dispense a precise amount of product. A little goes a long way and I often find that I accidentally twist too much product out. I know the packaging is unique and cute but it’s impractical in my opinion. Love the product itself but wish it was a classic pot. Conflicted
