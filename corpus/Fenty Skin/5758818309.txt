I am a ride or die aquaphor girl so it’s hard to find something I like better. This lip mask is nice- I really like the scent and it feels good on the lips. However, I don’t love the packaging (gets messy) and it is verrryyy sticky. I have a dog and her hair gets stuck on my lips when I use this! I will definitely get use out of this but will mainly stick to my aquaphor. Nice Lip Mask!
