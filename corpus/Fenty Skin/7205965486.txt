The Fenty Beauty Cherry Treat Conditioning + Strengthening Oil is hydrating & adds the perfect pinch of color. The color is not an intimidating red if you are like me and do not wear red lips everyday. Lips look healthy and hydrated. I find myself applying the oil multiple times a day because it feels that nourishing compared to other lip oils Iâ€™ve tried. If you want to try a lip oil I would definitely recommend Fenty Beauty Cherry Treat Conditioning + Strengthening Lip Oil! Great ingredients great lip oil
