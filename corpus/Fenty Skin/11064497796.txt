I received this as part of a free sample program, but that doesn’t keep me from stating my true opinion about this product. I love the smell, it has a very natural vanilla scent too it, it’s not too strong it’s the perfect amount of smell. I will say while using this bar soap, after I washed it off it made my skin feeling like rubber. But it has helped with my bacne!! I have a lot of clogged pores in back and I have been using this soap for about 2 weeks now and I will say I’ve seen some improvement with consistency. Smells great!!
