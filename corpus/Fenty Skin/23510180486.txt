I received this as part of a free sample to try out. I was a little surprised by the small size but for first use, it changed my mind completely! I have a lot of dark spots and texture and after a week of using it according to directions, I could tell it made a difference. It smells good, the applicator isnâ€™t too rough on my skin, and it left my skin feeling very, very soft! nan
