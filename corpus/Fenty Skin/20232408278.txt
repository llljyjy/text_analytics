I have acne prone, combo, sensitive skin. This mask did not break me out and felt so good while rubbing in the exfoliation beads and after washing it off. My skin was very soft and glowy. I appreciate this not having any fragrance. My skin didnâ€™t feel tight during the mask but it did feel a little bit tight after washing it off. Nothing too crazy though. great for sensitive skin!
