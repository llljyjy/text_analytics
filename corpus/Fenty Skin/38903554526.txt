Before I get started, I would like to start off by saying that I received this product as a complimentary sample to test and then review.  The texture of the lip oil feels hydrating, smooth, and although is slightly thick, has a good amount of slip. Making it easy to spread across your lips with minimal effort. The cherry scent is strong and very soothing to the mind, mouth, and lips. The lip oil also provides immediate and long lasting hydration, making it ideal for those with dehydrated lips in need of intensive care. nan
