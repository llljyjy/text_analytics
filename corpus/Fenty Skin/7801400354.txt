For starters, 1 star off for the strong fragrance, and 1 star off for how long it takes to dry/be absorbed, and honestly some more fractions of a point should be taken off for the container but… it ain’t THAT bad.I usually like fragrances in products and my skin isn’t sensitive to them at all, but I just never got used to the smell in this spf. To note though, the smell is strongest when applying, and afterwards it subsides and it doesn’t bother me anymore. I’ve seen reviews saying the spf feels heavy and sits on the skin, I think I’ve experienced the same. After I put on my skincare and makeup (no foundation or concealer) and wears a mask for commute, my face feels sweaty even though I’m not sweating.A note on the container/packaging, it’s nice it’s sort of refillable, but the nozzle where the product comes out is flush with the casing, so you gotta have your finger right next to the nozzle when pumping, otherwise the product will just get on the casing. Since the nozzle is open to air, the product that’s in the nozzle oxidizes and turns a dark purple/pink color when you use it the next day. I do really like how easy it is to apply though, feels just like a moisturizer (which it is), and it doesn’t ball up like supergoop’s glowscreen. The review got much longer than I intended… alas. I will definitely try out other spf before coming back to this one for restocking. I wished it to be the one
