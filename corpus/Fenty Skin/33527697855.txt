the skin on my face feels fresh and soft. The texture is so light and a little bit goes a long way!! It works its magic within seconds of applying as I feel my skin tighten and it is so easy to wash it off as well. I have many pores and it detoxed them very well, i have oily skin but upon applying this for a few days, it removed the excess oils. It moisturized my face well, and not feeling dry at all. works wonders detoxing!!
