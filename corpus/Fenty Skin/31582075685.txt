I ABSOLUTELY LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! I received this as a complimentary sample and I am super grateful that I did. It like a little magic gloss in the cutest bottle. I love the simple yummy cherry smell, I love it’s light sticky feel, I love the texture, I love the way it actually conditions my lips and makes them feel super hydrated and soft. It last on forever I think I only reapply it after I eat. The bottle is super cute and the applicator is thick and perfect for a single coat. I literally love everything about it. I have a natural lip color so I just apply it on top for that glossy finish. Every time  I use it I literally fall in love with it even more. I would definitely recommend and would buy again for myself!! It’s become my favorite gloss I have ever tried so far… and knowing that it’s also conditioning my lips makes it my number one favorite! LOVE IT
