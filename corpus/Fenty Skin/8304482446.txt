I wasn’t sure if I’d like Fenty skincare as I’m not huge on the makeup, but I was impressed!! The Fat Water is such a fun product, serum/toner, a great texture and viscosity too!! The moisturizer is so hydrating and feels great on the skin. The face wash is light and didn’t irritate my extremely sensitive skin!!! A+. nan
