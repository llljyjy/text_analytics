I received this product as part of a free sample program. From the moment I took it out of the packaging I fell in love with the subtle scent. It made shower time feel just a bit more luxurious for me. After the past few weeks I can say with certainty that this product helped my skin stay moisturized and hydrated. If it was more affordable I would only use this product for shower time- but you definitely get what you pay for and itâ€™s worth every penny. I will be splurging on this product whenever I can work it into my budget. I absolutely love it and would recommend it to anyone who can keep up with the pricing. So worth it! Worth every penny
