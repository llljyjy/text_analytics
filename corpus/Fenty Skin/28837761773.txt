The Fat Water is a super cute toner. Donâ€™t be like me and unscrew the whole cap to pour it out!!! You can just unscrew the top a little, turn it upside down, and squeeze the bottle. The little indent on the lid is a hole!!! It took me days to figure this out. The toner does feel moisturizing, it has an interesting smell, kinda starchy to me? After letting it dry, it feels like a little stretchy film on my skin, but not unpleasant. A fun and cute experience which definitely makes me feel pampered! And the bottle looks very classy on my vanity. Read this to not be stupid like me!!
