This is a really different mask. Usually clay masks are very drying, but this one surprised me for sure. The texture is almost like a whipped cream texture which is very different from a lot of masks in the market. It also has no scent which is great because he won’t irritate any sensitive skin, but it does look like ice cream! Application wise it honestly went on super smooth, turned gray immediately after I massaged it against my skin, and when drying down it did not feel tight and cracking as many do. It left my skin extremely soft and healthy looking. I will definitely be purchasing this full size. Surprised (but then again it’s Riri)
