I love a good clay mask. This really made my skin appear very clean without drying it out. I love the look of it, especially the little charcoal balls. I feel that this was a great addition to my self care Sundays routine. I did expect it to smell like cookies n cream lol but Iâ€™m glad it has no scent. The salicylic acid really has worked wonders on my skin. Thank you bzzagent!! And thank you Rhianna!! Yes!!
