I overall really enjoyed this product. I did see some change to my lip’s general appearance. My lips were noticeably softer when I used this product twice a day for two weeks. The results of the product are enough for me to recommend it to anyone. Usually, I’m not too fond of scented products, but the cherry scent here was not overpowering. The lip applicator was terrific and very helpful when applying the product. The packing was beautiful and was a joy to hold and look at. I would use this product for years to come and recommend it to anyone. If I had one complaint, it would be that it was a heavy oil, and it took some time for my lips to adjust to the product’s weight. The product results are enough for me to continue to use. I enjoyed this! A Truly Wonderful Cherry Lip
