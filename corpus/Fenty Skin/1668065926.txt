I really loved the texture of this and how it melted into my skin. Really feels like a nice moisturizer rather than a sunscreen. The only thing that keeps me from buying the full sized is the fact that there is coloring in it as well as the amount of fragrance. My skin is too sensitive to be handling these ingredients on a daily basis. great texture, please tweak the ingredients?
