I personally love this spf but it does has its pros and cons. Pros:I love the packaging and that it is refillableTexture is smooth and easily spread No white cast (although it’s expected because it’s a chemical sunscreen)It’s not super expensive (whereas I’ve seen some sunscreen for 60$ and above)It leaves a nice glow finishIt plays well with my toner, essence, serums and moisturizer not causing them to peel. However I don’t wear make up so I have no answer as to how it interacts with make upCons:Highly fragrance which is not good when you have uv rays of all kinds hitting your face which may be oxidizing the ingredients. Remind you, that sunscreen must be reapplied every 2 hours.I do not like linalool and limonene ingredient although they are at the very end, I’ll prefer to not see them at allIt would be nice is the spf is higher then 30 for days when people want to spend time out in the sun. The mix: I really hope in the future fenty skin care line comes out with a fragrance free version minus hand irritating ingredients. I would also like to see a fenty mineral sunscreen with spf 50 pa ++++. Overall I like it but I would not purchase due to the cons listed above. I’ve used my points to receive this sample product. A love-hate thing
