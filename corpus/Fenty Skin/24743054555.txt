OMG!! So, I received this product as part of a free sample program, and I am very proud of this product. I have already told everyone I know about it. First off, the scent is absolutely wonderful, and reminds me of vanilla pudding. Second off, the results! I used the product for a week and my lips look absolutely wonderful. They actually look much healthier than before, and are most definitely much softer. Lastly, the feel of the product while on the lips is extremely comfortable, and not nearly as sticky as most lip masks. I definitely think this is the best lip mask Iâ€™ve tried! I will most definitely buy this when it comes back in stockðŸ˜© Yâ€™all should get it, itâ€™s literally the best I swear I AM OBSESSED
