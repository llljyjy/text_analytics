A solid addition to my nighttime routine! I love that this mask feels like it’s truly giving my skin a detox without making it extra dry or peeling! I love the scent, the look, and it’s easy to wash off once it dries! My skin didn’t burn, turn red, or feel too tight after. The mask feels silky going on, left my skin visibly more clean and my pores a little smaller! A Solid Face Mask!
