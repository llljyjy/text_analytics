My skin has been feeling very dry lately with the weather changes so I’ve been using this toner after my cleanser, letting it sit for a while, and then proceeding with the rest of my skincare routine. It is helping with my blemishes from acne (some scarring and dark spots) so I’m really impressed with the product overall. I don’t care for the bottle it comes in as the twist and release cap is messy and will sometimes leave product behind so I have to clean it every time I use it. I think the dispensing would’ve been more effective if it had been a pump or something. Ideally I would give this a 4.5 star! Great for added moisture!
