I really like this lip oil. Leaves lips super shiny but not sticky. Also, it definitely keeps lips hydrated. I used it overnight and would wake up with my lips still having moisture. Here’s the issue: it’s so small!! I literally received it on 7/1 and it was finished on 7/11. I used it daily. That’s the only thing I would say that I don’t like about it. Otherwise, buy it! nan
