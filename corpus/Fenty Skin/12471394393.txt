I bought my before I ran out and didnâ€™t bother to check the item when I had it shipped to my house. when my sunscreen finished I pulled out the other I bought and it came damaged. when I came in to sephora to do an exchange it was passed my 60 days and I had to call the 1800 sephora. they said no because it has passed my 60 days. I am frequent client shop a lot there. it was damaged on there end not mine. bad horrible client service nan
