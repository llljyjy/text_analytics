I received this product as part of a free sample program. I will be completely honest in my review despite this. My first thought when I opened the soap is that it was huge, way bigger than a normal bar you get at the grocery store. The smell is really nice and airy, kind of like a lighter shea butter. It lathered up really well and made my skin feel super soft. It’s definitely a must-have in my bathroom now. I even bought a few bars of it to give to some family and friends (and to keep my own stash of it!). Overall, if you’re hesitating on it I would definitely take the plunge and buy it! A must-have soap!
