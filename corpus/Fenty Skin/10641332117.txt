I am in love with this so far. I’ve been using it for about a week and a half and love how moisturized it makes my skin feel. I use a prescription retinol and just finished a beach vacation. Definitely have drier skin in part because of retinol. I like to apply this product to damp skin before going in with the rest of my skincare. It helps with retaining moisture so much, I love it. It does have a bit of a scent but it’s really pleasant and I find that it goes away after applying pretty quickly. This product has a nice texture that is thin enough to be a toner but not so thin that you need a cotton round to apply it. Just squeeze a bit in your hand and you don’t have to worry about it running down your arms while you’re trying to apply it. The packaging is unique, and I wish it were a bit easier to squeeze, but is really nice and very aesthetically pleasing. All in all, I’m loving this toner and will definitely buy it once I run out. I received this product as part of a free sample program The perfect hydrating toner
