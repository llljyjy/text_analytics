I love this! I love the purple color and the smell. I usually hate fragrance in skincare but it smells good so I don’t mind. It’s not too strong or headache inducing, trust me I have chronic migraine so I would know. At first I got a sample to try it out and fell in love so I went and bought it. I love the texture and it isn’t too heavy or too light. Please make this without spf for night time because I would love this as a night moisturizer but can’t use it as one since it has spf. Love the packaging too. Very nice component and love the refillable option. I have dry, sensitive, acne prone skin and this didn’t cause me any problems. Gave me such a nice glow with my other products I use. make one without spf for night!!!
