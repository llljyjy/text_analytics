I received this Conditoning Lip Oil from Fenty Beauty and BzzAgent for free for my thoughts. The packaging is adorable with being small and having cherries on it. It actually smells like cherries too. It feels very hydrating on the lips. As soon as you apply it you can feel the moisturizing. Your lips even looks nicely glossed too. My only complaint is it doesnâ€™t last long. The lip oil fades away within a couple hours. Not Long Lasting
