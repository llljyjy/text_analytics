The best lip oil I’ve ever had. Just got it and I’m obsessed. Better than the Dior lip oil by FAR. This is a great product. It has the perfect consistency and is not sticky or heavy. It lasts all day. It has a subtle cherry flavor with a small applicator. I have dry lips and this feels so hydrating. My lips look so nice with it on and after. I wish it came in a bigger option. I definitely recommend. Great flavor and consistency
