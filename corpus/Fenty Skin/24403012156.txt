I’m so so so bummed about this because this toner is pretty great— absorbs right away, softens skin!! 3 weeks into using the Fat Water Milky Toner, my skin started peeling off. My skin became very dry and flaky, which eventually started burning/ caused redness on the T zone, cheeks, and around lips. Among the Fenty Skin products that have not worked for me, I’m most upset about this one! Really upset about this!!
