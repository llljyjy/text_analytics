This is a great lip oil!  I like my lip products more balmy & thicker so lip oils aren’t generally my jam.  I tried this after hearing an influencer talk about how much they love it (and we like the same type of lip products).  Did not disappoint!  I haven’t tried the Dior lip oil so I can’t compare but this feels light but balmy.  Lips feel nourished while oil is on the lips and long after it wears off.  Barely any color - maybe slightly pink.  Smells like strawberry candies, not cherry, and it’s a pleasant scent that wears off. I also really like the applicator. 10/10 Very Nourishing
