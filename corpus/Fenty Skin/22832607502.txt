Got this product from a free sample program! This product is different because of its interesting packaging (the toner comes from the top) and a creamy consistency. It makes my skin feel like I’m in a spa (it has a light scent) and has a very hydrating benefit to it especially because I have dry skin that would leave me glowing afterwards and  I’m glad I can use it even if I have sensitive skin. I would definitely buy this product again and would love to tell my family and friends about this! Very hydrating!
