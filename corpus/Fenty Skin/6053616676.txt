I think this mask isn’t getting the shine it deserves. I have bought so many face masks from high end brands, low end brands, all natural vegan brands, you name it but this just works. My skin felt so smooth, and good after one use. It also brought two pimples I had to their head which made extracting much simpler. My point in even writing a review is that, I usually don’t write reviews because nothing is THAT good (to me at least) but this face mask IS IT. Its to the point where I am actually finishing it, “hitting pan“ and here I am trying to repurchase it but its out-of-stock at the moment. Luckily I have about 3 uses left. Worth It
