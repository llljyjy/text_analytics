I’ll start with the pros- it’s very moisturizing and gives a nice glow- on a dry day. I also like the fragrance but that’s a very personal thing. Not everyone does. Cons: On a humid day, I look like an oil slick. It’s just too much - I have 50+ year old skin and it’s still too oily for me. I also developed acne after using for two days and at my age I haven’t seen a pimple in years. Not exactly the fountain of youth I’ve been seeking. I purchased this for the sunscreen, but I really don’t trust this to protect my skin well enough so I’ll use this in colder months when the air is dryer. It also stings my eyes so this is definitely not going to be a beach or activity sunscreen for me. Disappointing as I had to purchase something else just to be safe. When I finish this tube, I won’t repurchase. It also has some chemicals that I’m not really happy about putting on my skin. I really wanted to love this. Not Great
