I have oily skin and this face mask is a LIFESAVER. The whipped texture is so lovely on the skin - goes on white - then the little charcoal capsules break as you massage it into your skin and it turns the mask gray. It’s actually really fun, I like the exfoliation and how it encourages you to really work it into your skin and massage your face. It is not overly drying at ALL, it was exactly what I needed to balance my oily skin at the start of the summer months. I think I might marry this face mask I’ve never been so obsessed with a face mask
