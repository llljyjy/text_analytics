Rihanna should really consider dropping more fragrance free products to give people options. It smells fantastic but it’s way too much fragrance. I use Alaffia to cleanse and CeraVe to moisturize. Luckily those things are unscented/ff so I’ll make the exception for the scent this gives off. I will definitely try out the am/pm strategy with the og fat water. I love this and taking care of myself has made me look in the mirror differently. Thank you Feᴎty. Too much nose noise. Great in every other way!
