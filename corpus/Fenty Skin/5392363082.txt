I received this product as part of a free sample program. This product was really gentle and easy to use. I like how the product suds up a little, and I appreciate that the applicator gives a little physical exfoliation to go along with the chemical exfoliant. I haven’t noticed a huge change in my skin over the last two+ weeks of use, but it also hasn’t caused any damage or concern, which is good! fine, not necessary for me
