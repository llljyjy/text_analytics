I received a free sample of this with a purchase and was excited as I’ve been trying to upgrade my daily SPF/moisturizer combo (a godsend for us “non-morning people”, but surprisingly hard to find) and had been wanting to try out Fenty Skin since I enjoy all my Fenty Beauty products. I used it once and threw away the rest of the sample immediately because of how strong the scent was. I try to stay away from scented skincare generally, but it’s not an immediate deal breaker for me. This incredibly potent cherry scent assaulted my nostrils from the second it touched my face. If that’s what you’re into (no judgement) then maybe give it a shot? I can’t speak to it’s skincare benefits after only using it once. The search for the holy grail moisturizer/SPF continues… Olfactory Overstimulation
