So I received this product as part of a free sample program and all I can say is wow. I recently went on vacation and spent 10 days in the sun and salty water. When I got home I noticed my face was seriously distressed after all that time in the sun and it was thirsty. I normally would just use a mask and some lotion but since this is a hydrating toner I figured it couldn’t hurt to try. Im so impressed with how great my skin feels and how glowy I look. I’ve only used 1 toner in the past and I’m definitely converting to this now. It smells amazing I love how it twists open and I can easily get the perfect amount. I’ll absolutely buy it when I run out of this and will probably gift one for Christmas! I would 10/10 recommend! An absolute must have
