First of this product smells soo good! However, when I first tried it... my skin felt super dry and felt like its natural oils were stripped off. I don’t know how to explain it. Anyways... used several times again. One night (was super drunk) to take off my makeup. So I didn’t even use a wipe and I just used this soap. OMG! I felt like the wipe was not necessary since it literally took all my makeup off. I just remember the sink full of my foundation shade lol. I would keep on using it and just moisturize afterwards. I just don’t see myself repurchasing this product again. Dry skin afterwards
