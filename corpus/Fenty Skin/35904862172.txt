I actually like this product, the smell is actually really not that bad, I am not sure why some of the users had such a strong reaction to it. The texture is so soft and there is no cast after application which is amazing and it is for sure moisturizing as well but personally I also use a moisturizer along with the spf because I do not want to overuse the spf since its on the pricey side. I have used supergoop unseen sunscreen as well, I like both of them but I think I may stick to Fenty one in future. Actually not bad at all!!
