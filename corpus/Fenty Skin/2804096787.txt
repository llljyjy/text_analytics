This product truly is thick and super hydrating, which as someone who suffers from dry lips and then picks at them, this product has been a game changer. The thickness of the formula makes the product great to wear as an overnight lip mask or even throughout the day because of the gloss it gives and it stays on for so long. The vitamins and sterols in the formula really do help moisturize and restore dry lips so I totally recommend. It also comes in a cute and unique roll up packing that makes the product feel even more luxe. One thing that lost a star for me is the scent of the product, I believe it essentially has no scent but I am not a huge fan of the scent/taste of the product. Great Lip Product!
