This soap bar lathers soooo well it’s amazing! Be aware of the strong nice scent tho! Wouldn’t recommend for sensitive skin. With just a little, it turns very very foamy so I love! It did remove my makeup and left my skin feeling fresh! Also this is not only a face soap!!! Use it for your body as well✨ 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
