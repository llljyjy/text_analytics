I had a mini of this as part of a set. I didn’t end up using it up because I found that I liked other cleansers better. This wasn’t a bad cleanser and I didn’t have any bad reactions to it. I personally think the texture was too thick, and like others have said, it made it hard to squeeze out of the tube. Otherwise, I probably would’ve used it up (I didn’t love the product enough to hassle with it). However, I will say the concept of the tube is nice....it just needs a different formula that isn’t so thick. Okay
