I have been using this for a few weeks now, and I am absolutely loving it! It feels so nice to apply and the packaging makes it so easy to dispense the proper amount of product! It has made my skin smoother and lessened my post-acne dark spots. It’s moisturizing but doesn’t leave my face feeling heavy or oily. It also has a very nice, yet light scent. Great for improving texture and dark spots!
