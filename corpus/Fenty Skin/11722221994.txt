I love this mask!! It has salicylic acid in it, so it does detox the skin- however, it does not list the percentage of salicylic acid in it, which is a downfall. As someone with sensitive skin, I think it is important to have this information. I personally only use it once a week, maybe twice, because my skin is pretty sensitive. This product is really gentle while still detoxing! nan
