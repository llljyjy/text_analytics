I really gave this product a chance and wore it on and of for a month. The texture is really nice, I love the soft purple hue, the packaging is cool and it smells nice. I have normal skin, not sensitive or oily or combination. I had to stop using this product because it made me look and feel super greasy and mucky PLUS it would almost immediately break my skin out. I tried it with and without other products like toner and serums. I stopped using it and my skin’s bumps would go back to normal. Then i would try it again. Same result every time.I saw someone else’s review that the product reacted differently in dry v. humid weather. I would like to add that I live on the Texas Gulf Coast so it’s very hot and humid here most of the time. Not sure if that really does make a difference or not but could be a factor.Unfortunately it didn’t work out for me but with so many great reviews I would say get a mini and try it out for yourself. Not for me, maybe for you?
