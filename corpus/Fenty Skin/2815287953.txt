This is hands down the best toner. I have been using this for a week now. It smells great and feels amazing. It’s moisturizing and hydrating. A little goes a long way. It doesn’t leave the skin feeling sticky. I don’t wear makeup everyday so this with vitamin C and SPF and my skin looks great! Yassssss Fat Water!!!
