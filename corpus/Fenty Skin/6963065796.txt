I received this product in exchange for an honest review. The bar feels to thick and rich while lathering. The smell is delicious but surprisingly isn’t as strong while lathering. It is a pretty decent size which I was surprised. I will say that it gives that tight clean feeling so i’m not sure how nourishing it actually is. I love using it after shaving to provide an extra layer of moisture. Creamy smooth
