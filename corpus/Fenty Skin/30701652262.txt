I received this product from a free sample program and I’m honestly in love with it! I have a fairly simple skin routine and toner isn’t really part of it, but this toner just goes on so nicely that I decided to include it. I love how hydrated and moisturized my skin feels after I use it without feeling sticky or greasy. I’m also totally in love with the fragrance. It has a nice and fresh floral scent, but it’s also not too strong. nan
