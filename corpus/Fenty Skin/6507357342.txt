don’t let the size fool you, you only need a little bit. be careful when pouring it because a whole lot can come out. the smell is a choice but it doesn’t bother me however if you’re sensitive beware. i swear after using this, my pores are so clean and invisible. this clear out all the gunk in a pretty gentle way, at least to me who have really resilience skin. it is expensive for the size however don’t let that discourage you. you’ll see a difference with this product!! nan
