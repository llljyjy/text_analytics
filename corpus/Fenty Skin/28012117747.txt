My skin absolutely loves this stuff! It just drinks it right up! Super fast absorbing, easy to apply, just glides right over on top of the skin, feels so refreshing, and smells so nice! I’m not a fan of scents in my skincare but every morning I look forward to smelling this because it smells so nice and it’s a very very faint scent, not overbearing and doesn’t last on the skin. My skin has looked so smooth and even after using this. wish I could give it MORE stars
