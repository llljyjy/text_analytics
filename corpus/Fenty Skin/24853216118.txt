My first initial thought was that it was going to be sticky; another brand everybody hyped up. But it proved to be the exact opposite being moisturizing and leaving my lips glossy. The unique doe foot applicator makes it easy to apply the product evenly on the lips compared to other brands with a smaller wand. And small enough to carry with me everywhere.I panic a little when I donâ€™t have it and soon as this container is finished, I intend to buy one or three more and get one for my mom and me. Obessed!
