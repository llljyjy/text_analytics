My chin and nose area was starting to feel dry and the spf moisturizer just wasnâ€™t cutting it so I purchased this. Felt great putting it on and was helping with my dryness but I woke up with patchy red marks on my cheeks and they itched, tried again for the 2nd night thinking maybe it was because of something that got on my face during the night. Again woke up with itchy patchy red marks on my cheeks. Not sure if it is just too heavy for my skin as I use the cleanser/toner/spf moisturizer with no issues. Wish my skin liked it like I did
