ive been using this product for the past three weeks and it was honestly not my favorite product. I really thought I would love this this product but it felt cheap. I loved the packaging, i thought that it was a unique way for lip balm to be packaged. When I first put it on, it wasnt bad, it felt like your average lip balm. I continued to use and it really didnt help my chapped lips. It was just on there. The scent wasnt pleasant and the taste was not good. I honestly prefer my lip balm I purchased at my grocery store. nan
