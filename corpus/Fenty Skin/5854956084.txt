Iâ€™ve used the Fenty Skin Watch Ya Tone 5% Niacinamide Dark Spot Serum with Vitamin C over the past few weeks, and I am loving the results! It has helped keep my dry skin feeling hydrated and visibly faded away my dark spots. My skin is glowy and brighter than ever before! The application is easy and absorbs right into my skin without leaving a residue. The packaging is also sleek and modern, which I love. Overall, this product seems very promising, and I would recommend it to my friends and family. A must-have in my skincare routine!
