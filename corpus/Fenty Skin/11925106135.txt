I really love this lip oil! Cherry is my favorite and go to fruity scent so I really liked the scent of this product, although the scent may be too strong for some people with sensitives. I like how it comes on clear and doesn’t have a tint because I like clear lip oils more than something that has a bit of color because it feels more natural on my lips. I absolutely adored the applicator as well because it feels so soft and goes on my lips smoothly. The packaging is very adorable as well with a little cherry picture on the outside. But as for the effectiveness of this product I found it to be super hydrating and moisturizing! I had no problem with this and I love using it! It’s my new go to summer lip oil! Amazing!
