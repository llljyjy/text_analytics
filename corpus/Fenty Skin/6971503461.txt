I’ve been using this product twice a week for the last 3 months, but wanted to wait a while before writing a review. This is a new staple for me! My skin has never looked so good! I know the bottle is small, but you don’t need a lot. The influencers use way too much product! After 3 months I’ve only used 1/3 of the bottle. My skin is so smooth looking and feels soft and supple too. My pores are non existent and so clean. Best of all, this is the only product that has faded the hyper pigmentation on my cheeks. I feel like I look much younger. I usually rock a concealer only face now. I gave it 4 stars because the smell is horrible, very chemical smelling, but I put up with it for the results. Also, I feel this could be a bit cheaper given it’s size. I don’t use the rest of the fenty skin care line because my skin is on the sensitive side. I will definitely repurchase a refill when I run out. My Skin Has Never Looked Better!
