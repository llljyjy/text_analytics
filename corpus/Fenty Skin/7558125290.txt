It’s a “No” for me. I like the idea. And I can see where their mind was but the “cookies” part of this mask do not dissolve easily. It takes quite a bit of pressure to burst them. And when smoothing it over your face the beads roll in between your fingers because again- they don’t dissolve easily. The two stars are for the mask being gentle. I double cleansed then used this mask and it didn’t burn at all when I applied it. Ultimately returning it. No.
