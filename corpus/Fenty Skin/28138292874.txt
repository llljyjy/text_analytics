After figuring out how to actually open it, Fenty Skin’s Fat Water milky toner surprised me: I love eating tamarind, but this is my first time I’ve tried it in a skincare product. It’s definitely a standout ingredient, along with the squalane and acerola extract. This toner leaves the skin nicely hydrated with a silky/satin finish to it, so I imagine it would be useful as a pre-base makeup primer. I personally used it to do the 7 skin/toner layering method, and it worked miraculously. I do, however, find the price to be a little bit high for such an amount of product, and so I probably won’t be purchasing unless it goes on sale or unless I want to splurge on skincare. I received this from a free sample program. A little treat for dehydrated skin
