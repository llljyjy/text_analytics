I’m skeptical about masks usually and can’t find the right one for me. I love this— the feel is like jello. Rub it in well upon application for the charcoal to activate. You can tell when it changes colors. Easy off, didn’t make a mess. My skin looked dewy with a nice glow, zits were less angry. I feel like it worked really well. I usually have oily skin, for reference. Leaves a nice glow!
