I received this product from a free sample program. I was so excited and not disappointed at all! I absolutely love it! It has a twist cap. You can squeeze out as much as you need which is so convenient and easy! I have some hormonal acne and dry skin. My skin care routine is good but Ive been wanting to add something else. This is exactly what I needed. It’s very lightweight and hydrating. It has a scent but isn’t overpowering in my opinion. I’ve been using it everyday. Morning and night. It feels smooth and fresh on the skin.  My face is more glowy and soft. I’ll definitely be buying another after I’m done! nan
