this was the first lip oil that I’ve ever used, and I absolutely adored it. the doe foot applicator makes the product easy to use and manipulate. the texture is nice and thick, feels hydrating, and doesn’t move on the lips. would easily recommend. the fragrance smells delicious. can’t wait to restock when it’s back in stock!
