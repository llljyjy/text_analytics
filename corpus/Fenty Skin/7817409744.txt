I don’t know why, but I’m obsessed with this lip oil. When I first got it I was hesitant. It was way thicker than  I thought it would be and a little tacky, but it smooths onto my lips so nicely. The sheen is a whole vibe that has me in my feelings, it smells so good, and it’s a little tacky, but not overly sticky.. which I was nervous about given the thickness. It is a bit expensive, but I want one for all of my bags. I love putting it on before bed too. Def will be buying again. nan
