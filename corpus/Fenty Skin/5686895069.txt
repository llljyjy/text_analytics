Believe the reviews! I don’t own any other lip oils, but I am in love with this one. The cherry scent smells good and isn’t overwhelming. I absolutely love the wide doe foot applicator that picks up a good amount of product so you don’t have to double dip. This is perfect for the summer. Not sticky, perfect amount of gloss. You’ll love it! 10/10 recommend!
