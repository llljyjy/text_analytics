I love the design of this sunscreen. I bought this, hoping that I would buy the refil next time, and on... but,... when used, it’s a little bit sticky, and I didn’t love it so much.I am sad to note that the intended refillable container will be put away once finished.. I do recommend it, just not for me. Boo. Beautiful sunscreen, but..
