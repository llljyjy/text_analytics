I got this initially as a sample and loved the way it felt and smelled so I purchased the mini (because sometimes the sample is deceiving, amirite?) and it still felt/smelled great. Alone, that is. It does not work well with others. I’ve tried everything - letting each step of my routine sink in 5-10 minutes before applying this, applying it after cream, waiting until I left the house hours after my routine, and it ALWAYS pills. Super frustrating. Even pills with other Fenty products! The only time it didn’t pill was when I layered on a silicone-based primer, heavily I might add. It’s a no for me. 2 starts just for smell and packing, but I wouldn’t recommend, especially at the price point. You can find better for cheaper. hear me out…
