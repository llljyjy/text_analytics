I received this product as part of a free sample program for my honest review.The scent of this cleansing bar is wonderful, and it lathers well. The cocoa butters and vitamin e help keep my skin feeling soft, unlike other soap bars which can strip the skin and have that weird stripped feeling.I personally like this as an option for traveling as itâ€™s a cleansing bar that can be used for you face and body! It also seems great for a carry-on.The price is great for what your getting (great scent, nourishes skin, and is multi-use for face and body), so I highly recommend giving this a try! Great for travel!
