Not the best face wash I’ve ever used. Smells amazing but leaves my face feeling a little dry and tight afterwards, especially if I wash my face in the shower first and don’t get to the next step in my routine immediately after use. The packaging is awful! It’s very annoying getting any product out especially once the tube is about half full. Gives more of a flourence by mills vibe. Would recommend to teens. nan
