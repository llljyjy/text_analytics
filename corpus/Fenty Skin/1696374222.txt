GOT THIS TODAY WITH SAME DAY DELIVERY. WAS SO EXCITED TO TRY! IT’S SUCH A WEIRD CONSISTENCY-- ALMOST LIKE LIQUID CLAY? IDK. I WAS REALLY EXPECTING SOMETHING MELTY AND HYDRATING THAT WOULD SINK INTO THE SKIN. SOME PPL THAT DESCRIBED THEIR SKIN AS DRY SAID THIS WAS GREAT. I ALSO HAVE DRY SKIN, BUT AM NOT A PERSON WHO BREAKS OUT. I DO NOT HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN AT ALL, BUT I HAVE A STRONG SENSE OF SMELL AND THIS IS JUST OFF... SOMEONE ELSE SAID IT SMELLS LIKE MAKE UP AND I GUESS THAT IS AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION EVEN THOUGH IT SOUNDS AMBIGUOUS. I’M RETURNING THIS ASAP. SO DISAPPOINTED MAN
