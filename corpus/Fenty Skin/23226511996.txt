I actually love this product! Especially because I have dry and  sensitive skin. It feels so hydrating, doesn’t irritate me and makes my skin soft, I’m giving it a 4 cause I don’t like any product with fragrance in it, but I’m keeping this one hahaha, it smells like a boba milk tea. I don’t see the point of fragrance in skincare tho. Lovely product regardless ❤️ FOR DRY AND SENSITIVE SKIN
