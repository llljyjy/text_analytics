I have been using this for almost a month and it has CHANGED my skin. It is light, smells wonderful, and lasts. Definitely a great everyday morning moisturizer. I am speaking as a guy who has done minimal skincare my whole life and have just started getting into this. Would highly recommend to anyone. month in review from beginner guy
