I’ve been using this Fenty bar soap for a week now and I think I’m in love with it. I’ve been using this in combination with my skin pills and my face has never looked better. This soap has left my face soft and clear. The smell of the coca butter is like omg. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family. I love this soap
