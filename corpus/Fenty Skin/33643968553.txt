I was very excited to receive this product from bzzagent for my honest review. This lip oil has a great look to the packaging and bottle. It is clean and easy to apply with the soft doe footed wand. It was a bit stickier than other lip oils I have used, attracting hair and other stuff. The cherry flavor is very pleasant and has a great sweet smell. Overall this is a very moisturizing and leaves your lips looking and feeling moisturized. This product is also very affordable and I would most definitely purchase this product again! Fenty Cherry Lip Oil!
