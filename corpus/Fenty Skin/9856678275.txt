Love this mask! Even though it’s a physical exfoliant, it feels quite gentle as the little charcoal capsules melt into the rest of the mask. My skin is usually quite sensitive, but it doesn’t feel super tight or dry after rinsing this off. It’s also a fun experience putting this mask on while massaging the charcoal capsules in! nan
