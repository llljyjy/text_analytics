First off,  the packaging is great,  it’s a super cute purple box,  open it up to an even cuter people container.  The product itself is creamy with beads.  The cream is a little thicket but easy to get.  I used it on dry skin before bed.  Such a relaxing experience.  While applying the mask you kind of exfoliate and the beads break so the mask ends up being grey. Let it sit for 15 minutes and wash off.  My pores were noticeably smaller.  My skin felt nice and tight,  but not overly tight like I couldn’t move it.  It’s shiny.  I’m obsessed!!! Obsessed!
