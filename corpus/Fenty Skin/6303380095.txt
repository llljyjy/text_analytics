I’ve been trying out this product for about a week now and so far I like it! It’s not a miracle product, but I did love the glow my skin had immediately after using this product, and I feel like my skin naturally glows after a week of consistent use. Niacinamide and vitamin C are great ingredients, and I love the ease of use with them as a combo. I took off a star only because I thought the packaging was strange and it’s easy to accidentally dispense too much product at once, but it’s not a deal breaker since I got used to the packaging quickly. nan
