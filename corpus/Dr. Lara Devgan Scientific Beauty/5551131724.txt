This is now a Holy Grail product for me! I have incredibly acne prone and sensitive skin with a lot of sun damage from years of living on a boat. This product completely resurrected my skin! I’ve tried numerous Vitamin C and E products over the years to help heal acne/hyperpigmentation left behind, but nothing has ever given me results like this…let alone in less than 2 weeks!! So you can also observe this magic for yourself, I’ve added bare skin before & after pics. First (before) picture and second (after) picture were taken just 10 days apart with no changes to my routine besides the addition of this serum. Pics were taken in the same room, same place, same time of day and the glow from my skin is just amazing!I apply the serum only in the mornings. Yes, it takes a while to dry down, but once it does there’s no tacky feeling and I haven’t experienced any pilling when layered with my other skincare products. Despite how crazy sensitive and reactive my skin is, this serum didn’t break me out, cause a burning sensation, or leave me feeling slimy all day. And, yes, the bottle is small for the high price point, but IMO it’s SO WORTH IT to feel this confident and happy with the way my skin looks! I seriously can’t recommend this product enough! NOTHING COMPARES TO THESE RESULTS!!
