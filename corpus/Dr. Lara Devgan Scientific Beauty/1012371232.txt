This is incredibly overpriced for what you get, please don’t fall for this sham. I love DRMTLGY’s needleless serum and it has so many more actives on top of everything that’s in this product, including 3 different peptides, for less than half the price. I wish Sephora sold DRMTLGY it’s an amazing line of very effective products, unlike these ridiculously overpriced shams. overpriced, don’t fall for it
