This moisturizer is so buttery and luxurious. It’s great for most skin types and it’s been such a dream for the colder months. It has the lightest scent and it works so well with the other products in my morning and nighttime skincare routines. I’m definitely excited to keep using this product. The packaging is also stunning and it looks beautiful on display. nan
