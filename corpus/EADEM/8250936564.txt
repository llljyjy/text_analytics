This product unscented and lightweight, but still gets the job done. I liked that this formula is more of a gel like texture than most other products like it. Unlike cleansing oils, I didn’t feel like I was going to get this product all over myself and everything else. As far as actually removing makeup, it does that. I still had a bit more makeup in my second step of double cleansing than I’d like to, but maybe that was due to the thicker foundation I wore that day. Overall, a good product, but not great for the price. nan
