I wanted to love this but it makes my oily skin even oilier. It’s smooth and buttery. Thought it’d be okay for the winter to prevent my skin from drying out but it’s not worth the shine I get just a few hours after applying. After using this for a month, I don’t notice any real improvement. I bought the serum and use them both consistently. So this product (and the serum from this brand were disappointing. Too much for my oily skin.
