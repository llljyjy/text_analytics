I was very excited to try my first Eadem product. This cleansing balm is first of all so gorgeous in a tube. I prefer this format because it makes it less messy and more hygienic to get out product. It is a lovely mixture of plant butter and oils, it takes off my make up and SPF so well and with only a few circular motions of cleansing, and it leaves my skin very soft and fresh after. Highly recommend. Lovely tubed cleansing balm
