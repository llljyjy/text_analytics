I am not typically someone who repurchases because I like to try new products. First off, this feels like such a luxurious step in my skincare routine. The frosted bottle is beautifully understated and weighty and the serum is milky. After finishing my first bottle I tried other serums for a year and realized how much of a difference this product made for evening my skin tone. Happy to support this brand founded by WOC!
