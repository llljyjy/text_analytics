I am a full skincare junkie and changed serums often but after trying Milk Marvel I will never go back. I am on my 5th bottle and this product has not only faded stubborn dark marks but has also stopped my skin from getting new ones. I have very dark, acne prone skin and I noticed when I do get a pimple or two, this serum helps calm my skin and pimples heal without the severe pigmentation that comes with it. The texture of the serum is thick and moisturizing. It leaves the skin dewy without any oil or grease and works well under makeup on it’s own if you’re an oily gal like me. I haven’t felt the need to buy any other serum since - this is my new one and only. Skincare Staple for LIFE
