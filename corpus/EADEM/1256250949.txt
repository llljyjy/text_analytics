I am on my third bottle of the Milk Marvel Spot Serum. I love it! First it does what it says. I suffered with eczema for a while after wearing masks with the friction of the mask against my skin. This caused rash like blemishes on my face. I tried other spot serums but they were too harsh on my sensitive skin. I’m so glad I found the Milk Marvel because it has calmed the eczema, my blemishes have disappeared and my skin is clear and smooth  again. Second, I use the serum along with the Cloud Cushion Brightening Moisturizer. Since I don’t like to wear lots of makeup, the pair work together for a clear, fresh  and dewy complexion. I noticed a difference with the very first bottle. Good stuff! Love, Love, Love it!
