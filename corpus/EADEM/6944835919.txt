I tried out the hydrating make up removing balm on a day that I wore full coverage make up and it performed better than I expected.  It removed my makeup completely. I do like that it’s in a tube instead of a jar so application is a bit easier. The texture is interesting, it doesn’t feel like I’m applying grease to my face. It actually felt pretty moisturizing. nan
