This product was gifted by EADEM in exchange for my honest review. I have very dry skin and was so excited for this launch from EADEM! I struggle with uneven skin tone on my face and wanted to if this could help even it out. Itâ€™s extremely lightweight on the skin but packs a really nice amount of hydration. I use it as my only moisturizer in the morning and just add an oil at night for some extra nourishment in the winter. Every time I use this product I see it visibly calm my skin and help it appear more even. An absolutely killer launch from EADEM! A MUST for uneven skin tones!
