I really enjoyed the Eadem cleansing balm.My favorite thing about this is how good it is at removing makeup and it really gets everything off! It almost made me forget to go in with another cleanser.  It didn’t leave a weird film on my skin after using it so it felt super refreshing. I have oily skin and I really enjoyed how it left my skin hydrated and didn’t burn my eyes. If you’re looking for a great double cleanser this is the product for you! Great Makeup Remover!
