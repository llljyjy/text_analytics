This is a really lovely cleanser.  It has a thick balmy texture with small beads in it and a relaxing spa-like fragrance. It spreads easily and melts makeup off.  Since it has such a thick luscious texture, it also takes a little extra to completely emulsify and rinse off.  You can cleanse a second time with a thinner cleanser, but this usually does a thorough job of removing everything that I don’t feel the need to cleanse again.   After cleansing, my skin feels soft, calm, and supple, like I used a hydrating mask that also removed makeup.  It has a generously sized bottle which I appreciate too since you don’t need much each use.I’d avoid if you dislike thick textures, but I’d happily recommend to everyone else! Soft skin and melted makeup!
