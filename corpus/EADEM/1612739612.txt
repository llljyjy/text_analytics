For the longest time I thought I had oily skin and so I rarely used a moisturizer, thinking it would make my skin more oily. My bridal makeup artist recently pointed out that I had a lot of dry patches on my skin which surprised me because I thought I was oily all over! She insisted I begin using a good moisturizer with ceramides and peptides to bring back balance to my skin. I had heard really good things about Eadem’s moisturizer and decided to try it - and I’m SO glad I did! I absolutely love applying it every day. It gives my skin a beautiful glow that I never experienced before. My dry patches are all gone and my post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation from numerous bouts of acne are fading. Bonus points for it not making me break out! A bottle lasts me about 3 months which I think is decent. Eadem - thanks for formulating this buttery, dreamy moisturizer made for skin tones like mine, and please do not stop making it! Hands down best moisturizer ever!
