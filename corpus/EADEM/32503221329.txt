This is such a nice clean ingredient filled cleansing balm. It is definitely on the thicker side so keep that in mind depending on what you like to use but I love that it comes in a squeeze tube instead of a pot because itâ€™s so much more sanitary. It does an amazing job of removing my makeup in one shot and smells like a spa! nan
