As someone who is super picky about moisturizers, Cloud Cushion has been a game-changer. I use it religiously everyday. I love its thick, yet whipped texture. My skin always looks glowy and plump after use. The packaging is gorgeous. Plus, the brand has a mission I can stand behind. The only moisturizer I've ever loved!
