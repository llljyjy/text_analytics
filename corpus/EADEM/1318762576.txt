I’ve been using this dark spot serum for a little over a month, and it’s great. I have issues with acne scarring (cystic acne) and melasma (hormones), and this serum has helped fade the spots and even my skin tone. I can even skip wearing foundation. This worked so well I’ve added the moisturizer to my routine. Love it
