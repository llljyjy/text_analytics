This moisturizer is amazing! Firstly, the packaging is absolutely gorgeous!! It looks and feels very luxurious. The details definitely matter, glass bottle with a spatula makes it very easy to use. The product is equally amazing! It doesn’t feel greasy or heavy but it’s still very hydrating. I use it in combination with the brightening serum and my skin thanks me everyday!! I’m so impressed with this brand and it becoming a staple as well as a favorite! I definitely recommend this brand and product for everyone but it’s definitely targeted for women of color. My skin tone is a lot better and more even than before. The texture is also a lot smoother and feels softer. Yes, I’m a fan!!! nan
