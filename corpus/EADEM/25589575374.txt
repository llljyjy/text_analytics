Amazing moisturizer for any skin type. If you have acne prone oily skin like me- you know how hard it is to find moisturizer that doesn’t clog your pores. This moisturizer has an amazing texture (literally feels like a cloud) and doesn’t clog pores. I use it before going to bed every day (a little too moisturizing for daytime in Florida’s humid climate) and I love how quickly it absorbs into my skin and leaves it glowing. If you have normal or dry skin - you have to try it!Also, the packaging and branding is just WOW!! Glass bottle and  metal spatula give it a very luxe feel! This product was gifted to me by EADEM Love it!
