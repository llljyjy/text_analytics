I received this product complimentary from EADEM in exchange for my honest review. I have been using this product for about two weeks, my skin is dry and sensitive.This is a fragrance-free face cream with a light, whipped texture that still manages to be richly moisturizing. I have been using it as a night cream, but I believe it would also work well as a day cream.  It does leave some barrier on the skin when it dries down, but it is a smooth layer that would work well under makeup. While using this cream, my skin felt hydrated and smooth. I was able to wear it all night without a sleeping mask or other external layer and I still woke up with comfortable skin rather than feeling parched.The packaging of this cream is also beautiful. The frosted glass jar and metal spatula are both beautiful pieces on my vanity table!Iâ€™ve really enjoyed testing this cream and will happily continue to use it! Smooth and Comfortable
