Really liked this serum. Good consistency and lightweight but also moisturizing. Very gentle on skin but did see overall brightening results. Sometimes I also add a vitamin c powder to this and it mixes well so itâ€™s compatible with other products too. Have also bought this plus the moisturizer for my mom Really liked this and also bought for mom!
