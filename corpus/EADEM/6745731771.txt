I’ve tried so many cleansing balms and this one is definitely one of the best ones I’ve used. I love that the cleansing balm comes in a tube vs. a jar which makes the product more hygenic. I also like that the product has a thick consistency that easily thins out once you add water to emulsify. I’ve tried another product from Eadem and their formulas don’t disappoint. If you’re looking for a good cleansing balm that won’t make your eyes super cloudy, give this one a try. This Product Works Wonders for Sensitive Skin
