I had high hopes for this moisturizer but yet another failure for me. I’ll start of with my con: The dimethicone just made the texture feel too much like silicone. I hate dimethicone in my products. I just couldn’t get past the waxy feel. If you don’t mind the texture of dimethicone in moisturizer then you may enjoy this. I thought the dimethicone wouldn’t bother me as it was in the middle of the ingredient list but I still felt it was very prominent. Now the pro: the cream did feel really light, like a cloud.  It didn’t feel heavy at all. It smelled clean and there was no fragrance. It didn’t irritate my skin and It played nicely with other products like serums. I felt moisturized for the most part and my skin felt nourished. I didn’t experience any breakouts although I did get a couple of blackheads while trying this. I don’t want to blame the blackheads solely on the moisturizer as I only tried it for about 4 days…but I had them. The ingredient list is wonderful so someone may love this. I encourage anyone to try because products react differently one everyone. sigh…
