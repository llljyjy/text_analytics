The Dew Dream Cleansing balm has been one of my new favorite cleansing balms. I prefer balms over oils (liquids). Removing mascara takes a little work but it works well with removing makeup overall. use it on dry skin (with makeup on of course). Iâ€™ve also been using this as a step 1 in my double cleansing routine. I like the thick gel consistency of this balm. A little also goes a long way, as it is a thick texture. I also love the packaging as well, sleek and lux vibes! Definitely recommend using this cleansing balm to your routine! the dew dream cleansing balm is a dream!
