I am very impressed. I have never tried a gel texture makeup remover like this one. And I honestly didnâ€™t expect it to work as good as other ones that are oils or balms but it works. It removes non waterproof mascara.  The color that stayed on my lips is because of the intense lipstick tint but the product removed the lipstick as I expected it. would definitely repurchase it. Impressive
