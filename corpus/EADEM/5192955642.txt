Wow! This is one of the best cleansing balms I’ve used and I’ve tried a lot. I like that it is a gel like texture. It isn’t hard to rub into the skin and it breaks down the makeup well. I would recommend to rinse with warmer water to reduce the feel of residue on the skin. My skin doesn’t feel dried out after using this product. Nice!
