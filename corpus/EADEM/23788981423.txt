Love this airy cushion brightening moisturizer! It is fragrance free and it makes my face feels soft and hydrating! It is great for hyperpigmentation and dark spots and is great for any skin tone ! It has niacinamides, tetrapeptides, snow mushrooms etc which are great ingredients to look for ! Definitely recommend .I was this gifted by Eadem to try and review. Great for hyperpigmentation
