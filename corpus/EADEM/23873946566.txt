This product is amazing! It was gifted by EADEM. My skin is glowing. It visibly combat dark spots, evens skin tone, and boosts radiance. This product is great for anyone who has discoloration or dark spots on their face or neck. Even my husband comments on how great my skin looks. I have normal to dry skin and this product is gentle and does not irritate at all. This serum targets  signs of aging, visibly plump, and reduce the appearance of wrinkles. It is a clean product at Sephora meaning it doesnâ€™t contain any hard chemicals such as sulfates, parabens, formaldehyde, phthalates, and mineral oil. Amazing!!!
