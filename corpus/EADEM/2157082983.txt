This serum works!! I had hyper pigmentation and tried all of the more expensive serums with no significant results. I saw the reviews and REAL photos for the results for this product and gave it a shot and am so glad I did! I use it right after Paulaâ€™s Choice 2% AHA and my skin is so smooth and clear now! The dark spots are faded considerably in less than a month. Highly recommend! Super Serum for Hyperpigmentation!
