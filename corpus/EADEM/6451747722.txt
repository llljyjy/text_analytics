This was gifted by Eadem. I have to admit I was so excited to try this brand new product, as I loved the serum they launched last year. Eadem seem to put lot of thought behind the formula before they release products. This moistuizer is unlike anything I have tried before. Itâ€™s got a pillowy cushion texture that is such an experience to apply each time. It also has amazing ingredients and really hydrates my skin well. so unique!!
