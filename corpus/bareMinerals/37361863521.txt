I have been using this serum since it came out - maybe 6-7 years ago. I wake up in the morning seeing brighter more even skin. It improves any breakouts for me. It goes on light and non greasy, you only need 1.5 pumps for your whole face and neck. The only thing I don’t love is, the company has reduced the amount of product you get in each bottle over the years… making the packaging more bulky. They’ve also raised the price. This is a good way to make your loyal customers start shopping for an alternative… Awesome - been using 6-7 years
