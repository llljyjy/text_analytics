I had a trial bottle of this serum & I absolutely loved how it made my skin feel fresh & it smelled so amazing I decided to get the full size. Now… I feel like the full size bottle is quite pricey but I was happy to purchase because I loved it so much but now that I’ve paid for it & used the product it definitely does not last very long. I’m not sure if it’s the packaging but I was like 5 uses in & I was already down 1 3rd of the bottle. I don’t think I’ll be purchasing again. I would recommend if you have the money like that nan
