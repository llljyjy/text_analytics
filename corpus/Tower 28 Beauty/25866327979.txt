I have rosacea, which includes lots of redness and acne. I also have jornal acne. I saw a drastic change in my skin after the first use. I’ve never experienced a product with such a simple ingredient be this effective. I got the mini and definitely getting the 4oz. I’m so happy this product exists!! I have very sensitive skin and I can’t wait to wash my face just to spray this one. rosacea and hormonal acne
