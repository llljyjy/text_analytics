Okay first off let’s get this out of the way: it does smell a bit like chlorine at first. HOWEVER, it has saved my skin and it’s totally worth it!! I have rosacea, ultra sensitive skin and acne but a few sprays of this instantly calms down my red, angry skin!! I’ve never tried anything like this before that has worked so well and I’ve already repurchased two more bottles because I’m afraid it will sell out! Do yourself a favor and buy this immediately!! Holy Grail!!
