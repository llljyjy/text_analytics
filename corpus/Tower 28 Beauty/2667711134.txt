This is my first product that I’ve ever tried for this brand, and while I would say it is a good first step for me in trying them, I don’t know if I would reach for them in the future to protect my sensitive skin. I’m not saying that to make up brand can’t do skin care well, but one of the first ingredients in this product is salt. And salt can be a rough ingredient depending on the form. I didn’t find this product to be a lifesaver for me, but I also didn’t have a reaction from it. The smell was also a little “pool water” heavy, but not enough to be a deal breaker. I look forward to other products from them though! Gifted by Tower 28 Beauty nan
