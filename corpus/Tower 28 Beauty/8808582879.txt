I felt really silly buying what’s described as a beefed up saline solution + chlorine and I was right on the mark. No noticeable difference in skin condition and the smell is strange. I’ll use up the bottle to get any money’s worth, but won’t be repurchasing. In case the person reading this never took chemistry, hypochlorous acid is chlorine dissolved in water, and sodium chloride is table salt. $20+ for an ounce is a joke! Strange smell, overpriced saline
