First, the bottle is comically small but that’s a personal mistake of mine for not paying better attention. I don’t quite understand the price point (even the full size) for what it is. It’s primarily just water and I haven’t noticed any change in my skin. I will continue to use it because it doesn’t make anything worse, it just doesn’t seem like a miracle product (for me personally!)For reference, I have terrible allergies that affects my skin through rashes, redness, sensitivities, etc. I don’t have cystic acne but I will get the occasional whitehead and I have blackheads/large pores with dryness. Hasn’t done anything
