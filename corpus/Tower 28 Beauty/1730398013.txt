Been absolutely OBSESSED with this serum since being gifted by Tower 28 Beauty!! Tower 28 DOES NOT miss!! My skin has been a wreck since going to music festivals and dealing with heat, dust, and dehydration. I’ve been really simplifying my routine to help bring it back to a happy place and this serum has been the MVP.  Yes, it does smell like the pool. But it’s not bad at all! I like to apply on damp skin and then seal with a nice moisturizer :) it’s perfect! nan
