I received this complimentary from Tower 28 Beauty. In the picture I included, the left side is how my skin was the day before I started using the SOS serum, and the right side is my skin 7 days after. I have combo/oily acne prone skin, so I have acne scars and get red spots that show up every now and again. I will say that my skin behaved really, really nicely when I used this serum. I actually forgot to use it one day and ended up with a pimple lol! I only used for a week so you wonâ€™t see a huge difference, but some pimples/spots noticeably went away or got smaller. Some redness on the cheeks also  seemed to lighten. It feels nice on the skin and has no scent. I do notice a bit of a tightening feeling after a minute of having it on as it settles on my skin, but it goes away after a couple of minutes. Overall, I really like this serum and will continue to use it! Loving it so far!
