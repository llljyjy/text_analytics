I am allergic to my nasal cannula. For the last 2-3 years I have have been able to control the flare ups rather well but am always looking for facial products that help my symptoms redness, itchiness, peeling, bumps. Saw this on People.com decided to give it a go. Glad I did because the new cannula used the week I got Rescue Spray,caused an allergic reaction  that one has not in about 2 years. I sprayed and crossed my fingers, skin quickly became less red, less itchy, it felt more hydrated. Even sprayed it on a cotton pad and pressed it to my eyelids, felt so good!  Been using it everyday,the itchiness has not returned, the bumps, redness and peeling patches receded faster than I remember too. I will be buying again,sharing this gem with friends and others that have the same reaction to their cannula resins! Rescue Spray Indeed
