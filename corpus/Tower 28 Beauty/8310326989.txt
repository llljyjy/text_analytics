I actually was pleasantly surprised with this product. Because it’s water based I was iffy but it’s made my skin feel a lot softer and not as red. As someone who suffers from  stressed and sensitive skin, I really enjoyed this product and it had really helped my skin feel much more hydrated. It’s a good calmer for those with acne prone skin as well. #giftedbytower28beauty nan
