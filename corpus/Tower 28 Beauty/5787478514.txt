Complimentary from Tower 28 Beauty. I love this serum just as much as I love the SOS Facial Spray. I have sensitive skin that gets red a lot and this serum has helped so much! It is a gel formula that bursts when in contact with skin. It leaves me skin so hydrated, nourished, and calm! I tested this serum for 7 days and there was a definite difference in my skin. My skin is more glowy, hydrated, and less red & irritated. Great serum!
