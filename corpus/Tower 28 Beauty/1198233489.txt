I was a little skeptical about this one, even after my secret BFFs at Doctorly recommended it. How could a first aid product be a skincare miracle? Well, it somehow lives up to the hype. Unlike many facial mists, it doesn’t sting my eyes if it gets too close. It started clearing up a couple mildly clogged pores. It’s helped my skin texture, because I can use it between layers in my skincare routine. The most dramatic change, though, was how quickly it calmed the redness on my face. I had some Santa-level rosy going on, but now I can actually go without foundation! I gave it four stars instead of five because there isn’t anything on the packaging that makes an important point: Using this will deactivate your vitamin C serum if you layer them together — even if you let the SOS dry, according to the PA at my derm’s office. It’s a simple thing to get around, and the company should definitely mention it. Regardless, though, I’m a big fan. T28 is a brand that flies under the radar a little — at least for Gen X’ers — but every product I’ve tried has been absolutely outstanding. (be sure to try Beach Please in Magic Hour — it’s key to the perfect no makeup-makeup look)  I’m not sure exactly what made me decide to give this a chance, but I’m glad I did. I’m definitely no longer a skeptic! No longer a skeptic!
