[gifted by Tower 28 Beauty] I’m new to the hypochlorous acid craze, but I’m on board after trying out this product! I struggle with acne and the occasional dry patch from use of adapalene & finding products to treat irritation + promote healing is important to me. The formula of this serum is a lot more water-y than I was expecting, but it still adds an ample layer of hydration to my routine. After using it for a few weeks, I think my acne is healing & becoming less red faster! Super excited to try the spray/toner next! nan
