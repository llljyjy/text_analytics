The best!!! I love the spray, too; both are a must, and I talk about the SOS line when skincare comes up! But this works so fast, relieving irritation esp for my psoriasis behind my neck/head and almost instantly, it felt better pain-wise and felt more like skin again! It also has been a staple for my acne, and any irritations on my face I want bye-bye; it makes the healing process go by much better! Itâ€™s something I will repurchase again and again! It does what it claims! 100/10 Heart eyes!
