The texture of this serum is so unique, very jelly like but blends and is absorbed by the skin almost instantly. I found myself needing more than 3 pumps, as it absorbed so quickly. The antibacterial properties of the serum are great and has been a great passive way to reduce and keep my acne at bay. My results were not drastic, although my acne issues are minimal. Definitely worth a try if youâ€™re looking for a new way to approach your skin.  This product was gifted by Tower 28 Beauty. Gentle and Works!
