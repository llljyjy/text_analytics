Does it smell like pool water? Yes. Is it great? Yes. The hypochlorus acid is the active ingredient here and it’s why it has such a distinct scent. It’s extremely calming for the the skin. I get lot of redness and irritation and this really helps. I got a small bottle for my bag as well. I really like that this is simple and doesn’t have any added fragrance. pretty great pool water
