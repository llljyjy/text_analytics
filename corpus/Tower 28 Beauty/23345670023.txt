I love the serum, it definitely helped my hormonal acne heal faster and not get as bad as it usually does, and it also helped with my dark spots. I’ve attached photos of day 1, and day 14 to show progress.the reason why I’m not rating this 5 stars, is because of the packaging. the spray nozzle is so strong, that it bounces right off my skin if I don’t hold the bottle atleast 6 inches away, and cup my hand. other than that, I love the product! Great product, packaging is a bit annoying
