This SOS Serum was gifted by Tower 28. It has a runny, viscous serum consistency that immediately begins absorbing into my skin upon application. It helped calm the redness in my skin that was slightly irritated the night before when I exfoliated. It provides some hydration and doesn’t dry out the skin, but it doesn’t provide much moisture either so if you have oily skin it’ll work nicely for you! One thing to note, it does smell like chlorine even when you apply it to your skin. After it gets absorbed into the skin, you no longer smell it, but keep this in mind if you’re sensitive to smells! nan
