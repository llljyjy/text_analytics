Firstly, this is an unusual product. It smells a bit like chlorine, but not in a bad way- it smells “clean” like the skin is ready for serums etc. It definitely helps to cancel readiness, reduce irritation and by looking at the ingredients I’m confident it will be good to have on hand for breakouts. Will definitely consider buying the larger size when my mini runs out. Great Addition to My Routine
