This product was gifted by Tower 28 in exchange for my honest review. This serum is incredible! Hypochlorous acid works so well on my skin to relieve my redness. If you like the SOS spray, you will probably like this one too as it has the same ingredient focus. I don’t think you necessarily need both since they will play the same role in your skincare routine. This one is a thicker texture than the spray, but it’s still a relatively lightweight serum with a watery texture. The packaging/pump feels somewhat cheap, and it smells like chlorine as is expected with a hypochlorous acid product. Love hypochlorous acid, similar to the spray
