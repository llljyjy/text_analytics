I have been using the SOS spray daily for a couple of years now and I was sent a bottle of the serum to try over a week ago and have been using it twice a day everyday since. I do think it helps, but I think I will change to using it once a day (probably night time) since I have eczema prone skin and dry patches on my face. The serum’s  not super drying, my skin is just super fussy, so as long as i follow with hyaluronic acid serum (i use the ordinary) and moisturizer (neutrogena’s hydro boost hydrating gel cream), it’s perfect! I really like the texture and how easily it absorbs, and the effects are visible! My only wish is that the pump was a little less aggressive lol The product comes out with a slight bit of force that I wasn’t expecting! I think overall, this is another product from Tower28 I will be recommending to my friends ! Tower28 Beauty Winning Me Again!
