I was skeptical at first but decided to give the travel size a shot and wow, I am pleasantly surprised. It is amazing at preventing and/or healing mascne and other kinds of acne resulting from friction and bacteria - e.g. bike helmet, etc. I find this to be more effective than any other treatment I’ve tried for that particular type of acne. An added bonus is that it helps make my skin feel soft and it’s so unbelievably gentle, I like the simplicity of it. Yes it smells very mildly of chlorine but that goes away as soon as it dries - so about 30 seconds. I only knocked off a star because of the price. I’ve now discovered you can get the exact same product from different brands on Amazon for way less. But if you are partial to Tower 28 and don’t mind the price then this is a 5/5. Excellent for Mascne
