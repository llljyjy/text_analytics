I wasn’t sure what to expect with this as I’ve tried other facial sprays before that have either done more harm than good, or nothing at all. My skin is extremely sensitive and dry due to tretinoin use. This is also the time of year when the skin around my mouth and nose begins to peel and burn from being so dry. CeraVe is my usual lifesaver but my skin has been so dry and sensitive that it actually burns to use moisturizer. This morning, I was about to slather on more moisturizer when I remembered I had ordered this spray. So. Refreshing. I kept it by my computer all day and would mist my face whenever it started to feel tighter and dryer. I did this for at least 8 hours without really looking at my face in the mirror. When I did remember to take a look at my face, I was so shocked to see that my skin didn’t look like it was on fire. My skin looked calm and the area right below my nose was the only spot that still had some dry flakiness. I can’t wait to continue using this spray and I’m keeping my fingers crossed that this is the solution for my angry skin! Noticed great results day 1
