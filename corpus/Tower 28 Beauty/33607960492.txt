Amazing facial spray toner! I have sensitive dry skin/patches with an oily t-zone, some redness & hormonal acne and it has helped so much. It hydrates and cleanses the skin, leaving it so smooth and healthy looking! I love using it in my nighttime routine & first thing in the morning to get all the oil and dirt off my skin from the night before. I also spray throughout the day for a boost of hydration or when my skin is irritated, it helps so much with redness and I haven’t had any flare ups since using this. The smell is mild when you first spray it but then it goes away very quickly. I’m sensitive to strong scented skincare products but this isn’t one of them, it doesn’t bother me. I’ve been seeing so many people raving about this product and I get the hype now. I will be purchasing the full size next & the mini is perfect for on the go! Sensitive skin must have*
