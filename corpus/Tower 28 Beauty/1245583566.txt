I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FREE FROM TOWER 28 BEAUTY.I will say, I was super excited to have received a full-size bottle to sample because I was hemming and hawing about whether to purchase or not.  It came in time for the Sephora-sponsored Tower 28 Beauty digital event on May 24, so I was able to learn more.  I used an entire bottle now (used it up in a month), and I really tried to give this a fair chance as I am a fan of Tower 28 Beauty and will never go without the S.O.S Daily Facial Spray.  This serum, however similar it is to the S.O.S Daily Facial Spray, actually brought out the flaws in my skin that the daily S.O.S worked hard in calming down!  I had more breakouts and more texture issues than I ever had since I started my routine incorporating the S.O.S Daily Facial Spray (took over a year to find the right morning and evening routine that helps my skin).  I changed nothing in my routine nor changed any of the products I’ve used and yet with this serum, not only did my face breakout more, but also, my Tower 28 Sunny Days pilled.I rated this 2/5 stars for effort -- I do like the texture of the serum and, of course, hypochlorous acid.  I do recommend this product even though it didn’t work for me, just because of the brand and it being having the National Eczema Association Seal of Acceptance. nan
