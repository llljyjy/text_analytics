This is a super thick serum! I love how gentle and hydrating it feels, but I’m not sure it’s formulated for my skin type. I’m on the oilier side, and when I have skin issues it tends to feel clogged and dull as opposed to dry. I think a rescue serum for me would be more exfoliating, but this definitely does the job of comforting and hydrating. Definitely consider your skin’s needs here— if you’re looking for soothing moisture, this is for you! So glad to have gotten it gifted by Tower 28 Beauty! Calming!
