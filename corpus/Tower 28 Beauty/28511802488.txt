This product was gifted by Tower 28 Beauty however all opinions are my own. I’ve been using this serum for 2 weeks and I’ve noticed an improvement on the redness in my skin. the texture is a lightweight almost gel-like that sinks in quick, my skin feels soothed upon application. Love the compact packaging too, perfect for travelling! Only thing I noticed is the pump is a little hard to press sometimes but other than that great product that’s worth the try! So Soothing!
