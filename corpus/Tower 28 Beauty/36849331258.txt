After reading the reviews I was convinced that this would be a game-changer for my daughter’s acne.  Truth is, after using two times a day for almost a month, we didn’t notice any improvement.  It seemed to make her face more red and irritated.  She did spray it on an area with razor burn and the razor burn went away quickly and I’ve used it for itchy skin with success.  So it has some uses, but I would buy a cheaper alternative and not put hope in this as a great acne fighter. Not a miracle worker, some helpful uses
