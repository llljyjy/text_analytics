This works wonders for me. I have combination skin that leans oily in the summer and dry in the winter. I’ve been using this since June, and it has saved me. I get occasional deep, painful breakouts and this stops them before they come to a head. I don’t burn in the sun but I have a few friends who do. I suggested they spray this on and they told me it helped calm their burns a lot. I’m curious to see how this will react with my dry patches once winter comes but as of right now, I am in love.
