First of all, this product was gifted to me by Sephora and Tower 28 as a Sephora Community Ambassador.  I started using this in place of a serum in the morning with one squirt and found it didn’t really do much for me.  However... when I started using this right after washing in the morning with four or five spritzes and then massaged in my serum while my face was still damp it worked great.  It kinda gave a boost to my other skincare products.  The mister could use a bit of refining, but I would still purchase again since I’m not using this after my make up is on.  I also really found that I do like having a product in a spray format.  I’m lazy in the mornings and one less product to massage in was kinda nice.  Will for sure be open to trying more spray’s as skincare in the future. Spray isn't just for setting anymore!
