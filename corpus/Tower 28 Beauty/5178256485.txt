I am really enjoying this serum! My chin has been my problem area for a while now and I wanted to see if this would help with the redness and acne I have in that area. I’ve been using it for over a week and have seen a difference. First off, the texture is very light and gel almost like water. It applies really nicely on the skin and absorbs easily. It does have a scent but it isn’t too bad and fades quickly. Overall, my redness has gotten way better and it is quickly drying up my acne so that it goes away and the skin can heal. Im very pleased by this serum! Gifted by tower 28 beauty. Really like it!
