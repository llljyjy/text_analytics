i use this in the am and pm alongside my sos spray and some moisturizer (and spf in the morning) and my skin has genuinely never looked better!!! i was worried this would be a waste of money since i already have the spray but it works even better with this extra boost! i also think the price is pretty good considering the amount of product u get. my only complaint is that the pump on the bottle kind of spits at you so the first couple of uses i wasted a lot of product miracle bottle
