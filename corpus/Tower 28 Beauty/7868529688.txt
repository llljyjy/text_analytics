This is the serum version of Tower 28 Beauty’s facial mist. It was what I expected it to be. It’s a simple hydrating serum. It feels lightweight. It’s not sticky. Ideal for anyone with dehydrated or sensitive skin. I wasn’t blown away by it but it’s fine. Main con is that it smells like pool water. I prefer the spray form, but if you prefer serums over mists this may be worth a shot. *gifted by Tower 28 Beauty nan
