I’ve been really sick and haven’t had the energy to do my full am and pm skin routine. I keep a bottle of this on a shelf on my closet and spritz my face a couple of times a day. It’s all I’ve used for two weeks. I have rosacea but otherwise have pretty good skin. After two weeks of just this my skin tone is even and no redness, my pores less noticeable. I got this in a subscription box but I’ll pay for it gladly! It’s amazing! this stuff is great!
