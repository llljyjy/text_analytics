such a calm & soothing spray. i used to wash my face with face wash in the morning until i found out the ingredient hypochlorous acid have so many benefit to them like antimicrobial to keep bacteria that clogged pores away. it’s also super soothing to the skin after you tap it into your skin AND it’s so gentle that most skin type should be able to benefit from this product!! i can’t raved enough about this product. probably the most unexpected find. i watched on doctorly that you should not use antioxidant after using this product because they will cancel out each other!! so i will only be using this on days i don’t use vitamin c in the morning. alternate day or use vit c in the evening. SO GOOD!!
