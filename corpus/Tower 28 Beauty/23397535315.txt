I’ve been using the SOS Spray for about 8 months now and absolutely love it so when the serum came out I couldn’t wait to try it. I got to try it in exchange for my honest review and I am genuinely impressed. I have sensitive,  acne prone skin that can get red and angry. I cut everything out of my skincare routine except for my cleanser, SOS Spray, SOS Serum, moisturizer and eye cream. It’s been about three weeks and my skin has never looked or felt better. The SOS serum goes on smooth and my skin literally soaks it up immediately. It doesn’t leave behind a residue and my skin instantly looks less red and feels calm. Over the past few weeks my skin has cleared up so much. My skin hasn’t been reactive, sensitive, red or angry since I’ve been using the serum. It looks and feels amazing. I credit the SOS Spray and the SOS Serum for my skins drastic recovery. I would 100% recommend both (or at least the serum if you can’t get both) to anyone with sensitive, acne prone, angry, red skin. You won’t regret it! Sensitive skins new best friend
