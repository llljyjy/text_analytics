This spray is so simple that I can’t believe it works. Like the other reviews say, it seems like chlorine water at first. But the smell dissipates and it sinks into the skin very quickly. It is amazing for calming down active acne (especially if you have picked at it) and I can’t imagine this irritating anyone’s skin. This is the only “active“ product I use aside from tretinoin, and it has been amazing for my skin. WOW!
