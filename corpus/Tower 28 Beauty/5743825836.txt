I was so excited to try this product because I have chronic cystic acne on my neck and jawline with redness, and thought this could what helps me. Unfortunately that was not the case and I haven’t seen a difference in my cystic acne and redness. They’re still very inflamed, painful and red. I will continue to use in the hope of seeing a difference in the future. I also found the packaging not to be my favorite, the product comes out too aggressively and splatters way further than I intend and you end up ruining some product.
