Gifted by Tower 28 Beauty. I should preface this by saying my skin is sensitive and fairly dry, and my main issue is redness and irritated patches that make an appearance once in a while. I have used this all over the face and as a spot treatment, and it does lead to an almost immediate improvement on the troubled areas. I like the very thin texture because it allows me to layer a moisturizing serum on top. nan
