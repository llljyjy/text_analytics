This product truly lives up to its name — I didn’t really expect much from this product to be honest, but figured it would be really nice to keep in the fridge during the hot summer days. Wow has it gone above and beyond that! I have very reactive skin that leaves me looking like I just ran a marathon after washing it. This is the first product I spritz on my face after washing it AM/PM — by the time I’m done applying all my skincare the redness is gone! Also I get the MOST SUBTLE (very very subtle) chlorine type of scent — literally barely any scent to me and it goes away once it’s dried down. I do not at all get the overwhelming bleach scent some other reviewers have mentioned. 10/10!! Magic for Redness
