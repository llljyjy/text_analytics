I started using a few days ago and I’m in love! The texture is so nice and light, does not feel heavy at all. Not to mention that it absorbed quickly and did not irritate my skin. I’ve been using it with the mist and it has really helped with redness which was my main concern. You did it again Tower 28, another amazing product!! Summer must have!
