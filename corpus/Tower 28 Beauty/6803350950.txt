Gifted by tower 28 beauty. This product was a nice texture and consistency, and I find it really did help a lot with the redness on my face from acne flair ups. I was not a fan of the scent though which honestly smelled like a pool at the YMCA. After this product is on my skin a minute or so it almost dries down to the point it feel like you have a dry layer or mask on. Itâ€™s not super uncomfortable but definitely gets better once you put a moisturizer. nan
