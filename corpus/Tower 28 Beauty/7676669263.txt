- I have been using SOS serum for about 5 weeks. I have tried it both AM/PM. My favorite use for this is to use it like “primer“ serum before I apply any other products.  - I have noticed that my post inflammatory hyperpigmentation is calmed and heals faster when I use this consistently. - Unexpected side effect, it seems to have my my extremely oily skin noticeably less oily! I am still oily but notice a lot less oil on my cheeks/chin/forehead. - I use 4-5 pumps 1-2x a day. I’m surprised it it lasting longer than I thought. Not even half way empty. - Only complaint, the pump on this isn’t not very controlled. The pump slightly hesitated and release the product in a kinda of splatter onto my fingers, not as controlled release as other serums. Surprisingly Effective
