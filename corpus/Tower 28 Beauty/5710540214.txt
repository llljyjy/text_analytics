First of all, yes, it is basically salt water. But I don’t hate it. It’s overpriced for what it is, yes, but I’ve been using this since I got the sample size in a Sephora collections set, and I can say it helps absorb my skincare in my skin more quickly, which is a lifesaver when getting ready in the morning. I don’t have 15 minutes for my skincare to be absorbed into my skin before I start my makeup. When I don’t wear makeup but still use this after washing and drying my face, my moisturizer doesn’t feel heavy or greasy. As for the calming, I don’t see that much of a difference, but my skin at the moment is not very good so I can’t really say. Haters will hate, but I do enjoy this product and I will probably repurchase. even if it is kinda just salt water. Yes, it's water
