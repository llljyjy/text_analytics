I bought this from Sephora on the release day because Im such a huge fan of the SOS Rescue Spray. I must say, the Serum might beat out the spray for me - it almost instantly calms my skin, especially with the sun getting brighter and giving some needed rays. Additionally, using it after the gym, along with the spray has really helped my skin no longer breakout from sweat. If that isnâ€™t enough to convince you, it comes in the most adorable matte-touch red packaging! Definitely a must-buy for the summer Must have for the summer!
