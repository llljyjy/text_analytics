I received this product complimentary from Tower 28 beauty and I’ve been using this product for about two weeks, and so far I’m really enjoying it! This serum has been really soothing for my skin and has really reduced my breakouts. Overall, my skin feels very balanced and hydrated! I appreciate that this formula is fairly simple but works effectively with my other skincare products. After over a week of use I’ve noticed that my skin is calm and balanced - I usually get hormonal acne, but this serum has really balanced out my skin and I haven’t experienced any breakouts since using! Holy grail for balancing my skin
