I’ve been using the SOS Relief Serum for about a month now and I have really enjoyed the benefits! I already have been using the SOS Spray for maybe a year and it’s seriously saved my skin. I used to have acne-prone, dry and sensitive skin, with lots of angry dry patches, and it became tiring to wait for my “perfect“ skin. The SOS line has totally turned my world on its head, fixing eczema in less than a week. Highly, highly, highly recommend. SOS? Yes, OH YES!
