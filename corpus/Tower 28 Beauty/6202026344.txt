*gifted by Tower 28 beauty* This serum feels amazing on the skin. When I apply it, after a few minutes my skin is less irritated and red. It seems to really calm the skin. After continuing to use it, my skin over time has become less irritated! My only gripe is that the packaging feels very cheap and plastic-y, but it is also super lightweight which would be good for travel. nan
