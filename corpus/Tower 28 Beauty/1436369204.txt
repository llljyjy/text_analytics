I recently had a first timer experience with a dermaplaning razor and may have been a bit too enthusiastic and my skin was not happy with me. I immediately grabbed my SOS spray and then followed up with the serum while my skin was still slightly damp. Any irritated areas were soothed quickly and my skin felt silky soft. I half expected to wake up the following morning with my skin back to being irritated but no, it was still calm. I gave my face a quick wash with plain water and reapplied the mist and the serum. Perfection!! And yes, I still have the older style mist. Quite literally an SOS
