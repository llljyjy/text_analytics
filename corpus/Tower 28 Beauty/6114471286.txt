The SOS Spray is such a holy grail in my routine I knew I needed to try their new serum! I love that this is something a bit more substantial than the SOS spray. I do wish it was thicker and had more of a hydrating feel but I do think this will be something Iâ€™ll miss if I stop using it in my routine. I also wish the packaging was different, I find that the product kind of squirts out and is a bit messy. This was gifted by Tower 28 Beauty for review. nan
