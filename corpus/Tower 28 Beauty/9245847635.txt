performance | full star | Literally SHOOK to the core! I thought I had nice skin before, but holy shiiii. For the first time you cannot tell I even have rosacea! ZERO redness on my cheeks! Plus overall my barrier feels so healthy and strong. texture | full star | no weirdness like sticky, foamy, causing pilling, or any of that. It’s a super thin texture, like a step above water, so use it as the first step in the routine, which provides that extra layer before applying any acids. scent | full star | no scent, no added fragrance packaging | .8 star | love that they use recycled plastic, the branding is super cute, but the pump.. not the most user friendly; you kind of have to press hard then the product shoots out. ingredients | full star | like what?? Simple really is effective! No toxicants or irritantsvalue | full star | if you have inflamed skin or inflammatory skin conditions, BUY THIS, you’ll thank me laterTotal 5.8 out of 6 stars No rosacea redness for the first time ever!!
