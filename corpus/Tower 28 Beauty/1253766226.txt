This product works on redness for me.  I was worried about the smell after reading reviews, because I am very put off by smells, but I donâ€™t find it to be strong at all.  The one star off is for the price.  Some people complained about the mister, I find the mister is better on the small bottle which is refillable. Works, smells fine
