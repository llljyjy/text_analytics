Wow this stuff is….amazing. At first I wasn’t so sure, it honestly seems like spraying water on your skin. But within a couple days, my nose pores were clearer and tighter, any pimples clear up asap. It’s a great base for the rest of my routine!!! My BF use as well and it cleared up his hard to remove nose blackheads, literally within a few uses. Amazing! SO GOOD
