So far, so good. I normally use the paulas choice exfoliating body spray but they dont sell it on sephora yet and I dont always want to buy on her website so I tried this since they have a trial version. It is not as exfoliating, but it dries out my acne if I have any that have popped up. I dont mind the smell either. nan
