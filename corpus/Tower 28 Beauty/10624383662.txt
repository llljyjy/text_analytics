Honestly not sure what is in this product that makes it work so well but I love it! I have dry, sensitive skin with some recent irritation bumps due to the heat. I bought this trial size to see if it was worth it and I am a fan! It cleared up the red bumps I had and they are clearing up. It doesnâ€™t have a smell and I love that it is fragrance free. It dries down nicely without being sticky. SOS this product is awesome
