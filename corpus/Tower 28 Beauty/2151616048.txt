This is my second time writing this review as the app conveniently has an error processing my review. I received my parcel today and just opened it. I noticed that for a 120ml spray it is light in weight. I put it up to the light and noticed half an inch of liquid from the fill line is missing, which is especially obvious with the flashlight (see photo). I am super disappointed, annoyed and angry with the fact that I paid for a new product and got a tampered one instead. Sephora or tower 28 dropped the ball on this one. I did not even get a chance to even try this product as I don’t trust if this spray is safe to have on my skin-yay. I’ll be returning this product and reordering unless I can find it in store by some luck. Sephora quality problems or tower 28 scam?
