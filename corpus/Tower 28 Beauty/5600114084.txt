I recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin and facial redness. After moving into a new city/apartment, my skin began to suffer from a butterfly rash/atopic dermatitis that was persistent for about 2.5 months. My friend recommended this product after hearing good reviews on social media, and I decided to give it a shot.  I was very skeptical at first, but also desperate because no amount of aquaphor, serum, or hydrocortisone could help my facial eczema. After 1.5 week of use, I started seeing results. Although I still experience very minor redness, it is not as bad as before. I also noticed that itâ€™s helped my skin barrier - because my skin does not feel as dry and irritated before. If you suffer from eczema - I highly recommend. Good for Facial Eczema
