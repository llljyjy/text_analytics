This serum has a lightweight jelly texture. It leaves a matte finish and has really helped with my blind acne (acne bumps w/no whiteheads). There is a toilet bleach scent that comes from the main ingredient -hypochlorous acid, but it does fade quick. Although the packaging isn’t luxurious but recyclable, I’ll say I have seen an instant improvement in the texture of my skin! I suggest pumping the serum away from your hand cause if close it’ll splatter. It’s nice to see this be so effective fast as I’ve seen my stubborn blind acne decrease in swelling and they aren’t transitioning into those nasty white heads! *Full review on IG: @sassandskincare *Gifted by Tower 28 Instant Results but Has a Smell
