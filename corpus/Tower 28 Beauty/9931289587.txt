because i try so much skincare, i’m very picky with what stays in my routine. this is my new favorite thing (i’ve actually already finished 2 bottles and picked this up at sephora recently when i finished my most recent one + own the mini for travel)I have incredibly sensitive skin that gets irritated so easily, and i find that this is one of the few things that will calm my skin. I use it every day, twice a day as my first step in my routine in the AM and first step post-cleansing at night. It’s incredibly soothing and lightweight.It’s definitely comparable to other hypochlorous acid skincare mists (which is the main ingredient that makes this so soothing/calming for redness and other skin irritations), but i find that tower 28’s is the most accessible one on the market and very well-priced.I also love using it on top of makeup to give my foundation a more skin-like appearance (note: it does not work as a setting spray, just a nice refreshing mist)HIGHLY recommend. new holy grail
