I’ve used this spray previously a few years ago when I had near perfect skin and thought that it was a useless spray and it was over hyped, but fast forward to today where I am now suffering from hormonal acne - I tried acne clearing face washes, masks, acid exfoliants, spot treatments, pimple patches, everything! I was feeling hopeless and I decided to give this another try and lo and behold! It reduced the size of my red angry pimples almost overnight and  now I’m in the healing stage but I’m not getting any more new pimples. It doesn’t miraculously heal your pimples overnight but it does greatly reduce the inflammation and prevents new ones from cropping up. I will now repurchase this for as long as I have acne! I’m now on the journey to reduce the hyperpigmentation that all my acne has left along my jawline and hairline. BTW, I spray this generously right after washing my face morning and night and let it soak in until face is 90% dry, then I spray lightly again for a second time then go in with my serums and moisturizers while my face is damp. For people with bad acne or red irritated skin
