I purchased a mini of this after reading rave reviews, and I was pleasantly surprised at how it helped my skin: it alleviated redness, helped minor blemishes disappear quickly and prevent more, and overall has made my skin tone more even (I have combination skin that leans dry with a little redness). It does smell like chlorine but the scent fades quickly, so I don’t really mind it. I do think it’s quite pricey for the simple ingredients, however I tried a cheaper product from Amazon that was supposed to be a dupe and it did not work the same as the Tower 28 brand; in fact, my skin got worse using the other brand. I’m not sure what kind of wizardry is involved with this product, but my skin really seems to like it so I’ve scooped up the full size bottle. Everyone’s mileage may vary, but I recommend giving the mini size a try to see if it works for you. Improved my skin
