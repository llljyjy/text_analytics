I generally do not struggle with acne (beyond just the occasional hormonal bump on my jaw line) or super sensitive skin but I recently had covid which seamed to some how cause tiny painful little white bumps that resembled acne ALL over my face and neck. When I used any of my regular skincare routine with actives in it, it flared up worse. I cut out all the actives and only used a ceramide moisturizer and spf which kept the agitation at bay but the bumps persisted UNTIL I added this into my routine. Not even a week after using this twice daily the little bumps completely went away. I really wish I had taken before and after pictures because the difference is crazy. I will not ignore the possibility that it could have simply been time recovering from covid that returned my skin back to normal but I really don’t think it is coincidental that it cleared up after adding this product into my routine. If you are not dealing with redness and sensitivity, I don’t know how helpful this will really be for you but if you are - look no further. Additionally, Hypochlorous acid can be used post-workout to help prevent your sweat from creating breakouts before you are able to get home and shower. So I plan to keep this in my gym bag moving forward and will always have some on hand for emergency use. Saved my post Covid skin!!
