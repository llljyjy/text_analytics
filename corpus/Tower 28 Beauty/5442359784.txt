OKAY let me start off by saying if you have rough, red, dry skin prone to breakouts you should give this a shot! My skin’s moisture barrier was toast after a recent medium depth chemical peel and I had acne all over my neck, jawline and chin so I was desperate to clear it up. I sprayed this on after cleansing AM and PM and within three days I noticed that blemishes no longer popped up! And the redness improved a fair bit as well. I have a science degree and I’m still pretty baffled that such a simple product worked but it did lol! This along with Glow Recipe’s Avocado Ceramide Serum saved my skin. nan
