I’ve always struggled with rosacea/general redness on my cheeks, it doesn’t help that I have KP in that area as well. This product has changed the game for me, after applying my redness is gone almost immediately, and it lasts practically all day (I use it morning and night). Ive been consistent with it for the last week and I can already see such a difference. I thought this redness would always just be a part of my face that I’ve come to tolerate, I’m so happy i found this product, its really helped me in my skin care and self love journey. I recommend to anyone with sensitive redness prone skin! Best product I've ever bought on a whim
