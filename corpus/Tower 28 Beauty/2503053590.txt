This is an absolutely fabulous product. I’m nearing 40 and I have some redness on my cheeks. After three weeks of use I notice a huge difference. That said, the pump on this is horrible. The product shoots out with so much force I feel like I’m wasting product. I find it easiest to use a mixing palette to spray the product out, but it’s still messy and inconvenient. This would be much better in a tube, but the product is worth the hassle. nan
