I had high hopes for this as I’ve loved St Tropez products in the past, but this just wasn’t it. Pros- I like the consistency of the mousse, but for some reason I kept dropping it everywhere during application. Cons - Turned out orange. You could definitely tell it was a fake tan.- So much transfer!! Seriously my bedsheets look horrible. - Clung to all the places I didn’t want it to, and none of the places I did want it to (legs still look pale but ankles, feet, wrists all look orange AF). Sadly, this is getting returned. It’s a hard no for me
