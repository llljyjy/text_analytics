I’ve never used a tanner so this was a new experience for me. The lotion is white and smells wonderful, you can really smell the watermelon scent and it’s not overpowering. The lotion isn’t thick or runny you don’t need to apply much either. It blends in smoothly and fast. It does give a slight tan look that you notice after a few hours. It doesn’t have an orange tint to it, it actually looks natural. There was no streaking left from applying and it was an even color tan where ever I applied the lotion. This tube is 6.7 ounces and I feel since you don’t need to use a lot at a time it will last for a while. I do recommend this if you are looking to add a natural glow to your skin while smelling wonderful. Great!
