I recently tested out St Tropez self tanning drops and they are a game changer for a safe, sun free glow. The drops are easy to apply and are buildable so you can get the customized color that you want. They smell great and left my skin really soft, but most importantly the final effect was a perfect, even and natural looking tan. The final results are visible after 8 hours so I personally use them at night a little while before heading to bed.  These are a must for me during summer! Amazing summer glow
