I was super stoked to receive these tanning drops and had very high hopes for the results because this is a brand I love and trust.  I used more drops than the amount recommended per limb and on my torso mixed with a half pump of non-scented lotion for every 6-8 drops. I was really disappointed when after 8+ hours, there was no difference. I could smell the light scent of the tanner, so I thought maybe it would work even though when I patch tested before with the pure product, it also made no difference in my skin color. High hopes with no outcome :(
