Words cannot describe how long I’ve waited for a product that will tan my face without being blotchy or streaking!! I applied the drops directly to my face and it easily applied like a skincare serum. It has a light scent that smells great but doesn’t linger. I was worried it wouldn’t blend well 8+ hours later but I woke up glowing!! It looks natural and I was able to reapply a couple days later with no problems, this time by adding the drops to my moisturizer! Where has this been!!!
