I received this Tan Tonic Glow Drops for the trial. It has lovely light texture, nice smell and it’s is very easy to use . It does leave any greasy or sticky feeling, but it’s fast absorbing and smooth. As to the tan I noticed very natural golden shade after 8 hours of application.  I would recommend to try this product to all beginners in self- tanning products. Nice and easy to use self tanner
