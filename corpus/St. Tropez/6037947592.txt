Im 50 and some tanners really soak into my sun spots and make them look really dark. This doesn’t do that, it looks so good on the skin and it feels moisturizing.  It is sticky for awhile after applying but  I think that’s just because of the great skincare ingredients and it’s definitely worth it!  I’m already on my second bottle.  I also apply it with gloves instead of a mitt, I think the mitt soaks up too much of the product and I don’t want to waste it. nan
