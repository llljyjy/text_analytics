I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. So here it is, I think the scent is good!  It’s great for a beautiful natural looking glow. It’s not overwhelmingly orange at all, I find that to be a big problem with most self tanners. Don’t expect to look super tan after using this because you won’t be.  It will gradually get darker the more you use it. Beautiful Glowy Skin
