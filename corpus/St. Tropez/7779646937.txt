This one is one of my favorite tanning creams. I love the lightweight mousse texture and how evenly it spreads onto my skin with the velvet mitt on. Other brands I’ve used before have left me streaky but I’ve never had this issue with this one. It has ingredients that are actually beneficial to the skin like niacinamide, hyaluronic acid and vitamin e. My tan develops within an hour and the lasts a couple of days without a budge. My go-to tanning cream!
