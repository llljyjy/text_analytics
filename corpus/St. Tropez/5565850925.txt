I am in love with how this gives me the perfect sunkissed, bronzed look without any of the sun damage. It’s so easy to use, I do about 3 drops and mix it into my moisturizer then rub it on my face. There’s no streaks and it’s so easy to blend in, the bronzing is overtime and it doesn’t look too crazy or orange. It’s also a bonus that there’s skincare ingredients in it so it’s a win-win. Perfect sunkissed skin!
