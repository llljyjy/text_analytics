These drops completely exceeded my expectations. For the first application I tried just a few drops, and it gave me a gorgeous natural tan. So the second application I tested a bit more and even then it still looked super natural. They made my skin glow immediately but wait about 8+ hours to see the full effect. I was stunned at how gorgeous the finish was and how natural it looked. These are going to be a staple in my routine this summer. Natural tan in a bottle
