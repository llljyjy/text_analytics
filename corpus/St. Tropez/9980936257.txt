I am very pale and have been trying out self tanners before I go on vacation. This one so far is the most natural and beginner friendly I have found! I love that I can use it on my face and it doesnâ€™t break me out or look streaky. I just mix it in with my regular moisturizer and lotion every 2-3 days to keep up a natural glow. I love it. Love it
