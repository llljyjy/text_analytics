This is and has been my favorite self tanner for over a year now! I was really upset because I was running low and thought the watermelon scent was limited edition. This tanner is nice and natural when used with a mitt, and gives this fair skinned girl a healthy glow after just one use. I’ve always loved that this product feels more like a moisturizer than a gel. It’s really my favorite. The only slight con is it does have that artificial tan smell the next day but it doesn’t bother me. I received a second bottle from Influenster for my review and I’m so glad I did because I needed a replacement lol! :) Must have for fair girls
