I love these Tan Tonic Glow Drops from St. Tropez. They contain beneficial skincare ingredients to help soothe, protect and plump skin while giving a natural looking glow.  They also help smooth out fine lines, even out skin tone and reduce redness.  I usually mix a couple of drops with my moisturizer. The drops have a beautiful fragrance, and I like how the drops are customizable; I can use more or less depending on how deep of a glow I want. These are perfect for anyone who wants that radiant sun-kissed look! Healthy Radiant Glowing Skin!
