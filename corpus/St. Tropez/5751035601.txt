I have a slight obsession with glow drops and illumination on the face so I had to try this product. My skin felt so smooth after I mixed it with my moisturizer and literally all my skin was the same shade no light patches. You can put more of you want a better glow or less for a more natural look :) Worry free tanning for all skin shades
