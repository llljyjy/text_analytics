I have used many self tanners for the face that would fade after the first wash but this one is going strong 4 days later. I apply 4-6 drops (depending how tan my body is) and it gives me a nice healthy glow. It doesn’t get patchy or get orange. It’s so fast and easy to apply and I like that I can mix it in with my serum or moisturizer to get a even more subtle glow. I will continue to add these into my routine. Loving my glow
