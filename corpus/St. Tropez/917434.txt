This is a very odd thing to say about a self tanning product but the first thing I noticed was how good this serum smells! Even after the initial application I never really got the stinky DHA smell. To me that is a big plus! Even better was how this St. Tropez product performed. It should be noted that I have not tried to get an intense, dark tan so far with this - I used it on a recent trip to Europe this winter to prevent myself from looking ghostly and it was absolutely perfect and so easy. I love that you can easily customize your level of tan - one or two drops for a little color, and the more drops you use the more intense the tan. Unlike most tanning drops this doesn’t need to be used with a moisturizer or serum - I’ve used both with and without a moisturizer and the results were exactly the same.  This also did not make my skin tacky or sticky and absorbed surprisingly well for what it is. This would probably be too expensive for everyday use if you want a dark tan but it can be built up very well over several days and is also great for a temporary, short term color boost. The color was awesome, no orange, and did not become patchy when it wore off. The best tanning drops on the market
