I have tried many self-tanners and have strict criteria for the ones I recommend. I enjoyed a lot about this self-tanner and would definitely recommend it. I have provided further pros and cons below.PROS-This product has a color guide so I know where I have placed the product-This product did not leave any unwanted smells-The color of this self-tanner is great. Not too green and not too orange. Very natural looking-I have not noticed any of the color flaking off with wear-I didnâ€™t see any transfer after application onto my clothes or sheetsCONS-The mousse is not my favorite. I dropped a dollop of mousse twice during application. The first time it dropped, I think I had too much on the mitt but the second time, it slid off my body before I could rub it in. -I feel like you need to use a lot of product to cover an area. I worry this small tube will not last very long-I felt really sticky after application and it took a while to dry down. Overall, I would recommend this product. I think it would be great for beginners, as the color guide makes it easy to apply and it looks really natural. nan
