The best part of the luxe tan tonic drops is that you can use them so many ways, you can put them directly onto your skin to create a permanent contour or you can mix them in your foundation or tinted moisturizer for a more subtle glow. I love that I can also layer this, so if I want a deeper glow the next day, I just do the same application.  After using my skin always feels so much smoother, not only does it give my skin a sun-kissed look, but it also gives it that sun-kissed feel, but without the sun damage. Great sun-kissed feel without the damage
