I received this product from influencer and st Tropez in exchange for an honest review. I genuinely loved this product. The tan was even and natural. It says gradual but it tanned quite a bit in my opinion. It smells amazing. And it left my skin soft. I will definitely be ordering more. The tan lasted about a week without reapplying but if you continue to reapply every few days it wouldnâ€™t get too dark, just keep it from fading. Great gradual tan
