These tan drops are heavenly! They have niacinamide which is the holy grail of ingredients. It gives such a nice glow to my skin. After 8 hours you can see how much of the tan shows. I did 4 drops and I felt that my skin got 2 shades tanner! It looked really good. I also loved how it felt on my skin. It wasnâ€™t oily or greasy. You need this!
