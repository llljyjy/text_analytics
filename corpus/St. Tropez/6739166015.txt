I’ve been using foam tanners for years but this is the first cream foam and it was wonderful to use! It went on so smooth and felt luxurious on the skin, I also love that it’s tinted so I can see where I just went over and what parts need a bit more buffing. It also doesn’t smell like other tanners (like crackers) and smells nice and floral Goes on streak free and smells amazing
