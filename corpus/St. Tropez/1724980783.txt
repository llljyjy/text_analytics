Love these tanning drops!  I’ve heard great things about St. Tropez, but this is my first time trying a product of theirs out!  I’m already naturally brown and on the darker side, but I love having a nice sun-kissed, darker tan during the summer.  With me being pregnant, I wanted a safer/healthier alternative to tanning out in the sun, and this was the perfect opportunity to try something like this!  I love that you can put as little or as much as you need.  I really needed no more than 2-3 drops and would add it to my moisturizers and apply after showering.  Also super easy to use and not as messy as some other self-tanning products! I definitely noticed a difference in my color the next day and was super happy with the results.  Not something I’ll be doing regularly, but perfect for when I want that extra glow!  Highly recommend! Love!!
