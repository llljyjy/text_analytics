I’m terrified of self tanners which I’m trying to get over this summer. So I jumped at the chance to test this out, it’s definitely not as complicated as it seems and the mitt is super handy - No stained hands! The formula is great and it went on pretty evenly - any issues were user error. Ended up with a few blotchy patches but that was my own fault, just need to work faster. It doesn’t have a super overwhelming scent and it was fine for my sensitive skin! Excited to use again and again this summer to give me a healthy glow! nan
