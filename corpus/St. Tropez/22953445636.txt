The St. Tropez Gradual Tan Watermelon lotion is hydrating with a light smell of watermelon. I love that the lotion is white so you can tell how to apply evenly. I applied after a shower at night to one arm to compare. The next morning, I could see a subtle glow. Not orang AT ALL which I love. I did a fairly light application for testing purposes, but I could see how with another application or two, it would be a great, natural shade. Iâ€™m pretty satisfied so far and look forward to continuing to use this winter. Nice, will keep using.
