Ok so this was my first time ever trying any at home tanning products & let me tell you St. Tropez did not disappoint! I mixed in about 6 drops into a quarter size amount of my daily lotion, I used that amount for each one of my legs. It applied so easily and absorbed nicely into my skin. It was not oily or sticky, I definitely feel like these drops are beginner friendly. I am loving my end results after 8hrs itâ€™s an even subtle bronze exactly what I was looking to achieve. I would definitely recommend you buy these drops if you are a beginner or you just want to have control over how tan you want to be. Love this product <3 Subtle Bronze Glow
