I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I’ve tried multiple saint tropez products over the years, and I always feel like they are at the top of the game. I think this particular product isn’t the dark one of them all, so if you’re looking for the super darkest shade I would find another one. But overall the application is easy as always, the texture is so smooth that it feels like butter on your skin, and your skin feels amazing after. I typically put it on before bed and it looks great the next morning. nan
