okay, let’s put aside the smell bc tbh i can smell the chemicals in all self tanners even if princess diana preached she “couldn’t” i would be able to i just have a good sniffer, but this tan is wonderful!!! i’ve been using this brand since high school and wow has it come a long way! it’ll help me feel a little less ghostly this summer hallelujah a good self tan
