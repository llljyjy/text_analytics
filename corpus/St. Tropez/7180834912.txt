I have tried all kinds of self tanning products and these are the best and easiest to use of anything that I’ve ever tried. PLEASE CONTINUE TO CARRY THIS KIT SEPHORA! It makes getting the products cheap and accessible. When you’ve used self-tanner a long time you learn that there are a few things you have to do to prep your skin for self tanner… Exfoliate and hydrate the areas you’re going to fan for a few days before you do the self tanning. If you have patches of dry skin ANY product you try is going to patch because the active ingredients work differently on dry or dead areas. That isn’t the fault of the product since there is no product that will work optimally if you don’t prep your skin before you self tan. SO - I prepped my skin as usual then put on my usual hydration, then I just sprayed my face and body generously with this and that was IT! I waited 5 minutes for the product to dry and put on my makeup and went about my day and 4 hours later I had a perfect even all over glow in a beautiful natural golden shade. It’s so much better than a gel product! The mist is so fine that it deposits completing perfectly without blending! No blending whatsoever!!! I couldn’t believe it! No product on my clothes or bed sheets - a totally clean tan. I am beyond happy with these products they are BY FAR the very best self-tanning products I’ve ever tried in terms of results, ease of use and no bad side effects like patchiness, smell or clothes staining… I know I must not have misted perfectly because I was in a hurry but my tan is the most even it’s ever been and even previously hard to reach areas like my back are perfect. The ONLY reason I could see anyone having an issue is if they did zero prepping or the skin - which is something you have to do with any self tanning products. If you want to try self tanning this is the kit - just watch a video about how to prep the skin properly and you’re literally golden. The Very Best in Self-Tanning
