I’ve tried so many different self-tanning products and this one wasn’t a disappointment. I went with a moderate amount of drops (3) just to test it out and it gave me a nice subtle glow. When I use certain gradual tanning lotions or self-tanning products I get shocked at how drastic the tan comes out. In certain occasions I want that drastic change, but this was a step below drastic where it was just enough give me some warmth and glow. Putting on my own body lotion with the drops felt luxurious and absorbed into my skin well. I didn’t feel overly sticky and the scent wasn’t overpowering. I’m happy with how applying my moderate amount of drops, but I’m curious to see the results after apply more! Satisfying Subtle Glow
