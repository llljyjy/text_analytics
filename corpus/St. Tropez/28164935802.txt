As soon as I opened this product I noticed that it smelled amazing. Usually, self-tanners give off a gross smell, but this literally smelt so good! When I put it on my face, it went on so smoothly,  kind of like a face oil. It didnâ€™t leave my face sticky, gross-smelling, or oily looking. This gave me a light little bronze, but nothing too dark. Great product!
