The tanning oil drops made my skin feel really hydrated and soft. Did leave a glow from within on my skin. The application after more than 6 hours was not too dark/bronze look, did leave a natural tan finish then other tanning products that leave a deeper tan color on skin. There was no streaks and applied with moisturizer. Very easy and quick go to application when on the go and wanting a natural glowy look. nan
