I’ve tried tons of self tanning lotions. This one is great and here’s why:- no tanning smell, this mousse actually smells quite nice during application. It’s a soft subtle scent of something spa like mixed with a rich baby lol- this mousse DEVELOPS. Looks quite light upon application because this product doesn’t dazzle you with the color guard that washes off in the first shower after application. Cheaper mousse will do that... Not this one. It has 100% DHAs meaning it’s potent in the developing process.- it lasts a week if not longer if you care for your self tan (moisturize daily)- the fading period is quite gracefulThis mousse isn’t for you if:- you don’t enjoy being a tad sticky after applying. The stickiness goes away after a bit but it is a little sticky, not excessive though.- cool tone people may not enjoy the this product as it could make them look a little orange. It’s good for neutral and warm skin tones as I feel this tanner leans a bit on the warm tone. pros and cons below!
