I wanted to love this product. I do like the concept of the drops. The drops are easy to use and mix with moisturizer. After exfoliating and mixing it with moisturizer I let it develop and it was more orange than a sun kissed glow on me. It was streaky. It does not smell like self tanner, which is a plus. nan
