A few weeks ago I added this to my morning skin care routine, I just mix 2 drops with my sunscreen/moisturizer. I love that it’s so easy, keeps my skin looking tan and it doesn’t feel like there’s anything extra on my face! I live in Texas and it’s already 104 degrees here, so it’s been a game changer in not having to wear foundation! Love it!
