At first, I was a little suspicious, worried it wouldnâ€™t work, mainly because I am already naturally tan but very uneven and would love to have all one color regardless. I tried it, and I was shocked at how well my skin looks glossy and evenly beautiful I love it. I followed the instructions, and it is easy to apply too!! Love my results!
