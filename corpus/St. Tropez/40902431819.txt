I love this product! I’ve used st. Tropez for years, I started with their mousse but lately I’ve been gravitating more towards tanning drops because I can mix them with moisturizer to help out my dry skin, and these ones are great! The color pay off is great and so natural rather than orangey and applies so evenly! Definitely recommend! Great color payoff!
