I absolutely love this! It was much easier to apply than I thought and the absorption was great and didn’t stain any of my clothes after washing. I appreciate the color and it’s perfect for my skin and makes my skin glow like it hasn’t in a long time. I wish that I could be this tan naturally, but if I did it the natural way I would definitely have a lot of skin damage. So, this is the perfect alternative and I can’t wait to use it again when I start to lose it The best self tanner even, but a bit pricey
