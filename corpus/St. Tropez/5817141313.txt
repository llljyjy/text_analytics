I tried the st tropez tan drops for the first time, I added 4-5 drops to my moisturizer before bed and woke up with glowing skin. It makes my skin look amazing and now I dont have to wear that much makeup or bronzer because I use it right before bed and wake up with a tan. I cant wait to use it on my body as well, and since I mix it with my moisturizer its not blotchy at all. It actually blends way more than I expected and looks super Natural Natural Glow
