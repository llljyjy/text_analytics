I love st tropez products as the tonality looks great on my skin and never orange. These tanning drops are awesome because you can control the deep mess of the color so it gives me a nice natural glow instead of a super intense tan. They smell great, they mix really well with moisturizer and leave me feeling dewy without being sticky like so many other tanning products. Non sticky tan!
