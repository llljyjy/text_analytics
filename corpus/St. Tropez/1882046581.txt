St.Tropez Self Tan Luxe Tan Tonic Glow Drops came in clutch for the summer! I have developed a sock tan while wearing sneakers so my feet are super pale as my legs are dark. I really thought I had no other solution but this makes it so much easier to build my feet tan to my already tanned legs. I am happy to say that within 1 use of this, I am starting to see the tan line diminish! It looks natural and is a gradual build so I am so happy to know that this can not only be used for my body but Iâ€™m even more interested now to try on my face to match my summer body tan! So easy to use and love the product so much! Summer glow here I come!!! Amazing product for the summer
