Really nice and smells almost like coconut! I thought because I have olive skin I would need a lot to make a difference but I didn’t & 4 drops made a noticeable difference. Does not transfer on bedding/clothing and if you really need to take it off just exfoliate and it’s gone! Powerful & Pretty :))
