this product made my skin feel smooth and gave my skin a nice glow.  the final results were good although it did take more than 6 drops on each body part to produce some pigment since i have fair to medium skin.  i did love that it was super easy to use and that i could just blend it into my moisturizer! overall i think this product depends on how fair your skin is!! worth a try! kinda good
