I am a huge St. Tropez fan, and was so excited to try these glow drops. I’ve tried a handful of similar products, and these are definitely unique in that they offer way more than just a bronze. I love that they are so customizable, and that I can use as just a serum, or mix into my moisturizer. The color is very subtle, and natural - definitely lighter than some of the other drops I’ve tried. The product rubbed in quickly and made my skin feel more hydrated. Definitely would recommend for an everyday glow! Note: this product was gifted. nan
