Omg there is no way I paid 55$ for this mousse!?!? It’s so patchy and hard to spread on the skin :(. I wasn’t even a little darker after 3hrs! It took my skin almost a day to become a tad darker! The next day I just robbed my arm with my hand and it all came off... I never experienced something like that with my regular tanning mousse. Won’t buy again. But if you like olive tone and can manage to rub it on the skin it’s for you! Everbody seems to love it! I really wanted to love it too. it's a pass for me
