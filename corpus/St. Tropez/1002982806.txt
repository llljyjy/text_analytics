I like this product I tried it a few times and was so scared of how dark it was going to look on my medium skin tone but it looked so good and sheer and not streaky. I used the glove with it to keep a well balanced streak free coat and I wore it for a few hours and the color enhanced and it was perfect. I did it on my legs because my arms are pretty tan and no need for my body yet and I loved it! Def recommend nan
