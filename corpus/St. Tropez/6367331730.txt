Iâ€™m Pakistani and have naturally tan skin so I was a little bit afraid to use these but LOVE the glow they give me. It is a very natural but also very hydrating formula. I sometimes apply directly to skin and other times mix with my moisturizer - both ways work and give me an amazing glow.  If you want a natural sun-kissed skin, this is for you! the best way to get natural sun-kissed glowy skin
