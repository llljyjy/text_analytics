I’ve had so many bad tanning experiences in the past I am always really scared to try tanning products, but so many reviews stated that it was gradual and wouldn’t leave me streaky — and I’m so glad I listened! This product is really cool because I can adjust how many drops I want to use — and can use all over face and neck, or add into my moisturizer. It is super adaptable and smells great —I usually hate the smell of fake tanners but this one is awesome.  Make sure to wait the full 8 hours to decide if you like the color, it comes in slowly! Comes in gradually but the color is perfect!
