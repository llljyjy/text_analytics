This product does exactly what it says it does! I’ve used tanning drops like this before, but I’ve always mixed them into moisturizers or lotions and applied them that way. These tanning drops said that you could apply them directly to the skin, and though I was hesitant, I am impressed by the results! I especially love how you do not have to rinse this self tanner off upon application. This is the perfect product for tanning the face as it is not drying and did not cause me any irritation or breakouts. You definitely get a natural tan glow after 8 hours. My favorite way to apply is to massage the drops directly into my skin after a shower and before going to bed, and I wake up in the morning with a gorgeous all-over glow with no rinsing needed! It has a very slight scent, but is not overwhelming whatsoever. The color is not the most dramatic tan ever, but it’s perfect for that all over natural glow and the convenience of this product makes it 100% worth it in my opinion! For those who prefer a color guide, be aware that this product goes on clear so it can be a little difficult to ensure an even application, nan
