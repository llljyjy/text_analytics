I really like it! The oil is a thick consistency, applies on smoothly, & it felt hydrating to my skin. It’s easy to apply as well. You can use the droplet applicator or mix it with your moisturizer. I mixed in about 6 drops with my moisturizer & it worked great with it! I’m happy with how it turned out. nan
