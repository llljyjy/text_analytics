Really like st tropez products. Decided to try this out. Tried both mixed with moisturizer and alone. I prefer it alone. With moisturizer, the color didn’t develop quite as dark or fast as I’d like and I used max amount of drops suggested. Though there was no smell whilst being applied or after. Used alone, it dried quickly and there was no smell other than the subtle fragrance. The color development was nice and looks natural, not orange. However, there’s no color guidance so if you miss areas you won’t know till after. Also it does give off a smell after 8 hr development time. It’s definitely trial and error. It is a good product, but not my favorite of their brand. Good, just not the best.
