Definitely takes some trial and error to get the right shade but once you figure it out this tanner offers a very natural bronze tan. The first time I used 3 drops mixed with lotion and it was far too much and came out very orange. The second time I used 2 drops with lotion and it seemed to give me an even glow (just made sure to fully rub in and wash hands after). As long as you rub it in all the way it should give an even layer of tan, however if you don’t rub in all the way it may look spotty/blotchy. When using 2 drops on my stomach it perfectly matched the natural tan on my legs. The tan fades over the course of a few days but also fades evenly. The product has a fresh scent, very bright, clean, semi floral with maybe a hint of vanilla, smells great but isn’t overbearing. Nice product once you get the hang of how to apply Bronze tan with trial and error
