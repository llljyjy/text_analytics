Disclaimer: I was already a big fan of St. Tropez Tanners but this one is definitely my new favorite! So with this one my skin seems to be more hydrated afterwards and of course has a beautiful bronze glow! I also love the scent of this one it’s more musky but in a light feminine way I absolutely love it! Didn’t think it could get any better but it did!
