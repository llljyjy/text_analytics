new favorite self tanner!! i have used A LOT of self tanners, and also am an avid spray tan gal. this has quickly become my top favorite. the smell is great (not chemically at all). it smells slightly tropical but not that typical self tanner smell. i also really like how creamy the formula is and that the color guard is bronze not green/golden. didnâ€™t leave my skin feeling dry or patchy at all and looked amazing after rinsing off! new fav self tanner HANDS DOWN
