I was gifted these tanning drops from St. Tropez. Iâ€™m loving my results so far. These tanning drops are easy to use and smell great. I like how you can use a few drops in your moisturizer or apply alone so you can basically customize your tan how you want. I used these both on my face and body and I mixed 4-6 drops with my moisturizer when I applied. I definitely noticed a nice natural tan after a few hours. I was looking for a more natural glow and these worked great for that, they would also work great for a buildable tan. Love the results and easy to use
