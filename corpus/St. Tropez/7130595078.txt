I love self tanning drops. They’re my favorite form of self tanning application. And the St. Tropez Luxe Tan Tonic Drops are some of the best I’ve tried. They give me a great bronzed color, no streaks, no breakouts and they don’t smell horrible to me. 4 drops is the perfect amount for my face and I apply it with my moisturizer. Highly recommend! Love these tanning drops!
