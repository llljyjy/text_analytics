This does have a sweet candy watermelon scent. However it is not super strong. And it does fade quickly. This develops a tan within hours. It does not look orange. If you massage it in well it is not streaky. I did not see it come off on my clothing. I like that it is an easily absorbed lotion and it dries down very quickly. But I donâ€™t like that the next time that I took a shower and washed my legs my tan disappeared. However, while my legs were tan they looked very nice. And I started out on super pale legs. And the tan still looked natural. I do really like this product, the only thing that I would change about it is that it did not wash off when you wash your legs or shaved. Scent doesnt last long
