this is my first time using tan drops and this one is a good one for beginners who are hesitant to try self tanners. it’s nothing too crazy if you mix it in with lotion. i’m fair/light skinned and it was a nice gradual color. it’s very small for the size, considering you would need a lot of drops for something noticeable nan
