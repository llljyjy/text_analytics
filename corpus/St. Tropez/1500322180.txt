I was gifted this product and as for someone with sensitive easy to burn in the sun kinda skin I am always looking for easy mess free solution for tanning. This was fairly easy to use and the results were patch free and gave this beautiful golden glow to my skin. My skin felt more of a natural glow and not orangey and it felt hydrated as well. Beautiful natural glow
