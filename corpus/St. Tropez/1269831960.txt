Apparently some people in the reviews don’t know what a color guide is. The color you initially put on is not supposed to be the color of your tan. It’s supposed to run down the drain and it will not tan that dark after 12 hours. This is the absolute first self tanner that I felt comfortable with after the color developed. I always get blotchy or streaky, but this actually worked. It does feel a bit sticky, and does transfer, but I’ve never used a self tanner that doesn’t do that. I like to shower/exfoliate/moisturize the night before, apply in the morning and then rinse at night. Wear black clothes or stuff you don’t mind getting tanner on. Yes it has some of the downfalls that most self tanners have, but the formula gives great results in my opinion. I also used a self tan *remover* mitt in the shower to get a ton of dead skin off. Don’t use soap with it. Just wet your skin, go to town and you’ll be blown away at how much dead skin comes up. nan
