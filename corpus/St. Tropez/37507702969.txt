This tanning mousse is the perfect way to get that summer glow without sitting in the sun for hours! The mousse doesnâ€™t dry my skin out and goes on so smooth and dries really quick. This left my skin nice and bronzed after 8 hours and does not have an orange color at all! I love how easy and simple it is to apply with the velvet mit--the mousse is so easy to blend in evenly! Seriously love this, perfect for pre summer events! nan
