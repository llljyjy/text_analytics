So this product is my favorite tanning product ever. First off I wanna say it feels like a serum. So it’s very moisturizing light weight and smooth compared to mousses. You can apply the product with your hand just make sure you wash your hands afterward and I set couch got in my bed and there was no transfer. You start to notice a difference in your skin after four hours I was able to start to see changes I just slept in it because I wanted it to get as dark as possible. It was so light weight I even applied it to my face because you couldn’t mix it with your moisturizer. I highly recommend I will be using this product as my maintaining at home products from now on. It was super easy to apply you can do drops into your lotion or you can just do drops onto your body and rub it in it blends easily due to the serum base solution. I love my skin feeling very moisturized but not sticky nor congested which I love the most. Best self tanner on the market
