My skin dries out easily, so I’m always worried about  trying something new! So thankful this was an easy add into my lineup! The hydrating and lightweight formula made for a great combo with my skin. Drops are easy to blend into my skincare lineup so I don’t have to add extra steps or products, which is always nice! A few drops goes a long way and are the perfect add in with my daily moisturizer for some fresh color. Perfect for a glowy tan!
