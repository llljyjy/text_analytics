As with any self-tanner, most of the work relies in properly prepping the skin. Exfoliate and moisturize, apply before bed, and reap the results the next day. This develops in a beautiful tan color, even for my very fair skin. The scent is very pleasant, the color is not orange and itâ€™s not streaky whatsoever. Great experience overall. nan
