This product smells great and has a hydrating lotion-like texture. It does give a nice gradual tan, but I did get noticable streak marks around my hands/wrists (mostly from hand washing and sweating under my watch band) and also on my ankles/feet (from tight socks/shoes). I have always had a general issue with tanning lotions that claim to be “daily lotions“. If you don’t cover every square inch of your body, it is very noticeable in the spots that you don’t cover. I don’t know about you but I don’t use lotion head to toe daily. It’s daunting. So while I do like this formula and how tan it makes me, I’d much rather use a tanner that you wash off (to avoid streaking and staining) and so that it lasts longer without having to do every day. But for someone who doesn’t mind putting on lotion head to toe, I’d reccomend this product. Okay formula, don't love the concept.
