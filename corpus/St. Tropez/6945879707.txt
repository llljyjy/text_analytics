At first I was a little nervous because I’ve never used a tanning lotion. At first sight, I loved the bottle. I did notice there wasn’t a safety seal which was a little weird. 🤷🏼‍♀️ I really loved the watermelon scent. After reading other reviews I wore gloves when applying because it’s kind of hard to get off.  I applied the lotion and I really liked it. I would purchase this product again. I also recommend to all of my friends and family. Liked it!
