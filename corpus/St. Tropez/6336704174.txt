I’m impressed! This product delivers on a natural looking, streak-free glow. I have pretty fair skin and I was a little nervous at how dark this mousse appeared. However, once buffed out with a mitt, it looked fine. Hours later, it’s natural looking (not orange) with no streaks and no staining at the usual tricky spots like knees and elbows. Plus, it smells really nice! While drying, there is a faint whiff of that usual self tan smell, but it’s minimal. I will definitely use this product again! Easy to use with no streaks!
