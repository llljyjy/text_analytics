Honestly this product was just okay. I am hesitant to do self tan so when I do I was expecting more noticeable results. It gives a very mild “sun kisses glow” but I wouldn’t really say it makes you very tan. It definitely has a fake tan smell so for all of that I was hoping it would be darker. Not bad as like an added touch for an event or something though Not very dark but okay
