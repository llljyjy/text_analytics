I really wanted to love this product but I am disappointed! I used this product on my face and body, it gave me a beautiful glow on my face but left streaks on my arms and legs. I did like the color payout but the streaks were my main concern and they lasted for a few days. I also made it a point to apply the product evenly throughout. I can attest that the product is long lasting and works but be careful with the streaking! beautiful glow, leaves streaks!
