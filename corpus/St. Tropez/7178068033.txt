This is really easy to use. I just put a few drops into my moisturizer and mix it and put it on my skin. I am light skin toned, so I usually put like 5 drops into my moisturizer for my legs and body. I use like one or two drops on my face with moisturizer. I put it on in the evening and when I wake up I get a very healthy glow. I like the color its not too orange or green. Its a nice natural color. Nice glow
