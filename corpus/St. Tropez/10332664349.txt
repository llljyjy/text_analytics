Normally, I don’t use self tan because I hate the way it smells and feels on my skin. Smells gross and is all sticky. But, I got this as a gift from Sephora so I thought I’d give it a try. I was surprisingly shocked. It wasn’t sticky at all and it smelled good. It wasn’t orangey at all, and looked like the perfect sunkissed tan. Overall, I would definitely recommend if you’re new to self tanners. loved it
