First time using a self tanner and I am obsessed! I complain all year long about looking pale and missing my Caribbean skin but being scare of tanning/sun exposure has kept me from taking too much sun. I was honestly scared of messing up with self tanning and looking like a carrot but this process was easy, fast and it works perfectly. My skin was soft and didn’t stain my white sheets. The only advice is to be very throughout with your exfoliation and application, make sure to hit all the creases in your wrist, elbows and knees. Help for your back is not necessary but having someone really helped my anxiety of messing it up!I shared it with my sister in law, who’s as pale as milk, and she loved it too! Will buy again, 100% the price. Good for anxious newbies!
