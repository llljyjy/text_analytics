These self tan drops are incredible! They give you a rich, natural, and even tan without too much effort! I’m not the best at self tanning, which is why I rarely do it but these drops make it super easy to get it done. You can mix these tanning drops into anything and use it on the skin! I love mixing it with my serums, face moisturizers, and body creams. When you mix the drops into other products, it dilutes the tan so, it makes it much easier to get a gradual and natural liking tan. This is the least intimidating tan product I have ever used. If you’re new to tanning or you’re just don’t have the energy to put too much effort into it, Thai product is perfect for you! Easy and Natural Tan
