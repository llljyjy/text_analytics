I have a very fair skin that burns easily, so staying in the sun is out of the question. My experience with self tanning products was not very successful in the past, so testing this product was quite intriguing. Even for a beginner like me, it was easy to use. I was afraid that I was going to look like an “Oompa Loompa“, because the formula is darker when coming out of the tube, but surprisingly this applied without streaks and it does not look orange on the skin. The mitt that it comes with helps a lot, so do use it! The product does not smell badly either and it’s not sticky afterwards. I liked it a lot, hours later it developed into a nice healthy looking tan that I am enjoying. Great even for beginners
