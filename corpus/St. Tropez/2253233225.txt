as an avid self tanner i trust no brand more than st.tropez to deliver an even and dark tan that lasts. i love the self tanner drops for use in between mousse applications and helping to extend the life of that tan a little, or fixing a little mistake easily. as with all st.tropez items my skin always feels soft afterwards, but the scent is a little on the strong side. nan
