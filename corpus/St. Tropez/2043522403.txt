So, i’ve been using the old version of this for yearsBut gosh… this does not even come close to the old version.. It does have good things to it: its darker and the undertone is more flattering. Also does not stink as bad.BUT I have never used a tinted moisturizer/gradual tan that streaks THAT BADIt takes me 1-2h just to even everything out and i’ve tried with a glove, a mit and my hands!Also, it stains really bad, it does not come off your hands after so be mindfull of that..Finally, the worst part is that even with correct moisturizung and scrubbing before, it starts peeling off when its drying and leave me with really bad spotsI will definitly not be using this do not recommend
