I love St Tropez and have been using their self-tanning for quite some time now. When I saw this product, I knew I had to try it out. These drops make self tanning so user friendly! I find it easiest for me to mix a few drops in with my face moisturizer and body lotion and evenly apply that on my body. The color payoff is dependent on how many drops you put, so it is customizable to whatever color payoff you are looking for! It leaves my skin with such a subtle glow and natural tan that I am obsessed with! I will now look like Iâ€™ve been tanning on the beach all year long, and this is perfect for this winter season! A new self tanning staple!
