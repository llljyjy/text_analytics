I always get nervous with tanning mouses like these because you never know how it’s going to end up looking, but I seriously love this one! The application was super easy. It blended effortlessly and didn’t feel sticky at all. It left my skin with a beautiful summer glow and no streaks! I highly recommend! The best!
