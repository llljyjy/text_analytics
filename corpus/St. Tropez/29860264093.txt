This was exactly what I was missing! Ever since the pandemic I’ve stopped wearing so much makeup. However, I’ve noticed that I’ve been missing that little extra color makeup would give me. I use SPF and don’t go out in the sun too much but I do enjoy having some color. I don’t use this product everyday, but when I do I use one or two drops mixed in with my moisturizer and it does exactly what I need it to! Therefore this product lasts a good amount of time. It doesn’t make me orange and I make sure to rub it in to my neck and ears too to really blend everything. Love it!
