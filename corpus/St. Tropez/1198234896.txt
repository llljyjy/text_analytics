I have to start by saying that I never write reviews unless I absolutely love something! I just had a baby and used to spray tan myself religiously but now with a baby and breastfeeding it’s nearly impossible. I bought this and kept it on for an hour during my baby’s nap and washed it off before I fed him. It got gradually darker throughout the day and the next morning it looked amazing! Highly recommend if you’re short on time! I love this stuff
