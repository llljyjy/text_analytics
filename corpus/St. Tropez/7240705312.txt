I am kind of pale right now so I wanted an easy way to give some tan to my face but not have to worry about getting stains from self tanner & this was the perfect product for me! It smells really good - I mixed it with my moisturizer and slept in it overnight and woke up with a nice glow. I only used 2 drops but itâ€™s really easy to use different amounts depending on how tan you want to be! Nice glow!
