This is the WORST self tanner I have ever used… and trust me, I’ve used a lot. It’s disappointing because I love the St. Tropez Brand. This product has a topical bronzer in it, so it transfers onto everything, and the bronzer washes off right after the recommended time or longer-so you’re not even as tan as you were with the bronzer on your body. Anyways, the other st. Tropez products are great, just stay clear of this one… so many other great self tanners out there, for FAR less money.  Oh, and it’s super sticky and takes FOREVER to blend in the skin… you end up looking blotchy. do not waste your time or energy on this product
