I’ve been loving the St.Tropez Self Tan Luxe Tan Tonic Glow Drops and can’t wait to use it more on my next vacation. The drops are easy to apply and spreads evenly onto the skin. The scent is light and is not overwhelming or overpowering. It made my skin glow, feels more smoother and hydrated. The product is not too transfer proof (definitely allow time to absorb). Would definitely recommend this product! Great hydrating drops!
