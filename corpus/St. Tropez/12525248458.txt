This is my first time trying St. Tropez and let me tell you, it’s worth the hype! I’ve tried other tanning drops and this one truly is good. I loved the serum like texture rather than how liquidy other brands can be. I mixed mine with my favorite moisturizer and 8+ hours later it left my skin plump, glowy, hydrated without looking patchy or streaky. I did a double take while I was doing my nighttime skincare routine, because I noticed my skin looked so even and then I realized it was the drops. The scent is strong but I think it’s a plus because it gets rid of that weird tanning smell (if you know, you know). Clean girl must have!
