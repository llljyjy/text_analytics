I really love mouse for self tanner. This one goes on with ease (special thanks to the mit) and doesnâ€™t look blotchy at all. I had a nice even application with no streaks. I will say that it felt moisturizing to my skin. I did not feel like it gave me the tan I was looking for but it did provide a nice healthy glow nan
