I really hate this stuff. It’s super cumbersome to apply, it takes forever to rub in. It’s almost too creamy/hydrating to the point it feels tacky and sticky and that feeling doesn’t go away until you wash it off. Had a friend help me apply and she agreed it was way too much work to blend. Once blended, I let dry for an hour before putting a bug loose tee shirt on. Transferred horribly onto clothing and bed sheets. If you have 10 hours to stand around naked then maybe give it a shot.. also, after I rinsed this off 12 hours later, it all went down the drain. I was left with next to no tan. Waste of money and time. nan
