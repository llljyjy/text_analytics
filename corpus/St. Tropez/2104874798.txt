I have very pale complexion so I like using these drops to add a little color. They are great lightweight texture, not greasy, not drying, weightless and I don’t even notice that I have anything on. I use it on its own as a serum if I want a faster color or mix it with my moisturizer for an even more gradual tan. They don’t clog my pores or make me look orange. don't clog pores
