I have tried just about every self tanner at this point and I have to say this one is probably my new favorite. It went on flawlessly, with no streaks. I slept in it, it didnâ€™t leave residue on my sheets which is a hugeeeee plus. In the morning I showered and OMG. The tan was perfect!! I love. yes!
