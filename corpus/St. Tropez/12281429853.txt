I’ve tested many many self tanners, but never a st tropez and I really wanted to know what the hype was all about ! There’s no smell, which is good even tho I’m used to self tanners smell, and the color and glow this self tanner gives you is stunning ! So easy to apply and blend, this is my favorite now just because I’ve never got such a beautiful color, but keep in mind it transfers a little bit during the development process.
