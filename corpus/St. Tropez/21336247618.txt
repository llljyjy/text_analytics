I received this product free in exchange for my honest review. This is the first time I have used any kind of sunless self tanning product, and honestly I’m impressed with it. The lotion itself smelled like summertime watermelon, but faded quickly after application which I appreciated. The lotion was creamy, and spread very easily. It also absorbed quickly enough to spread evenly but not feel tacky or slimy afterwards. It was definitely moisturizing, too. I applied after a shower, and noticed it a slight difference the next morning. I am very pale, so I didn’t want to overdo it and end up orange so I waited two days between reapplication. After the second application at night again, I noticed a soft tan tint the next morning. It’s more a sunkissed glow than tan which is what I prefer going into cooler months. I’m not sure how dark it will go, but since I like the level I’m at I will use once a week to maintain. I saw no staining on my hands after washing or on any clothing that came in contact!As far as the firming portion of it, I’m not sure how long it would take to see those results. I think it mostly comes from moisturizing the skin and looking fuller over actual forming on a large scale. I would absolutely buy this again and recommend it based on the tanning alone with a bonus of firming happening over time. Great beginner self Tanner
