I trust St. Tropez for all my tanning products. this particular one is amazing for a few reasons:1. The mousse consistency is super easy for a streak free application, especially if you use a tanning glove.2. It has a bunch of ingredients that are actually really good for your skin - especially love the hyaluronic acid for hydration. 3. It smells like a vacation. A few tips for great results:1. Be sure to exfoliate and moisturize dry areas before application. 2. My skin is already a bit tan, so I left it on for the full eight recommended hours before washing it off. The result was amazing glowing tanned skin tone. nan
