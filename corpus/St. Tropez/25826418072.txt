I really liked this product to create a natural subtle tan. I used it specifically for my face and neck but it states it can be used on the body also! I used 4 drops in my moisturizer at night and woke up to a nice color for an event I was going to! I like that it applies smoothly when you mix it into your already staple products, and that it’s customizable to how deep you want your tan to be. It had a pretty neutral smell, not good not bad. I think next time I’ll use more drops because it didn’t achieve the full tan I wanted, but I have pretty olive skin tone to begin with so I probably just needed more drops. Ike that it just took on the texture of my lotion, and how a little goes a long way! It’s great for the skin care obsessed because it has a formula tailored to treat skin and not just “cover it up” which I loveeee. I’d recommend! A great addition for those who want a natural tan
