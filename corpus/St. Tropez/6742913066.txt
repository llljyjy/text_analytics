I went from pale to golden brown. Iâ€™m loving the results of my St.Tropez self tanning mouse. It was easy to apply. Not messy at all. I loved how I could see instant results and after 8 hours it looked even better. As a black woman, I never thought to use self tanners but this product gives the perfect amount of sun kissed glow that you need in your life no matter your skin color! Black girl approved!
