I received this and so excited to use it. I put 4 drops into my moisturizer during my evening beauty routine and couldn’t wait to see the results the next morning. The product: The product is super lightweight and drys into your skin as fast as the moisturizer which is so great, I always find that the more creamier consistency the tan is, the longer it takes to dry. The Results: It gave me a natural glowy look. I think next time I will add another 2 drops as I like a more tanned look, but that’s why it’s so perfect, you can literally customize to be as dark/light as you like. Beautiful Natural Glow
