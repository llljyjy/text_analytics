Transfer, transfer, transfer! I have fair skin, I love the color, no streaking when using a mit and minimal smell. Putting it on before bed is a no-no (say goodbye to your bed sheets). Letting the product develop for a few hours and washing off helps a lot w/ transfer but its not 100%. I would never feel comfortable siting on light colored furniture or car seats and white garments are a nice shade of orange after wearing. Wash them quickly because the coloring will become permanent if garments are neglected It does transfer
