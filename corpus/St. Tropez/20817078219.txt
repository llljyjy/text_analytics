This tanner smells great and the skincare benefits are a cherry on top! I would still exfoliate and moisturize first for the most even tan. However, I don’t think this is the best especially for the price point. The 8 hour development is kind of annoying. I do love the tanning mitt but it’s a randomly turquoise color? Kind of off brand?
