Although Iâ€™m already brown, I like to use self tanners go even out my skin tone, give me a summer glow, and to hide small dark spots and hyperpigmentation. I generally like St Tropez products and so I was very optimistic for this one. I do like the product but I does work very slowly so it took several applications to really see a difference . Perfectly ok
