I love tanning oil/serum! Since they’re very convenient. Just mix them with your moisturizer and you’re all done. I use something like this overnight so the next day I can see the difference. This one is on warm side but takes a lot of drop to get dark compare to the other brand. It’s actually itchy on peach/butt side. I gave this 8/10. Gifted by St. Tropez. nan
