This product does absolutely nothing for my skin tone. I have a medium olive skin tone, so maybe my skin is too dark for it, but at this point, I’m treating it just like a daily moisturizing lotion and nothing else. And make sure you wear gloves or a mitt when applying because it will most definitely stain your hands! Doesn’t Work With My Skin Tone
