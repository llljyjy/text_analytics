This is my first time using a self-tanning mousse and according to some of my friends who frequently self-tan, the products they use have a fried chicken scent. Thankfully, this product didnâ€™t smell like fried chicken and instead has a tropical scent. The mousse spreads easily and left a natural tan on my skin. nan
