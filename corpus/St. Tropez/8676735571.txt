This product does not work. I’ve tried different combinations, including mixing with moisturizer, adding more drops, JUST putting the drops on without moisturizer… I look white as a ghost still. It smells good at first and then the cheesy smell comes through after about an hour and lingers for a day or two even with a shower. I’ve tried lots of St Tropez products and I always default back to the Express Tan Mousse. Very disappointed in this one :( Doesn’t work
