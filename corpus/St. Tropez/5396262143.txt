I bought this fully convinced it was going to be crap because it was a water but I was so wrong! This is by far the easiest self tanner I have ever used. The fine mist applies effortlessly so you don’t have to rub it in. Just don’t do too much more than 5 or 6 sprays for your face because it works really well and it’s easy to get too dark too fast. I haven’t been able to find a self tanner for my face that I have loved since Lancôme stop making their flash bronzer for face. I do miss that one but this tanning water is amazing. Beautiful effortless glow
