The main thing I love about this self tanner is that it just goes on like a moisturizing cream. It’s not a foam, mousse, or oil that feels wet or runny. It’s a nice, smooth cream that the skin absorbs easily and you don’t feel sticky at all. It also has a great fragrant watermelon scent! It gave my pale self the perfect subtle darker shade that I can build over time to look completely natural. Before receiving this product from Influenster I bought Sephora’s self tanning mousse trying to save money with the cheaper product despite always hearing great things about St. Tropez. Sadly Sephora didn’t compare and St. Tropez lived up to the hype. I will make the investment on this one going forward as it’s def worth it. Especially since a little goes a long way. Pleasantly surprised!
