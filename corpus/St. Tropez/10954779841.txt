As soon as I opened the bottle I was impressed. The smell was phenomenal but not overbearing. It goes on smooth and doesn’t leave a greasy feel like some “gradual tanners” I’ve used in the past. I noticed a decent change in color within about a week but it looked very natural. I would buy this product in the future but for the moisturizing properties not the tanning properties. nan
