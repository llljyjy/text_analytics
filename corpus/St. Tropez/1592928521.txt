Definitely not gradual… I thought this would be like the Jergens gradual lotion, but this comes out black. Thankfully I washed my hands immediately with Dawn and was able to get it off. Don’t think I’ll be using this daily as I’m pretty fair skinned and it’s already very dark after 1 application. It did streak a bit, but probably would haven gone on better with a mitt. They really should change the name as it’s misleading. nan
