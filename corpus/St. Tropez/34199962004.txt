Always had a problem with face sunscreens, but this one is definitely my to go one now! It gives my skin exactly this natural glow which doesn’t look like you even wearing sunscreen..I just applied it overnight as a regular serum, but you also can mix it with your skincare products which should be so convenient, I’ll try it different ways!I already love it so much! I just woke up with the amazing glow!
