I received St.Tropez Self Tan Luxe Tan Tonic Glow Drops to try out and I am absolutely in love!   It’s very easy to apply and provides a great tan color that comes out nice and even. I’m not naturally very pale and many self-timers come out looking orange on my skin but this one actually provides a nice tan color.  I definitely recommend this if you’re looking for a good even tan. Easy to use
