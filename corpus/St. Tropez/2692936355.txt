I’m loving the St. Tropez Self Tan Luxe Tan Tonic. I’m already a fan of St. Tropez products so I knew I needed to try this one. I’m super skeptical to try anything out on my face that has to do with self tanner. Let me tell you, I was so wrong. I love the way it applied on. I loved that it dried face. I was a fan of the final result as well. It wasn’t too much but at the same time you still could tell it worked. Really did love This product and will be using it all summer. New favorite summer essential
