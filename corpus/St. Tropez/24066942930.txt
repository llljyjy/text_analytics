I LOVE these tanning drops, I’m a big fan of the Luxe Whipped Mousse formula but wanted to try something that I wouldn’t have to wash off after applying. I mixed 2 droppers into 1 pump of moisturizer and I’m so happy with the results. It gives me an even natural glow that I don’t have to wash off or worry about it getting on my sheets.  It has a spa smell to it which is amazing (not cheap smelling) and my skin felt so hydrated after applying it. This is my go-to tan for the winter months! The Perfect Low Maintenance Glow!
