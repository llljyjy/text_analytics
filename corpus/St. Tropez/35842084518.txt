St. Tropes has been one of my favorite tanning brands because I always feel a natural olive color instead of orange. These drops are perfect if youâ€™re someone like me who wears a lot of makeup and uses exfoliating face wash. My face never keeps up with my body when I fake tan and these drops have made it so easy to maintain my face and match my body tan Perfect for your face!
