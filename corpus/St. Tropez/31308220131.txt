#giftedbysttropez - you know, I am a bit on the fence with this one. First off, I absolutely loved the scent and the mitt!! The mitts from St. Tropez are the best and make applying the mouse easy. But because of the formula and its hydrating properties, it takes a whole to dry down compared to others. So you just feel sticky almost all 8+ hours. When its time to wash off, so much of the colors washes away - BUT will continue to develop. Try not to stress too much. Depending of the lighting, it can also looks a tade orange but most times looks natural and pretty. Color doesn’t seem to last very long and as it fades, it becomes a bit splotchy. Eh, I just don’t know about this one.. On the fence
