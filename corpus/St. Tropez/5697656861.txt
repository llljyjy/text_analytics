This self tanner gave me the best glow. I was a little nervous because iâ€™ve never used a self tanning mouse but i absolutely loved it. It was easy to apply and went on really smoothly with the tanning mitt. I really liked how the color developed, it went on copper but turned into the most beautiful golden honey bronze on me. This is gonna be my go to before events. nan
