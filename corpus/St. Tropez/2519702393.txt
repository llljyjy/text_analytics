I’m pretty pleased with the results of this product, the whipped mousse texture feels so luxurious and it’s easy to apply with the tanning mitt. The first application was a little patchy, it was first time trying this kind of texture.  The second application went smoothly and it blended much better. Overall it’s a pretty nice product,  just wish it was less expensive. luxurious formula
