I have used this tanning serum in the past and have absolutely loved it! I couldn’t wait to get my hands on another bottle! It gives you such a nice subtle tan that is not orange or anything like that. No streaking at all but it’s does still have that tanning smell after a day which I was hoping it wouldn’t. Overall I would definitely purchase this. Love this!!
