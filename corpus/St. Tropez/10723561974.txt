As a light skin black woman I have still always been hesitant to try Self Tanning just because I never thought I needed it and didn’t know how it would look on me but I’m so glad I gave this a shot !First of all this mousse from St Tropez is so hydrating on the body, has a pleasant scent, and didn’t leave any patches or streaks at all ! I definitely recommend getting the mitt so you won’t stain your hands. This product will leave the most natural tan on your body and give you a beautiful glow! The Most Natural Tan
