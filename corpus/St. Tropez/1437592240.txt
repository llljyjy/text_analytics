I was gifted this product in exchange for my honest review. I really like how this smells and that it is non-comedogenic! I have acne-prone skin and it’s hard to find a self-tanner that won’t break out my sensitive face. Unfortunately, I didn’t see any difference in this making my skin tan, even 8+ hours after application. I’ve been applying this directly to my face morning and night for the past 4 days and I see no tan! I’ve been using a full dropper worth of product. I’m pretty fair so it usually doesn’t take much to see these tanning products work. This one was a total dud. Sadly, I wouldn’t recommend it. Their bronzing mousse is so much better! Didn’t tan my fair skin AT ALL
