Who doesn’t love some extra tan, all yesr around? I was a little hesitant to use this during summer but I wanted to get a nice glow. You have to use the mitten to be able to get a nice smooth even look. A little will go a long way- what I love was that it isn’t heavy on my skin. I also love the ingredients in it as it helps my skin rather then drying it out - some ingredients including Niacinamide, High Molecular Weight Hyaluronic Acid, Echinacea, Vitamin E. Good use
