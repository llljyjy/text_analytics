This is the worst product I have tried from St Tropez. They discontinued the old gradual tan firming lotion and replaced it with this one. It instantly sets and stains, there is nothing gradual about it. I used my hand first as this is the way I used to apply the old formula. It instantly turned my hand a greenish black seven after repeated washes. I used my mitt to apply the rest and I didnâ€™t rub in one area of my leg fast enough and same problem instant blotchy streaks. After letting it dry for 30 minutes I got dressed and it stained my clothes. WORST TANNER I HAVE EVER USED! If I could give it zero stars I would. WORST TANNER I HAVE EVER USED!
