I do my best to keep my face out of the sun due to retinol use, but that leaves my face more pale than the rest of my body. So, I really like being able to customize my self-tanner on my face to get the right shade for me. This product is very easy to use, doesn’t have an overly strong smell, doesn’t streak, and creates a really nice color. I did notice I had better results when I did not mix the drops with my moisturizer though. So, instead, I applied the tanning drops to my face and neck, washed my hands with soap and water, then went back and added moisturizer. This gave me the best self-tan results.
