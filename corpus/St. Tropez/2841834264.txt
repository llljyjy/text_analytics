I‘ve been using this free sample of Luxe Tan Tonic Glow Drops self tanner lately. The recent cold weather meant the official loss of my summer glow, so I jumped right into it. My results using St. Tropez over the years have ranged from “noooiice!” to “meh.”, but nothing awful, so I trust the brand not to turn me a weird color. Turns out, I was pretty impressed. The tanning solution is quite liquid, so as with most tanners, I recommend being careful with the dropper, though this one is pretty easy to control. It can be used in a serum or moisturizer, and I use it in my moisturizer because I can spread it better to ensure more even coverage. 2 to 6 drops are recommended, and I’m still deciding whether my own sweet spot is 3 or 4, since I like the look of both. This tanner doesn’t dry me out or make me oily, so there are no issues I need to compensate for with skincare products. The glow isn’t orange, but is slightly more bronze than my naturally more golden glow. I actually like it, and find it close to the color I try to achieve when I use bronzer, since the hyperpigmented areas on my cheeks and jawline can tan a little green and muddy with my yellow undertone. I like that it’s quite natural-looking - there is no severe change in coloration, though I’m stupidly curious about trying the maximum number of drops. What impressed me most is that it actually smells good and has no tanner stink.I have to say, I’d use this self tan again, with no hesitation. The tan level is adjustable, the coloring nice and even, and it provides a natural look. Definitely worth trying. No streaks or blotches…
