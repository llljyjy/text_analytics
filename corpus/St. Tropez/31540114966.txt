I like this product, but it has too many negatives for me to love it. I love that the watermelon scent covers the self tan smell during application and that it feels nice on my skin. I also like that it does give me a tan. However, I wish it was more gradual. I donâ€™t like how it gets very dark and unnatural looking near my joints. I also found it a bit irritating to my skin. Does what it says
