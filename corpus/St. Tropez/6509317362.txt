Used this in Palm Springs and it was my first time using tanning lotion! I felt like this was easy to use, but Iâ€™d recommend using a mitt for even application! Has a pleasing scent and super cute and easily accessible packaging. Would recommend if anyone (like me!) is taking a vacation in November! Gentle and gradual tanner
