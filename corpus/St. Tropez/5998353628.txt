St. Tropez sent me this self tanner and it’s the best I’ve used so far. A little bit goes a long way. Love the mousse texture it goes on super smooth and rubs in easily with the provided mit. My skin feels amazing and very hydrated after application. After about 8 hours you’ll notice the perfect even summer glow with no orange finish. nan
