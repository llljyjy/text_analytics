I’ve been loving this hydrating glowy serum. It’s perfect for the summer time because it very glowy and leaves my skin very even and not splotchy. It evenly coats the skin in a pretty glow and the product itself has a strong scent but it goes away immediately. I also love how customizable it is! nan
