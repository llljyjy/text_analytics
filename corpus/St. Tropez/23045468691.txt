I used self tanners years ago and stopped because I always got a fake, uneven orange result. I’ve heard good things about these drops so I decided to give them a try. I get VERY pale in winter, and I’m often asked if I’m ill, so I was looking for something that would give me a healthy glow, not necessarily a “tan.“ This product is amazing! I add a few drops to my everyday morning moisturizer or serum and get a natural looking glow ... which is exactly what I was hoping for. No weird smell, no orange color, no streaking. If results stay the same, I’ll experiment with all-over color in warmer months. Get a Non-Orange Glow
