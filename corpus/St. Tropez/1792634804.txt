These ST. Tropez self tan tonic drops are pretty easy to use. You can mix it in with a moisturizer or use them alone. I’ve used them a few times and you get a mild tan the more drops you use the deeper the tan gets. I like it, it’s not boom in your face but more of a natural tan. I like that about these drops. Thanks to St Tropez for gifting these drops. Self tan drops
