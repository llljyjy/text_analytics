I love the fact that the tonic drop has niacinamide and hyaluronic acid. I am obsessed with hyaluronic acid. I love how my skin was glowing after applying the drops on my skin. The application process was easy.  I applied like 7 drops even though it said 2-6 drops but i love being extra lol. I did get a soft tan after some hours but i really love the after glow of the drops. nan
