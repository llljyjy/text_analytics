Great product! As a nursing mom I love that the tanner was easy to use, buildable and gave a natural looking glow, while not turning my sweet baby’s face orange. It was easy to apply,left my skin feeling soft and with no residue or smell. Highly recommend as an all year staple for everyone’s beauty routine. Nursing mom friendly
