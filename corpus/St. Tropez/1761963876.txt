The St. Tropez tanning drops are perfect if you have fair skin. It gives a very natural glow. It is easy so apply. I did one pump of lotion and three drops of product per limb and it came out great. I do wish they had a darker option because I usually prefer a more intense tan. Really good for fair skin or natural glow
