St Tropez new self sun tan is amazing for the beginning of the summer. My skin is very pale and I love the golden tan that it gives me. I love the ingredients and how my skin feels moisturized after I apply it all over my body with a special mitt. It goes really easy on, I love the whipped consistency of it and doesn’t leave any streaks. It stays on for a week and doesn’t leaves any tan marks on my clothes. I’d definitely recommend it.
