I’m very pale normally, so I was pleasantly surprised that these drops provided the perfect sunkissed glow on my face. It did not leave me orange! I tend to wear less foundation these days (especially in the heat of the summer), so this allows me to have a little bit of color without going overboard and looking unnatural. It’s super easy to use - I just mixed it in with my normal moisturizer. It does give off that typical “fake tan“ smell the day you apply it, but it went away pretty quickly after that. I feel like it applied very smooth and I liked that I could customize how “tan“ I wanted to be. Overall, really loved this product! nan
