This product made my skin feel extremely soft and refreshed. It was a bit sticky at first, but once it’s washed off it leaves the skin feeling very expensive. My skin tone is naturally tan so I was curious to see how this product would work for me and, if I would see a difference. To my surprise I saw an immediate difference! It actually made me like 4 shades darker, this was the guide color. I slept with the product on overnight which probably wasn’t the best idea. I have never used a self tanner before so I hadn’t realized a ton of it would rub off in my sleep. So, it did come out a tad patchy in some areas but, because I’m already tan it’s hardly noticeable. Lastly, this product was so easy to use. I will say I am a tall woman with big hands and the mitt was very tight on me and I did end up getting it on the bottom part of my palm. But overall the application process felt extremely luxurious and relaxing. I will be using this product again and recommending it to anyone looking for a great self tanner. nan
