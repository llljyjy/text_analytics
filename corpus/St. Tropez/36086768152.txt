I was gifted these tinted drops and I wanted to love it so bad! It smells and feels amazing. However, it left some noticeable blotches on my chin each time I used it. I tried 3 separate times to make sure it wasn’t just me but each time I was left with strange shading. Otherwise it would have been amazing. I’ve seen from other reviews that it works wonders, so maybe it’s just me. Bummed
