St.Tropez tanning drops surprised me by the light color of the product. It blends smoothly into your facial moisturizer and adds an even greater moisturizing feel to your skin after applying. You can control however many drops you want to use and can even co tool where you want to add the tanning moisturizer. I’ve used it as contour for a long lasting look last weekend and loved the results. I was skeptical in the beginning because many self tanners leave you with splotches in wrinkles and dense areas and I haven’t experienced that issue. Great for that subtle glow
