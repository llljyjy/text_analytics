I received this product for free from Influenster and St. Tropez in exchange for my honest review.This is a big bottle of lotion. I love the smell. I don’t know if it is quite watermelon. As you can see in the picture I posted there is a spot on my ankle... I have showered since putting the lotion on last and don’t quite understand the spot. There weren’t many instructions so I was sure how long it takes to “gradually“ tan. I am going to wait until after winter and try again. Just not sure yet
