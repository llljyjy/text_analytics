Love how this tanner left my legs!! Iâ€™m very pale and this added such a good color with no orange finish. Love the mousse texture, it made the application so efficient. It was very easy to spread out with the mitten but you need to be quick, it does dry down fast. Overall a great tanner, it left my skin feeling very soft; I will for sure be using it all summer! What a great self tanner!
