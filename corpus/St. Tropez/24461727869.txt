I was super excited to test this foam self tanner out. Here’s my honest opinion. I love the instant bronze it gives your skin. Unlike most self tanner’s, this foam tanner is infused with some skin care that leaves your skin feeling super moisturized! Huge plus for me because most self tanner make me feel like my skin is really dry. I, myself, am not a fan of the type of applicator mitt, but it did its job,it was just a little difficult to take off and on easily while applying the self tanner. Note, a little of the foam self tanner goes a long way! Another plus for me, it has a tropical smell to it. Overall I like it and will be using again. Looking like a bronzed goddess
