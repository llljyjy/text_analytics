First time I’ve used a self tanner, and I think there’s a learning curve, but I did okay with this one! I tested it on just my legs in case I had any application issues, but it turned out looking nice. It wasn’t sticky going on, and I liked the moussey formula. I was concerned that my legs might feel/look dry afterwards—they didn’t! No transfer onto my clothes or sheets either. My skin still feels like my skin, just with a light tan. The color actually came out looking surprisingly natural. I did have a little bit of streaking on the back of my calves, which was completely user error. Now I’ve learned to pay better attention to that area next time. :) As advertised!
