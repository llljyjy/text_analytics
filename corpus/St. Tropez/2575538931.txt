This lotion went on smooth and felt like it was easily absorbed into my skin. I didn’t smell very much watermelon scent and it does have that tanning lotion smell that it seems every product has. It was a very subtle tan but I could tell on my feet and arms that it worked. I didn’t use it several days in a row to see how dark I could get. nan
