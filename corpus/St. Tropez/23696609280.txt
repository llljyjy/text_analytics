These self tanning drops are perfect for summer! I used them along with a shimmer spray to achieve the perfect glow. They’re easy to use and left my skin feeling smooth. Not to mention, the end result was wonderful! One thing I would recommend though, is to use caution during application. Your skin can get blotchty if you’re not careful. There’s an entire guide on St. Tropez’s website that is super helpful! So, enjoy your *hot girl summer* and get that summer glow!! Love this!!
