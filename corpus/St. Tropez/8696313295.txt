I’m super picky about my self tanner because I’m scared of looking orange (IRL and in pictures) but I really love the color of this one! It dries super quick and using the tanning mitt made it super easy to apply, I ran over my body twice with the mitt and didn’t have any streaks or white spots. Super pretty, deep brown color that lasts longer than most other self tanners. Deep brown, fast drying
