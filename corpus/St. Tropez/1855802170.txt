have been using St. Tropez products for over 5 years now so I was excited to try these drops. I mixed a few of them with my daily moisturizer before going to sleep. When I woke up the next morning, I had a nice natural glow. I will say, however, I noticed that after a few days of adding the drops to my moisturizer, my pores started to turn slightly brown, so that was the one bummer about these drops. Overall, they were very easy to use and I liked the color they gave me. nan
