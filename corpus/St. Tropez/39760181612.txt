Definitely a fan of the St. Tropez line !! I don’t have to do much “tanning“ because Im black but I do tend to lose a little melanin during the winter months. Gave these drops a try and I really like them, great way to maintain a little bronziness until it heats up again. Love the packaging the small dropper was super easy to use just mix in with moisturizer and apply. I didn’t notice a major change, it was very subtle and natural looking which I loved and the tan is  buildable Im assuming by how much product you use but Overall I was very impressed. It has a very light fragrance which is nice &  I didn’t experience any transferring, staining of the hands or anything like that.  Thumbs up !! nan
