I’m impressed by this! I want to preface this by saying i’m the palest person alive, so self-tanners are typically too dark or lean too orange on me. This, when applied lightly, works for me. It gives a just sunkissed glow that works very well. Unsure how great this would be if you’re looking for a more pronounced tan, though! nan
