I received this product for free. It comes in a nice glass bottle. Application is easy & you can add it to your moisturizer or just as is. You can choose how many drops to get a varied range of tan. It’s nice how you can just add it into your moisturizer. It smells amazing and doesn’t feel sticky or gross on your face. I put this on over night & woke up with a subtle difference. nan
