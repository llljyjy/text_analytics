As an avid self-tanner St. Tropez lover, I have been dying to try the St.Tropez Self Tan Luxe Whipped Creme Mousse. First of all, I love the packaging and the way the mouse comes out of the bottle is great. The application of the product was seamless and the product was smooth which allowed the mousse to blend into my skin very nicely. The consistency of the Self Tan Luxe Whipped Creme Mousse was very fluffy and creamy, once it came out of the bottle it expanded in size and was great. To apply the St.Tropez Self Tan Luxe Whipped Creme Mousse I used the St. Tropez Double Velvet Mitt to apply the self-tan and it was great. I have tried many different mitts to apply my self-tanner but so far, the St. Tropez one is my favorite. For the tan however, after I rinsed off the bronzer I wasn’t that tan, however my skin was hydrated and soft. I love pretty much all of St. Tropez’s other tanning products, so this mishap could have been user-error. I wish the tan would have developed more since the bronzer was a beautiful color on my skin. I am going to continue to use this tanner, as the application process was so easy. My suggestion would be if you buy this product- apply multiple coats if you want a nice bronze! If you are in the market looking to try a new self-tanner, I would definitely recommend this one, or any from St. Tropez’s self-tan line! A Great Summer Tan
