The St. Tropez Gradual Tan Watermelon Firming Lotion is a must-have product for creating that perfect faux tan this season! It’s a great 2 in 1, with it being a lotion, it’s super easy to apply all over and its very hydrating + nourishing for the skin. I like that it doesn’t smell like typical self-tanner. The watermelon fragrance is absolutely amazing, it smells very sweet but it’s not overwhelming. I get to customize the results of my self-tanning application gradually each day until I’m happy with the final result. The final color of the tan is very natural, no orange. And best of all, no streaks! I do recommend exfoliating the skin prior to the first application, and with each additional application it’s important to apply thin even layers to create that perfect faux tan! Perfect faux tan!
