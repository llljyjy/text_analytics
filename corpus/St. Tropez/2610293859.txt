This self tanning mousse by St. Tropez is so good!! It turns into such a natural tan on my pale skin and it does not become streaky or uneven when I use the mitt to apply. St. Tropez is my favorite self tanning brand because they do not smell terrible and stay on your skin for a few days, even with showering. I always get a really natural looking color as well that isnâ€™t orange or muddy. nan
