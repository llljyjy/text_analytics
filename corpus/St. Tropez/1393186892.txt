I’m honestly obsessed with this product. I have tried so many different self tanning products and I didn’t think I can be impressed anymore by any new products, but this foam self tanner is just on another level. First , it smells incredible and it’s doesn’t have that self tanning after smell that could be too overpowering sometimes. The texture is gorgeous. It absorbs very fast and it gives immediate beautiful glow right after applying it . It looks very natural in my skin . I’m very impressed. Also it keeps the skin hydrated and my skin doesn’t feel dry . Wow . Obsessed
