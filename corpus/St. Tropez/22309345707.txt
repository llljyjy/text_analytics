It has a nice scent unlike other bronzers I admit.  BUT I admit that I expected more from him, since even leaving it overnight, there is a lot of tan.  In addition to that he covered and smeared.  Thanks, this bronzer is quite easy to correct mistakes.  He is not my favorite.  Especially for the price.  I expected more. Good product
