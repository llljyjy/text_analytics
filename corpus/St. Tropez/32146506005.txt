Im new to self tanning as I’ve always had very sensitive skin and try not to put on unnecessary products but I’ve been wanting to self tan for a while now as I’m really pale and don’t like to damage my skin with sun. I used this product and it’s amazing!! It applied really easily and even and didn’t bother my skin at all! Would definitely recommend. It also left the most perfect and glowy tan nan
