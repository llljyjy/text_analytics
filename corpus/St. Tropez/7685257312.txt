I am very fair, have eczema, often struggle with self tanners settling into my pores & turning me an unnatural orange color. This did not turn me orange or settle into my pores, it gave me a natural glowing tan. I love that it did not reek of that awful tan smell. It also made my skin feel great! Well worth the price- donâ€™t change the formula!
