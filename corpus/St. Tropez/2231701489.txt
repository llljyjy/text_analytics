I wear spf religiously so my face is always several shades lighter than my skin. I was nervous to try out this product but went for it anyway because I liked all of the skincare ingredients it includes like niacinamide.   I mixed a few drops in with my moisturizer and am pleased with the results. I have a nice glow now and the skin tone on my face is closer in shade to the rest of my body. Nice glow
