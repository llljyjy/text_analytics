The application was easy. I put three drops on my forearm to test. The color developed nicely I could tell a difference, three drops made a settle tan without any streaks, I used my hand to apply. Unfortunately I noticed a small rash on the area I applied it to and am not going to risk putting it on my face. I will probably try it again on my arms and legs. nan
