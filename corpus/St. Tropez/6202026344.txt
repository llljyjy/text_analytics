I’m so in love with this self tanner! The color is great for my light skin and doesn’t smell terrible like other tanning products. I love that I get an instant tan AND it’s long lasting. The color lasts almost a week but I tend to exfoliate and reapply every 5 days or so. I would repurchase this! nan
