I received this product for free. The application was seamless and made my skin feel moisturized not sticky. I was surprised with how smooth it was to work the product into my skin and the glove made the experience feel much more luxurious. I am very pleased with the final result as there were no streaks and my skin looked glowy and even! The color didnâ€™t get patchy after showering and lasted a few days from applying. Love that the color can be built up to your own desired shade. Perfect Summer Glow
