Works well and saw results within a few hours of application. I would use this only a few times a week since I do feel it can start to look obviously fake if you use too many times back to back.Only thing I don’t love about the product is it had a very strong fragrance scent. It didn’t smell bad like most tanners do, but the scent just smelled like very strong perfume smell nan
