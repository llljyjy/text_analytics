First of all, genius for including a glove. Self tans have come a long way!! No more orange hands. I had amazing results that lasted 5 days without needing a touch up. I think it’s all in the prep work though. Make sure you fully exfoliate before applying. I felt the actually applying wasn’t too bad but I did enlist my husband to help get my back to ensure it was an even coating. My skin actually felt more moisturized after. Highly recommend! Best tan I’ve had in forever
