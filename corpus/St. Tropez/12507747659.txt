St Tropez gifted me this product to test, these are my honest opinions.I love how easy these glow drops are to use.They work well with my combination skin.Theycan be applied directly onto skin or mixed into lotion and then applied to skin.Easy to customize your glow from light to deep tan depending on how many drops you use.Develops a beautiful, natural, gradual tan.Does not leave a strong smell. Love!
