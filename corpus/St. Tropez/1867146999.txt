I am on the pale side and very last minute when I need to tan for vacation. This tanner is really not that gradual on me and there was an immediate noticeable difference which I love. It went on smooth and even and is more bronze than orange. I personally thought the smell was nice and not a fake watermelon smell. I was really pleased with the product and although I canâ€™t speak to the firming aspect (in general I think being tanner makes your skin look firmer), I am really pleased with the product and will definitely buy it again when I run out. great fast natural looking tan
