First of all the smell!! This smells like watermelon jolly ranchers , it’s delicious!As for the performance of the product… this is coming from someone who doesn’t self tan. I’m impressed. It’s just like putting on lotion, no different but I get a slight tan enough to notice my skin warm up. It looks really natural nothing drastic. I was afraid I would look orange but I don’t. Another thing that’s cool is I don’t need a tanning mitt , that’s something that seems like a lot of work worry about streaks etc . But this is nothing like that . I’ll be getting another one when this runs out. Easy tan that smells like heaven!
