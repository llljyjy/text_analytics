I’ll start by saying that I have used EVERY self tanner out there. I always struggle with using tanner on my face because they usually wash off the next day. I don’t think my skincare routine is overly aggressive but who knows. This self tanner didn’t last either, unfortunately. I even tried just applying it directly to my face before moisturizer, etc, and it still washed off the next day. I am also very pale, like almost see-through pale, so you would think that some colour would stay, but no. However, I do like the colour it develops into. It may work for some, but not for me. I returned it. Fades Away Quickly
