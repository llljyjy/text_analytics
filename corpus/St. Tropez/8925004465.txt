I received this product complimentary from St. Tropez and it smells amazing! I’m honestly so impressed at how easy it is to use, blend, and doesn’t transfer! I applied it with a brush and buffed it into my skin and there are no streaks. I love that these tanning drops have niacinamide and vitamins which make this an easy staple in my skincare routine, and has never caused irritation in my skin. It takes a few hours to show but I’m glowing! Easy to use!!
