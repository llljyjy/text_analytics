Fantastic product! I use foaming fanned all summer long and it just doesn’t work on the face, it’s splotchy and strange looking. I’ve tried serums, that work but you have to use them every single day. I could never find something that would tan my face for even close to the same length as my body without the splotchiness, but THIS DOES! I’m on day 6 and while it has faded quite a bit, there is still color. It’s even and not orange at all. I didn’t really have high hopes for it as I do not care for St. Tropez foam tanner but this is magic.  I mix like 3-6 drops in to my moisturizer to use it and that’s all it takes so this bottle should last a long time, hopefully it doesn’t lose effectiveness as it ages. FINALLY
