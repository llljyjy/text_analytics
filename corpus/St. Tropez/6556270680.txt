This was gifted / free by st. Tropez and his was my first time trying tanning drops and I was really nervous. I did a patch test the night prior but didn’t think it would give me any results that I actually wanted because I’ve heard the horror stories. The next morning to my surprise it gave me a tan however it was more orange than what I would like. For reference I am asian so I have some color to me already. I applied it like lotion and it was also patchy. Application is easy and smooth but not too fond of the color might try again as it was my first time. Patchy and orange ?
