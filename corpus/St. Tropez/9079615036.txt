I have really been getting into self tanning lately to have that sun kissed glow without the harmful, skin damaging rays from the sun.  I started with the St Tropez Luxe Tan Tonic Drops for my face to get a nice healthy glow in early spring.  Now that shorts and tank top weather is here, it was time to use some self tanner on the rest of my body, especially my legs!!  I really liked having the tanning mitt to apply the mousse because I don’t have to worry about getting the dreaded dark tan between my fingers anymore. It applies evenly and doesn’t leave any streaking. It leaves a nice natural tan that doesn’t look orange like others I’ve tried.  It does take some time to dry down completely, especially in my humid climate, but the end result is so worth it.  Definitely recommend. Natural glow
