I’ve used this product over the past few weeks and I am in love! It’s a beautiful gradual but noticeable self tanner. It has a wonderfully yummy watermelon scent without being overpowering. I noticed a significant difference on the first use! It’s very hydrating and has replaced my nighttime/after show moisturizer. It’s a beautiful glow without being orange and doesn’t stain my hands with a quick wash after applying. It’s really wonderful! A must have in my every day routine!
