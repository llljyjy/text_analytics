Really impressed with this! I’m a “lazy“ self-tanner and prefer to use gradual formulas which is why this one is so easy and nice to use. I add four-ish drops to my lotion and it gives me a beautiful tan. I haven’t experienced any orange-ness either and it has a light, pleasant scent. Would recommend! Lovely gradual tanner!
