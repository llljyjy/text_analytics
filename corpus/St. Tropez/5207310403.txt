I have never self tan before so I was pleasantly surprised when I tried out this product. I honestly had anticipated that I was going to look orange but I actually looked so naturally Sunkist like even better than when I would just get a regular tan from the beach. what I like about this product is that it doesn’t smell bad and  it’s super natural looking! nan
