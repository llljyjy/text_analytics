ive been trying this out for about a week or so and ive got to say i really like this stuff ! It doesnt have a tanner smell at all it actually smells really good , its very lightweight oil its not sticky at all and the tan it leaves is so pretty ! Its not orange or too olive its the perfect shade . I would highly reccomend trying this ! Pretty tan glow !
