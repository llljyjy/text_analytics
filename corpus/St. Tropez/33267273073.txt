I received the product as a gift in exchange for my opinion. I like that the product is easy to use and it gives a natural glow to my skin. They can be used alone or mixed with a moisturizer. I added a few drops to the moisturizer and the color was barely noticeable. The color will be easier to see if you use the product alone. By adding more or fewer drops, the tan level can also be changed. The more drops you use, the deeper the glow. Amazing
