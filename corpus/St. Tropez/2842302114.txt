I loveeeee these! First impressions: the smell was so nice and not like normal self tanning products and since you’re mixing with your normal moisturizer you can barely tell it’s being used which is a win for me. I can’t stand the smell of normal self tan so those two characteristics made this my new fav face self tanning drops! And I’ve tried so many! It also gave such a natural glow - not fake or orange looking at all! nan
