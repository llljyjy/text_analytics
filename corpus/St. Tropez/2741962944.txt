I am very pale and love a good self tanner. I love the idea of it being a daily lotion. The consistency was a little too thin for me. Once I got the hang out how this lotion applied, I was able to apply it in a way that it wasn’t splotchy. It does wear off kind of splotchy after you stop using it. I did like the scent of the lotion. I didn’t like that when I worked it, it seemed to rub off in a few spots. Overall, I enjoyed this product. nan
