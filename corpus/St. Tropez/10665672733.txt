This was my first time trying a self tanner and I was so happy I got to try this product out. I love it, the application process was so easy it blends so nicely and the mitten is perfect to blend and a good size. After the 8 hours I rinse it off and my skin looked so healthy and had such a natural glow. I love the color. I will definitely continue to self tan now Iâ€™m hooked. So natural love the glow !
