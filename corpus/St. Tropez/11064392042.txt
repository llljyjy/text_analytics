I have never tried any tanning products before as I am a brown woman LOL but I have been seeing a lot more people of color trying out tanning products to even out their skin tone. I am super excited that the St. Tropez tanning mousse was my first product to try this stuff is really really amazing it smells so freaking good. It was also super easy to use I was kind of overwhelmed at the idea of how to use the product as I have never used any tanning products before but it was extremely easy. I made sure to exfoliate and moisturize my skin prior to applying this product and i now have such a beautiful bronze glow! Love it!! Beautifully bronzed
