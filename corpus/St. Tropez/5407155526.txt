I’ve been buying from Sephora for ten years and have never left a review, but I’ve come to share the gospel with you in regards to this product lol.  I deeply, deeply regret not taking a before photo of my skin, because the results are spectacular.  I’ve always loved getting all bronze-y in the summer, but as thirty gets closer, I have more reservations about being out in the sun.  I don’t want wrinkles!  I never saw myself as someone that would ever consider self-tanner, but I’m glad I tried this stuff.  I lotioned myself up before application, especially around the knees, elbows, and feet, and my tan came out so natural and pretty after four hours.  I’m seriously impressed.  The smell is also very subtle and pleasant; there’s no chemical odor to it at all.  I’ll be buying this stuff for the rest of my life until something better comes along. Very Natural
