Oh my goodness!! This Self-Tan serum smells divine and it feels quite luxurious on my skin. A great consistency that creates hydrated, dewy skin on top of its self-tan effects.  I really like that you can dilute the product & scale how deep the tan gets by putting more or less drops. A summer must have! smells & looks like paradise
