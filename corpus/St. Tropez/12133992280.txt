I have a love/hate relationship with this product, I love how it looks when it’s developed and how easy it is to apply (so much easier than a foam tan).  But I have to use 2-3 FULL syringes to make it show up. The product info says 2-6 drops, I originally tried and it did nothing. But it’s great for face, so I’ll be using it mostly for that! nan
