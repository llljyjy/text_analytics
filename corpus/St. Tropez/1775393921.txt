Love how easy you can use this product. You can either mix it in with a moisturizer, sunscreen, lotion or use it as is. I do 1-2 drops for something super light, not too crazy and gives me a light subtle dark glow. There is a small fresh fragrance scent to it, so if you’re sensitive to scents, this might not be for you. I haven’t tried any other glow drops so I don’t have anything to compare to but so far I really like this product! It’s really easy to use. Nice subtle tan!
