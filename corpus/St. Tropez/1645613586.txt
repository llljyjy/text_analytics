The St. Tropez Self-Tan Luxe Whipped Créme Mousse gave me a beautiful “I just got home from vacation” glow! I applied the mousse directly on one leg and quickly spread the product in circles using the double sided luxe tan applicator mitt, then repeated the process on the second leg. Once I felt confident that I knew I was doing I did my arms, chest, stomach, lower back, and only needed a little bit of help to get between my shoulder blades. For the hands I recommend creating a claw and just using the excess product so that you don’t end up with hands that are too dark. Honestly it saved me so much time and a trip to the tanning salon. The tanning mitt is an absolute must, you simply wash it with soapy water after you’re done applying to the body and it looks like new! You will notice a difference immediately and the tan gradually develops throughout the day. I don’t recommend wearing white immediately after tanning because it will stain your clothes, and just like most tanning products have a distinct scent, this one does too. The tan lasts several days so definitely worth it! Make sure to exfoliate in the shower before applying on clean / moisturized skin! Did you just get back from vacation? Summer Glow!
