I have never tried a mousse self tanner before I usually stick the the water Baer ones, so I was intrigued buy this product as St Tropez is super well known and is supposed to have amazing products. This one had the added benefits of skincare which is amazing! Application was easy and quick with their mitt. My skin felt smooth and soft after I washed it off and it also didnâ€™t have the as strong of a scent like most self tanners do! Color came out not to dark, looked very natural and bronzy not orange. Definitely want to try their water based tanner now! Bronzy Goddess with No Fake Tan Smell
