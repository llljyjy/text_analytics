Let me start by saying that I am not a self-tanner girl. I e always wanted to be, but every time I have tried I have ended up orange, splotchy, uneven or a combination of the three. This tanner was so easy to use and left me looking so naturally bronzed and glowing! I canâ€™t get over how beautiful my tan looks. I will definitely use it again! nan
