This is such a great self tanner! It’s a mousse and very easy to apply. There are no streaks either which is amazing. It develops pretty quickly and has very even coverage. It doesn’t dry out my skin like some other tanners do. I’d highly recommend if you’re looking for a new tanner. The mitt is amazing also! Love this tanner!
