I absolutely love these tan drops! They are so easy and fuss-free to apply. I simply add a few drops to my face  moisturizer, apply, wash my hands thoroughly and voila.It gave me an even, natural looking tan. My face is usually lighter than my body, due to exfoliants I use. These drops help me even out the difference and best of all: they donâ€™t smell bad, as other tanning products can at times.Highly recommend! Easy use and even, natural color
