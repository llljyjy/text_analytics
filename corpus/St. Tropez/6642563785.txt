perfect mousse formula for a pretty summer glow!! I wish the color had been a bit deeper for 8+ hours of wear but it wasn’t streaky or orange-y so I can’t complain too much! It smells pretty good for a self tanner, so it wasn’t uncomfortable to wear all day. And it didn’t stain my white sheets when I tried wearing it over night! This was particularly important because I hate the way that self tanner feels on the skin so I prefer to wear it when I’m sleeping lol Comfortable, but I wish it developed deeper!
