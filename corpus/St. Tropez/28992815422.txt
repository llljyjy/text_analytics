I live the way this product smells! My skin tone is a light olive, and applying this product only once was enough to get a nice tan. Just donâ€™t be like me and use gloves! My fingers were stained for over a week! And be very careful and apply it evenly! This product is very nice for anyone trying to even out their t shirt sunburn or just to add some color during winter! This was my first time using a self tanner and it was an interesting experience! Will use as needed! First time using a self tanner!
