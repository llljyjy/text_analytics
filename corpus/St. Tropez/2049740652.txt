Well I just wrote an entire review and lost it due to the Sephora app bugs.Just take my word from a pale Irish girl who has self tanned for 20 years - this is a fantastic product. I use this when I need a same day tan but don’t want to worry about getting water spots or sweating. I typically use the non-express version overnight as it can be more forgiving. Just follow the normal self tan recommendations by exfoliating the day before not shaving the day of application and lightly moisturizing hands feet elbows and knees.Also don’t worry about leaving it on more than three hours, I have left it on overnight when I want a super dark glow. I usually use this one on “fresh” skin after the previous tan is removed and will use the gradual tanner or the regular mousse to maintain.You definitely need to use with a mitt (in case you were wondering..)I’ve read the other reviews and I think most of them are user error. My favorite! Best same day glow, no fear of water!
