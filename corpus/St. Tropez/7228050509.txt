This self-tanner is absolutely amazing. It gives the perfect color, it’s easy to apply and it’s also super moisturizing. It smells heavenly and I love the applicator mitt too! I will definitely be using this all year round. I have fair skin and it still gives me a good color to where I don’t feel too dark, but I also feel like I am getting enough color! I love it so much. Can’t beat the price either! Amazing Tanner!
