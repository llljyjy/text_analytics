I love this self tanner, also tried face drops from st tropez, absolutely wonderful too! No streaks, natural looking color, easy to apply! It does not have a tanner smell when applying the product, however, it does come through once it starts developing. I received this tanning mousse and the applicator mitt for review purposes and can def recommend it! nan
