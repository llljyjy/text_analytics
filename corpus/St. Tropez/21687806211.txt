St. Tropez glow drops are now my new favorite way to self tan.Easy just drop into a lotion or even face moisturizer and you’re well on your way to a nice glow.I love that you can use this on your face - since it comes in a dropped you can be a little more lenient on how much you’re using on your face/body.It doesn’t leave you streaky, like at all!Being able to use my own hydrating lotion is a big win since I have a few favorites I LOVE.I got a lot of compliments on how soft and golden my skin looked. Big fan all around! Best Glow Drops you can buy!
