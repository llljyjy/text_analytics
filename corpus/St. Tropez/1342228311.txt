I wanted to love them and had high hopes, as I’ve tried tanning drops from another brand before and had a great experience. These fell a little short. I’ll explain below. Pros: these smell amazing, are lightweight and have skincare properties. They are easy to use and result in a very natural looking tanCons: they just aren’t dark enough. The tan while natural, is so subtle, even with adding the max drop to the lotion and applying daily. I have medium / olive skin tone already, so perhaps these will work better for someone with a lighter skin tone. I hope the come out with a ‘dark’ option, I would love to try it again but these drops simply don’t add enough pigment and aren’t long lasting for it to be worth it for me. I used all over my body and face, and tried multiple times and just didn’t see much color difference. nan
