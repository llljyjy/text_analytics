This was my first time trying a tanning mousse with a mitt, and wow was it easy! I was a bit shocked when I saw how dark and orange the product was on application, but it turned into a beautifully natural tanned shade once I washed it off. I applied this to my legs before bed and wore black pants, I’m not sure if it would rub off or be messy otherwise, but I wouldn’t be surprised. I did work quickly in smaller sections, it seemed to dry quickly and was harder to smooth out. Overall I enjoyed the experience and will keep using it! nan
