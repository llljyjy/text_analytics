I haven’t used self tanners before but I am a fan of the St. Tropes Self Tan drops. It was simple to use as I just included 2 -4 drops in my moisturizer in the morning. It takes a couple of hours for the tan to develop I I don’t mind as it looks more natural this way. The serum glides on your face and isn’t sticky which I was thankful for. It feels super smooth and easy to blend. Easy Use Self Tanner
