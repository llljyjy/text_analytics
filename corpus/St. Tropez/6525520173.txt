This is a product I was a little nervous for. Self tanners can be VERY hit or miss-  but this one was good! The color guide color is nice and isn’t too gray or green which is always a plus. The smell isn’t too obnoxious and the final result color is natrual! Would recommend. Would suggest to a friend!
