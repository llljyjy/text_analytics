I self-tan pretty regularly and St Tropez always has a nice undertone for my skin color. I really love these tanning drops because itâ€™s easy to mix in with my moisturizer for my face and neck rather than trying to rub a tanning mitt all over my face. Overall, I think it gives me a really nice color. All is good with my skin moisturizer. nan
