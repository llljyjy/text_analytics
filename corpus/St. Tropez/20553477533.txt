I have used the St. Tropez tanning mousse before and love it so no surprise that this product is also amazing! First off, the smell is light and very clean-smelling. I mix a couple of drops into my nighttime moisturizer and wake up glowy and very moisturized. I love that this product really adds to the hydration!! I also noticed that it helped to even out my skin tone. Overall LOVE this product. LOVE!
