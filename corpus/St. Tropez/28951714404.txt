These are a great way to easily get a nice glowy look. I love that it has nice skincare ingredients such as niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, echinacea, acerola cherry extract which has vitamins c&e. Iâ€™ve been mixing this with a moisturizer but you can use them alone as well! The more drops equals deeper glow. I usually add 3 drops to moisturizer for a light glow. I definitely recommend! Glowing is easy
