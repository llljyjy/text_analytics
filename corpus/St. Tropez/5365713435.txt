I tried this because of all the great reviews. It gives you a natural glow, but along with that it makes your skin SO oily. I have dry skin, and when I used it my face looked like a dunked my face in a bucket of oil both the day of use, and the day after. I never have blocked pores, but using this I ended up with two huge blocked pores on my nose. Absolutely not worth the money, I ended up returning it. Breakouts, breakouts, breakouts..
