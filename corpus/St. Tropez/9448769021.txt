Although I didnâ€™t need the product for tanning because I am brown skinned. I still believe it did a good job. The appearance was very catching to the eyes. The smell of watermelon was just right, not overpowering. I could feel the firmnesses as well. The bottle was a nice size with a good amount for usage.  I received this product complimentary.
