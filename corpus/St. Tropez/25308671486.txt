This was given for free by St Tropez but all thoughts and opinions are my own. I’ve never used self tanner before and wanted to give it a try. I’ve always been a bit hesitant because it seemed complicated but it was really easy! The color was not orange or too tan but looked really subtle and lasted a week or week and a half. Loved it! nan
