This is a pretty good product.  I did not notice much color until several applications later.  I used it several nights in a row. And let it set in over night.  Making sure it was completely rubbed in. After a few nights I did see a nice bronze tint to my legs which is what I was hoping for.  The scent is not unpleasant.  I now use on my arms as well.  It’s a nice product to use during the winter months when there isn’t much sun in NY. Good product
