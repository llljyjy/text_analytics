It’s a great color once you apply it on  & does not small funky BUT does not last like reviews say it will stain your clothes and your sheets it will wash away as soon as you shower you need to constantly reapply to look good, I’ve been using St. Tropez products for years and always loved it especially the build up one that they don’t offer anymore this one you just washing away your money not worth the price! Not as good as presented ! Wash away your money…
