I have really light skin and I don’t like sun tanning but I love the healthy glow of a tan. So over the past few years I’ve been on the hunt for the perfect self tanner. Unfortunately I’ve had many streaky tans, especially when it comes to the lotion gradual tanners. I was skeptical but excited. I also LOVE anything watermelon scented so this had my name on it! I’ve only used this a few times since it’s fall and I’m bundled up most of the time. However I had a warm outdoor wedding to attend and tested this a few times before the event. This applies effortlessly! I did not have any streaks on my legs and I also didn’t get the annoying tan marks on my hands. I love the watermelon scent. There still is a little bit of “self tanner” scent but it isn’t overpowering. Usually with lotion gradual tanners it takes a few days to develop, however I reached the shade I wanted the next day! I haven’t applied multiple days in a row because I didn’t want to be too tan for November. I definitely will during the summer though! As far as firming.. I can’t attest to that but I honestly do not think that any lotion can firm the skin so I ignore that claim. This is $29 which I think is pretty reasonable for a self tanner. I would definitely look for a sale but I can see a repurchase in my future!! I will also tell everyone I know to check this out!! ☀️ Easy to apply!
