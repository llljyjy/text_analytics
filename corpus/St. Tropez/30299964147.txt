This tan serum really was impressive- I’ve tried other drops like this before and they’re okay, but this product feels different upon application- it is the consistency of a soft gel and applies smoothly and evenly/ it leaves a gorgeous healthy glow and I honestly just mix it into my moisturizer for a whole body tan- Definitely a must try if you love a golden glow! Say Yes to the Tan Drops!!!!!
