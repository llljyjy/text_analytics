I received this product complimentary from St. Tropez in exchange for my honest review. The first thing I noticed about this product is that it smells really nice! It has a refreshing watermelon scent that isn’t too overpowering. I also appreciate that the bottle itself is rather large. I really like how gradual and natural the tan looks on my skin, especially as we approach the winter months. I wouldn’t say I’m a pro at using at home, self-tanners but I’m getting better with practice. I will say to make sure you rub in the product evenly and follow the directions thoroughly so you don’t end up with streaking. nan
