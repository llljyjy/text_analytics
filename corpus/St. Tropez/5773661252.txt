I have not really used self tanning products before in the past, but wow! Iâ€™m so glad I tried this, because I might have to put it into my routine now. Not only is it really easy to use and apply, but I have gotten so many compliments on my tan and it has lasted more than 24 hours! It is definitely perfect for these summer months and will purchase again. nan
