Lotion is a deceiving name! It’s more like a liquid version of the mousse. I assumed lotion so right away put it on my hand and started applying to my leg. I immediately thought, “oh no!“ My hands were stained and it was not applying evenly. It was a little better with my mitt but I would still... It’s not that even. I will go back to using mousse as it’s much easier to blend. Not a lotion!
