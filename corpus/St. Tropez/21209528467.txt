I finally splurged on this product and I regret it. I like the color and smell and speed of color development, but it only lasts ~3 days before getting splotchy! it fades very unnaturally even with proper care, and it is very hard to exfoliate iff for some reason! have found other cheaper alternatives that last a full week and look natural not worth the hype
