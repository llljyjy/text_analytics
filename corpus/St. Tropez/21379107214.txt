I’ve been using this product for a few weeks now to give it a full honest review. My first impressions were I love the packaging, consistency, and smell of the lotion. It smells amazing and goes on easily and smooth. I absolutely love the nice Sunkist glow it gives even on my Texas skin. Now for the bad, as with most sunless tanners it leaves streaks and as the tan is fading leaves white streaks. I meant to take a picture of a spot on my leg to show how it fades and streaks. I can’t imagine applying too many coats with this due to the streaking. For me this product is a no but i definitely loved trying it. Wasn’t a love for me
