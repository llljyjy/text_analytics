Wow I absolutely LOVED this tanning mousse! It was easy to apply and the tanning mitt worked wonderfully. The color developed really well during the 8 hrs. It was not too uncomfortable leaving it on for so long. I definitely recommend this if you want a sun kissed glow but donâ€™t want to be out in the sun all day. Loved this
