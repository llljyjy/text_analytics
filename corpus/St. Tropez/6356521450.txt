This is my first time trying out self-tanner and I am very pleased with the results. I enjoyed how simple and straightforward the directions were.  the application glove was very snug and kind of uncomfortable when applying the product. But, the mousse was very lightweight and blended like a dream into my skin. There wasnâ€™t any patchiness or anything, so that was also refreshing.  After 8 hours I love the results! I now have an even complexion. Beginner Friendly
