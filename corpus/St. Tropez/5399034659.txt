Iâ€™m a self-tanner novice and this is pretty foolproof! Easy to apply evenly with the mitt, and the shade looks pretty natural on my very pale skin. No orange tones! Only complaint is that it does take some time to dry down. I had to wait about 15 minutes before I felt it had dried down enough to put clothes on. Good for beginners, takes a while to dry.
