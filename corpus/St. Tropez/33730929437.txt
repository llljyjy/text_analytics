I was gifted this item in exchange for my honest opinion. This was my first time ever using a self tanner and the experience was quite nice. The tanner itself has a pleasant scent and is fast absorbed. My skin was not sticky afterwards and I did not notice any staining of my chair or sheets. I do have a tendency to cross my legs therefore there was this one area that was uneven compared to the rest of my legs but its my own fault. As directed, I washed my hands well after application and had no issues. I used it twice with a one day break in between and thought the tan I got looked very natural though slightly on the yellow side, I did not use it more often so I canâ€™t comment on how dark it will go. It faded nicely over the course of 1 week. Overall I am pleased with this experience and recommend this product, will definitely use/buy again in the future. Photos are: 1. After 1 use, 2. After 2 uses, unfortunately can only add 2 photos but you can tell a subtle difference between the two photos, the second one with a better tan Pleasantly surprised
