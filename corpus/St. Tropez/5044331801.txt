I am someone with fair-light skin who has never used a self tanner before and honestly I was scared to in case it’s way too dark or splotchy/streaky. But the reviews for this product made it sound foolproof, so I wanted to enter the “self-tanning scene“ with these drops to use primarily for my body. I started with my legs and used 2 drops on each calf and two more on each thigh mixed in with my watermelon-scented lotion. After a few hours, I will say that I did notice a SUBTLE difference - the kind of difference you’d get if you were hanging out on a sunny day for a couple hours and you’re a paler person, not a burn or a dark tan, but just a little more color. For me, this is totally fine. It brought my legs from ghostly to “I have been outside“ levels of tan lol. However, if you’re looking for something more extreme and you’re already more medium-toned, maybe this wouldn’t be for you or you’d need to use more drops. I had no issues with smell, transfer, or staining my hands/legs in any weird way, and no irritation. I’m definitely going to keep using and see how it layers over several days, since it seems very natural and buildable and hard to “mess up“. Glad to have tried it! Very natural, subtle, easy to use
