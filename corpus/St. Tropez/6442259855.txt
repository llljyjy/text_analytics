This is my fist successful experience using self tanner! I absolutely love the formula of this product. It’s goes on evenly with the mitt, no streaks. I also really appreciate the actual color it develops into. It’s not orange at all! I’m pretty fair skinned, so I definitely do not want to look orange! It looks natural too, like I sat in the sun! I did not experience any staining on my clothes or sheets which is great! I would definitely recommend this for a self tanning beginner, it’s pretty fool proof! This is a 5 star product for sure!!! Great product for beginners & pros
