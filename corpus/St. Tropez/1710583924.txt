Iâ€™ve never tried a self tanner so I was nervous doing it myself! This stuff is SO easy to use! The foam easily dispersed and made it really blend into the skin flawlessly. I used a mitt with it and it made for blended, natural coverage with no streaks or stains to my hands! This stuff is great!! nan
