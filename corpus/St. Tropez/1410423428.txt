This really does develop and nice gradual tan! I received compliments on looking tan. And it’s easier than a whole self-tan application, it’s just lotion! I will say, it is still a little smelly like all tanning products. I wouldn’t put this on before going out, but it’s just fine for around the house or before bed. Be sure to wash your hands after putting it on! I didn’t wash the heel of my hands well enough and they turned a little orange. Easy way for a natural glow
