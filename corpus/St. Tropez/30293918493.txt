I adore how these drops do not stain my clothes and also absorbs well while tanning my light skin. I would put a few drops into my moisturizer. because it helps the color blend so naturally. It doesnâ€™t smell either and the color does not transfer onto clothing.  Perfect to white skin Good for really white skin
