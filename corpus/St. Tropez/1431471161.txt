I’ll start by saying this was mostly easy to apply and looks pretty good after two applications. Unfortunately, based on all the reviews here saying otherwise, I assumed this self-tanner would not have that familiar overpowering odor that pretty much all self-tanners have but it definitely does. It smells just as strongly and just as gross as every other self-tan product but the hundreds of “incentivized” reviews here would like you to believe otherwise. Very disappointing to not be able to trust reviews here anymore because it seems like 99% of them are people that got the product for free and don’t give an honest rating. Don’t be fooled - smells bad just like every other
