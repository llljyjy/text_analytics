The smell is way better than most tanner, I’ll give it that. BUT even leaving it on overnight, there isn’t much of a tan (and I’m pretty pale). It also transfers and smears big time. I put my hand on my arm and woke up with an orange hand and a handprint on my arm. Luckily, this tanner is pretty easy for fixing mistakes. Not my favorite. Especially for the price. I expected more. won’t repurchase
