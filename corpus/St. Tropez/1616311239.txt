These tanning drops feel so luxe! The application process is simple - I just added 4 drops into my body lotion & applied to my legs. After 8 hours I had a subtle, natural glow without any weird lines of demarcation where the self tanner was applied. I’ve tried a lot of tanning products throughout the years, and this is one of the most natural I’ve tried. I’m going to try adding more drops next time to get some deeper color. My skin felt extra soft after using the tanning drops & overall the color looked like my skin, just with added color & glow. Natural tanning drops that smell so good!
