This is my first time trying out a tanning product, so I was a little nervous, but honestly Iâ€™m glad that it was this product. The application was really easy, I added three drops to my moisturizer, mixed the two products and then applied it. This left my face with a natural glowy tan and helped even out the tone of my skin. nan
