I’ve never tried a self tanner before I was very impressed by the beautiful scent and soft application of the product. I love that it came with a cute applicator mitt. ILove that it wasn’t sticky at all which was my fear. I have darker skin tone, this lasted about a week for me personally. Would definitely try again. Love this self tanner!
