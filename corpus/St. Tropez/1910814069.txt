I’ve tried a few self tanners before, but this one stands out to me for a few reasons! The mousse effect is super fun and easy to blend in. It dries quickly so you need to act fast, but I don’t have any streaks or obvious lines. It settled in nicely for the 8 hours I wrote it (didn’t stain any clothing or transfer anywhere) and as soon as I washed it off I noticed my skin felt super smooth and moisturized! My tan today looks great and is super even and glowy. The scent is not super gross either, but after 8 hours of wear I did slightly have a headache but honestly that’s pretty normal for all self tanners to have a strong scent. Overall I love this self tanner! Excited to be tan all summer long! My skin is tan & soft!
