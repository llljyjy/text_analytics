I was skeptical about any tanning lotion but after using the st tropez watermelon gradual tan lotion, iâ€™m surprised to see a clear difference. I did it on one leg only to see if it will actually do anything and wow, blown away by the quick and lasting results! Wash your hand after using though because it made my palm darker haha. Smells good and effective!
