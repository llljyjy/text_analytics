I love the smell to this! I’ve never tried a self tanner as I’m naturally tan so it was interesting just to see that subtle change that didn’t then you orange. It’s currently winter in my state so I couldn’t really wear it outside and see how it handled. But I’m excited to try it once summer ones !#complimentary #sttropezgradualglow #sttropeztan @Influenster @sttropeztan Smells good, can build up!
