This self tanner is incredible. I definitely prefer mousse foam self tanners vs. spray tanning/drops/etc. This is SO easy to apply and blend into my skin. It doesnâ€™t leave me looking orange at all and I love how it came with a mitt. Make sure to let it fully dry before putting your clothes on or it might stain your clothes/sheets. nan
