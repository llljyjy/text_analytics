3 words - buy this now. This is the first self tan product that I have tried that does not have that awful lasting smell. It has a fresh, almost perfume like smell. You can use the drops alone or with lotion, I tried them alone and had great results ! By the time I woke up the next morning after about 8 hours, I had a nice, smooth, non-blotchy glow. I canâ€™t recommend this product enough!!!! AMAZING
