St. Tropez Self Tan Luxe Whipped Creme Mousse is my new favorite self tanner! A little bit of product goes a long way, so the bottle lasts longer. It goes on soft and very pigmented, so you can keep track of where you already applied. The application was easy. It dried quickly so I was able to put on dark clothing, and waited eight hours to rinse off. Even after rinsing off, the tan was still there. Three days later, and my tan still looks great. I will be purchasing again! Easy to apply and tan stays!
