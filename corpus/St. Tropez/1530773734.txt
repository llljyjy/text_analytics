I have been a fan of the drops for a long time, but this variation has been my favorite. It gives a non-sticky delivery and dries quickly. The color developed over time and was a really beautiful shade - not orange or muddy. It also seemed to give me glowing skin, not just tanned skin. Very pleased! My fav tanning drops
