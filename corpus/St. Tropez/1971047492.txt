Excited to see that the ST tropez - Luxe Tan Tonic Glow drops do not stain my clothes and also absorbs well while tanning my pale skin. It does go on evenly, and is totally buildable ! After 4 hours, I immediately saw a darker shade in my skin tone. Very impressed it can be applied on your face (without breaking out ) and full body too. Tan did not transfer into clothes, so thatâ€™s a huge plus! I love the scent as it is a very light soothing summer beach-like scent. Perfect for fall & winter ! Luxury tanning experience at home !
