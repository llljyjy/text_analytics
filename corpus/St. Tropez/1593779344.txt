The product itself works in gradually turning your skin to a light tan and it does have a pleasant scent. Reapplying daily will darken the tan, however, I recommend washing your hands immediately after use or using a glove to apply as it will turn your hands orange. I would also recommend having a slight tan prior to using or you will have a slight orange tint to your skin. Works
