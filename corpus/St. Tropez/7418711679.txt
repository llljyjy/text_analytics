I wanted to try this because I use St. Tropez for my body’s tan. This product is perfect for my midwest winter gals! The serum itself doesn’t have the typical fake tan smell, and it’s not as thick and doesn’t feel as oily (like pore clogging oily) as other face tanning oil drops I’ve used. I think the size is the perfect amount and the applicator is unique. Overall would recommend 10/10! perfect for winter
