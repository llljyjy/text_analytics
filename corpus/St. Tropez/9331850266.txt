Pleasantly surprised by this! Dropper was easy to use and I liked that I was able to decide how much of a tan I wanted based off how many drops I used. I liked that the tanner has hyaluronic acid in it, which is what I think made my skin feel so great the next morning.  It does have a fragrance, but it smells nice. Great product!
