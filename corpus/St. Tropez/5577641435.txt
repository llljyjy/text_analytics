I used plenty of other self-tanners before, but this is the first one that didn’t have that typical self-tanner scent when applying, which I appreciated. It was easy to apply and I didn’t notice any streaking. I applied it at night and slept in it and didn’t experience any transferring which is a huge plus. I do however wish it left a bit of a darker tan, but overall t I’d recommended. nan
