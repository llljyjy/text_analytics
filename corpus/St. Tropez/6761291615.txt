I am not a frequent user of any tanning solutions since I have always heard that they leave patches on your face/body but I have always loved the idea. I’m so happy that I have chosen St. Tropes drops. I mixed 5 drops into my moisturizer and left it on overnight. In the morning when I washed this “mixture” off I was left with a subtle yet such a nice tanned skin color. Definitely will be recommending it to everyone! Amazing!!!
