The St. Tropez Luxe Tan Tonic Glow Drops have been a great way to boost a little bit more radiance and color onto my ever-so-ghostly fair skin. I have never used this before, so I was a little apprehensive at first. I was extra cautious since it takes a little bit of trial and error to figure out how many drops will work for your skin. I started with just two drops in my moisturizer, since I thought that it was going to be more impactful, but it wasnâ€™t until I ended up doing a repeat application that I actually started to see some color. It has an alluring and luxurious fragrance that might be a little heavy for those who are sensitive, but once settled into the skin, it was barely detectable. I like the glass dropper, which makes it easy to dispense, and I think I will get a fair amount of uses out of this bottle as well considering I only like a soft tan look. Simple Tanning + Skincare
