I had never used self tanner before I purchased this product and from the very first application it was perfect! The tan is not streaky if applied with a mit and I even found that is perfect for face when applied with a dense brush. My only complaint would be that the color is very light and may take a few applications, just something to note if you are looking for a darker tan. Overall, this is an AMAZING self tanner to keep me bronzed and glowing nan
