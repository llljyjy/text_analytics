It love how easy it was to customize the shade of the tan by adding more or fewer drops of the product to my moisturizer. I have quite fair skin, so I used 2 drops in my favourite daily moisturizer. It blended the same as my moisturizer always does and I don’t believe it affected the way my skin felt. My skin still felt just as hydrated from my daily cream. 8 hours later, I had the perfect glow! I’m loving the final result! I’m especially impressed that it doesn’t have an orange tone to it at all. The perfect glow
