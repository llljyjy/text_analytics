I have been using the tanning drops for about a week now and love them! It spreads evenly, adding it to your own lotion and you can easily control the color by the amount of drops that you use. I would recommend starting with less drops and working your way up to your desired color. Overall I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants an easy natural looking glow. Great Tanning Drops!
