My partner is from New york and recently moved to GA and really wants to embrace the sun and get something of a tan for his skin. I didn’t notice the tan per say like what you normally expect to see when you hear tan ( maybe with extended use and apply more drops more application it’s too early to tell) but i did notice the glow aspect after the first day skin definitely looked more bronzed and glows better than before i think it’s nice. did notice slight break outs on their skin but could be because of lack of sunscreen to protect them with this change in skin care. All and all think it’s pretty neat Nice
