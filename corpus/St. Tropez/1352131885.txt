I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I was a little late to the game in trying this, as I received this voxbox right before my wedding and was afraid to try a new tanner. Now that the wedding is over and I am going on my honeymoon I have been trying this out to try to get a little base color. It is not a drastic tan by any means. Itâ€™s easy to use and smells nice. I am a fan of watermelon scented products so I was happy to give this a try. There is no tan transfer on my clothes or bed sheets. I will continue to use this in the winter for some extra color. Nice for a subtle glow
