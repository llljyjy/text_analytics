This is no way a gradual tanning lotion. The color shows up pretty intensely right after the first use. I liked the initial scent of this lotion, but soon enough, the typical self-tanner smell showed up. The color was pretty splotchy, and it leaned towards orange for me (I am quite fair). However, my biggest beef with this is how it was coming off - not evenly at all, leaving streaky color behind. I would not recommend. As far as the firming effect, I cannot attest to that as the tan aspect of this lotion makes it hard to use consistently to see the results. Not good whatsoever
