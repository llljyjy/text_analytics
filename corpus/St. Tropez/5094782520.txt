I was really excited to try this but unfortunately, my oily skin just didn’t love it. It does develop a nice tan that isn’t too warm. It feels really nice going on but when I wake up I look like I slathered grease all over my face. I think someone who has dry skin would love this and really appreciate the formula. It goes on easily, tans well, and doesn’t leave a weird smell. Not for oily skin but could be perfect for dry!
