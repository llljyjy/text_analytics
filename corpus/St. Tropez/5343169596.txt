I love the express mousse so I thought I should give this a try. I’ve used it a handful of times so far with different mitts and I always get a weird application. It’s like the product pills on itself as I blend it into my skin. As other reviewers have said, it’s not very pigmented which I’m almost grateful since the application looks so messy on the skin, I’m never sure if my tan’s gonna look wonky or not. I’ll stick to the mousse Weird consistency
