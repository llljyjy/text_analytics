I just tried the self tan drops for the first time and I was not expecting to love it this much! I was surprised how lightweight and non-sticky the drops were! After waiting a few hours my skin really looked amazing. My skin felt so smooth and very evenly toned.  I also love how easy and buildable it was to apply. Definitely a must try! Surprisingly Amazing!
