St. Tropez Gradual Tan Watermelon is hands down the best sunless tanner I’ve ever used! The bottle is cute, the smell is delicious and it works! Really well. I like that it doesn’t have the typical tanner yellow-Amber color. (Don’t forget to wash your hands!) The color builds gradually but before you know it. Applying multiple days in a row resulted in a nicer, deeper color but not obviously a tanner or have that orange tone like a lot do. It creates a beautiful color, I love it and definitely recommend! So amazeballs!
