Wow this tanning mousse is really nice! It fluffs up beautifully and the tanning mitt helps spread it over my body easily. The only hard part is getting your back but I like to use a long stick - like my shower loofah with a handle - and that does the trick. I didnâ€™t notice any streakiness and my skin tone darkened a couple of shades. Overall, really happy with it! nan
