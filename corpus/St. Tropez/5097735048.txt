Summer is almost here and I’m excited about the new St. Tropez Luxe Tan Tonic Drops for a bunch of reasons. I try to stay out of the sun as far as tanning but I love a bit of healthy color. This tan tonic is a superb little complexion booster for me plus it’s really hydrating. It leaves my skin looking radiant and adds just enough natural looking color. My skin looks radiant and feels soft and hydrated. I was impressed when I used it the first night.  I saw a difference in the morning when I woke up. My complexion had a radiant bit of color and glow that was even and streak free. You can customize your level of color as well. I have been using two drops per day which adds the perfect glow for me. Customized glow is perfect for me
