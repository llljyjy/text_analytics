I’m not new to self tanning and follow the directions exactly for this one. I washed off after 3 1/2 hours and barely any color change. Since it continues to develop I thought I’d see more by morning. I have very little color and it’s a little orange. I liked the idea of not sleeping in my tan but I think if you go through the trouble of applying it’s better that way. I would recommend the Ashley graham st tropez mousse. I usually apply a layer of that over the norvell Venetian and I get a great glow. nan
