It was easy to apply and I didn’t notice any streaking which has been an issue I’ve had with other self-tanners in the past. I applied it at night and went to bed.  It didn’t rub off onto my sheets which is amazing! It was very smooth going onto my skin and keeps your skin smooth and soft. Smooth and Soft
