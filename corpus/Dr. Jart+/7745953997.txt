For reference, I am in my mid 40s, have normal to combo skin on summer and normal to dry in winter and have wrinkles, enlarged pores, hyperpigmentation and texture of all sorts. I don’t have redness but my husband does and this products works wonders to tone it down. And it works for me as well. I really like it!PROS- Color correcting properties: I don’t have redness but my husband does and this product really tones it down. - It has a green undertone but turns beige upon application, for a better match with the skin (I don’t think that it will work on all skin tones though…)- Good ingredients: it offers skincare ingredients that help with sensitivity.- Good SPF properties: it has good protection level if applied liberally.- It leaves a beautiful glow on the skin not feeling greasy.- It works perfectly on top of my skincare and under my foundations.- Mineral sunscreen: I prefer it over the chemical options because I can apply it over my lids without irritating my eyes.CONS- It is a little pricey but you also get quite a good amount of product.- It takes some time for the product to get absorbed and set, so you have to be patient massaging it.- It will probably look quite ghostly on darker skin tones.I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador Great multitasker
