Oh my goodness I am so surprised at how good this is!!  To be a tinted moisturizer the coverage is amazing.  I’ve got combination skin and get pretty oily in the t-zone and usually have to powder multiple times throughout the day.  It didn’t make me look oily at all and I only had to powder once at hour 7 of wearing it.  It does go on looking orange at first, like some others have said, but as your rubbing it in, it just magically integrates with your skin color.  This has absolutely become my Holy Grail tinted moisturizer!! New Holy Grail!!
