I’ve seen this all over the internet but was hesitant to try it because nothing has ever covered my redness. This stuff is AMAZING! I don’t wear a lot of makeup and never wear foundation, but this alone looked like I was wearing medium coverage foundation and covered all of my problem areas. Some redness still peaked through a little bit, but I was able to blend in a cream blush and it looked intentional. The smallest amount goes a long way though, I used too much and had left over product. I will definitely buy the full version of this when I run out! nan
