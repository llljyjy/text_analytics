I personally love a good BB cream because I’m all about an easy makeup routine. There are a couple BB creams that I love to use and this one is now a part of that list. I love that this BB balm provides decent coverage without being too cakey feeling or looking on my skin. It feels lightweight and moisturizing on my skin when applying and throughout the day. I LOVE that it contains sunscreen in the product. I burn in the sun pretty easily so I gravitate towards beauty products that contain sunscreen. I’m pretty fair skinned and the fair-light worked well with my skin tone. I think that if needed you could build up the product.I also love the packaging. It is sleek, but simple. It has a pump top which makes it easy for getting the product out. Overall I think that if you like BB creams/balms this one is worth giving a try. I plan to repurchase it in the future as it has become a daily staple in my beauty routine. BB Balm Win!
