I enjoy Dr. Jart products but have never tried a tinted BB cream before. The product applies very smoothly and blends in well. I am dealing with terrible acne on my chin and this easily covered it without me having to cake it on. This left a nice, natural finish but unfortunately, I couldn’t wear it out of the house since the color was off so I couldn’t see how it worked as an SPF. Since I liked it so much, I think I’ll head to Sephora and buy a color that suits me better. nan
