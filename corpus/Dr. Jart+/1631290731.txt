I had hugh hopes for this. First of all, the green turning beige is very limiting in terms of skin tones. I can’t see this working unless you have a very specific light skin with golden undertones. It’s not so much cancelling red as it is pasting beige over top. Apart from that, this is sticky, thick and greasy feeling and it looks streaky when applied. I would rather just wear a full face of foundation. I am returning this. Nope.
