This product is great for challenging skin. I have uneven textures and areas of dark spots. Overall I have combination skin and this BB cream does so well. I received this product to try for free in exchange for an honest review. I honestly love the coverage I get and the protection of a high SPF especially in summer. The scent is pleasant and application is easy. Buildable coverage & protection
