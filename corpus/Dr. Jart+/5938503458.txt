At first I loved this product, it lays beautifully on the skin, does exactly what it is marketed to do, and look great with or without makeup added. However, the packaging is terrible! It is  very messy. I’m not a huge packaging snob but for the price it should be better. I won’t be repurchasing right away, I’m going to try other products on the market because the packaging annoys me that much. packaging sucks, the product is lovely.
