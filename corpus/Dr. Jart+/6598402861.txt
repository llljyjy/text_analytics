I love this product! I can see some people have said that it turns orange, but this did not happen with me. I have very fair skin and I used only a small amount of product. I tapped it into my skin rather than vigorously rubbing (my skin is very sensitive). It was not orange at all. I put a light foundation overtop and it was beautiful. It had a dewy finish and stayed all day. It reduced redness, smoothed my skin, and felt hydrating. I think if youâ€™re on the fence about it, give it a try and see if it works for you! :) Love it! Reduced redness and improves skin texture
