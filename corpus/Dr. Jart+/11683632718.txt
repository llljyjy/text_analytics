great texture and coverage! my skin is on the dry side and I have some redness around my cheeks/nose. I’d previously tried the tiger grass color correcting treatment (in a jar) but it was a bit too mattifying for me. this serum was great. on normal days, I use 2-3 drops on my face after all my other moisturizers and I don’t need to use foundation. works great for dry, red skin
