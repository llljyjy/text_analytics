I have been using the Dr. Jart BB creams for the past 7 yrs and I love them. They’re my go-to for everything from a light make up day to a heavy make up day. I’m unsure why they changed up their product, but I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, I can’t rate this higher than 2 stars due to its caking and greasiness. It sits on the skin differently and really settles in fine lines. I used to be able to use a light powder over shiny areas and go about my day. Not anymore. I didn’t have this issue with their previous formulas, so this is discouraging. I’ll be spending my money on a different BB cream from now on. Not the same as the old BB cream :(
