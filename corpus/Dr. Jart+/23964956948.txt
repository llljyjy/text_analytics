I tried this product for the first time and you really just need one pump. That one pump does a long way. I thought that it wasn’t going to match my skin but it actually did! I had to blend it with my finger and it did it’s job. It lasted all day, I wore it at for 8 hours. My skin felt normal, it’s very lightweight I didn’t think it was going to feel like that. Yes I’ll buy this balm in the future and recommend it to others A must have!
