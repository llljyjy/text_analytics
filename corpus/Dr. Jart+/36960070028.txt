This is a great product. It’s SPF 30 which I need for my fair, redness prone skin. I haven’t been formally diagnosed with rosacea, but it’s close enough. The green tint really makes the redness and blotchiness vanish and dries invisibly without any residue left on my skin. The only flaw is the horrible bottle. It’s a mess and ends up all over the lid with lots of product being wasted. Why this is in a little tub instead of a pump bottle (like the Eucerin Red Relief, which is inferior in every way except for the excellent pump bottle) is beyond me. With a pump bottle container this would be an instant 5 stars. Excellent in every way except for the packaging
