But boy do I! I read mixed reviews on this product so I was hesitant to buy the larger size and was thrilled to see it cam in a travel so I could try it. Money well spent! I love the feel of this and I love the color correcting it does for me. I especially love that it does really well under makeup too so I can wear it with or without it a primer and it looks beautiful on its own or with foundation. A little goes a long way for me too so even though I’ve been using it at least once a day or once every other day for the last month I still have plenty left in this travel size. That makes me happy because I know I can invest in the regular size and I’ll definitely get my money’s worth out of it. If you’re not sure like I was definitely try the travel size. If you’re like me you just may find this to be an amazing product for you roo Wasn’t sure I would love it…
