I bought the entire Teatreement collection (cleanser, toner, and moisturizer). I use it on my chest and back which is where I get acne. In the shower is when I use the cleanser, then when I get out I apply the toner and then the moisturizer. This is the best stuff I have tried so far for my body acne! And I have tried sooo many products. I will give an honorable mention to Glow Recipes strawberry acne serum, but Dr JART is even better because it doesnâ€™t leave a sticky residue behind which is important for me because I have to put clothes over my target areas. I highly recommend the entire collection. They all work so well together. amazing!
