This product does go on really nice and made my skin feel great! I didn’t really see a difference using it and it made my skin break out a little. If it didn’t make my skin break out, I’d probably continue to use it! My skin did look brighter, but my pores remained the same. If you don’t have sensitive skin, give this a shot! nan
