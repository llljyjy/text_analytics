Similar to other recent reviews, this product arrived separated & very oily. I originally bought a jar of this several years ago & it’s lasted quite a while (not everyday use, though). So, when I re-ordered and opened this jar, i was shocked at the consistency. When I applied it it was like putting straight up oil on my face, really gross. I contacted customer service & they’re sending a new jar, but who knows what the condition will be. I was shocked at the consistency that I had to go back & see if I had originally had a jar labeled “creme“ instead of treatment, but sadly it’s supposed to be the same thing.The advisor at the store told me years ago to only use about 3-4 dots of this when applying, but i’ve always tended to use more. It covers red & under-eye dark circles, but it doesn’t last a very long time.Others said it pilles and I agree that after several hours it looks “grainy“ and like it’s been rubbed off, and if you touch anywhere it comes off. I started using primer after my moisturizer before putting it on, but that doesn’t seem to help. I love the color correction, but wish it looked better after setting. First jar lasted years, 2nd jar is oily/seperated?
