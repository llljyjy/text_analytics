This did wonders for my irritated skin. Not only is my moisture barrier (for the most part) healed but my skin is 10x less red. Yes it is slippery and you have to keep your head tilted up while you have it on or else itâ€™ll slip off but it is SOOO worth it. This is a new go-to for me when my skin needs some extra help. WORTH THE HYPE!
