I am not usually a fan of sheet masks but I loved this! I could not believe how soft and clean my face felt after. I will definitely continue using this when I feel like my skin needs a refresher. My only complaint is that it is two separate pieces which makes applying it a little tough but it is something I can deal with for the amazing results. nan
