I absolutely love these! I have chronically dry and sensitive skin but also a love for face masks. I have tried quite a few and this one is one of the most hydrating. I prefer it over the Dr Jart+ Ceramidin mask. The product is easy to use (standard sheet mask) and always comes with extra serum in the package. I usually have enough that I can put on a second layer once it begins to soak in or use it as a serum itself. Definitely recommend. nan
