This is nice if you don’t have super oily skin. It definitely calms down redness but the correcting cream that goes from green to a beige color doesn’t last long if you are wearing it all day. I was going for a no make up look and it slipped right off after a few hours and I was an oily mess. The other 2 products are great for night routine before bed if you’re oily. Im not working these in to my everyday routine but very nice to have on hand when my skin starts to act up. Good but under the right circumstances
