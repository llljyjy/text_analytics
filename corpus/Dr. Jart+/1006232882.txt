This BB is amazing. It exceeding my expectations. It has lots of good stuff in it and you can tell right away upon application that it has a dewy texture and skin softening formula. Every time I’d use it my skin would feel soft and hydrated. It didn’t slide off and if you wanted more coverage and a finished look, you could easily add more and set it. It didn’t melt off and I love that it has a 40SPF sunscreen so you could just use this and go. I would buy this but the only thing was the color was a bit too warm. I’m usually a light-medium (I base it off of IT) but I think the Fair Light maybe would have been better. Sometimes those shades are too light. It would be great if they’d expand their shade range from the 4 colors they have. I took off a star for that. I received this product free from Influenster for my honest review. Dewy & Softening
