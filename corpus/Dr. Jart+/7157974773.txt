I have pretty severe redness so wearing a light coverage product is not an everyday thing for me. However, I cannot stop using this. Even though it’s light coverage it evens out my skin tone so well and  make my skin look flawless. It’s easy to apply and layers well with skin care and other products. The only issue I have had is the packaging because after using it as much as I have it takes a lot of work to get product out. But I don’t mind that considering how much I love the product in my routine. My new favorite light coverage complexion product!
