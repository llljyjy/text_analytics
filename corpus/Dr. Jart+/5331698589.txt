started using this product and it applies nicely and everything although it does make my face appear very light (caution to POC) but my biggest issue is that after having the product for 3 months the dropper started growing MOLD. I make sure not to get product on the top (or if i do get some on it i clean it) but i noticed it starting to grow and now i dont feel comfortable using it. Really a shame because of how expensive it was. Issue didnâ€™t happen until about a week ago but Sephora said they cant do anything and that what i was seeing was probably just product (nothing about the product is a blueish moldy color). Not very confident in the longevity of this product. Also very concerning that Sephora didnt seem to care about it. Disappointed. Mold
