Honestly I haven’t used any sheet masks that have done anything for me before and I’ve really just used them for fun. But this one made my skin plumped and my lips were super dry and feeling tight before using the mask. I left part of the mask on my lips they were fixed, I seriously felt a difference! I think that deserved 5 stars Lol. nan
