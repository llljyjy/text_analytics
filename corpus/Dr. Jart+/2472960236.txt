I’ve always loved BB creams so I was excited however, I don’t think this was the right fit for me! It’s a bit thicker than I expected but I believe that’s due to the SPF and it had a pleasant scent. When I applied it, I realized that the color just wasn’t for me. The lightest shade is actually quite dark! It applied dark and then oxidized further. I have quite oily skin so the moisturizing benefits were ultimately to my detriment because it caused the balm to separate on my face and wear quite poorly. I truly wanted to love it but it just wasn’t in the cards for me.  I would likely not repurchase it but gave it to my mom who adores it! It just goes to show how products are so individual. Not quite for me!
