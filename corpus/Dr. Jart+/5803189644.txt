So often I feel like masks are a gimmick, or don’t give enough to be super helpful. This is a mask I would buy over and over again. It feels like a luxurious experience while gaining spa-like quality. I love that you can leave it on for 40 minutes. Like other reviews say, the mask does slide but what mask doesn’t slide?! I watched some TV and occasionally would massage my skin, pushing the mask back into place. This could also be a great gift! I give this 5 stars because I truly don’t know if another sheet mask on the market that beats this one nan
