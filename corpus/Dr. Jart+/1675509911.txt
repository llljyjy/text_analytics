I got this product free for a honest review  I REALLY wanted to like this product, but it’s simply not for me. I love the smell and texture. It seem very promising, until my boyfriend said my face look furry. I do have peach fuzz and I do remove my mustache area from hair. For some reason this cream enhanced all my facial hair. I like what it did besides showing my facial hair. Normally my boyfriend doesn’t comment on my make up at all, and the fact he said something really made me realize this product is not for me. I also try with setting powder but that didn’t help either. Fuzzy
