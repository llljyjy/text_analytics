I don’t think that this is a bad or ineffective product by any means, however I think it is meant for people with a lot of redness on their face. I have slight redness and while the cream and the serum were nice, I thought the color correcting treatment was too thick and only wearable at night. I tried this product under make up one day and found it to be too greasy. It also didn’t change colors to a skin color, it kind of stayed green colored. The serum did feel really nice in my skin and the cream was almost like a moisturizer, that was nice. This product would work well for some
