This product is really one of the best masks I have ever tried! I have really bad acne on my forehead, and it cleared it away! I had this really big pimple, and overnight it reduced the size of it and the redness was gone. But, after you’re done using it, the packaging may have more of the “serum” inside. AND USE IT! Plus the cooling effect of it is amazing as well! (Btw everyone’s skin is different, so it may work on you a little bit differently than me) WORTH IT!
