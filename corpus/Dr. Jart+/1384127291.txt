I was excited to try this product. Unfortunately, I found it to leave an unnatural looking cast on my skin and it doesnâ€™t play well with makeup (liquid or powder foundation). It feels heavy on the cheeks and forehead, and settles in the creases along the sides of my nose. However, it was drying on the upper lip, and chin to point my skin looks flakey. Over several months time, I tried different application approaches (fingers, sponge, silicone applicator/pad), only using it after exfoliating or a peel/mask; same results. I have fairly normal skin, not prone to breakouts, but I often ended up with a blemish or two by midday. My advice is to skip this product or get a sample at the store before shelling out the $$ for this. Disappointed
