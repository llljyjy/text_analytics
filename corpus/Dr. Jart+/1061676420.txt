I love this beauty balm soooo much. I’ve worn it a few times since i’ve got it and received compliments on how good my skin looked. Doesn’t cover everything but helps with texture and redness. It depends, you can build it up. I just used my fingers to blend and it was really easy to do. It seemed to stay on well all day without primer. Having spf 40 ialso is a plus! Dr Jart Beauty Balm
