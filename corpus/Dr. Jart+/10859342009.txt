So happy I was sent this for my honest review from influenster.  Have used this brand before and I loved it and I still love it üòç I had got the Color correcting treatment a while back I love it and I was so excited I was able to get these products, my face is naturally pink and with these three products I was able to achieve a non red face. I love the smell of the product but some people may think the smell is over powering. The serum was beautiful application a bit tacky so the other two products can stick and work better. The cream with a little pea size a lot goes a long ways, when using all three products my face was red free and it felt soo moisturizing and soft but you have to be careful around the sun because it‚Äôs not SPF, over all I love it because it feels like I have a light weight foundation on like a bb cream and I would recommend to friends. A must love!!!
