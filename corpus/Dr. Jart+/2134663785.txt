This is most certainly not for pale skin or people sensitive to scents. Color is green, immediately upon opening the scent is strong. The color does shift to an orangey-beige after rubbing it in and somehow the red undertones still poked through. Iâ€™m glad I purchased the small size and will be able to return it but this is not made for people who are in the pale to fair skin categories. Not for pale skin!
