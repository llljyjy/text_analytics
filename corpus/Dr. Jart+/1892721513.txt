I already forgot how many bottles I am finishing, it seems that this is number 20, it is a serum that I can never miss. Two years ago my skin changed and became insanely sensitive and it was the only serum that my skin tolerated and calmed it down. Now my skin is less sensitive but Even so, it is one of those serums that I can never miss. Its formula is suitable for acne-prone skin since it does not have any comedogenic ingredients. nan
