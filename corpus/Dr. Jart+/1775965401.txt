I had high hopes for this product. I tried a sample of the rich cream (forgot what it’s actually called) but it was a lot more moisturizing than this gel cream. I can say that it is light wearing and I don’t feel like it clogs my pores. It also feels cooling on the skin, but I don’t feel that it does anything beneficial for my skin. Not ideal for use alone under foundation. Not the greatest, but not the worst.
