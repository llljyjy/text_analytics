Sheet masks are great for when you’ve got to prep for some event or do an elaborate skincare routine.  The New Pore remedy Purifying Mud Mask from @drjart is a mess-free, mud-coated sheet mask that removes pore buildup, blackheads and excess oil without dehydrating skin. It is a cloth mask that comes in 2 pieces. It’s green so looks funny when you’re wearing it.  Sadly I used it at night and fell asleep so no pics when I had it on. Lol.  Adheres well to the skin and doesn’t slip.  Felt very refreshed after. Refreshing
