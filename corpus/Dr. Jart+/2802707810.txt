Unfortunately this is much too dark for me,; the shade range is rather disappointing, to be honest. The fair/light shde also has this weird gray tone to it.This is a dewy bb cream, that never really absorbed into my skin. I kept having to go back and blot my face to remove the excess oil. Not a fan. nan
