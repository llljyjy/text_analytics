I was so excited for this because I hate wearing foundation but it has such a weird texture when it settles on your face and almost feels worse than foundation. Itâ€™s also super hard to put on, it sort of feels like rubbing chalk on your face. The color it changes to after application is also horrendous if you are super pale or have cooler toned skin. I had to take it off almost as soon as I put it on and it came off on my cotton pads yellow. nan
