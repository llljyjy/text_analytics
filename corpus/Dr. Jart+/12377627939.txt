The color correcting treatment is exactly what it says, a color corrector. This isn’t an amazing product to use if you want a good foundation, but it’s perfect for people like me who don’t like a lot of product but still struggle with redness and don’t want to cake their face in a light foundation. I only use a tiny bit and warm in up with my fingers before tapping it into problem areas and it works perfectly. I enjoy it
