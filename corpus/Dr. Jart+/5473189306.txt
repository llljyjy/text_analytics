The people saying this is not good are tripping. THIS IS THE BEST SUNSCREEN EVER. It is lightweight and does not leave a white cast behind! The best part is that it completely dries down to a semi matte finish, which even if you have dry skin, it works great because it allows for your face to become a clean great canvass for the rest of your makeup!! It is not greasy at all, goes on completely invisible, and the ingredients are great!!! I donâ€™t know why this is so underrated, but THANK GOODNESS because otherwise this would never be on my Sephora shelves!! THANK GOODNESS THIS IS UNDERRATED!!!
