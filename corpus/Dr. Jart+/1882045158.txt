I’m so happy I found this color corrector. It’s a green tint but when I apply it to my face, it cancels out the redness. It works like a charm! I was surprised at how good it made my skin look. When I don’t feel like putting on a full face, I put l color corrector over the redness, put on blush and a colored lip balm, and fill in my brows, and I’m good to go. When I go out without makeup, I don’t feel confident and don’t want to be seen. But when I do the aforementioned routine, I actually feel confident (wow.) with the color corrector in my collection, I’ve been wearing less face makeup which is a win for me!!! My skin looks flawless after I cover up the redness. The downside to it is that if I touch my face ever so slightly, the color corrector WILL disappear. I’m giving it five stars because it basically replaced my foundation/powder when I don’t feel like wearing face makeup. great on fair skin for redness
