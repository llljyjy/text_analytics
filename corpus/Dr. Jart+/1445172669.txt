Wow, just wow. This might be one of my favorite products I’ve ever tried from Dr.Jart - I have pretty fair skin and suffer from hormonal acne, so I have quite a few dark spots I’m always trying to cover, and this truly did the trick! I don’t like to wear face makeup in the summer bc I’m a sweaty girl and it only causes more acne - this is my new go too for hot days (or just everyday) bc it looks like I’m wearing bb cream without wearing bb cream. Go get this green goo if you too, want to have a little coverage without foundation or a skin tint. A new staple in my routine. She is the moment!
