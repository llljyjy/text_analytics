I have moderate rosacea, and this flared it up hardcore. I know a lot of people like this product for their rosacea, but something in it really triggered mine to act up. I gave it two stars because before it started burning it did calm the appearance of my redness. My checks were still pink but they were toned down to the point of looking like blush vs. fire truck red they normally are. The burning also didn’t start immediately, so I recommend spot testing before rubbing it all over your face. I really wished this worked for me, but I’m happy for everyone else who was able to find relief from it. irritated my rosacea
