Disclaimer; I received this product, free of charge, from Influenster and Dr. Jart in exchange for my review. Overall, I give this product a B+.The packaging was lightweight, small, and minimalist. The exfoliant was translucent, had the viscosity of a thicker essence, and had a faint mint scent (be wary if you are sensitive to added fragrance). I mainly use the exfoliants on my body. It was thick and creamy and did not dry my skin out. I have K P on my arms and I was hoping that this would help with that but alas, it did not. My skin can be sensitive to chemicals call exfoliants and I did not have an adverse reaction to this. Overall this product was aesthetically pleasing, smelled lovely, and felt luxurious to the skin. I donâ€™t think I would buy this product again but I will certainly use up the bottle I have Gentle & Creamy Exfoliation
