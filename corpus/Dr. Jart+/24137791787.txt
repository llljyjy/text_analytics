I received this product from Influenster in partership with Dr. Jart for free for my honest review. Well let me tell you, this will be my new go to product. Not oily, sits very well on the skin, hides my rosacea flares up and gives the comfort of added sunscreen. Color match was great. I have been able to wear this ALL day long and not look streaky or like itâ€™s fading off after wearing it. It also has improved my skin with its added benefits. It has definitely helped my rosacea.
