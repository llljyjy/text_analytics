My only complaint about this product is that it basically works like foundation and my foundation (Bobbi brown) covers more redness. But if you want to go makeup free it does work and a little goes a long way for sure. Itâ€™s thick. I recommend dabbing little bits on your face after blending in your palm and then gently rubbing in. Covers most of redness, will last a long time
