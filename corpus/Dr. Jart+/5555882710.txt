I really want to like this skincare line but it just doesn’t work with my skin. I don’t normally have sensitive skin, but some ingredient in these products drives my skin crazy. I have tried their gel before and it irritated my skin in the same way. Before leaving me with itchy, red skin the color corrector does momentarily cover the redness I get, so I would still recommend the product to others that aren’t sensitive to the ingredients.
