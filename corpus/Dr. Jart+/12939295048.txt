This beauty balm is wonderful! It lasted me all day and didn’t dry out my skin, first time ever for a cream like this! It made my skin feel super hydrated which I appreciated. It was sticky for about 20 mins or so but then my skin soaked it in and felt silky. It’s light coverage so if you have a lot of blemishes I’m not sure how this would be for you but a few it looks great on your skin. I didn’t have any breakout or reactions either so I was super happy about that especially having sensitive skin that breaks out with new products. The color was on point as well! I received this complimentary from influencer and am so happy I did because this is a new staple for me! Yesssssssss!!
