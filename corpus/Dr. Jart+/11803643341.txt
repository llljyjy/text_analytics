Was super excited about this, but it is very drying and has a white cast. If you’re very pale, this may work for you. It’s currently winter and I’m naturally more tan in the summer, so I’m quite pale right now, and evenso this just does not blend well with my skintone. It’s also very thick and drying. I have normal to oily skin, and putting it on is not easy. Not for medium complexions
