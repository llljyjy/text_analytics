Love this for my irritated acne prone skin! I bought this at Marshalls but I love it so much I’m willing to pay full price. I put this on toward the end of my skincare routine, before moisturizer. It doesn’t work instantly but rather needs some time to work. I’ve been using it consistently for about a month and it helps so much! Also good for quick hydrating feeling
