This is great for hiding redness in the face. I have red sensitivity in my cheeks and usually use foundation but when I use this I donâ€™t need any foundation. I have light skin tone and find this looks really natural. It goes on green but changes to a more skin tone or yellow color that masks redness really well. I also like that it has physical sunscreen that is not irritating. Great for redness
