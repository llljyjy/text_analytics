This mask wasn’t terrible and I  definitely did not hate using it but it did seem kind of pointless and really didn’t improve the texture of skin. Might be cute for a little girls “spa” day for like a mommy and daughter type thing. The smell was.. overwhelming. It smelled a lot like those cheap lipstick kits from walmart that you use an applicator with. (If you know, you know). I did like how it came with two separate pieces, that made it much easier to apply. I didn’t hate it but would not go out of my way to purchase it. Mostly just “eh”
