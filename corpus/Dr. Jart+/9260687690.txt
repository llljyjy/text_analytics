These are my favorite microneedling patches, I get little red blemishes on my cheeks and these work perfectly to calm them down. I love that they have vitamin C and hyaluronic acid. Inside the initial package are six individually packed patches, which makes it easy to take one or two on the go. Now that I know these work Iâ€™m going to buy them regularly, maybe splurge and stock up. They work so well for my needs! Works great for red blemishes!!!
