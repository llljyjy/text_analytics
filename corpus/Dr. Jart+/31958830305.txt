Personally not for me. It does the job for color correcting but didn’t blend with my skin tone. I should add that if I tried blending it more, the product would come off and it would be as if I didn’t put anything on the spot I was trying to cover. Resulting a bit whitening to the skin around the area applied (if that makes sense). Although, I do have to say that it worked for my cousin who has a much lighter skin tone than I do. Personally don’t think it works very well for people with tan or brown skin tones.As for the recommendation: I recommend getting a sample because it might or might not work nan
