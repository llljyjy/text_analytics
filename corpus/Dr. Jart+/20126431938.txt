This mask was good not great. After only one use I’m not able to tell if it did much. It does make your skin feel minty and cool while it’s on. After my face felt tighter, but my skin wasn’t drastically different. The pricepoint is fair. I am not sure if I would continue to use this product as I have sensitive skin. Okay
