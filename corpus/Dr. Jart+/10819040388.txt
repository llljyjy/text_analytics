It has a very lightweight consistency with no white-cast which I absolutely love. However, after wearing it for a day, my skin broke out with small bumps on the forehead. I wish it worked so bad but that’s unfortunate. Probably because of high percentage usage of lavender oil (fragrance) or I’m just very sensitive to chemical filters. Breaks me out :(
