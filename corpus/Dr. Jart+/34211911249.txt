I received this from Influenster and Dr Jart+ in exchange for my honest review:)I started using this about 2 weeks ago and instantly fell in love with the after the first use. I am someone with a very sensitive skin, so I am always skeptical about face products because my skin reacts with almost anything and everything-other than Vaseline- but this specific one was so gentle on my skin it left me speechless. I have seen improvement after the first week of trying so I say it works just as well as it’s described. Speechless 😍🫧
