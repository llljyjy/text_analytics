Before using this I read dozens of reviews of this product, mostly positive, and many of them with tips on how to use this treatment properly to get the most out of it.  I felt I was ready to use it, and was excited by the positive reviews.  Before using this product, my skin was balanced, breakout free, but of course, red at times throughout the day (mostly in the morning).  After a couple uses, I noticed my skin was looking dull- and I could feel a difference when I washed my face.  Prior to use, my skin was relatively unclogged (except occasionally during my period). But now I could feel bumps and noticed that there were large clogged pores around my chin, neck, forehead, and cheeks.  They were huge- it was something I’d never experienced before.  The product felt heavy and sticky.  My skin became very oily and the only way to describe how it looked to me, was that it looked sick.  It also felt overly difficult to remove.  The color looked artificial and mannequin-like,  Many of the reviews recommended various tricks for makeup application over it, but I honestly never even got that far, so I can’t say what it would have been like with makeup. From strictly a skincare perspective, after using this for several days without any makeup, my skin went into flux, became unbalanced, and I developed large clogged pores.  After I stopped using this product, it took almost 2 weeks to reverse the damage my skin sustained from using it.  This is my first negative review of any product on Sephora- but I had such a bad experience, I thought I should chronicle it.  I think this product is the holy grail for many people, but if you have skin like, mine, it might not be the best product for you. Clogged Pores, Looked Sick
