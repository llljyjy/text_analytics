Can I start off by saying, look at my picture! This tint is absolutely amazing! Itâ€™s so light, creamy, and literally feels like a moisturizer and sets in like one too! My skin is glowing and I have found my #1 staple I always want to have in my routine! I did find that you get A LOT of coverage when applied with a sponge/brush by patting it in. I prefer applying it with my fingertips like a moisturizer as it blends smoother and looks super natural and radiant! Drink for your skin
