I love this product! I hate wearing foundation to cover up my redness but I love how this gives me an even skin tone like foundation but not that heavy feeling. I will say this…. I don’t think this product is for everyone. It does expose a lot of pores on my face so I have to use a pore minimizer before applying. If you have dry skin I honestly think this would make it even dryer. I have combo skin so some areas that are dry this product intends to not settle very well over my dry areas. But overall I use this product daily; it works great for me. It’s great! But maybe not for everyone
