i genuinely love this stuff so much. i bought the 15mL size and told myself if i really love it and use it i’ll get the full size. that being said, it has become a must in my everyday makeup and no makeup routine. i have rosacea on my cheeks so the texture is uneven and red and can be dry. i’ve found this had evened out my skin texture SO much as well as minimized redness as well as hydrated my skin. absolutely ADORE this stuff! so good on my rosacea
