I received the Pore Remedy Purifying Mud Mask complimentary in exchange for my honest review.I’ve never tried a mask that came in two separate halves before so initial application was a bit awkward to get each halve on, peel the plastic off, and then smooth it out. Once it was on, I was able to work on things on my computer without worrying about the mask sliding or falling off - which I can’t say is true for all sheet masks. This mask fully dried down, but it took longer than 15-20 minutes (which was the recommended leave-on time). I peeled the dried mask off and rinsed as instructed, and I did find my skin significantly less oily without feeling too dry and tight like other mud masks make my skin feel. It was a lot easier to rinse off the residue from my face than non-sheet mask mud masks which would make this a perfect option to use in the morning before getting ready for an event! This is typically more than I’d like to spend on a single use mask, but I can see myself purchasing this in the summer for vacations or events to help me stay oil-free and exfoliated! Pretty Good!
