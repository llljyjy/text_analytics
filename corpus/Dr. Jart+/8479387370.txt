I bought this cream as a moisturizer and thought that the color corrector was a nice addition to my sun-sensitive skin (very fair). It gives a strange ashy green color to my face, that later (after about 5 min) just remained ashy, the greenish hint disappearing as promised. Gives you ashy - gray shade
