Overall I really do like this mask. I went with a four star rating due to the fact that I think it is a little bit more of a complicated application process compared to other face mask sheets I have used. I think this mask makes my skin feel refreshed and clean immediately after application. It also helps my skin look smooth too. I also love that this mask doesnâ€™t feel super cold to my skin and there is virtually no mess! Great face mask
