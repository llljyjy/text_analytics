I received this as a sample and came to buy more. Almost never happens. I have always been self conscious of the large pores on my nose and adjacent to my nose. I’ve used so many products to try to clear them and nothing seemed to really clean them out until this product. This is my holy grail combined with Dr. Sturm’s glow drops, my skin looks young, fresh, smooth and definitely less porous. And yes, the serum is watery. It says that in the description…it’s like the 3rd or 4th row in. Just shake the bottle really well, which it also says to do so on the bottle. For all the previous complaints I think the reviews that the serum is “just water”…It’s amazing what reading can do. Try it and you might get better results! Read the Product Description…and the Bottle!
