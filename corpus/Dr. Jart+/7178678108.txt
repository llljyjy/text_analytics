This honestly doesn’t cover up my red better than shape tape concealer from tarte or Kosas foundation. It doesn’t deliver as much on calming and redness reduction as I would like for all the hype and the cost. I don’t totally get it. It is was better than the green color correcting primer from smash box though. I think that stuff is terrible. eh
