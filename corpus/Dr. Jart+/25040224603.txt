I have combo/oily, acne-prone, and sensitive skin so I was looking for something that was going to help with my redness that also contained SPF. I purchased the mini size so I can test this product out for myself but unfortunately I found it to dry my skin after 10 minutes of wear and needed to really rub this into the palms of my hands to minimize the pasty finish on my skin, and even in doing so it left my skin looking “ghostly“ - I really wanted to love this because of all the great reviews but I will say that if you are contemplating between getting this, it might be worth purchasing the mini size or going into a Sephora store to test it out in person. Skincare really is all about trial and error, so just because it did not work for me does not mean it won’t work for you. I am just sharing my experience with this product. Good luck to you! :) I wanted to love this based on reviews!
