I have been debating trying this line for months, but was so excited to receive this for free from Influenster / Dr. Jart for testing purposes. My skin is combination skin, I don’t have rosacea but do have redness especially in my cheeks. This set definitely helped improve redness, especially the color corrector, but it didn’t do well under my makeup. When used without the color corrector, it did great! The serum leaks when traveling, so packaging could be improved. I’ll definitely be purchasing the cream! Nice Set!
