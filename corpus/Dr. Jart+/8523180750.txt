This product works much much better than what I expected.It covers redness and is somehow super lightweight! I also love the fact that it has SPF. I’ve used it for about a week now and it has not given me my breakouts or dry skin which is a pleasant surprise.I bought the travel size as I wasn’t sure if I would be satisfied, but am definitely buying the full size once it a empty. nan
