I wasnâ€™t sure about this product as I find most products with SPF just breaks me out and makes my face produce too much oil. This stuff has helped with my redness and gives a nice tint to my face. After where it all day with no powder it does make my face a bit oily but powder helps with that. I like it and will be my go to when outside all day. Great product with a SPF
