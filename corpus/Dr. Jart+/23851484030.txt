I was worried it would be too dark. I have a fair complexion, and on my hand it was very dark! But after blending it for a good while, it took on a more tan/orange tint, that resulted in a nice sun kissed look. I did apply some white powder over top. But it provided a nice full coverage, that for me, did not dry out at all. My skin looked younger and happier. It helped cover up wrinkles and uneven skin tones. Iâ€™m really happy with this Beauty balm! Sun kissed!
