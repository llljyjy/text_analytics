I got this free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I hate being mean but I saw no difference with this one than my normal skincare… pores are the same, skin the same. Maybe I need extra time? I’ve been using it consistently about 3 times a week at night. It feels nice, my sensitive skin felt fine… it just doesn’t seem worth it at this price. I wasn’t expecting a major skin transformation but I was expecting a little change in my skin texture and moisture and didn’t see any. It’s easy to apply and gentle enough on the skin. I just think you can get something more effective cheaper. Really wanted to love this
