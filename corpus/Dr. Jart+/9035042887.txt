I used this for a month. First thoughts of it wasThat I like the way it sits on my skin. It gave my skin a Dewey look and gave me good coverage. It is super easy to put on. I like the pump bottle that keeps contaminates out. The spf is awesome too! I thought the added niacinamide would be okay but my skin does not like it. I’ve had other products with it before and I always break out. It took me almost a month to start breaking out. I hadn’t added anything different or change my diet. This product would be great if your skin likes niacinamide or at least doesn’t mind it. Love it but not for my skin
