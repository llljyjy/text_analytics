I enjoyed this product more than the Dr. Jart+ serum I received. The packaging for the mask is interesting. The mask essentially has a protective plastic film that you peel off in sections once the mask is on your face. I liked the idea cause it limits how much you have to touch the mask and the product on the mask. It was a little tricky though to peel the plastic off. The actual mask though felt really nice. It has a slight cooling effect but it wasnâ€™t icy or anything. My skin looked nice after too. I would definitely use this mask again. nan
