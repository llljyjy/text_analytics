Got this as a sample and just bought the large jar.This is like a tinted moisturizer with SPF, but itâ€™s SO much more.I have a fair/light cool toned complexion.  It goes on green and as you rub it it melt into your skin coveting/ neutralizing and red and green areas.Matched the color if my skin perfectly. It can be used alone for light spot coverage, or as a primer base.You will not regret purchasing this! Fantastic product
