just got this stuff today thinking “there’s no way this is actual miracle stuff” but boy was i wrong! my skin looks SO GOOD and i’ve put nothing else on my skin to help it other than i cleansed it before i put it on! it looks like i have naturally even skin tone and it makes my skin feel dewy and fresh! my mom is going to buy some now too! i hate makeup and i always get acne from foundation but if this doesn’t break me out, i think it’ll be my life-long go-to! don’t listen to the bad reviews! i just put a few drops on the back of my hand and then slowly rubbed it into the skin on my face and WOW! love it BUY THIS NOW!
