I wanted to love this product so much - I got the Cicapair set that includes the serum and the correcting spf treatment as well as this product.  But made me break out in tiny whiteheads and it did absolutely nothing to reduce redness on my skin.  I continued to use this cream for a month to see if the breakout was a purge, but it only worsened.  As soon as I stopped using it my skin went back to normal.  I think the redness benefits for the Dr Jart Cicapair line are actually beneficial for white skin tones - I have tan (Indian) skin tone and none of the Cicapair products have helped me at all.  The ingredients that I felt most on my skin were the shea butter and the eucalyptus oil - the centella/cica content of this product doesn’t produce the same results as other cica products I use (like the Laneige Cica Sleeping Mask, which is totally amazing). If your skin can’t tolerate shea butter or eucalyptus oil, which is common for people with rosacea, this product probably isn’t for you.  I’m giving the product three stars because it is moisturizing if you can tolerate shea butter. Made my type 2 rosacea significantly worse
