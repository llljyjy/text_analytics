While this product is great for skin discoloration, it does have a pretty strong smell for someone with a sensitive nose. I still recommend this product if you are looking for the blurring effect and I know many people who love it. Keep in mind it is a bit on the thick side but feels lighter once massaged into the skin. Good for Rosacea
