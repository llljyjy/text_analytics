I was loving this product, it makes my skin glow, takes away my natural irish redness, you donâ€™t need alot, its pricey but I thought it was worth it until.... 70 days later after receiving it in the mail from Sephora, it has separated completely. Looks like someone poured water in it, I ask how did this happen, temperature maybe. NOPE! It does this, and now its unusable and it wont mix back. Ive been told by the Dr.Jart team and Sephora this. Don't buy it, please, separates on its own
