I really like this product. It is a great mix between a natural and matte finish so itâ€™s perfect. Also I would say do not fear about the orange. When I tried it I on my hand I had a panic buy when applied to my face it blends out beautifully and I am pretty fair skinned Also watch videos. It is recommended you warm up the product in the your hands and pat onto the face. Everyone needs this
