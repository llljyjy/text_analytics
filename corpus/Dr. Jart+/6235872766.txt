I really wanted to love this product because it really does work in cancelling out redness and has SPF. I will say it really only caters to lighter skin tones when its blended out which is a flaw. However, this product broke me out really horribly. I don’t consider myself to have sensitive skin but when it really doesn’t like a product, it will break out like crazy. I ended up having to toss this because my skin hated it that much. Super unfortunate but a good thing to keep in mind before purchasing if you tend to break out over new products! Loved the product but broke me out terribly
