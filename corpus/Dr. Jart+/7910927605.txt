Game changer, especially when going for a no makeup makeup look. I usually only have redness around my nose that I like to cover up and this does it perfectly. A little bit of powder and potentially spot concealer, and I’m ready to go. It doesn’t even look like I’m wearing anything. The only thing I’ve found is that it doesn’t seem to work particularly well under any of my foundation, be it liquid or powder foundation. It works reasonably well under balmy foundation. nan
