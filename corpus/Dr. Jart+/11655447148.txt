I used the cicipair color-correcting cream before I started using this one. I very much prefer this one and I absolutely love it! This one has a lighter, more serum-y texture that looks and feels really nice. I’ll wear it by itself on more natural days or in combination with a light concealer when I want a little more coverage. It really does wonders for evening out my skin tone though! My only complaint is that, as a couple other reviews mentioned, the packaging could be better. The opening of the bottle really gathers product and gets kind of messy. I just clean the rim fairly regularly and it’s fine but it’s not ideal. nan
