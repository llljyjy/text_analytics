Being in the beauty industry as a beauty expert and skincare addict I love to use lots of exfoliating products and especially peels to make sure my skin is free of dead skin cells as well as product build up, dirt and debris.  Wearing makeup everyday does not help to keep your skin healthy unless you have a great skincare regimen starting with a good cleanse and also exfoliation.  This milky light texture peel is so phenomenal that it brought back my glow and health and brightness back to my aging skin.  Such a miracle worker to help smooth and even the texture and minimizes pore size on skin.  I highly recommended for everyone that loves self care! Poreless smooth skin!
