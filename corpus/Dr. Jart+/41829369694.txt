As a mom of four, one of which is a newborn, this BB cream is a dream product. I keep it in my purse or in my diaper bag so that I can use it to even out my complexion on the go. It blends in seamlessly and evens out my complexion. The shade range is great and the adaptive colors make sure that I have a seamless coverage no matter what shade my skin isq. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is seeking sunscreen and make up coverage all in one easy to use product Must have for summer!
