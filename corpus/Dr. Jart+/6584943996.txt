I Love Dr. Jart. I Always Have And I’ve Used Multiple Different Products Of Theirs. I Received this face mask as part of a complimentary box to review from Influenster. Upon getting it, I was very excited to try it out. I can tell that there was probably no easy way to make this mask easy to use as it is a mud sheet mask, however it was EXTREMELY difficult to apply properly and ended up making a mess. Removing two pairs of film on the mask in order to apply properly did not work very well and did not make for proper application. This part was disappointing. Despite all of this, I think the mask has good qualities and it made my skin feel clear and nice after application. The only thing I would be wary of is the format of the mask and it’s lack of easy to use capabilities. I’ll be honest…
