I really think I like this. I will say... you need to blend this very well into your skin. I have fair pale skin with a red hue on the cheeks. I really like the colour on my skin. I will use on basic makeup days which has been a lot lately. A little goes a long way. Donâ€™t put too much on your skin. I do use sunscreen spf 50 before applying this product. I think I will be using this product during the Spring & Summer season. I am surprised.
