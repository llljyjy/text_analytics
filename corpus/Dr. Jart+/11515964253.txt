I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have to say I like this beauty balm! As a gal with normal to dry skin, it sits nicely and gives me a light-medium coverage. Only downside is it can be a little orangey, but I may just need a different shade. I love that it has spf in it. I like it!
