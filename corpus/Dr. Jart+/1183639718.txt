I received this item through influenster for an honest review. I love the coverage of this BB moisturizer it’s sheer enough that it doesn’t cover all my freckles but matte enough that it hides my redness. The only thing negative I would say is it’s still slightly wet feeling well after applying but that’s nothing a setting powder can’t fix. Overall great product
