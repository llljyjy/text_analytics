Once the shade adjusts to your skin I guarantee you will love it! I wasn’t sure about the initial tone (tad gray) but the color did shift to a flattering shade that matched. I’m about a NC25/NW20 in MAC and the Fair-Light BB Cream was a good match. I prefer to warm my face with a cream bronzer still, apply undereye concealer & set the center of my face; the texture is a little dewy & I like to kill the extra shine in my Tzone. Packaging is A+. The scent is faint & appealing. Overall it wears nicely throughout the day & can certainly substitute your lighter coverage foundation. PS a flat buffer brush to apply worked better than my fingers. This product was received complimentary for review. Great everyday option!
