Definitely love how quickly this eliminates redness on the face / active pimples. Only note is wearing makeup after applying. If you have a simple makeup routine with minimal product, this redness reducer (with SPF!) will work fine. But if you typically wear higher coverage makeup, the blending and finish will be tricky. nan
