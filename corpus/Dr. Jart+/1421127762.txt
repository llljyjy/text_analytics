I went into Sephora planning to try the Saie tinted moisturizer. Upon entering this caught my eye first on a new display. I swatched the light/medium and it was a perfect match. Then I tried thus completely on one side and the Saie on the other. This had better coverage and a better color match for me so this was the winner. I tried the original Dr. Jart one and did not like it at all. I felt like there was way to much gliw for me almost as if I noticed glitter specks. This does not look that way on me. It has a nice youthful glow like my skin is well moisturized without the “glitter “ this will be my new every day staple. I am 50 with dry patches and plenty of wrinkles and this did not settle at all in the 6 hours I had it on.  I never used a primer or set with anything. I do have large pores so I may tap a primer on my T zone to minimize that but it really wasn’t a big deal when wearing this alone. I love the ease and quickness of putting this on with my fingers throwing in my milk blush and I’m done. Really really happy with my purchase. I do have acne prone  ( cystic) skin. And so far no pimples so I would say even with the chemical sunscreen it was not problematic for me. Youthful skin
