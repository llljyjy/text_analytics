I have used this product for two years. It was part of my daily regimen every morning. I recently purchased a full-size container and also the travel size container.  I was extremely disappointed that the oil separated in both containers and caused a mess.  This has never happened before in last two years so Iâ€™m wondering if the formula was recently changed?
