I was first initially surprised at the thickness of this. I was mildly horrified after putting it on, but I waited a little and it did get slightly better in my bathroom lighting at least. But when I arrived to work and saw myself in that lighting? Terrible, weirdly pale mask all over my face. It looked like I had the heaviest coverage foundation on in the wrong color. maybe I put too much? not sure but it wasn’t a crazy amount, and I like to put a decent amount of sunscreen on for the protection. I won’t be using this again! weird pale mask
