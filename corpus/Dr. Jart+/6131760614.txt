So, I had no idea this was new to Canada, and as part of a recent Sephora purchase I got this as a sample. I had no idea what it was or what it did, but I was pleasantly surprised and love that it has SPF! I liked it enough that I went and purchased the full size product. It has a scent to it, which I like but some may not. I found a little goes a long way which leads me to believe despite the big price tag this should last a while. It blended nicely and matched well with my skin tone, however, I’m not sure how this would work on people of colour as it may leave a bit of a white cast. It does leave you a bit tacky feeling, so I set it very lightly with a setting powder without issue. I did find that I needed to pay attention to making sure it blended it out around my nose/mouth/ear/neck so that it didn’t settle funny. It by no means would cover major redness IMO like rosacea or broken capillaries, but for someone with minor redness like myself it did a pretty decent job. It works nicely with all my other skin care and I like to wear it without any makeup, so I can’t speak to how it does under a foundation. nan
