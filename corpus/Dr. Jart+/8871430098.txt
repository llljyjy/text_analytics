Wasn’t the right color way too dark and had a hint of green to it as well. I have very fair skin and this just didn’t match me at all. I will be returning this. If you have a darker complexion this might work for you as far as coving up redness and acne it did the job but just didn’t look good on me. didn’t work for me
