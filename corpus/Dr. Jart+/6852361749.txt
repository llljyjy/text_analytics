I received this product for free from Influenster in for my honest review. I’ve been trying out this product for about a month and I really like it! I’ve always been a fan of Dr Jart products especially their cicapair and tea tree line because they were key in my skin healing process so when I got this I was excited! It has a milky texture and i apply it with my hands carefully tapping it in. It doesn’t leave my skin feeling tacky/sticky like other peels I’ve tried or has irritated my skin. It feels gentle and I’m able to layer it with my other skin scare products! Overall another great product by Dr Jart! A staple now!
