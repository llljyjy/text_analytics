I have medium skin with olive tones, but also have cheek redness/rashes due to my lupus. I was worried that this would make me look pale. However, I was amazed when wearing this product! has the perf amt of hydration so my dry skin isnt exacerbated while still drying down enough ( I live in a hot, humid climate). More importantly, my skin looked 100% even like I had put on foundation. It didnâ€™t look fake or cakey, just looked like I had perfect skin. Hyperpigmentation & my malar rash were GONE. Due to the hot climate I live in, I am always looking for ways to put less product on my face and simplify my routine. I now use this, some color corrector and concealer under my eyes, contour, & blush! I do sometimes put a bit of fenty eazedrop on my cheeks, but I honestly dont need it. I am so blown away! I bought the mini size and it will last me months, but I will definitely buy the full size. RUN, dont walk! the hype for this product is 100% justified. 100% Worth it
