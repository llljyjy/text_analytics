I always find sheet masks very fun to use and it’s always different with each sheet mask.  This one was definitely different and fun.  It came in two parts, a lower and upper part. It definitely was a new experience to use a two piece mask. after I figured out how it was applied, it was all smooth sailing, just like my skin after using it.  It was a nice consistency and the mud gave a nice feel and it didn’t slip off my face like some other masks.  It was definitely something I would purchase again and it really worked to smooth my face and made it feel so soft! Great cool mask!
