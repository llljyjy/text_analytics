I have fair skin, my ancestors are all Irish. I am now 36 and my pores on my cheeks are getting big and it seems like if I touch my face I turn bright red. This line from Dr Jart has been AMAZING for me. I use the drops on a nearly daily basis when I go into the office for work. I have noticed that after about 3 weeks my cheeks are looking more normal! I use this instead of foundation. If your skin is very red, I’d say go with the thicker cream in a jar. I started with that and liked it, but didn’t need that much coverage so economically the drops worked better for me. There’s a starter kit here on Sephora that has a few minis and is a good deal. This is a product I tell my friends with similar skin concerns to buy! 10/10 recommend!!
