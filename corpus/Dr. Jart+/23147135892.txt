I like the consistency of the product. It didn’t feel very heavy on my face, and it smelled pretty good for a serum! I didn’t feel like after using it a month that I saw a major difference in my skin however, I saw a little glow which was nice but nothing major when it comes to my pores. I’d recommend this to people with minor pore issues. nan
