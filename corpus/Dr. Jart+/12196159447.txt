At first I hated this product because I usually don’t like anything w spf. But then one day I decided to give it another chance and I’m sooo glad I did. It works so well with evening my skin tone and the spf is honestly great, after a few minutes I don’t even remember I have anything on. I personally think it helps with my acne too - my face looks absolutely fabulous :) give it a chance
