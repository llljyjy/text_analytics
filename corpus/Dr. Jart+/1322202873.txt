I absolutely CANNOT be without this stuff now because I have diabetic skin which alot of times is very problematic and itchy. I dont care that this is supposed to be make up as it SOOTHES my itchy skin and feels like its healing it. I get alot of bites and bumps and just a bit of this stuff does exactly what its named for soothes it. Tigers use it for that and so do I. I have also turned my sis and her friends onto it. Its worth the purchase alone for that but it also tones down my dark marks on my skin. BEST PRODUCT IVE EVER PURCHASED!!! cant live without it now
