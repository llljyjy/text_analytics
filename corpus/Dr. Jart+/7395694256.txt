I bought this to replace the old formula of Supergoop CC cream in light (now CC Screen). I have fair skin with cool tones. The coverage of this is light and looks like my natural skin, improved, evening tone and redness. I really like the finish of the product (not too matte, not too dewy). It blends really well. Also, my skin is extremely dry and this is one of the few products that keeps my skin hydrated and no flaking at the end of the day. Great replacement for Supergoop
