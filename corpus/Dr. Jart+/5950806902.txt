At first I wasn’t too impressed with this product since it pilled on my skin when rubbing it in however I’ve found that applying a thin layer onto the skin and tapping it into my skin gave it a nice finish without the pilling. I have fairly light skin and was looking for something to cover up the redness on my cheeks, nose and chin after washing my face and moisturizer in the morning and this works great! The texture is like a watery foundation with a slight powdery finish once it dries. Give it a chance!
