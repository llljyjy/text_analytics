The product has a smooth texture and doesn’t really have a scent. It went on very smoothly and it wasn’t streaky at all which made it easy to blend. Initially I was nervous about the color but surprisingly it blended into my skin perfectly. It made my skin look as if I had nothing on so it’s great if you’re going for a natural look. This product is great for people who want minimal coverage and an even tone. My skin didn’t feel dry or irritated using this and the balm lasted for about 8 hours. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for lightweight balm that gives off a minimalistic look. Amazing
