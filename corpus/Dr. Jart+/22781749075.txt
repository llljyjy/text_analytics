I received This mask for free for testing purposes from Influenster. The mask itself does what it claims. I’m combination ski type and it’s the dead of winter(extra dry in areas) and this was almost too drying for me. May be better suited for oiler skin types or when it’s hotter outside. Better for oily skin
