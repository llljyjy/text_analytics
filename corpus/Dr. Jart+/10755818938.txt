I received this item for free from Influenster for reviewing purposes. I don’t have a big problem with my pores and the serum from this line broke me out really bad. That being said the mask didn’t break me out which I thought was strange. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I’m not a huge fan of sheet masks. nan
