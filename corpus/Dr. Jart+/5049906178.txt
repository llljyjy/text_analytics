This did not work for me. I have combination acne-prone skin. The treatment feels heavy and tacky, heavier than wearing most foundations. When I wore masks daily, the product rubbed right off, making the redness of my nose and chin even more noticeable in contrast to where the product remained. It did not wear well, made the texture of my skin more noticeable, and it seemed to dry out my sensitive skin. I tried all the tips and tricks, watched videos about how to apply, but this product is a no for me. Hard pass
