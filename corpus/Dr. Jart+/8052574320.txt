I actually used this on my whole body because my pale self I was going on vacation to Mexico and needed a carry on size sunscreen that I could wear all day without feeling constantly sticky as sunscreen tends to do. This worked! Feels just like a nice lotion, didn’t disrupt my spray tan, and actually kept me from getting burnt. I forgot to put it on my hair part and got burnt there—so clearly it protected the applied areas. The only thing is of course this is made for your face and is crazy expensive to use regularly on your whole body! But definitely can recommend for a lighthouse, non sticky option no matter where you’re applying it! works and not sticky!
