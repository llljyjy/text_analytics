I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Dr. Janet in exchange for my honest review. I adore the Cicapair line and this is such a great little introductory kit. If you deal with redness and sensitivity this is a great option. The cream is balmy but not heavy and works well for day or night. The serum is lightweight and non-sticky. The color corrector is my go-to tinted moisturizer and really perfects my skin. I deal with periodic psoriasis flares on my face and these products are gentle enough for regular use and help tone down the angry redness. The serum is generously sized for a mini kit and the color corrector lasts a long time. Perfect little redness kit
