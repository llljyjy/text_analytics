I thought that this product was hard to put on as it had a lot of layers of plastic to remove. Once it was on I thought that the mask was made out of a really good quality and had just the right amount of product. I was actually nervous there would not have been enough on the sheet mask but there was enough for a thin layer. When I removed the mask and started cleaning my face with water my skin felt really nice. Pores is also a trouble area for me in my skincare and though this mask did a good job helping to clean out my pores without drying out my skin. Good mask, too many layers
