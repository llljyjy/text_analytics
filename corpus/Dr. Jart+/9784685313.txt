I liked this mask a lot! I loved how it fit perfectly on the face, seeing as it had two parts. The mud wasnâ€™t too thick or caked on, it felt soothing and relaxing. As far as seeing any kind of detoxifying, or skin clearing results, I would need to try it more than once! Hope to purchase this in the future! Thanks Dr. Jart! Nice product!
