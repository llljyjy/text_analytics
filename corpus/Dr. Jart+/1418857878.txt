Iâ€™ve used Dr Jart for yeaaaaars and am completely devastated over this new formula change while also being surprised at the addition of horrible chemical sunscreens in the same family as avobenzone and oxybenzone. They are not listed on the ingredients page for the product and if I had not read the box, the only thing showing these chemicals, I would have had a horrible reaction to this. Really hope they bring back the old formula CONTAINS OCTINOXATE***Deceiving ingredients
