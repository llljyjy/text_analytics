First time using this mask and it feels AMAZING!I love that the rubber doesn’t slide off my face like most sheet-like masks do. The rubber sticks perfectly to the serum and doesn’t slide off my face when I go back and sit to watch TV. Leaves my face glowing right after, and also mixes well with my BHA serum and FARMACY gel moisturizer when I apply it on after removing the mask. It gives a nice cooling sensation while you have it on, and the rubber really helps make sure your skin absorbs it; I recommend the 40min mark, as this ensures well absorption into the skin!PICTURES BELOW ARE ME WITH THE MASK, AND IMMEDIATELY RIGHT AFTER (BEFORE APPLYING MY SERUMS AND MOISTURIZER) Amazing!
