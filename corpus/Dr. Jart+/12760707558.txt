I hate to give this a bad review since all of the current reviews are positive, but this mask actually gave me redness and irritation after I used it. Judging from this, I guess I have very sensitive skin, as this mask is meant to help irritation. Iâ€™m sure this product works great for other people, but be wary if you have sensitive skin. My face was very smooth after though. Sorry to give this a bad review.. but...
