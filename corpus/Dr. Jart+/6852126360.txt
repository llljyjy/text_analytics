I got a second-degree sunburn on vacation on my back, shoulders, and arms. And let me tell you the blisters are not fun. When I got home I didn’t have aloe vera or a vitamin E. I did have some Aloe Vera spray but it really stung putting it on, smelled bad, and it really soothe at all except for the cold. Decided to use this and OH MY GOODNESS.  Instant relief. Would definitely recommend. It worked so well. I’m buying more right now. soothed 2nd degree sun burn
