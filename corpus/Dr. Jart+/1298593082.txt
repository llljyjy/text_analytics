Both my husband (!) and I have used the dark spot patches on some stubborn benign skin growths (“barnacles of aging“) that we used to have frozen off. I had one spot that would be gone for a year and then come back - after a course of six of these, it completely disappeared. My husband had one on his forehead that was 1/4 of an inch high - it took several courses for his, but shrank it to the point where we can barely see it anymore. I plan to have a long chat with my dermatologist as to why the heck these were so effective, but they were. No soreness, redness or any other adverse effects. Surprisingly effective on stubborn dark spots
