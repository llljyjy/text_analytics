I love this product ! I use it on my t zone mainly and where I have redness (in combination with a sunscreen all over my face). I was scared that it would be too orange but the coverage and color is very subtle, just enough to reduce redness. I have combination skin and sensitive skin and it works great. To be fair, it does not do a lot in terms of coverage, but it helps me making sure I apply sunscreen which is very important to me. Use it everyday!
