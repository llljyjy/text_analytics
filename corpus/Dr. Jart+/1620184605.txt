I don’t think I’ll ever wear anything else! I’m lucky enough to not need very much coverage most of the time, so this is perfect for me. And when they say it’s a universal color, they mean it. I can’t attest to how it looks on deeper tones, but I’m really fair and it adjusts to me beautifully. Big fan!
