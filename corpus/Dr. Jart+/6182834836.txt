I’m a very pale person and my face is flushed almost 24/7 because of that. I got this to correct my redness and it does - with a bit of work. When I first put it on, I immediately saw the orange tone that some complained about appear on my skin. I wiped it off and then reapplied a much, much smaller amount onto my cheeks and really buffed it in. I noticed my redness start to fade. To even the slight colour it left behind, I applied a skin tint on top to blend it in. I was pleased with the results, but unfortunately it won’t be a foundation replacement for me, which I was hoping for. Trust the process
