5⭐️/5 BABY. This stuff is magic and probably my favorite foundation I’ve used. It has great ingredients and high spf. I’m able to blend it in with my fingers and it melts into my skin perfectly. It doesn’t have that strange streaky look that happens with other foundations. I also usually have issues with foundation setting weird on my nose but this doesn’t do that at all! Previous reviews do mention that it looks gray, which it does have that kind of coloring when you first pump it out, however it does not look gray on the skin. Beautiful natural finish and lasts all day. YES
