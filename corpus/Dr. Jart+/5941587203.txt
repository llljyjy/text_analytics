I received this mud mask complimentary from Influenster - I was super excited to try it because I love mud masks! I really liked that the mask came in two separate pieces for the bottom half/top half of your face and the ability to adjust it to your face size since not everyone’s is the same. I wasn’t a huge fan of the smell of it but overall it got the job done! When you first put the mask on your face it is Dewey and hydrating and as you let it sit on your face for the 15-20 minutes it becomes more firm and dry. You can clearly see your pores on the sheet once your done. I definitely will purchase this mask to use again! Great Mud Mask!
