I’ve got really picky skin. It gets pretty oily in some spots, dry in others and I’m prone to acne. I love this gel cream because it’s not only soothing but it does the trick in terms of the right amount of moisture. It’s not cheap but you only need a little bit! Will definitely buy it again! love Dr. Jart!
