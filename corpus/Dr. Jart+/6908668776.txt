Iâ€™ve heard nothing but good things about this and I had to give it a go. I was a little skeptical at first because I am like GHOSTLY pale but it matched me perfectly. It feels super nice on the skin & lasted all day. 100% reccomend if you are looking for something lightweight with good coverage perfect for summer
