After the VIB sale I tried a lot of new makeup and after a long day I took it off and my skin had a horrible reaction. It was red, enflamed, and bumpy. I had a sample size of the product and used it religiously every night along with First Aid Beauty cleanser and after 4 days my skin was like new. A Must Have for Red & Sensitive Skin
