im absolutely blown away by this little thing. i was worried it wouldn’t work on my dry skin, but it’s actually very creamy and it doesn’t even look like i have any kind of product on once everything is patted in! a little goes a long way but you can build it up without it looking heavy. my skin looks so smooth and my redness is pretty much gone! i can for sure use this instead of any foundation. im definitely gonna have to get the bigger size once i run out! amazing!!
