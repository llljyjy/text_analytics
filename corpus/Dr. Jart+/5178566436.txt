I was actually about to buy the cream version after trying it as a sample before I saw the serum. I decided to go with this instead after trying on my hand and I can say I made the right choice! My skin is very oily and this was a better option for me for this reason. I feel like it’s lighter yet still does a good job at correcting redness and evening the skin tone. It’s great for a fresh, natural look! If I use this and mix my foundation with my moisturizer on top you can’t tell I’m wearing any makeup and my skin looks even and luminous. I like that I get the redness correction AND spf and other skin benefits. I was using Makeup Forever green tinted primer for ages but I like that this is a skincare product and absorbs into my skin easier. Great redness drops, suitable for oily prone skin!
