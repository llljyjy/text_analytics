I was crazy and got this right before a trip so the first time I used it was in a different country (don’t try this at home, I have been very lucky and not ever had any reactions to skin care products). I loved that this had SPF because I was in the Caribbean. I don’t usually wear any face makeup/foundation because I’ve always felt weird trying to “cover” my freckles. As I’ve gotten older, the freckles have been less “freckly” and more like a big blob of almost olive skin. Anyways, I really loved this product because it gave me a little bit of coverage but not too much - it smoothed out my skin tone. The major bonus for me was the fact that it also protected me from the sun. I would reapply with about 50% this and 50% sunblock and it blended nicely.I did receive this product to try on behalf of influenster. I wish all products included SPF like this
