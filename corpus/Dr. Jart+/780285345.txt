I’m not quite sure how I want to use this product. It is not great as a “foundation“ and it didn’t even out my skin tone like I was hoping it would. It cancelled out about half of the redness from my cheeks, but I can still see it coming through. It is not a great “primer“ for me as it emphasizes texture, pores and minor flaking. That leaves using it as a sunscreen on beach or pool days, although I feel like it leaves a slightly white cast in full sun. I’m glad I purchased the smaller size to start with. Don't get the hype
