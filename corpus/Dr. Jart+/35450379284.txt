The collagen mask is my go to all the time, apply it the night before a special occasion and your skin will be glowing and radiant! I normally leave it on for a little more than the 40 min, and the serum stays on all night. Morning just follow your normal routine and be ready to serve face everywhere you go. Best mask ever!
