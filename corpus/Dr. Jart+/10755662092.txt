I received this product complimentary from influenster for testing purposes. I love this so much! This is a must have for your “no makeup” makeup days. The coverage is great, the finish is truly just like a moisturizer or beauty balm. The scent is not too strong and it doesn’t cause too many issues for my sensitive skin. (Just a few irritated patches) I used this with cc cream, blush and powder and it made my skin look so naturally glowy! Highly recommend this product, but the only downfall is the shade range is not great. I was very lucky this ended up being a good enough match to balance out with my other products.
