Not gonna lie, the first time I used this product, I hated it because it looked orange. However I gave it a few more tries because I spent the money so I might as well give it a try. I now love this product and it’s a staple in my routine. I have always struggled with acne, I was even on accutane last summer. I started using retinol and my skin in purging and is red and dry. This product doesn’t necessarily cover up acne, but it definitely helps with the redness and the dryness. I’ve attached before and after pictures for reference. It works fantastic under makeup as well. Although I find it pricey (why I’m giving it 4 stars instead of 5), I do think it’s a great product. If anyone finds a dupe, lmk! However, I don’t recommend this product for anyone who has fair skin since the product is orange. Great for redness, wished it was a little cheaper
