I purchased at a Sephora store when I couldn’t find Black Label Detox - this will not be a repeat purchase.  I’ve been using for two months, really wanting to like it but I just don’t.  It sits really heavy  on the skin where I am anxious to take it off at the end of the day.  The finish is not as glowy as Black Label.  Black Label was luxurious feeling, felt really nice on the skin and left a really nice subtle glowy finish.  Also provided a nice moisturizer plus SPF.  I have been using Black Label Detox for over 10 years now.  Really disappointed it may have been discontinued.  I now am shopping for something else as I will not buy this product again. Please bring back Black Label Detox
