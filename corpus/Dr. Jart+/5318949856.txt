I received this mask through Influenster in exchange for a review. I enjoyed that the mask was separated into two pieces that helped fit the face better. This mask is great for those with oily skin. It was too much for someone with combo skin like mine but it did what it was supposed to do. 3 stars cause it’s something I wouldn’t use personally. Good for oily folks.
