I have very acne prone oily skin, and this product did not work for me. I tried it and it made my breakout worse, however I can see how it would work for some people. This product seems to be a hit or miss kind of deal, like most acne products tend to be. For the price, definitely worth a try. Didn't work for me, but that is ok!
