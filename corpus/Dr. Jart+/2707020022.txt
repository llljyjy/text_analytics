Holy smokes, this BB Cream is everything I want in a foundation. I’ve tried high end foundations (Pat McGrath, Guerlain, Dior, Lisa Eldridge), to drug store in my search for the Goldilocks foundation of my dreams. THIS IS IT. The coverage is great, just enough to even out my skin tone without masking it, and it looks 100000% natural, like your skin but better. A lot of BB Creams and foundation product lean yellow, but fair/light feels truly neutral.  It doesn’t break up on my skin, it doesn’t pill, it isn’t precious to apply, and it gives it a beautiful natural looking dewy glow. I have decluttered all my other foundations. I’ve decluttered all other foundations. HOLY GRAIL
