I really wanted to like this since I absolutely love all dr jart products, however sadly this wasn’t for my skin. It did take the redness away from my skin, however pretty quickly, the makeup was starting to separate and look patchy. I did try setting it with and without powder, and still got the same outcome. It just wasn’t for my skin, will be returning nan
