The face mud mask was slightly difficult to remove from the packaging and then apply neatly to face. The face mask was made for a smaller face (small eye holes/mouth) with no facial hair . I found that the mask did not dry within the specified timing. When I left for almost double the time, various sections were still wet. Removal was easy. The mud did soften the skin and leave moisturized. Mask too small
