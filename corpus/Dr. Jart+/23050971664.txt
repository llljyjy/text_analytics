Received complimentary in return for a review! I was quite skeptical at first as the formula appears very gray and does on the skin. Once applied and absorbed, it ends up melting with your own skin color and has no issues at all. It does appear a bit dry if used alone, and appears like a liquid foundation on the skin, but with a regular moisturizer underneath, it is much more glowing. Also canâ€™t go wrong with the SPF, although it still has a sunscreen scent but not too strong. Love The SPF
