Love this product. Since using this, my morning routine has halved as it has sunscreen and I don’t need to put on any concealer or makeup due to the color correcting. Some people have mentioned the issue with the separation, I’ve had this issue too but find it’s just a natural separation. I find it happens most when I travel or I leave it in the heat. Just put the lid on and shake the product really well and it will go back to its creamy, useable texture! Not a real problem at all! Don’t let the reviews about separation scare you!
