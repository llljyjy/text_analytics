I received this product complimentary for testing and review. This product blends flawlessly into the skin, it matches perfectly so you don’t have to worry about streaks. It hydrated and doesn’t look cakey plus it has SPF so it’s great for summer months. I like that it’s buildable Light weight great coverage
