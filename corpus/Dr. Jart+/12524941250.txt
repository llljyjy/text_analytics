I don’t consider myself to have sensitive skin but I had never tried a peel before so I was a little nervous as to how my skin would react and it worked well for me. It made my skin feel softer after the first use and with using it for about 3/4 times a week for 2 weeks it has made my skin glowy and smooth. It didn’t dry me out or irritate my skin at all. It does have a bit of a scent but it appeals to me. I will definitely repurchase when it’s done! Glowy skin
