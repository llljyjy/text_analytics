I was quite skeptical about this serum. The texture is like water rather than the traditional syrup-y serums, so I wasnâ€™t sure how it would work. I tried it out multiple days as part of my night time routine. This serum was great at making my skin feel so soft and smooth in the morning. Quite impressed. nan
