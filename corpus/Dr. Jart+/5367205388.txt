I added a sample of this to one of my last Sephora orders, as I constantly have a bright red face (sensitive, seborrheic dermatitis plus plain ole eczema, breakouts, etc) am struggling with concealer & foundation lately, plus have been looking for a “quick fix” that doesn’t take long to get ready for work. (Which realistically doesn’t exist lol). I also haven’t had much luck with other green color-correcting products (they simply don’t work, or don’t work well enough - no negative side effects). Anyway, the seb derm part of my issues is in fact fungal/malassezia related, so I knew right off the bat that I’d have to patch test this very sparingly since it has many known triggers. I’ve tried a very small amount two times now in two different areas. When initially applying, I was actually extremely hopeful for a few seconds because it seems to work just the right amount and adjust to my light skin tone almost perfectly. Buuuut within a split second it separated, turning to literally neon orange. It seemed to be well beyond the typical oxidizing that some concealers/foundations and other cosmetics are known to do. Needless to say I immediately wiped it off (gently haha). Even the very few outlying edges that appeared to still be  a normal skin-toned color wiped off the same neon color on my tissue/cloth. My skin was not particularly oily or anything either time that I patch tested this - in face it was a bit more on the dry side. I did use a light moisturizer beforehand both times but not a heavy hand, and gave it plenty of time to absorb on my skin before adding this product. (Also used different moisturizers each time). I haven’t read enough reviews to see if others have had this extreme of a color change with the it, or if I just yet again am lucky enough to have the super weird skin that does completely abnormal things with makeup (amongst other types of products lol).
