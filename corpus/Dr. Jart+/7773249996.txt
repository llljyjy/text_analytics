I love this stuff for getting a lazy day base that makes my skin look even and healthy. I know it doesn’t work for everyone but it does work for my oily sensitive skin. I don’t use it every day but it helps me neutralize the odd blemish and redness on my skin. Its good for no makeup days, just a little of this and powder and that’s it but it makes you look put together nan
