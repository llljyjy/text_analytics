Oily girls can love it too! I love this product although I have oily skin. I sue urban decay all nighter setting powder on top to help control oil. This product keeps my skin looking dewy even with the powder. Itâ€™s so beautiful on the skin. It has buildable coverage. I have acne and sometimes I just want to get rid of the redness without completely painting my face. Would recommend over and over. oily skin can love this too!
