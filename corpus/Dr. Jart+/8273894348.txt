I love this, and I use it instead of a tinted moisturizer or tinted sunscreen! I usually put a sunscreen on underneath because this is only SPF 30, but it lays well on it! The consistency is thicker than I expected, and it spreads easily! If you have oily skin you might want to set it with a powder as it can still feel “wet.” I’m not sure if this broke me out or not as I don’t use it daily, but it’s very nice for if I’m going out and wanting to look a little more put together than how I would without makeup. different but good
