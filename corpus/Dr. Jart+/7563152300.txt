I got this for a review! My face doesn’t like essential oils, so I used this on my thighs where I have some skin texture and typically get ingrown hairs. It did make a difference for me and I’m going to keep using it this way. I’ve used a few body exfoliants in the past and I always preferred chemical over physical because some of my skin is sensitive. Overall I think it’s a nice serum for regular maintenance. The formula is very watery so you’ll still need lotion on top no matter where you use it. nan
