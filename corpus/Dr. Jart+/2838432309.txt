I loved this product so much!! I love that it has spf so I know I am protected while I’m out in the sun or running errands. I love that it moisturizes and hydrates my skin so no need to apply a moisturizer before using this because it already hydrates your skin. And last but not least this product provides a medium to full coverage foundation so no need to apply foundation as this already does it. Couldn’t have asked for a better product all in one bottle. Love it
