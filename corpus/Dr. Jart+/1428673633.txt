Like the consistency and it sinks into skin really well. It has a very faint green color to counteract redness. I would recommend for drier skin types as this could probably make oily skin slick. The downgrade of 2 stars is for the highly fragrant oils. One of which smells like lavender which is very sensitizing for sensitive skin. So if you have truly sensitive skin this will probably irritate your skin. highly fragrant
