I swear by this. Please make sure you use it correctly, PRESS IT IN first before you rub. You only need a little and then you can build. I believe most bad reviews are from not applying it correct. Iâ€™ve shown people this in person and have changed their mind about this product. This makes me confident to go almost naked faced to the gym, or just around anywhere. It protects your face and feels good (IF used properly). try using it correctly!
