After a long search for a foundation with spf that will cover my red, eczema, acne-prone skin I found this product and I’m happy to commit to using this every day, forever. I do have oily skin so I often blot throughout the day and this product stays on well after blotting. The most interesting part is its ability to change color from pale green to nude and blends well with my skin tone. The best part is the ability to control how green you want the product to be when applying. Even though the green can disappear, it’s still effective at controlling redness. After applying setting powder it still looks good and not cakey. After a long search
