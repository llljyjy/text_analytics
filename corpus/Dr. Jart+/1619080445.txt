I saw an ad for this on the Sephora app and decided to give it a try on a whim. Glad I did. This BB cream is buttery soft and just melts onto your skin without being heavy.  The coverage is buildable, however, just one pump is more than enough to cover any marks on my face.  I highly recommend. Absolutely
