This is matte which is exactly what i look for in a sunscreen. Dries to a somewhat powdery finish. Didnt irritate my acne prone skin and works well alone and under makeup. Heres my only complaint: it is really thick. After applying 2 layers you start to look ghostly white and this is coming from a pale person. The price is too high as well Would love if it wasnt as thick or white
