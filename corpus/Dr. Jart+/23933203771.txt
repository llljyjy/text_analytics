I am not so sure about this one.. I really wanted to love it, but I’m kind of disappointed. 1) This is expensive and for the amount of product you get (which is too little), I really had HIGH expentations. 2) I put this on the area around my mouth, which is very dehydrated and sensitive. I was hoping it would have a soothing effect, but it started burning as soon as I applied it. I have to endure the burning effect because I did not want to waste this expensive cream, but it was totally useless.3) It is fast absorbing, which is why I will give this product a couple of stars, but it doesn’t nourish the skin as much as I thought it would. 4) I’ll say it again, NOT ENOUGH PRODUCT (at least for the price paid...). I feel like someone who loves this cream would go through the tube really fast! nan
