Good substitute for foundation on my fair skin. I like the lightweight feeling, and the SPF in the product. I like that it does not cover my freckles, it just corrects any redness. I set it with a powder because of my oily skin. You donâ€™t need much of this at all, a small amount covers the whole face. Will Repurchase
