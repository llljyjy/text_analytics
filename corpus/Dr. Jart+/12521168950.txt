I’m using the Dr Jart tinted moisturizer and I love it, so I was super excited to try this kit. I have eczema year round, and my face is prone to redness. The directions say you can use the serum and cream at night as well, but I just all 3 in the morning before I start my makeup routine. It’s lightweight and does not leave a sticky residue, so it works well to have before makeup. I’ve been using it for a week, and I noticed my makeup sits better, and my face isn’t as red anymore. My face doesn’t feel irritated anymore either! I’m a big fan of Dr Jart, and I’m so happy this product line works for my skin. Buying the full size!
