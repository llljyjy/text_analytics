This was a nice light coverage bb cream. I would say it has more of a dewy finish than a natural finish but I still looked good.  It is buildable but it makes the color darker and then it didnâ€™t match my skin tone. By the end of the day it seemed to have worn off some even though I used setting spray with it. Loved the high level of sun screen though! nan
