Like many of us, one thing I appreciated about the pandemic was the shift away from full daily concealer and foundation. I found this product thanks to a Sephora employee who mentioned its popularity on TikTok. Deeply uncool, I had no idea about it. I marveled as she helped blend it on the back of my hand and had me hold my hands side by side. Amazing. I purchased immediately and have not looked back. I also tried the traditional Tiger Grass Cream, but I like this better for its lighter feel. Loves: light feel, blend-ability, SPF(!!!), the -idea- of the dropper for spreadable application.Nots: Packaging makes getting the last drops out nearly impossible and the dropper could be better. Not the tightest seal for the cap. SPF dewy blending yes yes yes
