Only sunscreen that did not break me out- that I have ever tried in my life! No white cast, and dries down within an hour or two. Sits nicely under makeup but you have to use primer and foundation that agrees with it. You will be shiny for a while while it dries down, to me that’s not a big deal. After it absorbs you can’t tell that you ever put it on in the first place. This is a great sunscreen I would recommend it to anyone having trouble finding something that doesn’t flare up their acne, fungal outbreaks, and sensitive skin. Love this Fantastic, life saver
