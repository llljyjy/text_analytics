I used this mask after a week of using the serum. I do have open pores very visibly on my cheek areas. This mask was mess free and there wasnâ€™t any fragrance. It did clear up my skin even more by removing any lingering blackheads without opening my pores. However I give it 4 stars because it was super dehydrating after the 20mins were up and before I rinsed it off. Good mud mask
