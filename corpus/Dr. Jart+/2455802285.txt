I have slight redness in my face, some days worse than others, and use Cicapair cream to cover it when needed, however I’ve always wanted to try this. I received a gift card so figured I would finally try this and I’m so glad I did. I was shocked when I woke up the next morning after using it right before sleep and my complexion looked so good!  Barely any redness!  And it wasn’t just the redness- my complexion just looked better. Maybe brighter. This Cica line from Dr Jart is just amazing. Excellent for Redness!
