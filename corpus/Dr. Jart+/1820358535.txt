I received a light medium-medium and it definitely leans way more towards medium than light. I did not think this was light coverage, although using less still covers my skin. I might have liked it better if I had gotten the Fair-light but Iâ€™ve always been a light medium and just found it to be too yellow. It looks fine in person but in pictures it looks too tan on me. I do like that it hydrates and has SPF, it smells slightly like sunscreen. Overall it does a good job covering up imperfections, and I might have liked it more if I had gotten a lighter shade. nan
