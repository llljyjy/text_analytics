I am pleasantly surprised that this sheet mask is only $9. That’s about the same price as the junk ones you can get at the drugstore that do nothing lol. This is EXTREMELY soothing and relieved my face immediately. I am planning on getting more to keep in my fridge to combat future rosacea flare-ups. This is completely fragrance free (and no essential oils like in other Dr Jart products either). I usually keep the FAB oatmeal mask in my fridge for this purpose, but this sheet mask is more hydrating (Keeping your masks chilled will really boost the soothing effect!). The “poreless“ look this gives you is due to the caffeine in it, which is temporary of course, but it would be nice to use before an event or something to have extra flawless looking skin. If I had events to attend lol. sensitive rosacea skin
