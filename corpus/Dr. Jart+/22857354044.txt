I’m absolutely obsessed with this bb cream skincare foundation. I love the fact that the formula feels lightweight when wearing and leaves my skin looking natural/hydrated! The foundation even comes with a pump and distributes the right amount of product. I’m only giving this foundation four starts because they need a better range of shades. The fair to light foundation I received had too much of a pink undertone for my fair skin. Other than that, I highly recommend this foundation!! Love, but they need a better range of shades!
