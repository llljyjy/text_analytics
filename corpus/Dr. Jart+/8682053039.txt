I got this product complimentary from Influenster! I absolutely love this product. I don’t normally wear bb cream as I have in the past and it made me break out (not this brand). But now that I’m older I decided to try it again. Sometimes I wear this by itself since it has SPF in it and sometimes I wear it with makeup. It has a good scent, perfect color match and makes my skin super nice and it makes it even better it has spf in it to protect myself from the sun anywhere I go rather it’s just in the car etc. I definitely recommend this product plus the brand is great! I would buy this product again and again!
