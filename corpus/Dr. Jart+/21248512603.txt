I’ve been using this product on my skin on and off for the last 3-4 years and it’s perfect. I have extremely sensitive/ naturally red skin and have eczema on my face but this neutralizes almost everything. Not to mention is lasts so long and has spf in it so I’m able to layer it on top of my sunscreen for extra protection. Highly recommend! Perfect for sensitive skin
