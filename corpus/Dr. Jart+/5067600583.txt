This is a trustworthy spf for me. Yes the texture is questionable, especially this second time for some reason it looks super seperated,  the paste and oil. I’m guessing the paste is the sun protectant and the oil is the centella asiática. I don’t remember it looking like that last time I purchased it but I still use it everyday. I trust broadband spectrum mineral physical sunscreens and this is that. Since it has that green/white cast when I stamp it on my face after my skincare I can see where I’m protected where I missed and then afterwards blend it in so it’s not so white casted. The ingredients and the green hue are perfect for me because I use a lot of active ingredients like prescription retinol, aha, bha, and spa treatments. So I constantly have flaky sensitized skin. This spf soothes and can calm my skin reducing redness and is my go to even though I have so many other spfs. Also apart from sensitized skin, I naturally have sensitive skin and easily break out, this spf doesn’t break me out. It works for me. I love it, my favorite spf so far! Works for me, I love it, my favorite spf so far!
