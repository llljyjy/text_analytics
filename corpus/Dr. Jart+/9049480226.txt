I am not into wearing foundation often, but I do get acne and redness from time to time. This is a really great middle ground for me. It offers enough coverage to cancel out redness while still having a more natural look. Of course that is not the main purpose of wearing this but that is what I like about it as opposed to other SPF lotions or foundations. nan
