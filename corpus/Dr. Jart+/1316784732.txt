This mask is mess free in a way but application has a learning curve. I would recommend keeping one of the layers on when placing the mask on your face and THEN peeling it off. The mask is relatively small on the face. Noticed my skin felt a bit smoother after I took it off (the mask dries down and you kind of peel it off) but I’d recommend one of dr jart’s rubber masks OR if you want a mud mask get an actual mud mask.Recvd complimentary sample for review nan
