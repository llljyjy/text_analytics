I don’t recommend this for fair skin tones. I used a tiny amount and my face was bright orange. It looked like I used a fake tanner and didn’t blend evenly. I enjoyed the texture of the product but it is scented and it burned my skin upon application. I can see why some people like this, but I do not recommend for fair and/or sensitive skin. I’ve returned mine after the first use. Not for fair or sensitive skin
