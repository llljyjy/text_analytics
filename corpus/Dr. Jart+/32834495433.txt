I am olive toned and received the med-tan shade of this product. When I first put it on I was a bit worried because it looked a bit yellow, but it blended beautiful and left my skin with a nice glow. It is scentless as well, which I like. Would definitely recommend. I received this product free for an honest review. Blendable, Buildable, and Luminous
