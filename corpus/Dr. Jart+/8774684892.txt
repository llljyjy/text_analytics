I honestly wanted to love this product but it just was not right for me. It has a really gritty texture even if I followed how this product should be applied. I even YouTube searched ways to make me actually use my money’s worth of product. I usually don’t break out but I do have combo skin, this stuff broke me out the second I used it. Also this didn’t really colour correct for me, maybe because I have tan skin, it just made me look pale. I would rather buy a cc or bb cream and use that instead. nan
