I received this product free in exchange for my honest review. This product felt great on my skin & it blended in very smoothly but the color was too peach for my skin. I do recommend this product if you can get a color that matches you skin tone. It looked really good it just was not the correct shade for me. This is the first time I have found a BB that blended in so well for me. nan
