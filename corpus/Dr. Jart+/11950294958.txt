I have been a fan of Dr. Jart+ for some time, however do not find this product all that effective on my dry skin. It is non-irritating (I also have sensitive/reactive skin), so I could see this being a great choice for someone just starting out on chemical exfoliants, or for those that have ultra-sensitive skin that cannot handle most products containing stronger AHA/BHAs. Non-Irritating, Yet Not As Effective As Iâ€™d Like
