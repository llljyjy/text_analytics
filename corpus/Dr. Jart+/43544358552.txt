At first, I didn’t really like this product much, because I thought the reviews were overhyping it a little. However, it does get rid of a lot of redness on my face and leaves it looking dewy and even-toned, so I’m honestly loving it. Highly recommend buying this if you have a lot of hyperpigmentation! Good for acne scars and hyperpigmentation!
