I love this product to deal with the rosacea on my Irish complexion.  It’s got a mousse consistency and is cooling going on.  The scent is very fresh, kind of herbal, and clean.  I like this so much because it goes on light green and turns to beige.  The Sephora rep recommended it because I’m color blind and afraid of using color correctors that will leave me green, only I won’t know!  I use this before my base and concealer, and it really helps to make my complexion more even.  SO glad it was recommended to me! Finally, a great product for Roseacea!
