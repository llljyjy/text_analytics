I wanted to love this product because I love the skin care moisturizer and eye creams. However, this BB cream did not suit my skin. Like others mentioned, it does come with a limited shade range and appears off skin tone when first applied, though I do think it adapts over the course of the day. My main issue with it is that it sits on the pores and fine lines and makes my T zone very oily (I have combination skin). I even tried applying a primer underneath and some translucent powder on top, but I did make my skin look smooth by the end of the day. Will be returning the product unfortunately. Worsens skin texture
