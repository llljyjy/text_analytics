I really enjoy the serum and the tiger grass cream, they both leave my skin feeling very soft and moisturized with out being greasy. It also did help to reduce redness a little bit. I wasnâ€™t a fan of the color corrector in the jar, it made my skin very greasy and caused me to break out. I recieved this product free for testing from influenster and Dr. Jart Fan of 2 of 3
