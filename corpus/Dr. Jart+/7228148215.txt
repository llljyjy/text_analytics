The reviews on this confuse me a bit. A lot of people said that it is not well-suited for pale skin with cool undertones. As someone with pale skin and cool undertones, the colour was actually really well-suited for me. I also found that it was pretty easy to spread around. Not sure if it’s because I used it right after applying my moisturizer? I focus the application in areas with more redness, and used only a little bit in others and I think this avoided the muddiness others have complained of. I really like it... but the price is painful. I’m not sure I’d purchase the full-size. Really good on cool skin tones... but the price
