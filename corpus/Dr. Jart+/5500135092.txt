I have rosacea and pale skin, 44, and really hate wearing foundation. This is my holy grail product, just a miracle in a bottle! I use Drunk Elephant’s Lala Retro (because I live in a dry climate), some Murad sunscreen and then this and I am good to go. All the products work well together; but if you have oily skin might want something different. I am super dry and flaking at the moment.  Make  sure you have a good moisturizer because if you have dry skin or are older this can get a bit dry looking if you don’t use moisturizer first. Works great over my sunscreen. Only issue is if you are super pale this may slightly darken your skin but it is faint. I had a slight sunburn and it hid it very well. Where have you been all my life?
