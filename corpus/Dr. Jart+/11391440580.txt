This is hands down the best, least greasy face sunscreen I have ever tried. I love this for everyday wear. I have *very* fair, combination, sensitive, acne prone skin. I’ve almost used an entire bottle with no breakouts. It wears beautifully under makeup, doesn’t leave a cast, and doesn’t pill. It has a slight, pleasant citrus smell when applied, but after a few minutes, it goes away. I had reservations about spending $40 for >2 ounces of sunscreen, but it is worth every single penny. I finally enjoy wearing sunscreen!
