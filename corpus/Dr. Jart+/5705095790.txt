I’ve been trying this out for a few weeks and I noticed that it’s oddly moisturizing for something exfoliating and pore centered. It doesn’t dry my skin out but I notice a change in pores. I have yet to find a product to clear my pores but that’s an unrealistic request! The mask was nice and my skin felt tight and plump serum & face mask!
