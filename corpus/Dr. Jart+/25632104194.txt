I like this product a lot. You don’t need a lot. It blends so well into my (fair) skin tone. It’s not an absolute miracle worker but this makes me feel so much more confident when I have a lot of hormonal acne. Love that it’s SPF 30 too, just makes me sure that my acne is super protected from the sun. I use this kind of like a concealer for redness, I wouldn’t apply to my entire face. lovely for redness and acne redness
