This stuff goes on really smooth like a moisturizer and the greenish hue slowly turns beige as you blend it in. I was worried that the colour wouldn’t match my skin tone but it actually really looks like my skin, and I don’t have to worry about little spots where it isn’t blended properly like a foundation. Having said that, I am still recovering from a pretty bad rosacea flare and have awful redness. I have to apply a second coat to really get full coverage, but the first coat does cut through the redness a lot. It also feels weirdly velvety on my face for like 5 mins right after I put it on, and it’s really shiny but eventually this goes away. If you have very dry skin, moisturizing first is a MUST because I noticed all my dry spots were very obvious. At the end of the day I’m glad I tried it and really like putting something on my skin that will actually help it, unlike just wearing makeup. Definitely worth a try!
