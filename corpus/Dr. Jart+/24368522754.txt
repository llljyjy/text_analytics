Disclaimer: I received this product for free from Influenster and Dr. Jart and this is an honest review! While it isn’t good to pop pimples, I had to pop one on my cheek. That night I went to bed with a pimple patch and used this kit the morning after instead of my normal serum & moisturizer. I noticed the redness in my skin disappear after I let the color corrector set on my skin and I noticed my acne scars weren’t as intense as they normally are. This is a simple way to make your skin look clearer without wearing makeup. I have tried using the serum and the cream alone and didn’t notice a huge difference in appearance, so I believe the color corrector helped the most. Great for toning down redness
