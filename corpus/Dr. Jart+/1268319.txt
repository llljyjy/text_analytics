I’m wearing this on my no-makeup days…but I think I’ll wear it during  the week to work instead of foundation.  My skin has never looked better:  even, smooth, and no redness.  I apply this product after skincare and sunscreen, and top it off with a light application of Dior No Powder Powder.  Perfect! Where has this been all my life?
