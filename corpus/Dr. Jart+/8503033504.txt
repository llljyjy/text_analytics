This kit was just okay. It definitely did not provide much “redness rescue”. I have pretty pink/red cheeks and both the serum and cream did not help even with multiple uses (honestly didn’t expect them to). They had a really lovely herbal scent and the cream almost reminded me of an ointment in the best way, it was extremely hydrating on my dry skin and I really enjoyed it! Didn’t leave me feeling oily and it soaked into my skin well. The color correcting SPF did mildly help with redness and I didn’t dislike it but unfortunately it definitely didn’t play nice with my makeup! Smeared everywhere and just looked awful. Would be good for a no makeup day. I wouldn’t repurchase this kit or recommend it but I did really like the Cicapair Tiger Grass Cream and would repurchase and recommend for someone with dry skin. Love the cream!
