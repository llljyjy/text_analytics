Omg. I just put 2 on my face as I have sun damage from years of not using spf.   After 2 hours I took them off and I could instantly tell the difference.  Did not sting. Did not burn. I do have sensitive somewhat dry skin (Iâ€™m 53) and has no issues except for trying to get the spots off of the paper.  I am definitely buying these again. And again. highly recommend for sun damage on face.
