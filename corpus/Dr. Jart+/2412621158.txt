I actually received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I really enjoy this beauty balm--although, it is the first one I’ve used, so I don’t have anything to compare it to. It has light/medium coverage in my opinion and is enough to even out my skintone and give ma flawless finish. Overall this beauty balm definitely gives off more of a dewy finish, so if you are on the oily side you may or may not like this. My only con about this is that the shade I have leans slightly more pink and my tone fits better with warm/olive. Other than that, this is a great product and I will continue to use it! I would repurchase!
