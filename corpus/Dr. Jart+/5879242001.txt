This is such a fun and easy to use mask. I have dry skin and this helps add some much needed hydration to my night time skin care routine. The mask itself is made of a rubbery material that is applied to your face after you apply a serum thatâ€™s also included. Application is easy! I leave the mask on for about 20 minutes then follow up with my night time skin care routine by adding some oil and moisturizer before bedtime. nan
