I really loved this mask. My skin has been extremely dry and irritated due Texas Heat and a chemical burn thatâ€™s still healing. Instructions were easy and clear to follow, applying the mask itself was also pretty simple. It left my skin feeling hydrated, smooth, and cool. Overall I HIGHLY recommend and would definitely repurchase! worked GREAT on my dry/irritated skin
