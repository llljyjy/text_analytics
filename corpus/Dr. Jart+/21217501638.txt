Putting this mask on was super messy and not the biggest fan of the smell but overall I enjoyed it. The mask at first has a nice cooling sensation which I really liked, left my skin feeling nice and smooth afterwards. Love that I only had to have it on for about 15-20 minutes and then could go about my day or night. This mask + the PHA exfoliating serum â€¦ amazing combo left my skin feeling amazing. nan
