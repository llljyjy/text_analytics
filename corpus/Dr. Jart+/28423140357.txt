My first impression about this product was the clean and elegant packaging, it is a hard tube with a pump that works great. The scent is mild, which I prefer, and the texture is yummy, it really is a hydrating balm. It blends well on the skin and feels light like the brand says, a breathable formula. About the color, my shade came wrong as y’all can see on the pictures, so unfortunately I couldn’t use it on my entire face and see how long the effect would last, but I did use it on top of a mineral sunscreen that leaves a  white cast and it worked perfectly this way, I love the finish of this balm and I used it as a contour as well. Specifics - the purpose of the product is very interesting, first of all, it is a blend of physical and chemical active ingredients to play the role of sun protection, besides the 40 SPF it is a broad spectrum that means that is protecting from both UV rays and the tint on it helps to protect against visible light which helps to prevents worsening the cases of hyperpigmentation, dyschromia, dark spots, etc… It also has some ingredients like niacinamide that helps to brighten up and even out the skin tone, it is also an antioxidant ingredient. Hope it is a helpful review and yes I do recommend it, but get it in the right shade, please haha Great Surprise
