I was sent the DrJart beauty balm for review (incentivized). I really enjoyed this product. The all in one cc cream is hydrating, comfortable to wear, and lasted all day. The balm is light to medium coverage and conceals dark marks well. I felt my shade was just a touch warm for me but still work out. If you like a simple quick makeup routine this product is a must buy hands down. Only person I donâ€™t see this working for are those with oily skin. quick and easy makeup
