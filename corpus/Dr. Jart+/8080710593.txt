At first I thought I didn’t like this enough, but when a little over and hour passed, I notice like my skin was getting rid of black heads, it’s like it cleaned them out. I usually have a very hard time removing them, I usually need a needle, but after I used the mask it was sooo easy. At first I felt like it hydrated my skin, but then…it felt a little drier. I was scared because I felt a cooling sensation in my skin and some products that feel like that burn my skin and this didn’t. Overall this did good. I could even get this again just to unclog my pores. Great to unclog pores
