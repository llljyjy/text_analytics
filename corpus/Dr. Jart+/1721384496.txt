This mask is amazing!! Instantly calmed my burning skin! I used retinol last night and my skin was burning & itchy all day today + redness. After putting on another brand mask that was supposed to calm down my skin, the burning sensation worsen. Couldnâ€™t bare it after 30 seconds. Had to rip it off. Then I remember I bought this Dr. JART cicapair mask a month back. Popped it on and instantly my skin stopped the burning sensation. Wow. So rare that a product does what it claims. If you have over exfoliated or using retinol, I highly recommend this mask! Best calming mask
