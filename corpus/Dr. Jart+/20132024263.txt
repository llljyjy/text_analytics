I wanted to love this after being recommended it, but I dont. It’s very heavy on my face, doesn’t absorb well (maybe that’s the point) it also rubs off/pills up HOURS after I applied it (as in, you can’t touch your face), and it didnt neutralize the moderate redness in one of my cheeks at all- which is why I bought this. Sure, it helped the very minor/unnoticeable redness in other parts of my face, but those didnt bother me. This felt far more like heavy duty foundation/sunscreen rather than a skincare product, and I dont like foundation. You’re better off with a light/medium coverage foundation to remove redness than this. I also have very dry skin, so again, especially baffling for this to be so heavy and uncomfortable. Feels like heavy foundation and not effective
