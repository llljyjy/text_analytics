I am a big fan of Dr.Jart but I really didn’t like this product. It’s expensive and did nothing for my redness and sensitivity. It also has a very overwhelming herbal smell that took several hours to dissipate on my skin. The smell of the product actually caused irritation which was very disappointing. Strong Smell and Sensitizing
