I love the idea of a mud mask in the form of a sheet mask! For someone as lazy as I am, itâ€™s a blessing to be able to use a mud mask quickly and easily. I actually did not find it difficult to use or open, and it was not messy which I greatly appreciated. My skin felt soft and moisturized after using it, though it did not do much for my pores. The Serum was much better for that! Maybe it takes multiple uses... Convenient and Easy!
