My first impression of this product is that I really love the studio packaging. This BB premium beauty bomb makes me feel really good when I use it because the ingredients used to make it are amazing for your skin. I love this as a summer foundation because of the broad-spectrum SPF 40. But because of the SPF, it does have an overwhelming, suntan lotion smell. I think that the best way to describe how this beauty balm looks on my skin is my skin but better it has an amazing full coverage look and it is definitely buildable! Nice!
