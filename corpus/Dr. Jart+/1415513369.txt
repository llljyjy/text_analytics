Really great product! I have the Fair-Light shade, and as someone who has VERY neutral undertones, the shade is almost perfect, and a little really does go a long way while providing excellent coverage. Itâ€™s not quite a perfect product for me because I do wish the shades were more expansive, but overall this is a terrific BB cream that exceeded my expectations. Buildable, mixes well with other products, looks GORGEOUS on the skin, and I love the SPF 40 coverage. nan
