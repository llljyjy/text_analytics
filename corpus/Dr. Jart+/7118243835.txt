I am so happy with the results of this cream. My face suffered a burn from the Halo laser treatment leaving two noticeable red burn marks. I have been using soothing creams to slowly heal the burn and tried many creams to cover it up. I don’t want to use a ton of make up to irritate it and make it look unnatural which would just invite more attention to those spots. I was using Ilia Slip Tint which worked nicely but it comes off from wearing a mask and still looked like make. I tried the camp drops and it was just incredible. The redness is almost no existent when I use it and the effect is extremely natural. It looks like you have flawless skin with no makeup. I still had to put some concealer for my age spots. I highly recommend this product for a sleek, fresh and flawless no makeup look. I have not tried it with an extra sunscreen so I’m wearing a hat out in the sun. Just so happy you have found this product by accident in a goodie bag from Sephora. One thing I have to say is that the name and description does not really explain well what it does. I had a hard time understanding what it is and what is the difference amongst the product on this range. This is a fabulous product but it could do better with marketing and explanations. I was looking exactly for a product like this but it never came up on my searches. Very effective
