I absolutely love how this product neutralizes redness and almost gives me a makeup appearance but I get to be makeup free ! It is more of a thicker product and takes a little time to rub in. I usually would use sparingly and pat in, then use a makeup brush to blend more evenly after. Let sit for a few minutes to take full affect :) great option for those who are acne prone but donâ€™t want to be completely natural face (no makeup) love Dr. jarts!
