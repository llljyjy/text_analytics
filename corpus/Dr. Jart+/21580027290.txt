I was soooo excited to try this because I have some redness and Ive heard amazing things, but I was very disappointed when I tried this:( first of all it left me looking very yellowish/orange and if anything it made me even redder in my cheeks. The texture wasn’t very pleasant either, but I didn’t care that much about it and was willing to work through, but the more I had this product on the more I realized I hated it! (For reference I am very pale so perhaps it could work on someone with more yellow undertones??) Very yellow/orange on pale skin
