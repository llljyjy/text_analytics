The reason I’m only giving 4 star for this mask is because I don’t feel like it’s strong enough to make an affect on anyone’s skin for the first time. I do love the soft feeling after washing my face though. Use it as a combo with the pore remedy serum, it’ll help with the pore faster! Good mud mask!
