I received this product complimentary from Dr. Jart and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This is the first time that I have used a product like this so I have nothing to compare it to. This product has a creamy consistency and is easy to apply. It didn’t cause irritation other than a slight warming of the skin that was not unpleasant. It’s not drying, I did not need to use moisturizer. My skin is always extremely soft and feels plump the day after using it but otherwise I didn’t see much of a difference in texture or discoloration. I’ve been using it for about three weeks - will need to use it longer to see if it truly makes a difference. Worth a try if you have the money to spend - if nothing else I enjoy how soft my skin is. nan
