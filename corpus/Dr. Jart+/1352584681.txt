I received this new product from Influenster recently and I was happy to test it out since Dr. Jart is known to make great products. I have recently gotten into BB creams because of the fact that they’re skincare and makeup in one product and I don’t care for heavy full coverage in my base products. This hits all my must haves, I love that it has amazing ingredients for the skin such as Niacinamide and Glycerin. It’s super moisturizing and hydrating without feeling heavy. The coverage is great, just enough to even out my skin tone without masking it. It looks natural, like your skin but better. Gives it a beautiful natural looking dewy glow. The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does have natural fragrance in it and I avoid any kind of fragrances in my skincare and makeup products. They are from essential oils, but I also try to avoid those just because my skin tends to be sensitive. However, I haven’t had any bad reactions to my skin from using it so that’s great! I do wish they come out with a fragrance free, EO free version for those who don’t like any kind of fragrances in the ingredients. Other than that, this is a winner! Great BB Cream option!
