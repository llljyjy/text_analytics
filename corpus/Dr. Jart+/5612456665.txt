I really wanted to like this, especially after reading raving reviews but this product did absolutely nothing for me. It was very water like and didnâ€™t wipe across the skin well. It also has a very medicine like smell. Not only that, but there was no difference in my skin after using as directed for a month. No noticeable difference
