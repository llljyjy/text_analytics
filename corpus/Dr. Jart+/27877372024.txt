I originally received this in a Dr. Jart+ gift set, and it quickly became one of my favorite products. I use it as an alternative to foundation on most days, and I love that it color corrects and has SPF. I was skeptical since I’ve used other green-to-beige products that don’t fully blend and leave an odd residue, so I was super pleased. The texture is great, and I love the formula. Perfect foundation alternative
