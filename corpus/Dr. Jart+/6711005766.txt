Effective redness reducer. I used to have this years ago and then forgot about it until they relaunched it. Being very fair skinned with redness on my cheeks chin and around my nose I find itâ€™s hard to cover up with foundation or concealer. This is an excellent product. I actually use it like a primer all over my face set it with a bit of powder and then add concealer where I need it. It has completely removed my need for attended moisturizer. However, in the summertime when I have a bit more of a tan it does not look correct on me. effective
