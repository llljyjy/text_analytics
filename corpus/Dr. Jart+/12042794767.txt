Not a terrible serum but not something I would repurchase again. The scent is strong so I can see why some may not like it. To me it was relaxing. Didnâ€™t really see any difference when I used it. Maybe a slight difference in redness on my face but not a major change. The serum felt odd. Almost like a tacky feeling? nan
