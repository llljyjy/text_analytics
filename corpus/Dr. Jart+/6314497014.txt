It is very nice bb cream has medium coverage and lasts all day with good setting spray and powder. I wouldn’t recommend it if you don’t like dewy skin finish. I used light color and it has bit grayish tone that most Asian bb creams have. It is not affordable I do think there is more affordable options available in the market. nan
