I’ve never been a fan of tinted moisturizers but this one is incredible. It matches my skin and leaves my skin looking dewy but not tacky and it covers all of my redness! I love the formula of this. It doesn’t cling to any of my dry patches and the SPF is such an awesome bonus especially in the summer months! This also lasted all day when I was out running errands and my skin still looked amazing 12 hours after putting it on. I also have very sensitive skin and this didn’t break me out! I’m so impressed with this product!
