The formula itself was very soft and non irritating, but after only 10-15 minutes my skin started flaking, I have naturally dry skin but was shocked because I had just put all my moisturizers on and then tried this product and didn’t enjoy. Sadly, if you have dry skin, I definitely wouldn’t recommend Disappointing :(
