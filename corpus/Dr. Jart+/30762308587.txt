I loved this stuff at first, but it doesn’t last as long as it says it should.  Meaning the quality product deteriorates before expected.  It has a “use by“ date of 12 months from the date of opening.  After 6 months the product started to separate, would leave clumps/grit feeling on the skin, and would not mix back together.  I guess If you use it every day and before the 6 month time period, I would recommend it, but make sure to use it before 6...probably even before 5 months after purchase.   I probably won’t purchase again just because I don’t use it fast enough to justify throwing half of it away. Ok if you use quickly.
