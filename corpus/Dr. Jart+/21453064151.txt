I Received This Product From Influenster For My Honest Review. I Have Been Using This Serum For Ablut Teo Weeks, And Right Away I Noticed That It Evened Out My Skin Tone And Began To Reduce Discoloration Within The First 1-2 Days. It Also Works Well To Reduce Pores And Create An Even Skin Texture. I Use This Twice Daily After Cleansing And Before Moisturizer. The Serum Is Not Heavy And Absorbs Into The Skin Well. I Also Noticed That It Is Not Drying, Which Was One Of My Concerns With Trying Out This Type Of Product. After A Few Days, My Skin Is Noticeably Brighter And With A More Even Texture. Great
