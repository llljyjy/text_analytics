I loved it!. I’ve been using for over 2 years now. a jar lasts me about 6-8 months deepening. I use it everyday and sometimes twice a day depending on how many times I wash my face. I use it as a CC cream. After I wash my face I moisturize then I put this after. I get compliments on how my skin loos and ( I do think my skin can look better) but this does the job  perfectly. Mine also does sometimes cooperate with the clear like liquid but that doesn’t make a difference with how the products works.. WORTH THE BUY!
