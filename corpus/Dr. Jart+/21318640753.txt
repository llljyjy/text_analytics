Surprising texture ( it’s heavier than anticipated) but it’s awesome! Blends in perfect, light coverage, neutralizes redness. It’s my go-to now for days I’m not really wearing makeup. Very hydrated finish, so if you want Matt you’ll need powder. Some folks mentioned it goes orange, this was not my experience but It def changes to a set colour and not your skin tone. It’s just very sheer also so something to think about if you’re worries about it matching. I have fairly light skin (Polish/Scottish person here) and some noticing redness in the cheeks. For reference. Worth it but read reviews!
