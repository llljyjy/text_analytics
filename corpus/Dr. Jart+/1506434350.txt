This mask seemed like a gamble but I was curious and mud masks are a pain because they are messy ans hard to remove. Follow the directions and don’t remove the one side of the plastic that covers the mask aka the one not facing your skin, until it’s on your face. The actual mask part is heavy because it is soaked in the mud treatment and it’s hard to move around when it’s not attached to the paper/plastic covering. The bottom section of the mask doesn’t fit well. If you try to move ans adjust it too much the mask fabric starts to stretch out ans you have to make it work. 5 stars for the actual results of smooth, soft skin with reduced blackhead appearance ans 4 stars for the design of the mask which is tricky. I Good results, tricky mask to apply
