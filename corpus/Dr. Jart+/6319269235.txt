Such a GREAT product!! I have mild rosacea on my face and my redness tends to intensify on my cheeks & forehead. I’ve tried multiple moisturizers, serums and redness neutralizers but none have worked like this. It completely cancelled the redness in my face while hydrating my dry skin and providing me SPF when out during the day. It left me with a nice dewy hydrated look and left my skin actually feeling hydrated. It wore extremely well throughout the day and it didn’t rub off as easily when blowing my nose for example. Overall, it’s a great product that works for me. Like I mentioned, I do have mild rosacea so my experience will be different than others. It’s worth giving a shot even if it means trying a sample first! GREAT STUFF
