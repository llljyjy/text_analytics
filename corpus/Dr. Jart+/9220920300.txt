I USED THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME TODAY, I RECEIVED IT COMPLIMENTARY AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. IT MATCHED MY SKIN TONE PERFECTLY, IT HAD THE PERFECT AMOUNT OF COVERAGE AND WAS LIGHTWEIGHT ON MY SKIN AND ALSO BLENDED WELL WITH MY OTHER PRODUCT. WAY TO GO DR.JART+ FOR THIS ONE! 10/10 RECOMMEND! A MUST HAVE
