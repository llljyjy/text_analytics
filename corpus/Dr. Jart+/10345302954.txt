I typically do not wear tinted moisturizers because the ones Iâ€™ve tried before are greasy. However I was pleasantly surprised with this one! It did not leave a greasy finish and actually blended into my skin well while hiding imperfections. The price is a little high, but a little goes a long way so this would last for a while! Super surprised!
