This product is nice if you figure out how to use it properly. The first time I used this cream I applied it to my face and blended it with my fingers and then buffed it out with a beauty blender. I absolutely hated it - I put waaaay too much on and I looked orange and cakey (I have very fair skin with acne scarring). The second time I used it, I used only a small amount and warmed it up on my finger tips and then patted it into my skin and followed with my beauty blender. This was perfection. It feels lightweight and does a nice job neutralizing redness. To my gals with fine lines and wrinkles- this product will settle in them but it’s easy to blend out throughout the day so it doesn’t bother me too much. I love the SPF in this and it gives a nice healthy look to the skin! Definitely give it a go if you’ve been curious about it :) Healthy looking skin!!!
