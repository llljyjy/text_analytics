I received this product from Influenster and Dr. Jart complimentary in exchange for my honest review. My 2 biggest issues with this serum were the pump and it broke me out in little bumps in my T zone.  For those customers who aren’t allergic to the ingredients… please switch to a dropper applicator as I can guarantee the pump wasn’t only giving me issues. I used my serum for about a week before having to discontinue use so I unfortunately can’t recommend it for others. Not for me
