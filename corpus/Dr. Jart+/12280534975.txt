*Received via Influenster complementary for reviewing purposes * Only got to use once, but was highly impressed on performance and what not. Only real gripe is the shade I got looked VERY orange for a light/medium skin tone product. Thankfully didn’t look as bad in natural lighting. For reference, I did use a primer underneath. So my experience is based off that. I can’t speak for how it’d perform with one. Influenster review
