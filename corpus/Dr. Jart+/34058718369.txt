This product needs to be advertised more as makeup, not skincare. It covers redness somewhat, but duh it has coverage to it like a sheer foundation would. It look good when first applied as the green colour corrects, but unless you’re the exact shade of beige it turns to then it looks the wrong colour for your skin and just looks like makeup. The SPF is SO unnecessary and just makes the product look greasy. The amount you’d have to apply for the SPF to actually be useful is not plausible for the intention of the product. When you try to apply a translucent powder to fix the greasiness it just gets cakey and looks even more like makeup. Not a fan. Looks like makeup, not skincare
