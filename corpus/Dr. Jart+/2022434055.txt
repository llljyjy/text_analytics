I got so many advertisements for this product. I was just disappointed. As it dried, my imperfections (wrinkles, scars, etc.) were defined. I also noticed the green tint didnâ€™t really go away. Then I tried it just for spots and dark circles, it kind of worked better but still was not happy with this product. would not buy again
