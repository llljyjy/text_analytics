I was sent this product for free in exchange for my honest review. First, I was sent the wrong shade, but decided to try it out anyways for testing purposes. The foundation went easily and smooth, but is very scented, like a sunscreen, which I know it is one. It’s suppose to be buildable, but it only is with this product and this product only. I tried finishing my makeup routine and when I got to concealer it the foundation began to seperate from my skin and clump up. At this point I wiped all of it off. This product also did not conceal. If your someone looking to have a little color on your face and keep from burning this is for you, but if you want to use it everyday it just doesn’t work. Again, I know this is a sunscreen, but the scent was overpowering. Not the right shade very scented
