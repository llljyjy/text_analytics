I do BG acting part time and hate when I have to get make up done because their products clog my pores like crazy. So now, during the colder season when UV Index isn’t high and there’s a exterior shoot, I use this and very minimal concealer on either dark spots or a stubborn pimple and I’m done. It looks as if I did the whole shebang with foundation and whatnot. I know this might not work for some people but if you have skin like me, it should be fine. I’m Asian, with a slightly lighter beige skin (I’m a in-between-er, not sand and not beige ....) and warm undertone but it matches my skin really well. I love it!
