I recieved this product for free from influenster for my honest review. Personally I was not a fan of this. It’s not a bad product but I just wasn’t a fan. I didn’t like the way the mask was two pieces instead of one. It didn’t stick to my face and kept falling off. Maybe it was the way I was applying it? I’m not sure. Not for me
