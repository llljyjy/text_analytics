I am so impressed with this product! Once applied to the skin, it covers and calms all blemishes and any redness that is present. It gives you a stunning glow while not being oily in any way. I typically experience so much irritation with most chemical sunscreens, as they often make my eyes sting. However, I did not experience that with this product! I love that it has such a high level of SPF and UV protection. This product is so easy to apply and reapply, especially because I can use it in place of a foundation. Could not recommend more! So impressed with this product!
