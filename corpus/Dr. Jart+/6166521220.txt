This is an everyday staple! Ever since 2020, I wanted to take a step back from heavier make-up and start paying attention more to my skin. However, I do have some redness and hyperpigmentation Iâ€™m not too thrilled about. For the longest time I was self conscious about these imperfections. So much so, that I used to always feel the need to have foundation on before leaving the house. This product perfectly helped me transition to going foundation free a majority of the time. The color correcting element blends perfectly into my skin and blurs the redness around my nose. I also really love that this has SPF as well! Thanks Dr.Jart for helping me to love my own skin again <3 I'm a Changed Woman :)
