This beauty balm has become a new staple in my routine! It is great used as a base foundation as it covers redness really well— way better than other beauty balms I’ve tried. I love that it is SPF 40 and that it doesn’t have a funky smell. It does not leave a white cast at all. Definitely recommend! New staple product
