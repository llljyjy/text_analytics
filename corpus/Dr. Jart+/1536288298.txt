Multiple complaints. Didn’t dry down nicely and clung onto pores for dear life. Had a gray cast on my pale skin (as described in other reviews). Made me look sickly even though color match was decent. Didn’t build well as well for me as described in other reviews, got really muddy looking. Returned. Fair coloring needs some work
