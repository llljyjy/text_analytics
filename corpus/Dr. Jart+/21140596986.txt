I love this so much! I have mild rosacea & some acne scaring & this covers the majority of the redness. Of course it doesn’t cover it all because it’s not a foundation but I love how this looks on the skin & balances out a lot of my redness. It doesn’t have that awful sunscreen look either. I am very pale so I’m not sure how it would be with darker skin tones. Love this! If you have rosacea this is amazing
