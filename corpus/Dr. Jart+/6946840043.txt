I started out loving this product, it covered all redness on my face. And smoothed out my skin texture very nicely. The longer I had this the less I liked it. It began to separate and get very watery, and the water would just sit on top of the product and I couldn’t mix it in. I tried to still use it but it would start to almost pill on my skin and her very textured. Maybe I just got a bad batch but I haven’t reached for it since a consistent week or so of the product not being great. nan
