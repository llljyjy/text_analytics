It did not take me long to fall in love with this sleep mask. It goes on light, soaks in fast (non greasy) and keeps my skin hydrated. After I went I went through my first container, I decided to try a new product and within 3 days I was back at Sephora to rebuy the Cicapair. Price might seem intimidating but a little goes a long way and the jar last a while. Loved it so much I gifted it to my mother, who now also only buys this as a night cream. Love it! My favourite night cream hands down!
