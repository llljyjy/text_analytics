I really love this cream. I was using the ceramidin cream for a while. I bought this because they said it removes redness. I would say... on my skin... it didn’t. I didn’t notice a big difference. Maybe the other type of cream is better. I’d try it in the future. But it made my dry skin feels very hydrated, especially in the zone (my forehead) where it’s usually very dry and I have to put a thick cream to feel ok. It’s also very good for sensitive skin. I’ve never felt any discomfort with the Dr Jart cream. It’s not sticky, it doesn’t make me breakout or makes my skin itchy. ahhhh Dr Jart, always doing wonder
