Bought this mask after I had a bad reaction from a face serum. It helped so much. After putting it on, the rubber was nice and cooling and definitely worked to soothe my skin. I could feel a difference immediately after finishing the treatment. The next morning my skin was almost back to normal. So grateful that this mask saved my skin. Definitely would recommend but be careful since it shouldnâ€™t be used on broken skin. Saved my skin
