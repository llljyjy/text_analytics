I received this mask and the matching serum complimentary in exchange for my honest review and well- I don’t love this. My pores haven’t shrunk or disappeared, this mask is one time use which really isn’t going to give any big differences. Not only this, but I HAVE to moisturize after using these products. It feels soothing and nice on the skin but boy afterwards my skin just feels sucked of all hydration which is not what I ever want. I will not be purchasing this especially for the serum price point. One time mask doesn’t rly do much
