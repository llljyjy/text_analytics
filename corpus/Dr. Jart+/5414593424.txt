I was hesitant to try this because it had no reviews, but I’m actually really happy I tried it! I’ve been using it for just a week, but it’s really improved my skin texture already. I always have a rough texture to my skin because of clogged pores and dry patches, and it feels/looks so much better and smoother. The first use I didn’t notice a huge difference, but every time I use it I feel improvement. I’m excited to see how much better my skins gets with more use. Definitely give it a shot if you also struggle with your skin texture! pleasantly surprised
