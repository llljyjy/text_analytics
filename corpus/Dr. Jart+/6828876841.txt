Very impressed with this! I’ve heard and seen so many good things about it. I was a little worried at first when I read that some people with fair skin tones had issues with it being too dark/orange. I had that issues when I first applied because I rubbed it into my skin and used a tad too much. Once I used less product and pressed it into my skin after rubbing it between my fingers a few times it applied very nicely and looks like a tinted moisturizer on my skin and matches my skin tone. My acne gives me some major self esteem issues but I don’t like putting foundation over my face so this is perfect for me! I’m the morning I wash my face and use a light moisturizer, then once the moisturizer sets in for about 5-10 mins I pressed this into my skin and it lasts my whole day!! Will be buying again for sure  :) nan
