For being a clay mask that’s also a sheet mask I was pleasantly surprised how well this product work I didn’t notice any physical change on my skin afterwards besides it feeling smoother but this product works really well if you need a quick pick me up! I left my skin very smooth and clean feeling! I didn’t have any noticeable break about at the time so I didn’t notice any huge changes on with my skin! But I would definitely use the product again if I needed a mask while I was on the go or if I was on vacation! Great mask!
