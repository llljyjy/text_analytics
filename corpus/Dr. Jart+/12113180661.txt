Received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review and here it is. The packaging I do like. I like that it has a pump not exposing rest of the product to air. It’s very smooth and feels hydrating on my skin. The coverage is light to medium that can definitely be built up to near full coverage but I like the more natural look so I don’t mind blemishes coming through. Reason why I gave it 4 out 5 stars is because it oxidizes to a yellowish tone. Some people prefer the golden yellowish look me not so much. Overall I would buy this again. nan
