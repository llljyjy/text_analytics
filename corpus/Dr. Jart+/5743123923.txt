This was a game changer!  The texture was smooth and moisturizing but I was also able to apply foundation on top without issue. It completely blended in and there was no white cast. Light, natural scent which was nice. Didnâ€™t irritate my rosacea prone skin either!  Holy grail! perfect for sensitive, dry skin
