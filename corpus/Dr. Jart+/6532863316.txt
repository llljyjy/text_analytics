This product truly amazes me. It goes on green and adjusts to my skin tone  it makes my skin look brighter and healthier. I like to wear this as a ’no make up’ makeup look with some blush, bronzer and mascara. This does not sit heavy or irritate my skin like some foundations. It also has SPF! I will be repurchasing this in the full size. I am very happy I found this gem. nan
