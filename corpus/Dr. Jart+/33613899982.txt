LOVED IT. I usually hate face masks but I wanted to have a self care night, and it was amazing. I loved how it says to leave it on for 30-40 min because that makes me feel like it actually did something. Everyone complaining about how it slides off, but who cares? I feel like thatâ€™s not important. Just lay down and watch something on ur phone if U care so much. It was so relaxing, I have really sensitive skin and it worked so well for me nan
