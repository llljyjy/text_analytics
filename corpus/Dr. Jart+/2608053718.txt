I prefer products that leave me looking a little glowy but not like I just ran two miles. I love this because it has that exact effect of not too matte, not too oily/glowy - just a nice natural skin like radiance. My only complaint is the lack of range for skin tones. I normally am a cool fair tone and the lightest one is even a little dark/yellow on me. Would be nice to have a wider variety and better inclusion for darker skin tones. A new staple!!
