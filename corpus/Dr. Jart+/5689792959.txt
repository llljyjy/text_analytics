I have tested this beauty balm with multiple primers and it wears beautifully! I have combo sensitive skin and usually have issues with foundations (especially lighter coverage) to stay natural looking/matte on my skin. This one truly lasts so well. It looks gorgeous all day even in humid tennessee weather and doesnâ€™t require touch ups. I had low expectations and this has blown me away. I will be continuing to use it until it runs out! Highly recommend! Pleasantly surprised
