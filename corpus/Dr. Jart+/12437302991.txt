I do love these masks, however there’s one downside and maybe it just happens to me. First and foremost, everyone says these masks slip off their face. This is true if you’re walking around and talking and stuff, but if you can find 10 minutes to relax and let it suction to your face, it stays pretty stuck on for the remaining 30 minutes. The ampoule is VERY hydrating and makes my skin look like I just got a hydrafacial afterwards. I have been breaking out on my forehead so I purchased the Vitamin C cryo rubber mask a couple times the past week or so and I feel like it does improve my skin. I personally use it after I do the daily extra strength alpha beta peel pads by Dr Dennis Gross. Okay now for the downside- whenever I use this mask I wake up with a few very tiny whiteheads on varying parts of my skin and it only ever happens after I use this product. I exfoliate every morning very gently with a washcloth and this seems to get rid of them so it’s not a huge deal but for a couple hours after my morning shower there is a bit of discoloration from these whiteheads being scrubbed away. Take it with a grain of salt, it’s obviously not bad enough for me to stop purchasing but if they tweaked their formula ever so slightly so that this did not happen I would 100% bump it up to a 5 star review. Also I wish they sold the serum in a moisturizer form to use daily because the glow it gives is unmatched. A great mask and worth the money
