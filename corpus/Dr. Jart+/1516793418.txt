I think this product is fantastic and does exactly what it says it will do, but unfortunately for me it gives me breakouts overnight. I have sensitive skin and a lot of products will cause me to break out on my chin over time, but this one gives me acne everywhere - even on my cheeks, which I have never experienced any other time in my life. I’ve purchased this a couple different times thinking my skin would react to it differently but had similar results years apart. I think it’s worth giving a try but I caution those with sensitive skin to be aware it may not work for you. I wish it worked for my skin!
