I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinions. I’ve never tried bb creams especially one that has an spf but I actually liked it. It’s super lightweight so you’ll have to build it up for a fuller coverage but it doesn’t feel that heavy on the skin. The color matched my skin pretty accurately. I think this product is ideal for someone who prefers light coverage. I have acne prone skin, acne scarring, and redness on my face so I have to build this up but if you don’t have this issue, you’re probably totally fine with one application! Nevertheless, I’d buy this product for sure in the future. Definitely a fan of BB creams now!!
