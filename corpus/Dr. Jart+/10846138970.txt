I loved this tinted moisturizer! The packaging is nice and sleek, easy to pump top. The ingredients are great! I love the SPF 40! It was easy to blend with my fingers but also applies nicely with a beauty blender. It left my skin dewy and smooth. Coverage is light, but enough to provide a blurring effect! Would definitely purchase again nan
