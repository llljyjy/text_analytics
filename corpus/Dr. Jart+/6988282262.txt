This is a good set to try out the mini sizes before you commit to a full size. The serum and moisturizer go on the skin smoothly and have a nice consistency. The color correcting treatment has a bit of a learning curve to it. It can look good if you pat a small amount on the skin. Overall, these are decent products. Good set to test out the products
