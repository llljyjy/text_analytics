I’m not new in kbeauty and definitely not new in Dr Jart products. I love a good BB with SPF, but somehow it’s not a good formula in every brand. Light medium - medium matches perfectly my medium skin tone. Just perfect! Makes my skin look healthy, corrects my redness in my cheek area and best of all helps my SPF! This formula works wonders on my dry skin! Doesn’t enhance my dry patches and works good with the rest of my products. If you are looking for a tinted BB, look no further! Love it so much!
