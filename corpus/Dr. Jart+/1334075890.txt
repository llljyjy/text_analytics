I really liked how light and easy to apply this was. It was super light but still provided some coverage. As someone who lives in the sun in the summer, I love the added benefit of SPF. I’m able to actually spend time outside without this wearing off also, which is a huge plus! My only complaint is the bottle, I wish it was more flexible, it’s a very hard plastic, more like a foundation. I prefer the flexible plastic (similar to the IT cosmetics, your skin but better). nan
