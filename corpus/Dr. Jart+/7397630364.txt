I received this product for free from Influenster and Cicapair in exchange for my honest review.  I have always had trouble with redness and blotchy skin.  It runs in the family on my dad’s side.  It seems like the older I get the more problems I have with the redness.  This product has helped improve my skin’s appearance tremendously.  I feel like I don’t have to hide behind makeup now which is great because I have a demanding job and having to put in a bunch of makeup to start my day is just too much.  This product worked wonderfully for me and I’m now working it into my regular skincare routine. Great product!
