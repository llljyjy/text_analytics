I LOVE this cream. I’m very fair and am prone to redness but this does a great job at both matching my natural skin color and toning down the red/unevenness. I also don’t wear makeup often but this doesn’t feel like makeup, even under a mask. It goes on best if you apply it after a moisturizer like the jar says. I was skeptical but this is a new mainstay for me! I can throw on this and some mascara and lip gloss and feel made up with very little effort. nan
