This mask was pretty great to my skin. It left my skin feeling so soft and clean without feeling irritated. It was a tiny bit of work to apply the mask but moving slow, following the directions I was able to achieve great contact and a nice mask experience. It left me a tiny bit red but that did fade quickly. It worked well at refreshing my skin and soothing it. Lovely Mask
