I received this free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I already enjoyed the Dr. Jart masks and this one seemed interesting. I chose to use it one day where I had a breakout on my chin, and it seemed to help soothe clear it up by the next day. The best part of this product is that it gives the effect of a clay mask without the messy application and cleanup. The mask peels right off with little residue. However, this is very expensive and creates a lot of waste compared to a non-sheet mask. I would still consider repurchasing this if itâ€™s on sale. Easy application and clean up
