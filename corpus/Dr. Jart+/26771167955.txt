I received this product complimentary from @influenser and @drjart in exchange for an Honest review. I love Dr jart’s products, I just don’t like how pricey they are. I love this mask! I don’t use a lot of masks but this one makes me want to commit to them. I like that it came in 2 pieces to make sure that my face would be properly covered but I found peeling the layer off to be a bit challenging. This mask combines the best of like 3 masks into one. My favorite part is the pore reduction (your girl has some BIG ones lol). I wish there was more than 1 mask in the package though. Overall, it’s a great mask you should try it. The best of 3 different masks! It’s great!
