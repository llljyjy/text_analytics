I havent tried the redness cream yet but i’ve used the serum and moisturizer. I received this product from influenster in exchange for my honest opinion, I have only used these a few times and my only complaint is the strong smell of essential oils, I am concerned that they will damage my skin. I do love the serum so far though, i’m not sure if I recommend it or not. Strong of essential oils - not sure if bad.
