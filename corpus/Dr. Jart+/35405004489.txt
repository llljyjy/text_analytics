This is the perfect beauty balm . Love that it has SPF 40 and niacinamide. It is pretty hydrating and is not scented. It leaves a nice healthy glow on the skin . It is lightweight . Love the applicator and the packaging . The tube is very sturdy. The only downside is that it transfers, itâ€™s better to use setting powder post application . Natural finish
