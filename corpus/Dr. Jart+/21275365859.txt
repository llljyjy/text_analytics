First let me say my skin is picky and doesn’t react well to many things but this kit helped reduce redness and pain from my acne and my dry pealing skin and took the red swelling out over night. The cream works well you will want to clean your face and apply. The serum is very similar. The only thing I didn’t like was that the directions are so small and not very clear into what order to apply can you mix with other routines or not. Other than that loved it.
