It IS hydrating. I’ve tried mannnny different things for my redness and acne and I’ve found this paired with Derma-E skin de stress cbd face cleanser works actual wonders and it’s really all you need. If you have combination skin, red cheeks, and acne this combination could work for you too it has changed my life. i only use the 2 but if you wanted to add in other elements but be careful adding in too much could make your skin worse!! you don’t need a-lot depending on your skin. :) nan
