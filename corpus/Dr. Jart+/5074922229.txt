I love Dr.Jart masks and this one is no exception. There is only one issue… the mask does not want to stay on my face. You have to constantly re-adjust it which makes the experience much less relaxing. However, even with this issue, the mask feels incredible and my skin is so plump and hydrated afterwards. Only one problem…
