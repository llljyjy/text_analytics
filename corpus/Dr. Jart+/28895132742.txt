I had to work really hard to like this product. after seeing the ads I was really excited, as redness is one of my main issues and I’m not a fan of wearing a full on foundation daily. however the first time I tried it, it felt awful. it was an odd, almost gritty texture, went weird and flaky, and immediately turned orange. since then I’ve been experimenting with working it into a routine, and finally have it working for me. first, it cannot go on my skin dry - I need something dewy underneath it to keep it from going weird and textured. I use glow recipe sunscreen, but I imagine a good mositurizer or primer would be okay too. next, I use a very very small amount, literally just a little dab and add more as needed to cover my face, and then it doesn’t go orange. it still doesn’t blend in well on areas I have texture (chin, creases of my nose), but it’s not too bad. the gritty texture is still weird to me, it almost feels mildly exfoliating. I’ll definitely use the jar, but I’m glad I didn’t get the full size - we’ll see if I repurchase after playing with it some more gritty texture??
