It’s not horrible. It didn’t break me out. I expected it to feel dewy on the skin like a serum but it kind of has the texture on my skin of a powdery liquid foundation without the coverage. The color correction wasn’t that great, honestly I can still see pink through it and I used 4 drops on only half my face. For the cost, I’m definitely going to be returning it for something closer to a redness removing mask since that’s what I wanted from this most. meh, not worth the price
