I didn’t really see the point in this mask. As a guy sheet mask never fit my face as they are too small. I did enjoy that this one had two separate parts as I don’t need the bottom half of the mask due to facial hair. I didn’t notice any visible changes of my skin. I did feel though like the mask pulled out any excess oil and build up in my pores. Not for me as a guy.
