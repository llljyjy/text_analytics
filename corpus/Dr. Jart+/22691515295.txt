I am amazed!! Usually mineral sunscreens peel on my skin. I have oily skin and couldn’t understand why this was happening to me. This sunscreen doesn’t have white cast and blends right into the skin. Leaving skin with a matte finish and it doesn’t pill! I could even reapply my sunscreen without anything weird happening to it. Although I wish the box said how long the sunscreen is water resistant for. Amazing purchase. If you don’t like the product you can return it before 30 days. That’s what I did but I’m keeping this sunscreen!! wow
