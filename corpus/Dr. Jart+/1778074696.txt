I received this product for free from Dr. Jart and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. First off, I really enjoyed the fact that I got two weeks of use every morning from these smaller sizes. I could have gone longer (I think I was a little over halfway through them) but I had to stop because they were drying out the corners of my mouth and causing my skin to flake there. I also didn’t notice much redness reduction Issing the serum and the lotion but the color correcting cream definitely helped tone down some redness. The serum and the lotion worked really well under my makeup, though! I didn’t notice any pilling or splotchy areas from them. The color correcting cream was a great way to even out my skin and make it look a little better than just my bare skin on my no makeup days. I do use tretinoin at night so that could be why these products were a little too much for my skin. I’d say give it a try because it’s a good price, plenty of product for a few weeks of use, and everyone’s skin is different so it might work wonders for you! My skin didn’t like it but yours might!
