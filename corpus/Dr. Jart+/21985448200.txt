I’ve been using this product for a few weeks now and so far, this is what I’ve noticed:-it seemed to help with some hormonal acne I get around my period (aka I didn’t see as much this time, yay)-it wasn’t drying like some products without even having to add oils or moisturizer-it hasn’t made a difference with my Melasma :( it’s only been a few weeks so fingers crossed it will with a bit more time nan
