I got this product complementary in exchange for my honest review. To begin with I have oily skin but I do need some protection along with a little bit of coverage for days when I’m just running errands or out by the pool and I don’t want a full make up face. This product does hit those marks. I did set it for a little bit of loose powder before I ran around town just to make my face a little bit more matte. But again it is a good product for days when you’re riding bikes or out by the pool and just want all in one product. Multi tasker
