I was absolutely blown away by this product. Recently I’ve been transitioning into lighter foundations and complexion products with not a lot of coverage. I don’t like anything heavy anymore but miss the coverage that those kinds of products would give and this has become one of my favorites to use. This is a buildable, lightweight, smooth product. It goes on so smoothly and blends like a dream, giving me the coverage I want without any of the weight. It also worked well with all of my other products I’ve tried, didn’t separate at all, didn’t feel oily or cakey on my skin and it looked amazing. I will 100% continue to use this product and will stock up once I’m out. My new fave
