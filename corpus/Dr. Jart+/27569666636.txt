I’d heard rave reviews for this product, and I so badly wanted to love it. But this leaves a white film on my face and I end up looking like a corpse. Ye, it covers the redness but I’d rather be a little red than white. I’m olive skinned so maybe it works better for lighter skinned people. I’d caution anyone with darker skin to steer clear of this. My mom asked me if I was sick after using it lol White film
