I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. This was the first time I’ve used a peel like this so I can’t compare it to others but I was very excited to try it. It has a nice creamy consistency and was easy to apply. It had a slightly mint smell to it which I thought was appealing. I used it twice a week because I don’t want to dry my skin out and had nice results in just a few weeks. Pores appear smaller and my skin had a nice glow! nan
