I tried the serum and the color corrector. The serum was okay, but I did not notice any changes after a few weeks of use. The color corrected was a mistake to use. It looked great when I put it on in the morning around my chin. By midday, my skin which is never dry was peeling excessively where I had the product and over the next few days I experienced an intense acne flare up on my chin. I will not use it again and I do not recommend it. Will not use the color corrector again
