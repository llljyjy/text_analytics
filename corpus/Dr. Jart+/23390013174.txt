I have fair skin thatâ€™s pink/red and I get flare ups of red cheeks with certain foods I eat.  This product is very nice at canceling out that pink and red. A little goes a long way, I go through a jar about every 6 months. You can wear it alone or I put a CC cream over. Works well under makeup. Great product! nan
