I previously got a mini jar of this and while I wasn’t obsessed with the formulation, it did really help my redness. So I got a larger jar and was pretty disappointed. The product came completely separated with about 1.5 cm of oil on top. I tried to pour out some of the oil and then shake it to mix it back in, but nothing worked. This product helps with redness, but I don’t use it very often because it makes me even more shiny and I already have oily skin. I’ve also noticed it separating on my skin and becoming patchy some days when I don’t wear anything over it. When I do wear makeup over it, I find that it makes the foundation look more textured. Overall, I think it’s worth trying the mini one to see if it works for you - but I will likely be looking for another alternative from now on. nan
