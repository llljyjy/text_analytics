This mask is a great one if you want to clean up the pores in your face. In my experience even though it does not fully 100% clean out all the pores in the hard to reach locations (like the tip of the nose), it still does a pretty good job of cleaning out most of them around your face. After using it your face will feel very fresh. I would definitely recommend this product. nan
