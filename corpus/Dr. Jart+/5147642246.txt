I really like the formula of this product! It sits so well on the skin and doesn’t cling to dry spots. It dries down luminous but not tacky at all (doesn’t need to be set w powder). Not AMAZING coverage but definitely gives you a tint. The one con I have with this product is the packaging — doesn’t work very well. Overall I really like it! I received this product for free from Influenster. Color was also darker than I expected. nan
