Love this stuff, i have rosacea and broken capillaries on my face and no longer use foundation because of this stuff! I started with the camo cream in the jar, it feels a bit heavy on my oily skin so i tried this and I love it! My skin looks amazing with no foundation and I never ever thought i would say that! I have oily skin and large pores and it does not accentuate them at all. no more foundation
