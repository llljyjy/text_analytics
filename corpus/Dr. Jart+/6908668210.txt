I loove this product! When I go it I was a little scared that it might be a bit too dark for me, surprisingly it matched my skin tone and actually made me look kind of subtly tanned and glowy which I loved! I guess is the color correcting formula. The texture is light and buildable, light to medium depending on what you want, it’s hydrating and, as a plus it also has UV protection. This right here is very complete product that won’t disappoint you! Best BB cream I’ve tried
