so far i agree with the claims! ive been using it for about 10 days and my skin feels smoother. no irritation, no dryness, very water-like and light, hasn’t made my make up look weird later. i dont have pores but my forehead breaks out sometimes and it’s been clearer lately, so, so far so good! i like it!
