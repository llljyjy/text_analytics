I suffer from dry, pale skin that’s prone to blotchy redness, especially after a wash. Other redness correcting foundations have done little to help, and I also break out with the use of any heavy product. Despite the higher price tag, Tiger Grass Camo Drops is one of the best skincare purchases I’ve ever made, and has worked perfectly on my skin type. It actually smooths my blotchy skin without feeling cakey. It’s also a pretty multifaceted product, and I love that I no longer have to layer extra foundation and sunscreen, which can contribute to my breakouts.The only potential downside is the price. This is a little more than I would normally be willing to spend on skincare, but, ultimately, I think it’s worth it. Just a few drops go a long way, so I imagine one bottle can last a while. Actually does what it advertises
