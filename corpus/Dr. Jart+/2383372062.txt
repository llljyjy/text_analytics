I received this from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. I don’t do sheet masks very often, but this one was pretty easy to apply! Like most clay masks it does a good job of soaking up oil on the skin, and it felt nice when it was on. However it’s very cold and dry where I am so I think it was a little too drying for me right now. I might like it better in the summer when my skin is more oily! Nice, but a little drying
