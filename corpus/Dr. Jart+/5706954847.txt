I started using Proactiv on my chin, and obviously, a few days before an event, my skin began to flake, revealing redness underneath as the new skin began to show. Horrified, I used this product, and I can honestly say I am pleased with the results. I used the serum and lotion for about 3 days, day and night, between my normal moisturizer, on my chin. By day 3, the irritated redness of my baby chin skin had begun to calm, enough that I didn’t feel quite as self conscious. I do not normally suffer from rosacea, so I cannot comment on how well it works long term. But in a pinch, it definitely came handy enough that I bought the serum and cream for emergencies. The sunscreen was so/so. It’s a little thick, but I have no doubts it hides redness and provides more than adequate ability to protect skin from the sun. I am left with the impression that if a user had a case of moderate rosacea, it would do well at masking most of the redness. However, for me, it left me looking like a ghost. nan
