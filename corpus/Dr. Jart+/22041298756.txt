I ordered the sample size of this a while ago when it was blowing up on tik tok. I tried it a few times but never really had an opinion on it. Until I went back to school and had to wear masks all day and didn’t want to suffocate my skin with foundation under. This product is a really good alternative to a cc or bb cream. It has a really nice skin like finish, when you first apply it it looks crazy, green , and washed out, but after you let it sit on your skin and warm up it kind of melts into your skin tone and evens everything out. I also love how it’s spf 30. My only complaint is that I think it’s a little drying. I make sure to apply a substantial amount of moisturizer before this. I think I like it
