This product works quickly to reduce redness and help improve texture. I decided to use it when my skin was red and inflamed and within minutes it started to look better. Overtime it really continues to help with skin color and texture and is a great product for anyone struggling with extreme redness. The scent is a little strong but it didnâ€™t bother me. I highly recommend this product, it gave me confidence in my skin! Confidence booster!
