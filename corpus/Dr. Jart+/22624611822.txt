This is my first time using Dr. Jart products . The packing of this BB cream. Is great. Comes in hard tube with a push down pump which helps to easily dispense the product. The consistency of the product is a little thick and not right for my skin given that itâ€™s a little oily and breaks out easily. It blends in well. The broad spectrum and spf provides perfect protection from sun. It is mildly fragrant and the fragrance does not last long ,something i like about my makeup. I would love to purchase this product in future if this comes in lighter formula. Too thick for my skin.
