I’m not a fan of foundation or heavy layering of makeup. I’ve done color correcting creams here and there, but still had to pile on makeup on top, which I hate. This is my holy grail! My go to, everyday! It gives me the glow I need and calms the redness in the most random parts of my face. Make sure you’ve “warmed up” this cream before putting it on your face. It works wonders for me. I’ll always buy this. For more spf protection, I add some underneath this cream. Before and after photos below. nan
