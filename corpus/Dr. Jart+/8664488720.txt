I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this. It’s so darn expensive for the 6 patches you get (and I thought Hero brand was pricey)! I left these patches on overnight and there was no difference in the swelling or redness of my cystic acne. It didn’t suck any sebum out that I could tell. Absolutely disappointing. Do yourself a favor and buy any other brand than these. Even the cheap ones work better than this. Would not purchase again. Waste of Money
