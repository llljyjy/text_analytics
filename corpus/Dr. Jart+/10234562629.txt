This moisturizer absolutely blew me away! I always hesitate to use heavier gel moisturizers because my skin is EXTREMELY sensitive and acne prone, but this stuff works wonders. This is the only heavy moisturizer I’ve come across that doesn’t break me out, and when I put it on at night I wake up with skin as soft as a freaking baby. Truly, my skin hasn’t ever felt more moisturized and silky smooth. My skin is the healthiest it’s ever been, this product has helped break me out of that “dry/oily” cycle. Absolutely worth every penny! Amazing moisturizer for sensitive skin
