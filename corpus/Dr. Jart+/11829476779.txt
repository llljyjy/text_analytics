The mask did a good job at purifying my skin and left a matte finish once it was rinsed off, however I have a few concerns with the mechanics of this product. The material of the mask is paper-like and very thin, so it can get stretched and twisted easily, which makes it harder to cover all problem areas, so I recommend leaving the plastic cover on the mask until it is applied to your face completely. Additionally, the “no mess” advertisement on this mask isn’t completely true, while applying it I got the mud mask all over my hands, and once I removed the mask it was like I had a thin layer of mud mask all over my face, so it’s not just a quick throw-away sheet mask… you will need to rinse off your face afterwards. But again, the formula is good at purifying the skin, so I would recommend it for oily skin! Good purifying mask for oily skin!
