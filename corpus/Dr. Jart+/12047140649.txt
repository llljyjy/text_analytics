I’d like to start and say the color is not my sade but I’ve noticed that when I pump it on my face it’s a tan color and when I blend it out it turns orange this would be great if you were to go to the water and wanted to have something on the face that’s light with spf it dose sit on the face and dose not blend well with the skin and give you that nice glowy look but again it’s supposed to be like a sunscreen There’s better
