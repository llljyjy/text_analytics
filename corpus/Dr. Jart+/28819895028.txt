I have hyperpigmentation due to some bad acne breakout mask-related. This helped a lot reducing the redness associated with it! I wear it when I have to go to the gym, where you canâ€™t really use makeup and I was struggling with confidence because of the redness! It also has spf which is definitely a plus. Highly recommend it great for hyperpigmentation
