I was excited to try a product like this for the first time and it was a great experience. It hydrated my skin and didn’t make my skin tight or dry feeling. I have noticeable pores and blackheads around my nose area and that’s where I saw the most improvement. Smoothed my skin out over the weeks and made my nose look much clearer. The rest of my face benefitted from the hydration and general clear feeling this left my skin. Blackheads worst enemy :)
