So maybe I misunderstood what this product was for… I thought it was supposed to be a skin cream (that HAD SPF in it) I didn’t think the sole purpose of this cream was labeled as a “mineral sunscreen”. When I ordered it and read the label I felt slightly misled. Maybe that was an oversight on my part. I had gotten a sample of the cicapair CREAM and I really really liked it but it didn’t have the “color correcting” aspect. I was thinking this was more of a face cream/moisturizer that treats redness? I also did not feel like it made much of a difference in my redness? But I will continue to use it one or two more times to see because I do like dr jart products A little misleading
