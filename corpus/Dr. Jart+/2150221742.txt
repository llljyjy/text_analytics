I’m not certain what this product actually does, or is it just an SPF (zinc is a main ingredient)? I didn’t find it did anything to diminish redness (honestly the IT Bye Bye Redness is far superior for colour correcting), and as I rubbed it in, it seemed to make parts of my face redder. I’ve got mature, normal to dry skin with some redness and I’m not going to be keeping this product. Confused
