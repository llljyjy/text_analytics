I have seen this all over social media. I am a huge sceptic when it comes to products that seem to be pushed on Tik Tok and other places, but I got a free sample of this and then decided to try the mini also. It really works! I am fair skinned, so that is definitely something to consider, I think if I had a deeper skin tone, there would probably be a weird cast, but being fair it just happened to work. I have sebaceous filaments on my nose, and because of that I have not been able to find a foundation or skin tint that even looks ok up close, but this did it! I really feel like I have coverage over problem spots but with the felling of a daily mineral sunscreen. This works great as a base for my other makeup and keeps my skin moisturized all day. Just buy it!
