I’ve bought this product now twice, as an alternative to wearing makeup as a nurse. But, being that I’m very pale, with a rosy undertone, it leaves an orangey aftertone. It doesn’t matter how much or low little you apply, or even if you apply it with other Dr Jart items in the Cicapair family or w/e else. I’m writing this in hopes that it’s resolved some day for those of us who don’t have golden tones to hide the orangeyness afterwards. Not for the Pale People.
