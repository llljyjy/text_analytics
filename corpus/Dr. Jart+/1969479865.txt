I’m not big on using foundations, but I am really impressed with this beauty balm! I received it in the shade “fair-light” and it matches my skin perfectly. I love that it blends into my skin so well and creates almost a blurring effect without cracking or looking cakey. It dries down almost completely but leaves a nice subtle sheen that is actually quite beautiful. I love that it has sunscreen in the formula (SPF 40) too. Here I applied it to the back of my hand and it hides any imperfections and creates a smooth, flawless surface. Highly recommend! The best beauty balm!
