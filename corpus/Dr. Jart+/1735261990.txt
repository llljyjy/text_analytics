I must be an anomaly because I know this line gets a lot of love and rave reviews, but it didn’t do much for me. I tend to get redness around my nose and any breakouts I may have, and I didn’t notice much of a difference after using these. I used the color correcting treatment as a spot concealer and it didn’t do much in terms of color correcting for my breakouts, their redness still showed through. The formulations feel great on the skin though, so I’m hoping that these will do more, over time. Not Much of a Diffwrence
