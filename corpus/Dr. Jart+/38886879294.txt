This is great for anyone who has lasting acne scars (but no immediate acne). The treatment fades them away nicely. I usually use this whenever I’m too lazy to use foundation or skin tint. I suggest melting the product on your fingers before applying it to your face. Although the product is great, it’s very expensive, which was my only problem. Great product, but very expensive
