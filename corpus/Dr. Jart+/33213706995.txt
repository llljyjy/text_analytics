This is a very nice BB Cream for someone who is combo skin. The shade somehow adapted to my skin tone. When I initially applied with my fingers it was very dark. The next day I used a brush and it sheered out the coverage as well as the shade. I do use a bit of powder to set it once itâ€™s completely dry. I use the Dr Jart Teatree skincare routine + my Dr. Jart sunscreen underneath. I applied Hourglass blush (the one in the stick) and no issues blending out. I will continue to use this. I like!
