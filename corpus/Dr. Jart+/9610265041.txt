OMG, I’m so glad I found this product! I’m redheaded and very fair skinned so I naturally have sensitive skin/redness. I was skeptical to try this product but I decided to try the mini version just in case I didn’t like it. I was not disappointed! A little goes a long way and all I do is gently pat into my skin for carefree no-makeup days. Please try this! Kiss your foundation goodbye!
