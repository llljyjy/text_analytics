Like other have mentioned this will highlight any dry or peeling skin on your face, even if youâ€™re well moisturized.  I use retinols, and my face can get a little peely and red looking.  Even after the most intensive moisture routine, if I put this on it will cause any dry skin to show up. Also, the open tin style of container is annoying because I always get it under my fingernail when trying to get a dab to put on my face. Highlights all peeling skin
