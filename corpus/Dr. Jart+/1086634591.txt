I absolutely love this bb cream!  It applies easily with no streaks. It has a medium light coverage with a dewy finish. It’s very lightweight and I don’t even notice I have anything on. It’s also hydrating without making my skin look oily. I love how it has a SPF 40 as well!  This shade does have some pink undertones in it which worked well for my skin but may not work for everyone. I will definitely be purchasing this in the future! New staple
