Really happy with this product. It seems a bit grey in color when it comes out but once you blend it in it becomes seamless with your skin tone. I recommend using a beauty blender and not your fingers to blend as it becomes a bit too thick. Perfect and sheer coverage, I simply added some powder foundation on top and done! Will definitely purchase again. Perfect coverage and color
