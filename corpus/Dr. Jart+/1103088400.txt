I absolutely love this cream. It reduces the redness and is moisturizing but doesn’t leave my skin oily either. I use the cleanser and mist and all together my skin has improved 90% and it’s only been 2 weeks. I would definitely try these products as I have tried so many and nothing worked. I just wish I would have found them sooner. moisturizing and calms redness
