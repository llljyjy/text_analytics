I’m not a big fan of sheet masks to begin with, but this one was easy to apply and not messy. It dried down but wasn’t uncomfortable like other mud masks I’ve tried. It had a very strong cooling sensation, which may be nice in summer, but it just made me cold! I didn’t noticed any immediate differences in my skin. nan
