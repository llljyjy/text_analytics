I absolutely love this sunscreen. I have combination, sensitive, acne prone skin and prefer to use mineral sunscreen on my face. Yes, this does have a slight white cast, but nothing compared to other brands I’ve tried. It blends in fairly easy and if you massage it enough it won’t leave much of a white cast. It doesn’t break me out and I think it helps some with the redness my skin experiences. 10/10 would recommend. The best mineral face sunscreen I've tried
