I received this product for testing purposes through Influenster! I was super excited to try this mask out! I have heard such good things about Dr Jart products. My favorite part about this mask would be how mess-free it is. While I was confused about the different layers at first and it not being just a mud mask packet, once I got it figured out it was nice not having a mess to clean up compres to other mud masks. I do have extremely dry skin, but this mask did not over dry my skin out. I was a little nervous since it is a mud mask, but my skin only felt a little tight afterwards. Nothing a little moisturizer couldn’t fix! I will say I didn’t see too much of a difference, but I only got one mask. Maybe if I was using it many times over and over I would see results. I do like the ingredients list and the brand overall. I would recommend and would consider buying it again for face mask night! Great Face Mask!
