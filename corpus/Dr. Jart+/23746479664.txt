I have light, incredibly sensitive skin with some discoloration. This wonder product replaces foundation and concealer for me. I use a light moisturizer, let it soak in, then cover my face in about a quarter sized dollop of Tiger Glass. (Use sparingly as it is a thicker cream.) In under a minute it perfectly matches my skin tone. The texture becomes dewy and plump. My skin feels and looks amazing. The improvement I saw within 6 weeks of consistently using this is unbelievable. You may want to use a makeup brush to blend out because of the color change. And I double cleanse at the end of the day since this product lasts. Highly recommend. Worth the price. Iâ€™ll be using this until my dying day. Must Have Skin Fixer
