I like this product a lot, dr. Jart never really disappoints when it comes to products like these, it’s very easy to apply, and ghastly great powerful ingredients to help fight acne. The things I don’t like now, In the ingredients there are spearmint oils, peppermint oils, eucalyptus leaf oil, and limonene in my opinion and the information I know about skincare these are basically just fragrances that can possibly do more harm than help in the long run. Fragrances in skincare is not that great because you could develop a irritation to it easily when using the product over time. I like everything but these and my product came slightly leaking which is not fun. great product with some fragrance flaws
