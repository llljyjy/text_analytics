Iâ€™ve been obsessed with this for years, the formula has only improved! The previous formulation could be a little gray sometimes, but this gives me a bright even complexion - no orange tones or gray cast! I love the sunscreen, skin loving ingredients, and the coverage is sooo customizable. I do a half pump all over for a sheer tint, and 1.5 pumps for full coverage. My fave!
