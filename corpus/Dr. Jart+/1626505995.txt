This product is EVERYTHING. I look like I’m wearing foundation and I’m not. This and a light concealer is everything I need especially in the summer. Love that there’s SPF and like the texture. I do use a bit of moisturizer underneath as my skin is pretty dry. Don’t love the smell, but I honestly don’t care and don’t notice shortly after applying. I’ve got light-medium skin with neutral undertones if this helps. HOLY GRAIL
