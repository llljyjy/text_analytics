I had been using this treatment for a while and probably purchased it two times before my most recent purchase. I noticed that instead of the creamy light green moisturizer consistency, it now comes very separated with the oil pooling on top. Around this time I started to notice Cicapair promoting the product with the instruction to take a little and mix it in your hand to warm it before applying. I do not know if that was a coincidence but I did notice by doing so, it starts looking a lot like the previous formula.I think I preferred the old formula where it was as messy for my hands and I only needed to use the little applicator spoon that comes with the product. Other than that, the product still works well, but I worry it may be a cause of my clogged pores recently. Good but I either got a dud or the formula changed
