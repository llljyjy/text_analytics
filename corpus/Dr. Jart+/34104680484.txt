I will start off by saying that ’in general’, i am not a sheet mask fan. I have a fairly thick beard & have always struggled with sheet masks and their general application, Especially with hair covering 50% of my face. I was Absolutely surprised with this sheet mask from Dr. Jart+! This mask comes in two pieces which makes application super smooth & customizable to your face shape. A lot of the time sheet masks are one size fits all, and they slide off my face. I was able to shape the lower half of the mask to fit my beard & at least get some of the skin in that area. The mask itself stuck very nicely without any slippage (although my attached photo might look goofy, it was definitely intentional — lol!) Another problem for me; clay masks! I hate that clay is so difficult to remove from the beard hair. I find myself scrubbing my face for a lot longer & typically avoid clays altogether when i can. That was not an issue whatsoever with this product! Just enough clay is worked into the mask so that there isnt an issue of excess run-off or any product transfer. I had no problems washing my face & getting the product out of the areas that it did get into the beard hairs. I couldn’t more surprised! Altogether the scent is very lightly natural clay with a hint of mint. As far as i can tell, no overwhelming fragrance additions were used. My skin immediately felt smooth and clean, yet hydrated and toned. This product really is a breakthrough & a new addition ill want to always have on hand!! Although i got this product as a Complimentary test product from dr. Jart+ & influenster, i would for sure Spend my own money on this product to purchase again. A Breakthrough Clay Mask!
