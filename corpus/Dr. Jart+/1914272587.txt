This is an excellent solution for redness. It goes on smooth and is slightly refreshing. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of introducing my 89 year old grandma to this when I was Christmas-ing with her in TN, and she stole it from me! It does really well on her age spots and the redness she has from melanoma treatments, so I am happy she has it. nan
