This product is hands down my miracle cream. I’ve never loved a product like I love this one. I do not typically wear foundation except for special occasions, so I wear this cream on a daily basis in place of face makeup. It’s better than any BB cream I have tried. I have very light skin with rosy cheeks and my skin is easily flushed or inflamed. This stuff evens out my skin tone and calms redness and irritation. It’s not makeup, it’s a skin treatment, so I see and feel a difference in my skin when I use this on a regular basis. It gives my skin a smoother texture and calms sensitivity. It has SPF 30 as well which helps to keep my skin healthy and not inflamed. I cannot praise this cream enough. It can feel a bit sticky depending on how you like your finish. If you like the dewy look then you may like that. I sometimes use a translucent finishing powder on top, especially if it’s a humid day or I’m going to be wearing a face mask. If you have a fair complexion with redness and inflammation, try this product! You will not be disappointed. Best Product I Have Ever Used
