I LOVE this stuff. It’s completely changed my makeup routine. I don’t even use foundation anymore, I use this and then spot conceal with the Glossier concealer and my skin looks so natural and beautiful. I used every last drop and need a new one. Its a bit thick but I got used to it. As for the separating of oil people are complaining about, it happened to mine too but I assumed it was normal and it didn’t bother me, it still worked fine. 4 stars because it’s thick and separates in jar but I still use it every day and love. Changed my makeup routine, in LOVE
