This product is so good! It lays on your skin like a second skin and doesn’t look cakey or dry. It really evens out my tone without having to use a lot of product. It pairs well with all of my other makeup products but also looks great by itself. It doesn’t leave any sort of white cast from the SPF. The pump bottle is excellent and disperses it’s just enough product. This wears well over an 8 to 10 hour day with only needing to touchup once a with powder nan
