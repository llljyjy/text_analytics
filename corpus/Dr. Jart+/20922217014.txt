I wanted to love this since I have red nose and red checks but I have oily skin so it just slid off my face almost immediately. I tried more moisturizer, less moisturizer, more product, less product but for oily skin it just doesn’t work. I’ll stick to my tinted moisturizer from IT cosmetics Not great for oily skin.
