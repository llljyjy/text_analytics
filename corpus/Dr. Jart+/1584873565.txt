Love this sunscreen for everyday use! I prefer a sunscreen that doesn’t have that “sunscreen” smell. This has a very light citrus scent that goes away as it dries down. I wouldn’t say it’s very hydrating nor is it drying. I wear this over my moisturizer and wears well under my primer/makeup. I use reach for this daily even without makeup. I have combo/oily T zone and dry skin around my mouth. It spreads nicely without clinging to any problem areas. No white cast for me. I’ve already repurchased a new bottle! nan
