Got this as a delux sample. This stuff will make your face look orangey and unusually dark if your pale... It’s quite heavy and when you touch your face you can see it on whatever you touched your face with - tshirt, fingers, napkin whatever. The stuff is orangey/foundation colored and very noticable. When you rub it on you will definitely have to wash your hands before doing anything else because it leaves a heavy sunscreen feel with color. I don’t feel that it ever sets because touching my face hours later still gives me that film and I have to wash my hands. The only good part is the spf, but I’m pretty sure thats what makes the texture the way it is... nan
