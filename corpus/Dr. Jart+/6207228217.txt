I am really happy with this product! It’s light and buildable yet stays nice all day and never dried out. I wish I didn’t need to wear another layer of sunscreen under it but it’s worth it to have such a workable base color. I’m happy with the product overall and I will continue to use it because of how easy to is to remove in my end of day routine. A new staple
