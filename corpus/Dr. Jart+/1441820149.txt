Let me first give y’all some context with which to work: I’m 32, I’m about as pale as a slice of Sunbeam white bread, and I have sensitive combination skin. My t-zone gets oily halfway through the day, yet the apples of my cheeks and the curved part of my nostrils are dry. If your skin is the same way, I feel your pain. When I say I have sensitive skin, I mean it. I can look at it wrong and I break out. Being a nurse means I weak a mask all day and when I come home after a 12-hour shift, my chin and jawline are a wreck. By the time I’m done with my nightly routine of double-washing to get rid of all the makeup and oil trapped under my mask, my skin is clean but dry and tight. I’ve used Philosophy’s Purity moisturizer for a while and I love it, but my skin soaks it right up and within an hour my skin is dry again. TikTok almost convinced me to try slugging, but there’s no way my pores wouldn’t get clogged. Then I found this gem. First and foremost, I can slather this stuff on in layers and it doesn’t clog my pores. I will actually go so far as to say my pores look clearer in the morning when I use this the night before. Second, it actually takes my skin a while to soak it all in, and even then it isn’t dry like with other moisturizers. It has this plump, dewy, glowy goodness and I can’t believe it’s my face. Third, and maybe most impressively, my face isn’t as oily the next day. Not even my t-zone gets as greasy as it does when I don’t use this. I have finally found a product that makes my skin behave. My mind is blown, and this stuff is amazing. Trust me and try it. So. Good.
