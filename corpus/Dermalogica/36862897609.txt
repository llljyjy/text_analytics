I was gifted by dermalogica sampling but This stuff is amazing. I use this every day in the morning and my skin has never looked brighter and more even and soft. It’s a little uncomfortable to use as it’s a powder you have to mix with water to get a paste and sometimes it’s still gritty, and it’s quite watery so it can run everywhere especially as I use it on my neck too. But that’s worth it as my skin really is so bright and even now that my make up looks better, and I wake up in the morning with a smile at how great my skin looks. It’s very gentle but still exfoliating. Do yourself a favour and buy this! nan
