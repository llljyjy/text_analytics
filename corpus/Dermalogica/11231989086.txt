I heard great things about this and really wanted to like it. I bought it for makeup removal and was disappointed. You have to really work it hard to get mascara off and thereâ€™s quite a bit remaining. Works great as the first step in double cleansing if makeup is not involved. Light scent and nice feeling after. But there are better products to remove makeup. Not a makeup remover
