I was sent a sample of this which was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. This daily microfoliant is fun to use and feels pretty gentle on the skin. The powder does take a bit of time to get used to but it feels like a ritual when I do it. I like that it doesnâ€™t have a fragrance added. This is overall a great exfoliant to add to my routine. nan
