I was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling a “7 single-use packets of Dermalogica’s Daily Microfoliant”— First time using powder and unlike the exfoliant aspect of it as long as you don’t mind mixing your own paste, super easy enough. Kept my skin soft, smooth and clean but not with the feeling of tightness. -CC Great addition to my routine
