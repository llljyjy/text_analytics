I’m a HUGE fan of Dermalogica products. As a new mom I need something to brighten my skin and under eyes so this eye gel stood out to me. I love how lightweight it is and how well I’d really does brighten and depuff. I don’t look as tired without makeup, which is honestly what I was going for. I’m looking forward to the extended benefits since I’ve only been using for about a week. Dermalogica gifted me. nan
