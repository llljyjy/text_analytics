I’m still just slowly integrating this retinol to my routine. So far I’ve been using it just one or two times a week and fortunately there is no other negative effect for me, maybe because my skin is already used to retinols. Overall, I’m looking forward to the results and am glad that no irritation is happening so far! Skin is also looking smoother these days. Gifted by dermalogica Smoother texture
