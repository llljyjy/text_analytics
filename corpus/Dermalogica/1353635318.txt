This product is so gentle that it’s slightly deceiving to call it an exfoliant haha. There isn’t much grit to it at all but, being an oat based product, that’s probably the point. There’s no redness or discomfort that comes with some exfoliants… this one is very calming on the skin. My face truly feels velvety smooth after using it without any irritation. I’m generally a big fan of Dermalogica and trust the ingredients they use in this product will lead to good results like with their other products. The powder base of this product is like nothing I’ve ever used before and it activates quickly when mixed with water. Overall, I really like this product but personally prefer my exfoliants to have a bit more grit and texture to them. I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica for my honest review. Super Gentle Product
