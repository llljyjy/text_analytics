I had high hopes for this but it made me break out. 2 weeks of progress, I introduced this last, used it twice and disaster struck. I’m sure it’ll work for someone else. In the meantime, my exfoliation hunt continues. 1 star because is was fine grains and gentle to rub. I only tried it with water as a paste, not a cleanser mix. Also, size is cute but it was half full. Just not for me
