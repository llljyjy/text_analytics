I was so excited to try out this serum as I’ve heard amazing things about Dermalogica products. The price is a little much for me, but I figured if it’s worth it and it works, then I can deal. I read all positive reviews from so many sites. When I finally got to use the product, about two weeks in, I thought I had a problem with the pump. I wasn’t overusing the product - I had only been using two pumps in the morning and night. NOTHING would come out. Come to find there was nothing in the bottle!! This didn’t even last me a month. I am so disappointed and I didn’t even get a chance to notice a difference with my skin. I won’t be repurchasing to chance trying again. Sounded too good to be true and it was. Did I get a dud?? Product was nearly empty!!
