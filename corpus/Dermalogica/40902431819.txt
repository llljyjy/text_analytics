I am in my 20s and trying to prioritize skin care to keep my skin healthy and a big part of that is SPF, however a lot of sunscreens are very oily or heavy which can break out my very sensitive skin but I love this spf, it doesnâ€™t feel oily or heavy and helps my face feel protected! Great SPF, not oily or heavy!
