I received this complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling to try out as gift. I absolutely loved it using this daily microfoliant was great for exfoliating your skin daily without striping your skin. It did help me clean up my left over make up and clean up pores. It felt like I was  just using rice flour I didnâ€™t feel no papaya enzymes or fragrance in there. Overall I like the product. Good for Routine
