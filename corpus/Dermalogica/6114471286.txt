This is a physical exfoliant I can definitely see myself using regularly. It feels really hydrating while still exfoliating my skin. I love the texture it lathers into and I loved the way my skin looked afterwards. It looked polished but felt hydrated and not irritated. I will say the packaging is a little bit messy and the smell is a little off putting but both things I can look past because I enjoyed using it and the results so much. This product was gifted by Dermalogica for review. Gentle but effective
