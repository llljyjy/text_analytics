I was able to use this a three times in the last week. I absolutely love a powder to foam formulation. So smart for an exfoliant and much more hygienic! With just a little water it starts to foam up, though did not dissolve completely. Like pieces were left, I guess as the exfoliator. I’m not a huge fan of feeling anything Like that in an exfoliant, gives me Neutrogena face scrub vibes which wasn’t the best. The product itself wasn’t used long enough to see any actual results. Need at least a few more weeks for that, but short term I did like the immediate smoothing effect. I look forward to trying this out longer to see more results! Gifted by Dermalogica Liking so far!
