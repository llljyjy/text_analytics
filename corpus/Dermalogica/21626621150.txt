Dermalogica daily microfoliant was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling.The first time I was introduced to Dermalogica was at a facial. I could see an immediate difference in my skin. This lead to at-home use of the Daily microfoliant. This product does what it promises! It’s a fine, rice-based exfoliant powder that gently smooths and brightens your skin — and a little goes a long way. This is on my personal “best of” list. Would highly recommend. Great everyday product!
