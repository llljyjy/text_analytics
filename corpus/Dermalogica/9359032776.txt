To be honest that first version of the sunscreen was a little bit of a flop for me :( I have sensitive skin and honestly it doesnâ€™t like chemical filters haha for some reason I had better luck w this guy! I donâ€™t know why because this is also a chemical formula but itâ€™s been super gentle on my skinâœ¨ðŸ–¤Very expensive though! nan
