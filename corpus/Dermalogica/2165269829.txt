This is was an interesting product to try. You have total control on how thick or thin you want your product to be by just adding how much water you want. I like how it does not dry out my skin compared to other micro exfoliants. It does help exfoliate the skin. However I did not see a difference in brighter skin with this product. Iâ€™ll pass this product. Complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. Pro and cons
