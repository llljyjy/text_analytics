I have been using Dermalogicaâ€™s Circular Hydration serum for 6 weeks and my skin has never felt more plump and hydrated. I love how easily I can layer it under my usual moisturizer day or night. This serum has helped with cell turnover which decreases the likelihood of acne scarring. A Dermalogica skin therapist recommended that I include more hydration in my skin to help with my adult acne and this serum is definitely making a huge difference in keeping my skin clear and healthy!#giftedbyDermalogica nan
