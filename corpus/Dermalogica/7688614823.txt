It’s great! It’s a powder that you mix and can exfoliant your face with. I typically prefer chemical exfoliants but this physical one gets the job done. No heavy fragrance. Smooth skin afterwards. I recommend. Gifted by dermatological. I think that I will be using this many days to come and it’s a great addition to anyone’s skincare routine. I typically have oiler skin and I find it works well for me. Great
