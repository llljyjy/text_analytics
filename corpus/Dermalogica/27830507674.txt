I’m in my mid 30s and try to incorporate SPF into all my skincare to prevent sun damage. I like that this has an SPF of 50, and the formula smells great and feels lightweight so it’s easy to apply all over my face and neck. After continued use my skin feels hydrated and looks firmer and smoother. nan
