I absolutely love this product! First of all, it’s incredibly easy to use and incorporate into my daily skincare routine. I use it while I’m in the shower which speeds up the process. It’s a powder form but when you mix it with a little bit of water it becomes a paste that you use to exfoliate your face with. Once you rub it all over and rinse it off it’s literally insane how smooth and glowing your face looks and feels after!!! My pores are smaller and my face is smooth when applying makeup! *complimentary from dermatologica sampling” Love this!
