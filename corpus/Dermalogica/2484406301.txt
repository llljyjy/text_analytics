*this product was gifted by Dermalogica for review*Love love love with this exfoliant! I really dislike rough exfoliators, I’m so happy that this one by Dermalogica is super gentle and soothing on the skin . Although it starts off as a powder, once you add the water it emulsifies into a creamy, soothing chemical exfoliator. I love that it has both AHA’s and BHA’s along with other great ingredients to gently exfoliate and hydrate my skin. After using for 6 weeks, my skin is brighter, smoother, and clearer. There is zero irritation from this product and my skin can be reactive with some products. I love that I can also mix it in with my cleanser when I’m in a rush and don’t have time for 2 steps (cleaning then polishing). Awesome product and will repurchase when I run out. Gentle yet effective exfoliant!
