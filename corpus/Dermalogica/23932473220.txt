I have recently been using the Dermalogica Multivitamin Power Recovery Mask on my face. I have mostly dry skin, but I don’t always love skin masks because of their textures. Some feel like a chore to keep on for several minutes. This mask is good for me because it goes on like a cross between a rich mask, but closer to a rich cream. While waiting 15 minutes to rinse, my skin felt completely normal, as opposed to having a strange texture sitting on my face. I don’t mind the subtle scent and even though I like pleasant fragrance, I prefer not to put synthetic fragrance on my face, so I’m glad this doesn’t contain any. After rinsing, my skin felt smoother, but honestly I could use even more moisturizing since my skin is already on the dry side and the weather is currently very cold where I am. The instructions indicate it can be used as an overnight mask, so I will try that since the texture doesn’t seem like it would get all over the pillowcase. I love that this mask contains so many vitamins and great ingredients to make skin look brighter and healthier - great brand! nan
