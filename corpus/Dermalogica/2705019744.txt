The Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant is a powder product that you mix with water to create a paste and then use to exfoliate your face. I think it’s a great product. I’m not sure if I would want to use it daily, but every other day would be more ideal for me. I love that it’s a powder because that makes it super convenient for travel. My skin was super smooth afterwards. I definitely recommend this product!This product was complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. nan
