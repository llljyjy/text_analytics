Gifted by dermalogica this is the first ever regional product I have ever used and it’s safe to say I fell in love. I am very picky with what I choose to put on my skin as I have “normal” skin that breaks out during my period and the fine lines are starting to show from my expressions. I have used this cream for almost 2 weeks and I have definitely noticed the lines around my mouth, corners of my eyes, and forehead “wifi” lines are reducing. Love!
