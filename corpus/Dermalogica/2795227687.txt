Such a unique product, offered a good refreshing exfoliating without being too harsh or abrasive. Left my skin feeling soft smooth & hydrated without any drying or tightening that some cleansers can leave behind. Has a stronger scent so if youâ€™re sensitive to smell you may not enjoy it as much. Overall this is great so a gentle & effective daily exfoliation. Great Daily Exfoliater FFF for sensitive skin .
