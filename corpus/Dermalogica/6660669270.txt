I really liked this product! I think it was the perfect amount for sampling. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that is looking for an exfoliate with these properties. It made my skin feel really smooth after using and seemed to get all the dead and dry skin I had off my face. This was complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. Good product!
