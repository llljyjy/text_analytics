Huge, HUGE Dermalogica fan and this daily exfoliate is so, so good! I was gifted this product complimentary from Dermalogica. It begins a soft white powder and, mixing with a bit of water becomes a slightly paste. Applying in circular motions to your face, you then rinse.with splashes of warm water. The results: mind blown. My face was so smooth and my complexion the next morning looked so much more even, less shiny and overall just renewed. It really is a game changer and not at all overly expensive! Love it! Fantastic daily exfoliate
