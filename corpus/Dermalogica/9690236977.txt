First off I like to say this is literally hydration in a bottle your skin will love you after you use this.... Secondly the consistency is not too thin but also isn’t a thick serum which is very nice doesn’t leave any sticky residue behind soaks into your skin really nice leaving your face glowy but not looking oily, I will not be disappointed in this purchase... I was lucky enough to receive this for free in exchange for my honest review @dermalogicacanada, @sephoracanada, #giftedbydermalogica Hydration hydration
