I received the Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant, gifted by Dermalogica Sampling, for testing and review purposes.  This daily microfoliant removed dullness from my skin and evened my skin tone.  It also smoothed and brightened my skin and is absolutely gentle enough for daily use, which I love.The rice-based powder present in it activates upon contact with water, releasing Papain, Salicylic Acid and Rice Enzymes to polish my skin to perfection.  Moreover this amazing daily microfoliant is vegan, cruelty-free, gluten-free, contains no parabens, contains no artificial fragrances or dyes, contains no silicones and comes in a sustainable packagingI have already recommended the Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant to many of my friends and family and several of them have already purchased and used this awesome daily microfoliant and they all love using it daily as it improved their skins a lot after they started using it.
