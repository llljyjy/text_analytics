Gifted by dermalogica for my honest review.  This is a very gentle exfoliant. It comes in powder form that you put some water on and it turns into a paste texture and It lathers very well.  I really like this product. The paste is easy to apply and I have seen a really great improvement in my uneven skin texture. This product helps to deep clean my skin really well. Would definitely recommend it. nan
