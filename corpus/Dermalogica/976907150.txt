I love Dermalogica cleansers, and now I love their eye gel! I have hereditary dark undereye circles, and I have been losing sleep for one reason or another the last few months, so my eyes need a little depuffing. This eye gel has caffeine in it, which is apparently the ingredient I have been missing (in my skincare, anyway!) It is definitely firming and hydrating. I can feel my undereyes are a little tighter and smoother right after the eye gel dries. Iâ€™m hooked! I received this complimentary from Dermalogica. I'm hooked!
