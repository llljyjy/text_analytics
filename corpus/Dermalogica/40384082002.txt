I love this product. I seem to not really go for exfoliating products, mainly cuz they seem just okay to me and my skin. But with the daily mircofoliant it got rid of my dead dry skin, and my skin felt very smooth after words. My eyes also are very sensitive towards smell so I was worried before I used it, but after realize there no fragrants. Overall I’m gonna be buying more and telling my family about this!! Ps this was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling , but doesn’t mean I won’t give an honest review. Favorite exfoliate by far
