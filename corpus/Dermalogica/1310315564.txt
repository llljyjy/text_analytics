I remember my college roommate used Dermalogica and it was my first intro into high end skincare. It had been awhile since I had used this but it was a good as I remembered. Helped with the clogged blackheads I am struggling with on my nose but also is so gentle and doesnâ€™t irritate the sensitive skin around my mouth. I am glad I got back into this brand and love how it made my skin feel. I was gifted by dermalogica sampling with no requirement to write a review but I always want to share when I enjoy something So glad I tried this again!
