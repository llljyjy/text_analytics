I received samples for a one week complimentary from Dermalogica. It is really very gentle how the brand promised. No irritation and skin oil absorbs very well. I have sensitive skin, but haven’t had problems to use it daily. You can’t see much brighten result from one week, but I like how fresh and smooth my skin after. Good for sensitive skin
