I have had my eye on Dermalogicaâ€™s moisturizers for a while now and was thankful to have chosen this one to use over the winter to target dryness and overall moisture in skin health. This is an extremely pricey moisturizer but I will say it has worked well for me in my Dermalogica system. It addressed my dryness very quickly and I enjoy that moisturizer because it is not as greasy as my previously moisturizer (First Aid Ultra Moisturizer). I use about a dime size every morning and night on my face and anytime I may have a facial wash in the afternoon. If you can afford this it is a wonderful product but I am sure there may be more affordable options. I tend to enjoy using the Dermalogica system as a whole and have enjoyed seeing how my products from the company build off of each other in a positive way. Very Pricey But Effective If You Can Afford
