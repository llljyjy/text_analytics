loving this exfoliator! I have combination skin and struggle with cystic acne on my cheeks and acne on chin.I use this 2 to 3 times a week and it’s been 3 weeks so far. My skin feels soft and fresh after using and is much clearer and even now.  I bought the small size just in case I wouldn’t like it and it’s still mostly full! you only need a little shake out of the bottle and mix with wet hands to apply. make sure to let it sit for at least 30seconds so the enzymes work. I find straight aha, bha and salicylic acid exfoliators super irritating to my skin and makes it worse. nan
