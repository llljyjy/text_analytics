I received this milkfoliant as a gifted by Dermalogica to try. I had never tried a milkfoliant before using this product but now I’m hooked! It’s a dry product that you pour into your hand, mix in a little water and rub onto your face. It’s so fun to use and it leaves my face feeling super soft. I keep it in my shower and use it once a week! Love this product!
