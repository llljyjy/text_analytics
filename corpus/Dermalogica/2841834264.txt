I recently received a sample complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling of their Daily Microfoliant Exfoliator. It produces a creamy foam with a mild, fresh scent. The beads in it are very gentle, and I’ve gotten no scrapes or scratches at all. Per the directions, I also tested leaving it on an extra minute for additional brightening, and though the handful of times I tried it wasn’t enough to make a huge difference, I can report I had zero irritation. The chemical exfoliation is gentle, as well, and while I don’t see any extreme or dramatic results as far as brightening, my skin is noticeably softer and smoother after a week of use. It’s so gentle I’m able to use it twice a day without no reaction. I will note that though this exfoliant is meant to be used after washing, the foaming action does have a bit of a cleansing effect, so I do sometimes feel a bit dry. The feeling goes away completely with the rest of my usual routine, but I might require some additional moisture while using it come winter. Overall, this is a nice, gentle exfoliant that provides results without irritation. Gentle, effective exfoliation…
