I was very skeptical with this product that was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling because it’s a powder. I thought it’d be inconvenient and messy and just not good. Wow I was wrong. I read and followed the directions and this product literally melted into my skin and made my skin feel so nice and smooth and soft as you work it in. It leaves my skin feeling clean but not stripped. I really enjoyed this product and was pleasantly impressed! It didn’t break me out at all either! So impressed!
