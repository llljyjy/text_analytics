This is my go-to cleanser for everyday use! It makes my skin look so bright and even. I struggle with texture and unevenness the most so I love that this cleanser actually helps so much with brightening and smoothing everything out! Personally I like to let the cleanser sit for a minute whenever I do my night routine so it can really do it’s magic since my skin is problematic. After consistently using this I’ve seen results that I haven’t with any other cleanser so I’m definitely sticking with this in my routine! nan
