I’m currently using the Daily Microfoliant Exfoliator. It lathers so well. I had it on for about 3 minutes, continuing to form a lather on my face. It felt great. I rinsed my face off with warm water. My skin feels so refreshed and rejuvenated. This product is something that I cam use daily at night. I’m got this product as a complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. A must in my daily regimen
