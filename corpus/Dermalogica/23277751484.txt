I’m really enjoying this serum.  It doesn’t smell, it’s easy to apply and it hydrates my skin very well.  I’ve been using it twice a day and it doesn’t need much for an even application on the face and neck.  Hydration remains for many hours.  Before I used a serum and a moisturizer, now I often don’t even need to use the moisturizer afterwards. Great moisturizer
