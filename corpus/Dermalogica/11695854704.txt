My daily microfoliant gifted by Dermalogica sampling was great for my dry skin!I have dry skin that sometimes flakes a lot and this was a very good addition to my night routine. My skin was visible smoother after 5 days and I didnâ€™t get any of those flakes. At first I was unsure about using this everyday because of fear of irritation caused by over exfoliation but that was a non issue! Really glad to have tried this sample and would consider getting a full sized product in the future. Great for dry/flaky skin!
