The Daily Microfoliant was gifted to me by Dermalogica and it’s supposed to brighten your skin and smooths it. I’ve only got to try it once and it did make my face smooth. I put it where I have redness and have not seen a change. I can’t say if I recommend or not because I haven’t used it long enough. nan
