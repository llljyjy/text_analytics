This micro exfoliant gifted by Dermalogica sampling is very gentle yet effective! My skin definitely looked a bit brighter and felt smoother even after the first use. Itâ€™s gentle enough to use daily if you want, but I think even just using it 2-3 times a week is enough if you have sensitive skin like me. It froths up easily once you add a bit of water or if your hands are wet, and it washes off easily as well. Definitely worth a try! Gentle yet effective!
