Dermalogica gifted me their new Retinol Serum and Iâ€™ve been loving this one! It comes in a simple push pump plastic container, makes it easy to travel with. I love that it has zero scent and sinks into the skin quickly and with no pilling when used with my other skincare products! I have noticed that there is some dissipation to my fine lines and wrinkles. Though my fine lines and wrinkles are small they are less noticeable when smiling and forehead lines! I love this one and would recommend it to anyone! nan
