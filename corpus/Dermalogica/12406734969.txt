I love dermalogica products. I need something for acne prone skin but I’m in my early 30s and also want to start using anti-aging products. Retinol of many kinds are way too harsh on my skin. This product is GREAT. It literally sinks into the skin like water once you put it on. I personally love the earthy medicinal smell. I’m easily prone to breakouts and this hasn’t irritated my sensitive skin at all. My skin definitely is more clear and less dull. I hope this helps! Dermalogica Age bright clearing serum
