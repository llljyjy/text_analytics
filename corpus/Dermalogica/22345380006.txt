This tool gently polishes the skin, mattifies it and it becomes a little lighter.  it also works well with inflammation, if something appears, then I immediately use this peeling and it seems to dry out the pimple, stopping the process.  And what I especially like is that it evens out the tone, the skin becomes even and smoother, and it looks fresher and more well-groomed, even enlarged pores become smaller! Super clean and bright skin
