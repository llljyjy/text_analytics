I love that this is a 2 in one product so one less step in my morning routine. The formula is lightweight, moisturizing without being oily or greasy. It blended easily into my dark skin which is a huge plus! My only issue would be the scent, itâ€™s a little bit on the stronger side but overall a great product to have or to gift to those that hate to wear sunscreen. My husband hates it but will use this 2 in 1. A great combination!
