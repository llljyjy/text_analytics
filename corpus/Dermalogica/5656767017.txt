Dermalogica never misses! I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica for my honest review. Retinol is a big player in my routine so I was super excited to try this. This is a creamy serum that sinks into skin and wears beautifully underneath the rest of my nighttime regimen. This helps a lot with dark marks and acne. I like to use this over the Circulars Hydration serum from Dermalogica and my skin has been super happy with it! Great For Hyperpigmentation!
