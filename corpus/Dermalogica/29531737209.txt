This serum is wonderful! My skin can be sensitive, so retinol can irritate it sometimes. I experienced absolutely no irritation with this. It actually seemed to sooth and hydrate my skin really well. Iâ€™ve been using it and have noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin. My pores seem to be less noticeable and my skin tone seems more even. I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica - Sephora for an honest review. nan
