This product was was gifted by Demalogica sampling in exchange for my honest opinion.. The Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant has a very unique rice based formula.  It’s a powder exfoliant that smooths skin with Papaya Enzymes & Salicylic Acid, it also brightens skin with Phytic Acid & Rice Bran.  This Microfoliant is so easy to use, all you need to do to activate the powder is add water and rub it in your hands until it turns into a foamy paste.. Once it’s a foamy paste apply to your face and rub in a circular motion for one minute then rinse, that’s it!! Unlike regular dermabrasion this is much more gentle to the skin and the results are fantastic!  I was able to see a difference in the way my skin looked and felt after just one use!  The only downside to this is that I’m not a cleanser and an exfoliant in one so it adds an extra step to your routine.  I really love this product and will continue to use it!  I will definitely be recommending the Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant to all my friends and family! Great Microfoliant!
