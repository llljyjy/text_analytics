The powder is a little hard to work with but once it’s foamed up, the texture is really lovely on skin. Not too scratchy, not too aggressive - it’s a nice smooth lather with some exfoliating pieces. Overall a nice product, just a little hard to use. It is also REALLY expensive. *gifted by Dermalogica Sampling in exchange for honest review nan
