Iâ€™ve been using this cleanser about two weeks now and I really like it. It has a very nice and light scent, not overbearing at all. My face feels and looks so clean and I feel like it does look a bit brighter. Both pictures are with no makeup, second one was just after cleansing on day 9. I look forward to seeing the long term results of this ðŸ˜Š Give it a shot
