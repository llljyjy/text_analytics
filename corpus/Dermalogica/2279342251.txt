I’ve used the Daily Microfoliant off and on for several years and it’s a product that I like to return to periodically because it actually works.   It gently but effectively exfoliates without causing excessive dryness or skin irritation.   I like how it’s a customizable product in the sense that the user can decide how concentrated--and therefore how abrasive--they want their cleansing solution to be based on the exfoliating particule-to-water ratio used.   It’s a lovely cleanser, easy to use, and seemingly suitable for every skin type.*I received this particular sample complimentary from Dermalogica Samplingfor review. nan
