I have been living this vitamin C eye serum- it’s the perfect pick me up for my eyes especially in the mornings. It gives my skin a nice glow and makes my eyes look less tired. It doesn’t have a smell so it won’t irritate my eyes either. I started to use it at night as well and have noticed the skin around my eyes are brighter Ans less puffy Love love
