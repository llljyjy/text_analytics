I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. It definitely is a good exfoliant, however I found that it almost was a little too rough on my skin. I also wasn’t a huge fan of the application since it was a powder and I felt like I wasted some of it. But I could see how this would be nice in some cases like traveling! I did like that it didn’t have too much of a scent and it did leave my skin feeling nice after even if it was a little red. If you are looking for a quality rough exfoliant, this is definitely for you! nan
