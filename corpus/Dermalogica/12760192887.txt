This is one of the few cleansers that I feel actually cleanses and clears my skin. I have fair, combination/acne prone skin and this doesn’t dry me out. It has also really improved the texture of my skin. Wouldn’t recommend for people with dry skin as I think it might dry them out, but for me with somewhat oilier skin, it really works. Nice!
