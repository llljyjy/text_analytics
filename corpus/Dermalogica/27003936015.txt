This is hands down my new favorite retinol product! The texture is thin and creamy, it soaks into the skin like a dream, and my other products lay amazing on top of it! I have seen great results for only using this for only 2 weeks, my skin feels softer/smoother, texture is less noticeable, and overall complexion is more even and brighter!
