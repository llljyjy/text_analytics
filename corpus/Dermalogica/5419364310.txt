I had high hopes for this product but can’t say that I really understand the purpose do maybe I’m doing something wrong. I expected that since it starts as a powder texture it would be exfoliating feeling but when you add liquid it just gets creamy. Which is fine, but why not just make it a creamy pork duct to begin with? I did receive it complimentary from dermalogica. nan
