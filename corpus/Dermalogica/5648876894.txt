As I always recommend, give any skincare product specially anything from Dermalogica atleast 2 weeks before you notice any difference. I use this serum everyday during my morning skincare regimen, I instantly feel the much needed hydration one tip, always apply it to your damp face and let it air dry before you move onto the next product. Also since it has vitamin C, donâ€™t forget to use sunblock of you use it during the Day. I receieved this product complimentary from Dermalogica in exchange of an honest review. Just as good ad the Biolumin C mosturizer
