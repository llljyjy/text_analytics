I LOVE this sunscreen for the fall to early spring. It is so good at protecting the skin, moisturizing, and leaves no white cast. It completely disappears into the skin, without collecting on the eyebrows or at the hair line. For reference, I’m dark tan with very black hair. It is a great base for makeup, and doesn’t pill with makeup or my other skincare products. If you are a fan of the elegance of Korean sunscreens, this is very comparable and I prefer this even slightly to most Korean sunscreens (bc I can actually get my hands on it when I need it and there is very little to no smell). I am a retin-A user, and this has been such a good compliment. It has also helped me keep my hyperpigmentation at bay, which I am very prone to. Overall, this product is totally worth it! Absolutely worth it! No white cast!
