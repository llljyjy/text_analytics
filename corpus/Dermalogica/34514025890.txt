This product is a really great exfoliant. Itâ€™s milky granules that melt into a really soft lather that foams on the skin. The texture is really smooth and soft. It made my skin feel very clean and refreshed. The product did not break my skin out at all. The smell is good and I would recommend using this before any serum or cream! The This product was gifted by Dermalogica. Awesome exfoliant!
