This product was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling in return for my honest review.  I was a little worried upon realizing that this product was a powder and it had to be mixed that it would make a big mess but it really did not it only takes a few drops of water to activate and massage cleanser after using this exfoliant my skin felt a lot smoother and just in general a lot cleaner First time using a powder exfoliant
