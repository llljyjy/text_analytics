Gifted to me by Dermalogica for my honest review.  I was so excited to hear that they came out with a sensitive skin/calming version of the microfoliant. This product left my sensitive skin smooth and moisturized. I think itâ€™s suitable to use daily if needed. I do think that normal skin might find this product not enough exfoliation. Great for sensitive skin!
