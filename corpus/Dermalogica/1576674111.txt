I was very unimpressed with this oil cleanser. For something that costs this much, and from a reputable brand, I expected a lot more. Firstly, the fragrance in it is completely unnecessary and I’m sure it contributed to the irritation it caused my skin. Secondly, it broke me out so severely - my face hasn’t looked this bad since I was a teenager. I’m so glad I was able to return this product. I would not recommend it to anyone with even slightly sensitive skin. Definitely not for anybody who’s acne prone. I obviously used this product as my first cleanse and followed up with a secondary cleanser, so I know it was completely washed off, but it still left my skin in a state of complete and utter disaster. No other oil cleanser has done this to me before. Dermalogica, do better! Absolutely not
