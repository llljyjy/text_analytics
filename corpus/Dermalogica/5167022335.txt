This is my favorite chemical filter sunscreen. It’s so easy to apply and rub in with no white cast, and it doesn’t burn my eyes. It is super hydrating, too, so every time I use it I actually skin my moisturizer and just use this- my dry skin loves it and it protects my fair skin from sunburn. Hydrating and easy to rub in
