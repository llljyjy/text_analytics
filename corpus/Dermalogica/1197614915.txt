I have normal/combo skin that has some fine lines. I try to wear sunscreen everyday but sometimes I skip it because so many that I’ve tried leave a heavy or greasy feel on my skin but this one has changed that! It goes on just like a light moisturizer and sinks in so fast while still leaving my skin feeling moisturized but not weighed down. The smell is light and not overpowering at all, it smells like a regular non-scented sunscreen to me. This sits great under makeup as well which is a plus for me and it doesn’t leave any whitish cast behind which is great too. I love that this has skincare benefits to it as well rather than just being an spf. I feel like my skin is getting some great ingredients while it’s also being protected from the sun. I’m wearing my spa everyday now without fail because of this product and that’s a feat in and of itself! If you hate the feeling of heavy sunscreen and want to give your skin some love you gotta pick this up. SPF and skin love all in one!
