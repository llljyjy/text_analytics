A friend of mine is absolutely crazy about this stuff, so I knew I had to try it. It’s easy enough to use… after cleansing, pour about half a teaspoon worth of product into very wet hands, rub your hands to form a lather, and then massage on your face in circular motions. It’s not quite as gritty or “exfoliating” as I was expecting, but it still does the job, and very gently at that. After use my skin feels smoother and does indeed look brighter. Now I understand why she loves it so much! nan
