I have such mixed feelings on under eye products, mostly because my issues are beyond cosmetics because of the bags that I have but I always have hope for a miracle product. This gel is ok, I canâ€™t say I saw a difference in my bags but it felt nice and kept the eye area feeling hydrated and prepped for makeup application. Gifted by dermalogica nan
