I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica for review. This hydrating serum is fabulously hydrating. It glides effortlessly onto my skin and leaves it looking plump, dewy, and refreshed. It offers long lasting hydrating with a lightweight finish. I especially love this when my skin is feeling a bit patched and needs the extra hydration. My only critiques of this serum would be that I’m not in love with how it smells and my wallet wishes it was less expensive, but you can’t always have it all. So hydrating!
