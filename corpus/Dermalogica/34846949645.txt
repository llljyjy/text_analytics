This was gifted by Dermatologica in return for my honest review.  I have tried a lot of eye products.  I work in ophthalmology, so I am very particular about my eye gels/creams.  The Awaken Peptide Gel left my eye area feeling incredibly smooth and I felt my makeup smoothed easier too. It did flake off slightly as the day progressed, but I think if I moisturize my eye area more that won’t happen.  I also felt my eyes were more “awake“ as the title suggests.  If you’re looking for a smoothing eye gel that feels incredible when you put it on, give this one a try. Smooth Eye Gel!
