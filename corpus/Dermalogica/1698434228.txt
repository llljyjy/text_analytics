#dermalogicagiftedme the MultiVitamin Power Recovery Mask which is packed with concentrated antioxidants to visibly brighten, hydrate, and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. I’ve been leaving it on overnight mask and after a couple weeks of doing this twice a week I’ve noticed an improvement in my skin’s dryness. The results are noticeable after washing off. An added bonus is that you don’t need to apply moisturizer afterwards. My Skin feels so smooth and soft after using this, highly recommend. Soft and hydrating skin
