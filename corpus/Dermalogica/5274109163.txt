I was gifted by Dermalogica sampling. I wanted to like this but I’m not a fan of the powder. I really thought I would like it but it just wasn’t for me. I need to be able to grab dab wash and go and this honestly was just not for me. I didn’t really notice anything different but only used a sample for a weeks worth. Not for me
