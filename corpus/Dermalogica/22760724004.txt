I have been obsessed with skincare and face cleansing is an important part of the process. And I found daily milkfoliant by dermalogica and dermalogica gifted me to test their new product. I have to say I’m very impressed with the result. It is a powder-like product you can wet your hands and dispense some milkfoliant and rub your hands together to create a leather then gently massage your face in a circular motion avoiding the eye area. Don’t forget to rinse thoroughly. After washing, my skin feels soft and hydrated. Soft & Hydrated!
