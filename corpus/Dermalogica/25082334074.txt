This serum has a lightweight lotion texture (not as liquidy as a regular serum) and feels very comfortable on my skin. This is a gentle formula - it didnâ€™t cause any irritation or sensitivity at all (although my skin is quite used to retinol). It also contains squalene which is great for soothing and moisturizing. Amazing retinol serum and I have high hopes for it (gifted by Dermalogica for my honest opinions). nan
