Finding a good spf for a combo skin has been a challenge for me. My skin starts to look oily in a few hours after using most of spf creams & I also don’t like the white residue that most spfs leave on the skin. This spf truly is a game changer! My skin feels and looks amazing, smooth and soft throughout the entire day. 50 protection actually works even on a sunny day in Florida. Dermalogica products are the best and I’ll  definitely buy this cream again! nan
