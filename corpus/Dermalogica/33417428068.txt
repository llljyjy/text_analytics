It is complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. I am always a fan of Dermalogica. I like this microfoliant sample so much. This enzyme powder creates a creamy paste with water. I massage it on my face gently for one minute, then rinse thoroughly. My skin feels so refreshing and looks brighter. Great exfoliator
