I was so excited to try out this exfoliant. While my skin is somewhat sensitive, I had heard this one was good for more sensitive skins. I have used it 3 times now, and have noticed a few pimples surface since then. My skin feels so clean after using this exfoliant, so I am going to keep using because I think my skin is just purging due to new product. purging skin but refreshed
