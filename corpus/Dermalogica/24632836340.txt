For the past week I’ve been using Dermalogica’s Daily Microfoliant which Dermalogica gifted to me for my honest review and I’m happy to tell you that I love it.   What starts out as an exfoliating powder in your hands quickly becomes a creamy paste to rub all over your face.  I’ll admit,  it took me a couple of trys to get it right.  At first I added to much water, then the next day, I went to rub my hands together and spilled most of the powder in the sink but I’m happy to report, that even a little powder goes a long way.  My pictures are from day two.   Since I added too much water and lost some of my powder the exfoliant was much thinner.    But I went ahead and mixed it up in my hands and which created some wonderful soapy bubbles for my face.  As I’ve gotten older my face has started to break out a bit more,  but one of the ingredients in this powder,  salicylic acid, which actually helped to clear up the small bumps.  It also had a brighting effect through the use of Phytic Acid.  However,  I’m so pale I didn’t really notice a difference.   The scent is very clean and my face feels healthier.  No bumps or dry patches. Powder pack becomes an excellent face scrub.
