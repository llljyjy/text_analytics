Good cleanser and yet another great find from Dermalogica! However, my combo skin did feel a little dry after using it as a standalone cleanser but worked fine with double cleansing! To truly see the effects of Glycolic acid I would have to use it for a while but itâ€™s promising. Would be a great value addition if you have oily skin. nan
