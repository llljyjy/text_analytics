The way this product goes from a very Sandy/Crumbly product to a mail key soft substance is fascinating. The way that this product also doesn’t have a scent that is disturbing, it’s quite comforting to my skin. I highly highly recommend this product. It’s one of the products that I don’t find irritating on the skin as well Outstanding
