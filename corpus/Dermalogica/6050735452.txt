This SPF is super hydrating and glides on the skin! I love that it is SPF 50, and has anti-aging benefits. My only complaint is that once I applied makeup over it, the formula started to pill up and flake away. I would probably only wear this on days I’m not wearing makeup just to be sure I don’t have that issue again. Otherwise, it’s an awesome formula! Lovely formula for non-makeup days
