I received this product gifted by Dermalogica. This serum runs real nice on the skin. It left my skin feeling hydrated and “bouncy”- the texture feels similar to another (much pricier) hyaluronic acid serum on the market.I’ve used this in conjunction with some other products to achieve the “glass skin” look. Overall, I like this product. However, I don’t find it too unique amongst similar products out there- so it all boils down to brand preference or brand loyalty.Would I use this again? Yes!Would I repurchase this again? Maybe. So refreshing!
