I’ve used Dermalogica on my clientele before, but I came across this kit and wanted to see if Dermalogica would work on my skin as well. & my skin is loving this product, the cleanser is gentle, cleans my skin well & does not leave it feeling dry, same goes for the daily microfoliant. I only do the double cleanse method when I’m removing heavy makeup. I have Normal, Dry & breakout prone skin, and so far since using this kit I haven’t broke out.I will consider getting the full size product after this runs out, it will now permanently be a part of my skincare routine. my skin feels soft & good
