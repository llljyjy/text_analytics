I’ve been dealing with texture since I basically started puberty and no other product has helped me like this. I was using an SA cleanser to help with texture but it just wasn’t producing the show stopping results I wanted. So I revised my skincare routine and added this and I’m glad I did. After just 3 days I noticed a difference. 7 days after my skin had made a full 180. I love that it’s gentle enough to use once a day as well. This is my holy grail exfoliate. Baby Soft Skin
