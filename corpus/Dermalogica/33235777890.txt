Dermalogica gifted me this product and I absolutely love it and will buy more for myself when I run out. Although it is a foaming type of paste , it felt gentle on my skin. I have found a little goes a long way. It has a great smell which is unlike mass- market products. This will definitely be added into my daily skincare routine. Definitely adding to my skincare routine!
