I decided to treat myself to a better skin routine. I was using only 2 steps for my AM and PM skin care - face wash and Aveeno body moisturizer. I tried Dermalogica and although I am adding about 3 more steps (precleanse, face wash, exfoliator, Estee Lauder Serum, Estee Lauder Moisturizer) it is not adding much time to my routine. The steps bleed effortlessly into one another. I only dry my face once during this process after the exfoliator step where I then apply serum and moisturizer. It feels like a mini spa experience twice a day! My skin has large pores and is prone to breakout but I feel the product is really keeping my skin clear and moisturized. I am not using products specifically for skin texture or acne but feel my complexion has improved using just this starter sampler. I am planning to purchase more after my current supply runs out! Invest in your skin routine - it is worth it
