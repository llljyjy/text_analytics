Gifted by Dermalogica Sampling- Used it a few times, it does not have a scent to it, itâ€™s just a white powder that needs to be mixed with water and massaged on the skin. I found it very messy to work with, the powder got on my entire bathroom counter. It is meant to be a physical exfoliant so it felt grainy with somewhat large beads. I would honestly rather a pre made and a chemical exfoliant like alpha or beta hydroxy acid!No mess, even results, happy life :) Unnecessarily messy to use
