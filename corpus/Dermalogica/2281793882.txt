This product was gifted by Dermalogica for review purposes. I am a fan of many Dermalogica’s products, but this one was somewhat disappointing just because it’s not what I expected. It’s an okay product, but if you want this product to gently, physically exfoliate your skin, this is not the product for you. Once water is mixed into this powder, it turns into foam. It does however have AHAs and BHAs to chemically exfoliate the skin. I didn’t see or feel much of a difference after using this. My skin was maybe a little softer, but it wasn’t mind-blowingly soft. I just don’t see myself reaching for this often because I’d much rather use a more potent and effective exfoliating toner/treatment or serum to get my dose of AHAs and BHAs. If you have really sensitive skin and you are looking for a chemical exfoliant, this might work for you. nan
