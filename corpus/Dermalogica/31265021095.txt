I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica. Found a new staple of my skincare routine. Dermalogica never dissapoints so this product is not an exception. This eye cream is one of the best I have tried. As a sleepless mom, I have dark circles under my eyes that never go away. I also have fine lines that keeps increasing. This cream is totally magical. It’s consistency is just so perfect. It is not too light but not too thick either. Just the right consistency. It doesn’t clash with make up. It absorbs fast.It significantly reduced my dark circles which is truly a blessing for me. As around my eyes are really sensitive spot, I have experience no irritation whatsoever. After application my skin feels hydrated and nourished. Really happy with this product so far. Highly reccomend. Best eye gel!
