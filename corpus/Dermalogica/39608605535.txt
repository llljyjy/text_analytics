I have never used this product before until I recieved free gifted by Dermaligica Sampling for the honest review. First day, I can feel some itchy and crash on my skin  maybe because of eczema. A 2-3 days of using this microfoliant, my skin feel likely be flaky, as layers of dead skin cells were slowly being sloughed off. After about 5-6 days, my skin starts to nice a complete change  better! I recommend for everyone! If your skin have sensitive skin shoul be test on hand before apply on your face. Big-fan of my skin!
