I used the dermatologica Calming oat-base powder exfoliat for 7 days and as from day 1 I noticed a significant difference in my skin brightening,  looks more clean , my pores looks a bit small, the only drawback is that I feel my skin a bit dry but I applied my night moistener and it is solvedI used it mostly as part of my cleaning routine during the night. It has a neutral scent  “oat scent“ . I love the exfoliate feeling in the skin.  The product texture is powder and with the wet hands you make the texture ready to apply. Thank you @dermalogicacanada, @sephoracanada, #giftedbydermalogic Excellent Product
