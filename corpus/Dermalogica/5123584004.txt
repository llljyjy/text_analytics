I have historically always used really good eye creams. It takes a lot for something to be a stand out for me. I haven’t been sleeping well lately, and my usual day and night creams weren’t doing a good job combatting the visuals making that apparent. After a couple of uses my eyes were noticeably brighter, smoother and less puffy. Am really impressed by this. This was gifted by dermologica for review but all opinions are my own.  Not a terrible price point for its effectiveness either in comparison for what I’m used to having to spend to get the effects I want. nan
