This is one of my all-time favorite sunscreens, and I’ve used up well over 10 bottles. It feels like a regular moisturizer, keeping the skin hydrated and soft. It’s best suited for someone with normal to dry skin, or for using during the cold winter months. No noticeable white cast on light skin tone (can’t speak for other skin tones though.) nan
