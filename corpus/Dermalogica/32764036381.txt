I got complimentary from Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant Sampling , I used it after I received it, Be careful when pouring it on your hand, there will be powder flying, It is easy to generate foam when rubbed in your hands, and there are particles in it, which can cleanse the skin very well and remove dead skin. After cleansing, the skin is very smooth and not greasy, and I will repurchase. Very clean
