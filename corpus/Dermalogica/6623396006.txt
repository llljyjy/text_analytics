This was gifted to me complimentary by Dermalogica Sampling. This is a manual exfoliant—meaning it has tiny grains to exfoliate the skin. It comes as a powder and you have to use some water to make paste. It’s not a bad product but I personally still prefer chemical exfoliation. If you are sensitive to chemical exfoliants, this is absolutely one of the better means of exfoliating. The granules are really tiny and cause little irritation.I give it 4 stars not because I would buy it but because I think someone who likes manual exfoliant will love the size of the granules. And maybe even the delivery system. It’s good for a manual exfoliant
