It’s okay. Little or no white cast on me. Feels nice, not greasy, absorbs fast. Love that it’s mineral only. I don’t like how after 2 hours it starts sort of pilling. I know realistically that’s when I should wipe it off and reapply anyway, but it’s beside the point. It’s good at first but a while later it just feels icky. I also wish it was spf 50. I’m sure this works great for some. I recommend putting it on in store from a tester and seeing how you like it. Sadly, I will be continuing my search for my perfect daily sunscreen:/ nan
