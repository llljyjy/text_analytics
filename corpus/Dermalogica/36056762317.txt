I received the Dermalogica Daily Microfolient as part of a sampling program and just love it.  The powder form is very simple to use and foams up in my hands with a little water.  I love the soft exfoliating feel on my face and it washes off clean, without any residue.  It left my skin so soft without any harshness.  Great to use for day and night routine and is very gentle to remove makeup.  Highly recommend.  This sample was complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling Gentle and Effective
