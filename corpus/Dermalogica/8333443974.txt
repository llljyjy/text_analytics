It comes out as a fine yet coarse powder that’s activated with some water. It becomes a paste. It smells a little unpleasant, like baby throw up. But I deal with it because I like the exfoliating feel. Not super abrasive like St Ives, but I use it twice weekly. Only giving 4 stars because I wish it wasn’t a twist top, it’s a little inconvenient since I keep this in the shower. nan
