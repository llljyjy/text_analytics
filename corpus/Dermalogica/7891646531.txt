The dermalogica serum texture was amazing! It was not as watery as a regular serum but not as thick as a face cream. It was very light weight which I loved. It has a very light floral like scent but it was still very gentle. I do not have wrinkles but itâ€™s always good to use retinol to prevent them. Complimentary from dermalogica Amazing texture!
