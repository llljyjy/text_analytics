I had high hopes for this one since Dermalogica has some great products which Iâ€™ve tried in the past but this is one I would not recommend for sensitive skin. The abrasion felt too rough for my skin which resulted in redness as well as gave me an itch which is rare for me. I really did not see any amazing results either which would make me want to continue using it.  Daily Microfoliant was gifted by Dermalogica for my honest review. nan
