As someone who wears SPF everyday and loves trying out new products, I was so excited to try out a new product. Let me tell you, Dermalogica’s Dynamic Skin Recovery SPF50 Moisturizer does not disappoint! I’ve been wearing it under my makeup for the past week and I’m obsessed. I apply a little all over my face — I love how quickly it absorbs without leaving a sticky or oily feeling behind. It’s high SPF, but doesn’t leave a white cast. After using it for about a week, I’ve noticed my skin looking hydrated and smoother! Looking forward to seeing results after extended use! nan
