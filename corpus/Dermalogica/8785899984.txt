Dermatological does no wrong! I have their SPF that is much lighter for the summer and just got this one to moisturize and protect in the winter. I’m super happy with it it goes on very smooth feels moisturizing and doesn’t seem to clog my pores. Extra bonus that it does not contain chemicals that harm our reefs nan
