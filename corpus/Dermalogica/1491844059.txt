If I could only keep one item in my skincare routine, this would be it! Before taking the plunge on this product, I was already starting to see fine lines on my forehead (at 27!). I figured the lines were just part of the normal aging process and there was nothing I could do about it. Boy was I wrong! Within just a week of using this product, my skin looked super happy and hydrated. The fine lines vanished and people are constantly complimenting me on how my skin looks. I’m 30 now and people are shocked when they find out because they think I’m barely old enough to have graduated college. I love this stuff and recommend it to everyone who is struggling with dry or dry combination skin! Completely Transformed my Dry Skin!
