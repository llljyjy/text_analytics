I’ve been using dermalogica for over a decade and I have the daily exfoliant, superfoliant. Love them for different reasons. The milkfoliant is amazing though, so delicate it does the job for us sensitive skin people. This one can definitely be used 2-3 times a week. I don’t exfoliate daily so I can’t speak to that. I’d say try it out. I love it so far. Not a paid review
