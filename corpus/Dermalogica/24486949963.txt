This is my new favorite moisturizer! I absolutely LOVE it! I am a huge fan of everything Dermalogica makes, but this is one of the best. I love that it is spf 50, an actually amount that will protect my skin. It dries down so beautifully and layers so well under face oil at night and makeup in the morning. My skin feels so hydrated but not greasy at all like most spf feels. Also the fine lines around my eyes and mouth look so plump and smooth after I use this! Absolutely love and will continue to use this for as long as itâ€™s made. Obsessed!
