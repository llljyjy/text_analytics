I have pretty sensitive skin and this stuff does not irritate my skin. I do really like this face wash. Salyicylic acid is such a great ingredient for getting congestion out of the skin and clearing out poors. This face wash does end up leaving my skin a little dry but its 100% worth it and easily fixed with a good moisturizer. (Received Complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling.) nan
