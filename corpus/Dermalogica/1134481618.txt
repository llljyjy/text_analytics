Loved this! It worked super well on my sensitive skin that is prone to a lot of redness. It’s calming, but smoothes out your skin. At first I thought it wouldn’t be abrasive enough, but my skin felt and looked really renewed and soft after. Will continue to buy in the larger size now that I’ve tested the smaller. so good
