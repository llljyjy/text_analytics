Great serum to add to the morning routine! It is lightly scented, but it’s a pleasant citrus smell, definitely a benefit in the morning. It fits well into the routine - after toner and before Vit C serum. Hydrating without a tacky finish and doesn’t pill, like most hyaluronic acid serums I’ve tried. It gives a healthy and subtle glow and sits well under makeup. I really like using it right after a chemical & physical exfoliant and under a sheet mask, to really soak the new skin layer with all the hydration. With that said, I took one star off the price, as I don’t think it is worth the $79CAD price tag. I have no problem paying for the Vit C serum by Dermalogica ($123CAD), because it’s just perfect and accomplishes what it says, but maybe not for this hydrating serum. Great For Everyday Hydration
