This is a very gentle exfoliant that you can use daily. Now I have sensitive skin so I would only use it weekly but I can see why for some that itâ€™s possible! Very mild and I love how creamy it feels on the skin. Since this is activated by water, I can easily bring this with me on travel trips! Kindly gifted by Dermalogica. Easy for travel!
