Gifted by Dermalogica - Sephora for review. This cleanser is really nice! It’s enough that I feel like I’m getting a deep clean, but without feeling “squeaky clean”. I’m acne prone and have dry skin, so finding something that works is sometimes difficult. I’d compare this to YTTP’s cleanser in that it isn’t super drying but cleanses well. nan
