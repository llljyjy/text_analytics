Such a great SPF product. Smells light but fresh and feels super moisturizing on the skin. This is even good for my sensitive eyes that burn with most SPFs. I’ve been using it for a couple weeks and I even see an improvement in the clarity of my skin. All around such a great product. I’ll definitely be rebuying. nan
