I received this complimentary from Dermalogica. I really like the exfoliation when rubving it on my face.  My skin felt so hydrated and soft right after each use.  The scent is amazing. It smells like mild soap which I like. I didnâ€™t notice it brighten my skin like the description though. Smells Amazing!
