The texture was different than I expected. Very hydrating and gentle! Tried it after it was gifted by Dermalogica and wish I tried it sooner. Loved how smooth and soft my skin felt after. I used this after pre cleansing and cleansing with Dermalogica as well and WOW. The combination has truly changed my skin. nan
