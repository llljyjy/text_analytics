I have been wanting to try this product for a while so I finally decided to put it to the test! I’ve been using this product every single morning for a week now, and I’m impressed with the results so far! I apply 5-7 drops of the serum to cleansed skin while the skin is still slightly damp for maximum absorption. The serum absorbs into the skin very easily and leaves behind a luminous glow. After application my skin feels more hydrated. I follow up with an eye cream and a moisturizer to create the perfect skincare base for makeup. Through using it for a week, I’ve noticed that my skin appears brighter and it has helped my acne hyperpigmentation fade faster as well. Overall, I am really enjoying the results of this product so far and will continue using it every morning as part of my AM skincare routine. Even though this product was gifted by Dermalogica - Sephora, this is my honest review after testing the product for a week. The results speak for itself. Leaves skin moisturized and luminous
