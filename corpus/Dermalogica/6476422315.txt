I have been struggling so much lately with getting a full night’s rest and that predictably leaves me with puffy, dark circles under my eyes. There are so many eye products out there that claim to depuff that area but aren’t actually very effective. This gel actually does what it claims to do, very quickly too. It’s not a miracle worker, of course—I still need to work on getting that rest as that is the underlying issue—but in the meantime, if I want to look more composed, I reach for this. It smooths the area under my eye and makes it less swollen, and it also gets those crows feet ironed out too. A little goes a long way so I’m not too worried about this lasting a long while, although it is expensive for the amount you get.Complimentary from Dermalogica Surprisingly effective!!
