I have liked the Dermalogica products that I’ve tried in the past and this daily microfoliant is no different. I have sensitive skin and so I was a little on the fence if my skin could handle it for 7-days in a row. Thankfully, it was delicate enough that I had no issues with redness or irritation from the product. I was honestly surprised, pleasantly so! I love that you can pour out as little or as much as you like and then mix it in with water to get your desired amount. Even adding a little water, the exfoliation isn’t rough at all. This has definitely sold me on purchasing in the future! This was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling, however, this is my honest opinion. nan
