I received this product complimentary from Dermatologica Sampling.  I was a bit skeptical to use this because I have some PTSD from the physical exfoliants of my teensâ€”Think St. Ives Apricot (Glass) Scrub! However, I was surprised that I really do like this product. It is dispensed as a fine powder into wet hands, which morphs the powder into a liquid-paste type compound. While applying to the face, most of the product glides around with some micro fine particles gentle rubbing the skin as it is moved around. It rinses easily, and there is no grittiness or weird residue left behind. After just one use, my skin felt amazing and even my makeup looks so much better! I think I will buy a small size and continue using this for a while before I invest in the larger size, but this is a definite win! A new convert
