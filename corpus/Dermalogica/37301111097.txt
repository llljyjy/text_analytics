I got this unique exfoliator gifted by dermalogica. It’s the first exfoliator and powder skincare product I’ve used and I couldn’t have had a mor epositive experience with the time I’ve used it. I’ve never got irritation from using this and after applying it leaves me with an even appearance, smooth looking/feeling skin that doesn’t give me a shiny glow but doesn’t leave me looking dull either. I haven’t had any long term big changes with my skin but after uses my skin has looked great so its only been positive for me. nan
