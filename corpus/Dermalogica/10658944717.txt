Obsessed is an understatement.  I received this complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling, I don’t use it daily but it doesn’t aggravate my rosacea when I use it 2-3 times a wee and seems to calm my redness.  It leaves my skin feeling really soft but not stripped.  I defiantly recommend this to everyone of my friends.  I encourage you to get a sample at your local Sephora to ensure this product is right for you! The best Routine
