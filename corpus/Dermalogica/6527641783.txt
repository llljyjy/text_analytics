This product is a gentle exfoliator that is suitable for all skin types. Unlike regular exfoliators, the Daily Microfoliant is a fine powder. To activate you mix with water to make a paste and apply gently to your skin. I have combination skin where my tzone is oily while the rest is dry, especially around my mouth. I was worried this would make my dry bits feel stripped. I used this during my nightly routine after cleansing my face.  After using the first time my face felt clean, polished but not stripped. My skin felt and looked healthy. My skin continued to benefit from using this every other night. It looks brighter, healthier and feels great. That being said, it didnâ€™t get rid of my stubborn blackheads or make my skin flaw free. Maybe with longer use it could have made a bigger difference? I personally think the price is a bit steep but if you can afford it, I think this is a decent product.  Gifted by Dermalogica Sampling nan
