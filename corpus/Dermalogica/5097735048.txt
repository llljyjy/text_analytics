I was pretty impressed to see how smooth and radiant my skin looks and feels after using this dermalogica daily microfoliant faithfully.  I was worried it would be too much to use every day but it is not. My skin feels so soft. I am kind of obsessed with this particular multi-ingredient rice powder formula because it is gentle but really effective. Even my make up goes on smoother. I got so many compliments from friends and family at the holiday parties last month so I know itâ€™s apparent. My skin actually looks brighter and more radiant even without makeup. This is easy to incorporate into my every day skin care regimen so I will continue to use it. Skin has a radiant glow even makeup free
