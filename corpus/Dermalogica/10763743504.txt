I received this complimentary from Dermalogica. The season being a dry winter that tends to leave me patchy and with weird skin this mask was necessary. My skin really does need all the vitamins and love it could possibly get. This mask left my skin feeling great and looking so hydrated and lively. Not to mention the smell was pretty moderate too which I highly appreciate. Cool mask
