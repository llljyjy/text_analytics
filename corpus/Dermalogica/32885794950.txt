It’s winter & I have combination dry skin which gets even drier during winter and when I travel out of state so this mask has been a life saver for me, leave my skin feeling hydrated, lifted and with an inner glow that I can’t even describe. Thank goodness I found it this winter! Must Have for Winter/Fall!
