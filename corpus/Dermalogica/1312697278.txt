Another great product from Dermalogica: their daily exfoliant. It is a powder cleanser with rice enzymesto brighten the skin. It contains other ingredients like salicylic acid, white tea and licorice, and oatmeal and allantoin to exfoliate, balance, and soothe the skin.I like that it is a rice-based powder, since rice water is great for brightening the skin. I also like that you can adjust the amount of exfoliation and lather depending on the amount of water you add. Personally, I enjoy the coarser lather and really feeling the exfoliation.If you donâ€™t know, Dermalogica is a professional-grade skincare brand. I trust the quality of their products. They are also certified cruelty-free, gluten-free, vegan, clean and ethical. Great exfoliating cleanser
