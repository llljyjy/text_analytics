gifted by Dermalogica Sampling- I love this 7 day sample I got from the brand to review. It’s the perfect amount of product for a one time use! The product it self is a great cleanser option if you want to exfoliate gently without using harsh actives or scrubs. While this is a “scrub” it’s very gentle and makes my skin super smooth! nan
