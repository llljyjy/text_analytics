I really love this brand but I’m not sure if this is the product for me. I’m 31yrs old but I don’t feel like I have a lot of issues with under eye so maybe that’s why I don’t see any results? I like the consistency, it’s like a gel and you need less than a pea sized amount. It feels nice and hydrating and a bit cooling as well. This product was gifted by Dermalogica. Cooling & hydrating
