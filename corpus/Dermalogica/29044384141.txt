Dermalogica Sampling gifted me this for my honest review. Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant- smooths and brightens skin in 7 days. Smooths with Papaya Enymes and Salicylic Acid. Brighten with Physical Acid from Rice Bran. To activate exfoliant powder with water, lather into foam frothy paste in hands. Apply in circular motion for one minute and rinse off. It is easy to use. My skin doesnâ€™t feel dried out. No irritation, redness or breakouts caused by this product. Nice Product
