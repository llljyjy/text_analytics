really love dermologica products and have loved this one so far! after a week of using it in between cleansing and moisturizing, i feel like my skin is holding its hydration better. the serum is thicker, which is nice so it doesnâ€™t run down my face, and has a nice light scent. gifted by Dermalogica but would purchase on my own to refill! great for dry skin
