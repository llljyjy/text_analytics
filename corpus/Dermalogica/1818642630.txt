Thiis product was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling in exchange for my real and honest opinion. If youâ€™re looking for a gentle, daily exfoliant, look no further. This product starts off as a powder, but once you add water it foams up nicely. I instantly felt that my skin was softer and after using this product for a week, my skin feels smoother and more hydrated. Perfect for Everyday Use
