I received an 8 sample pack that was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. This was interesting. This daily microfoliant left my skin feeling smooth and soft, but slightly dry.  My skin does feel clean after. I did not have any reactions when using this product, but I do not see much brightening on my skin after 7 days use. nan
