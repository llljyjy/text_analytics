This product is a staple in my routine. I suffer with blackheads frequently and this is the only product that’s helped! It doesn’t dry my skin out and it’s not harsh. It lathers really well and a little really goes a long way. I’ve gotten 3 uses just out of one packet and my full size bottle lasts me about 4-6 months. Literally can’t say enough good about this! If you suffer with acne and blackheads…this is a must have. Gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. A must have for blackheads and acne prone skin!
