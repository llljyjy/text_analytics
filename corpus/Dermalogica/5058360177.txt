This has been a long time favorite product of mine, but in the hustle and bustle of moving a year and a half ago, I never replenished it and I don’t know why. I received it and I won’t let it go again. It’s gentle but effective on my skin and leaves my skin incredibly soft and and the texture improved a ton. Smoother, brighter and less bumpy... win win win Won't let this one go again
