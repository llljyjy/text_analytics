Definitely one of my new fave sunscreens. I already love dermalogica but they really did a great job here! This leaves my skin moisturized and glowing all while being light weight. It doesnâ€™t leave my skin looking or feeling greasy. The spf is also higher than 30 so it leaves me feeling protected and secured ! nan
