This hydration serum is lightweight and yet hydrates the skin. I love the consistency thatâ€™s never heavy and really sinks into the skin. My skin felt dry and dull before and after, my skin looks glowing, luminous and hydrated. It gives a nice healthy look. The only negative is the price for a hydrating serum. Gifted by Dermalogica. nan
