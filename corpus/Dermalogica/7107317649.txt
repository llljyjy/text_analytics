This is one of the most gentle exfoliating facial cleansers I’ve ever used! It is a powder that you add a bit of water to in order to lather but it doesn’t feel abrasive at all. It gently exfoliates and leaves your face feeling soft and smooth. Highly recommend this one especially if you have sensitive skin! Awesome cleanser!
