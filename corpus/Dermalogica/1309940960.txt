I was gifted by Dermalogica-Sephora their new retinol product. I absolutely love using retinol and I have been on the search for a good one that gives me results. I have been only using this product for just shy of 2 weeks & I wanted to be able to give a fair review within that time frame. I have noticed my skin feels smooth and my fine lines aren’t as visible when I apply this product. I would love to see with continued use my results in at least a month. I am an avid retinol user that I am able to use every night.  Normally my skin is dry around this time of year, but I feel like it is kept hydrated and I didn’t feel that my skin felt dry at all. This is a must-have in my skincare routine. You need this product!
