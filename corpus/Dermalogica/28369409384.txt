I like the size of the bottle because it fits well in my travel bag and gym bag. So far so good I have used it for 2 weeks and I like the texture and the way it sinks into my skin.  After this bottle is up I would totally re-buy this. They make good products and work well for my skin.  Itâ€™s got good hydration properties and I like how supple it made my skin.  Please note that this serum is gifted by Dermalogica for my review and my opinion is of my own. Great serum !
