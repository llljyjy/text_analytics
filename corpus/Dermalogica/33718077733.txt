I LOVE this serum! I’m not always a fan of Vitamin C serums as they can be sticky to me. This one is not. I love the glass bottle and dropper for easy dispense and keeping it fresh. It has a slight orange scent that does go away upon applying. It’s a dryer formula, but again I like that to not be too stick. It takes a few moments to completely sink into the skin but not too terribly long. The magic is how bright and liniment your skin looks upon wearing it! I tend to have red hue to my skin and this take care of it instantly. And no bad reaction on my skin when I wear it. It’s a fabulous serum! Amazing Vit C Serum!
