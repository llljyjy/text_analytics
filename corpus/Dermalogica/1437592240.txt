I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. I really enjoy this. I have sensitive, acne-prone skin and even though this is a physical exfoliator, it is gentle enough to use on my acne. My skin definitely felt smoother after using it and it feels gentle enough to use daily. Very gentle for acne-prone skin
