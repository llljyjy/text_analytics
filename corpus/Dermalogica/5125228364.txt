This was complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. I tried this product and I really like how it’s assembled. The packets are ideal for travelling. Each one is measured with enough powder and I simply added a little water, mixed with my finger and applied to my face. While the product feels gritty, it didn’t feel abrasive. After one minute of circular motions, I rinsed my face. My face feels noticeably softer and smoother. Works Well
