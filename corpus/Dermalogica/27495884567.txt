gifted by dermalogica but my honest opinion. when i first tried this i thought i could only use it for 2 times a week because i suffer from dry skin an i thought i didn’t need to exfoliate.we’ll i tried the 7 day challenge and used it daily to see if it was gentle enough. during those 7 days i suffered no reaction and my skin felt softer i used the exfoliate. using it daily for seven days I can say that my skin definitely looks brighter and smoother. i definitely recommend if you want a gentle exfoliate for your face. really good gentle exfoliator
