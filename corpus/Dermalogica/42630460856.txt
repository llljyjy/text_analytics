I love this face wash because my face always feels super clean after I use it. It has glycolic acid so it smooths skin and helps prevent breakouts on my skin.  It rinses clean and doesnâ€™t irritate my skin at all.   The texture has a lot of slip so it spreads easily on my face. Smooth and clear skin
