I received a sample of this product complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling  in exchange for my honest review. I thought it was interesting that it comes in powder form, but it was easy to create a paste when mixed with water in my hands. I did find the physical exfoliant to be a little grittier and harsh than I like, but I did feel like it helped improve my skin texture. Although I like the results, I donâ€™t think I would use this everyday. A Little Rough on Skin, But Does Exfoliate Well
