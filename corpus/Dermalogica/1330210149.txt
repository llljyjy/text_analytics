Honestly, I’ve used better sleeping masks. The cream was very rich and thick, I didn’t mind the smell, I don’t know how to describe it. It did feel like it absorbed well in the morning and it did leave my skin soft and made my other skincare products also absorb better. However, I just used other brands that I felt worked better, that’s all. but they were just as or more expensive. I’m indifferent. This was complimentary from Dermalogica for an honest review. Works, but not my favorite
