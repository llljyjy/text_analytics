I went through two bottles of this and saw no difference. I have rosacea, and it didn’t help at all. I have dry skin, and it didn’t help with that any more than my usual moisturizer, which I used in addition to this. I used it twice a day, 1-2 pumps each time, and a bottle didn’t even last a month.It’s not bad, but I got better results from products that cost less than half the price of this for twice as much actual product. Definitely not worth $135. Not terrible, but definitely not worth the price.
