I was gifted by Dermalogica their new Awaken Peptide Depuffing Eye Gel and I am already in love! I am the biggest Dermalogica addict and having been using their Stress Positive Eye Lift for a year but this new eye gel is definitely going to be my new go-to eye product! I love how this eye gel has caffeine as a main ingredient because after applying it you can visibly see the puffiness and swelling go down within 10-20 minutes! It does a great job at firming the under eyes which makes makeup applying seamlessly on top! Highly recommend! nan
