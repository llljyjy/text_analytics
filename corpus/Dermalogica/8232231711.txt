Tried out a powered exfoliant for the first time and I really liked it! Itâ€™s very easy to use as you just need to add water until it becomes a paste and rub it into your skin (in circular motions) Once you rinse it off, your skin will instantly feel refreshed! It is very gentle on the skin and I found that it soothes any irritation I would have after use.  (complimentary from Dermalogica to use and give my honest feedback.) Soothing and Refreshing
