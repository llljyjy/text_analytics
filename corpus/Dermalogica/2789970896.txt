I received the Daily Microfoliant complimentary from sephora. I didn’t know exactly what to expect as this is a powder form exfoliator. I admit, I was intimidated but in the end, it was so asy to use. I immediately noticed my skin felt softer and somewhat smoother so I’ll say this lightly exfoliated my skin without making it red and irritated. Actually works!
