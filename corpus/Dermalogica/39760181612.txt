I am fairly new to adding Retinols in my skincare routine, and this one is very gentle yet effective  I immediately noticed a difference in my fine lines  and it also helped lighten some of my acne scarring as well. Itâ€™s definitely not a product I need to use every single day and a little really goes a long way. I also really like that the texture is very lightweight and  it contains Squalene in it as well so you really get the best of both worlds with this one !! Complimentary from Dermalogica - Sephora nan
