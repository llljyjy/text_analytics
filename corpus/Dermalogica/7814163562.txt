I have been having hormonal breakouts and luckily I was gifted by Dermalogica and decided to try this out and I LOVE it! For an exfoliant, it is gentle and thick and a little goes a long way. Does a great job exfoliating my sensitive skin! Even though it is a travel size, a little definitely goes a long way. You only need a little and it lathers you very nicely. Highly recommend! Best exfoliant
