I received this Circular Hydration Serum as part of the #giftedbydermalogica program in exchange for my honest review.Lately my skin has been so dry due to the cold winter weather so itâ€™s super annoying and unpleasant, then I started using the circular hydration serum and the results have me blown away! My skin now feels so hydrated and soft! The texture of the serum is silky and feels light weight and comfortable on the skin leaving it looking bright and radiant! If you struggle with dry skin like myself I highly recommend this serum Love this product!
