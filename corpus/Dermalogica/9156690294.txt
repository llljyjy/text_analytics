This is my go too for a mild exfoliate after being gifted by dermalogica sampling . It is the perfect one to use on a daily basis. Not too harsh and it adds a brightness to my skin. I really like how this lathers when applied on the skin, and as a bonus it removes all my makeup. It does have a rice flour like consistency so be careful about where you store it. I love that this product is clean, not all chemicals, and that it is something good for daily use with sensitive skin. This is it. My skin feels so clean and super soft after using it.
