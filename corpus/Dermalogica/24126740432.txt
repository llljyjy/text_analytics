I have heard really good things about Dermalogica but honestly never got anything from them until I realized I don’t really use a exfoliating scrub anymore. I used to use this to help tone my skin as I struggle with oily skin all summer long & when I see Dermalogica has a exfoliating scrub I decided to get it and I really love how it has my skin feeling afterward without drying my skin out too much. I definitely recommend this scrub for anyone looking for something that gets the job done and that’s pretty affordable especially if you won’t be using it everyday! #GiftedbyDermalogicaSampling New favorite skincare product
