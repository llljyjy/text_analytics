Gifted by Dermalogica! This was such a neat surprise, from the first time I used it I felt like my skin looked so much more radiant and alive, it was starting to look very dull. Now I feel a boost of confidence as I feel like my skin looks rejuvenated. I think this will stay as a staple in my nighttime routine; it is also a really fun texture to work with and apply to your face. I follow with a good moisturizer and eye cream. Love this Exfoliant
