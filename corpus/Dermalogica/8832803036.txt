I received this a 7 packet trial was gifted  by Dermalogica Sampling -I was super excited as I have heard amazing things about this brand. Little bit of back knowledge - I have extremely dry, sensitive skin. I am always looking got exfoliation that will help with the dullness that dry skin can cause. and this definitely did the trick! After the first wash I could honestly see improvement in smoothness and brightness. However, with my skin being so sensitive. I could feel areas of the skin where the abrasion was too rough when I put on my moisturizer there was a bit of discomfort. This is not something that I could use everyday, as it is intended, However I could absolutely use it once a week!also the process of turning the powder into paste is something to get used to, but its pretty straight forward. Just make sure the water is coming out of the faucet lightly so that you can control where the powder goes. Great for bringing in brightness!
