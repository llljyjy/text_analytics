“Kick-start skin’s hydration cycle: long-lasting serum immediately floods skin with hydration, replenishes from within, and helps prevent future hydration evaporation. Full-circle hydrating serum utilizes an enhanced form of Hyaluronic Acid to penetrate skin’s surface for deep hydration and more supple, radiant skin over time. An Algae Extract-infused moisturizing matrix delivers quick and long-lasting hydration. Polyglutamic Acid from fermented Soy replenishes skin’s hydration reserves from within. Plant-derived sugars and a blend of amino acids similar to those naturally present in the skin trap water on skin’s surface to help prevent future hydration evaporation. A postbiotic blend of Lactobacillus Ferment and Avena Extract helps to balance skin’s microbiome.”performance | full star | wowowowow! This serum truly does all that! As a dry, sensitive, acne prone girl, an effective hydrating serum is a must. This will def be going in the top five list!texture | full star | literal perfection. Not watery, sticky nor foamy. Soaks right in to the skin, leaving it GLOWING, but not greasy or heavy nor like it’s filled with silicones scent | full star | scent isn’t super present. There are essential oils, but none have been irritating. No added synthetic fragrance!!packaging | .95 star | the bottle looks like it would be plastic, but it’s glass! Love the added pop of blue to this one lol. Only complaint is the bottle wasn’t full when I received it, almost an inch of empty space without the dropper in it. ingredients | .9 star | absolutely love the use of “post”biotics, rather than pre/probiotics! Shows they actually understand what’s beneficial topically, rather than just throwing buzz words! there are a few ingredients rated 3-5 on ewg scale, but also a TON rated a 1. Overall “clean” formulavalue | .6 star | $59 is on the pricier side for a hydrating serum, but it works amazing. So if you got the coin, this serum is lit!Total 5.45 out of 6 stars Literally yes!
