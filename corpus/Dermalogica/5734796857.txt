The subtitle, ’high-dose wrinkle serum’ got me a little worried about a retinol serum. But after the first application, I felt much better because its creamy texture feels like a non-greasy cream. I really liked how it applied as well as the after-feel of it. I would prefer using it overnight although it can be worn under SPF during the day. I received it complimentary from Dermalogica for review. Very nice texture
