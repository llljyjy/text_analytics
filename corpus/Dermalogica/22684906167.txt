I first experienced this pre-cleanse while getting a facial and literally asked the aesthetician what it was that she was using, because it felt amazing on my skin and also smelled so, so good. Recently I decided to snag the mini online to try again and omg. Just as I remembered! This smells so citrusy and I’m all about citrus scents, but more importantly it goes on my skin so gently and really gets everything off of my skin and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and clean and ready for my cleanser! I just started double cleansing and I’m a huge fan! I just purchased the full size today! I am obsessed with this pre-cleanser!
