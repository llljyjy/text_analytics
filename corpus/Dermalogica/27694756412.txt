I really enjoyed using this Dermalogica Dynamic Skin Recovery SPF 50. It works amazingly well for my combination skin. The sunscreen provides a nice layer of protection for my skin.  it blends so well on the skin and leaves a nice and even coverage with no white cast finish. This is a big plug for me on top of the full board spectrum of SPF 50.  The only thing that I don’t like about it is that it leaves my skin feeling a bit greasy.This sunscreen helps to protect the skin from my daily outdoor activities. It’s one of the product that I really want to put on my mature skin when i’m out and about because it not only provide optimal protection from sun exposure, but it also helps keep my skin hydrated throughout the day. Overall it is a nice sunscreen that doesn’t feel heavy on the skin. It Works Nice
