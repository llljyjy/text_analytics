I love how hydrating this dynamic skin recovery SPF50 is. I have been looking for a good everyday SPF to apply to my face before leaving the house, and this product is exactly what I’ve been looking for! It has a really gentle floral scent and the texture isn’t too thick or heavy which is nice. It also blends into the skin nicely. Perfect Everyday Moisturizer with SPF!
