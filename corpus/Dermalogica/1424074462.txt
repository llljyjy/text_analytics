Dermalogica really has some excellent formulations so I’m not surprised how much I’m enjoying the circular hydration serum.  I have dry skin and love getting the instant hydration and plumping to my skin... and that it’s lasting hydration is even better!  This isn’t a simple Hyaluronic serum.. it has lactic acid which hydrates and helps with cell turnover and polyglutamic acid which I love.. it’s really an enjoyable serum and has seamlessly become part of my everyday routine.  I use it before my moisturizer and spf.  It’s soothing and hydrating and I’m loving it.  I was gifted by Dermalogica - really think their products are thoughtful and smart for keeping my skin healthy and glowing! More than an HA serum.. lasting hydration!
