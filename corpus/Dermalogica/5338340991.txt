Gifted by Dermalogica. I love exfoliators but I have semi-sensitive skin so I have to be careful what kind I use. I’m so happy to say this product is super calming and didn’t aggravate my skin at all. After cleansing with this product and applying the rest of my routine, my skin feels so clean and smooth!! My skin also looks like I have a natural glow. The smell is a teeny tiny bit off putting but not overwhelming and doesn’t linger. Calming & refreshing
