I was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. I was delightfully surprised by the Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant Exfoliator product. Usually not a fan of the texture of most ’exfoliators’ because they tend to be too gritty or harsh on my skin. However the Dermalogica brand lets you adjust how much water is added which helps control texture.  I’ve noticed my face is looking a lot brighter and more even. nan
