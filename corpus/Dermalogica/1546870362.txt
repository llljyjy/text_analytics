This sun protection goes beyond protecting the skin from UV rays. This sun protection has a very high protection factor, which I absolutely love! I feel very well protected throughout the day and it helps prevent - dark spots, wrinkles , and other signs of aging. The packaging is awesome with the pump, which helps keep your product clean and helps dispense the product really well. You only need about two pumps to cover the whole face and neck. It’s a beautiful formula that blends into the skin easily and quickly without leaving behind a white cast. It doesn’t feel heavy or greasy, which makes it a great base for your makeup. I love the addition of the anti-aging skincare because it helps keep my skin looking firm, smooth, and youthful! I love that it isn’t just a sunscreen but also an anti-aging cream! I highly recommend this formula! Beyond Sun Protection
