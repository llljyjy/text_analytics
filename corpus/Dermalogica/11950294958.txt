I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica in exchange for me honest review, so here it is - I have always had major dark circles (itâ€™s genetic for me unfortunately), however started getting puffiness under my eye area over the past few years. Although this eye gel does not really do much for my dark circles, I makes an incredible difference with the puffiness - I feel like within a matter of 5-10 minutes the puffiness is entirely gone. I have dry/sensitive skin, and this formulation does not irritate the area around my eye whatsoever - I love that it is fragrance-free too! Works Incredibly Well At De-Puffing Under The Eye
