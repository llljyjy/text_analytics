Dermalogica gifted me their Biolumin-C Vitamin C Eye Serum. It is great for dark circles. The tube allows for just the small amount needed to come out. It is very hydrating, absorbs well, isnâ€™t greasy, and can be applied before makeup. This is lightweight, brightens up my eyes and makes my dark circles less noticeable. brightens dark circles
