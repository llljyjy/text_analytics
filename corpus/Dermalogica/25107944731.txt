Gifted by dermalogica. This eye gel is very cooling and sits nicely. It’s not too thick and sits well under makeup which is always my biggest concern. I have really dark undereyes and it does a great job at brightening instantly, it’s genetic so it won’t go away but it’s nice to see a slight change in tint for right now! Perfect for the AM routine!
