Does this work? Short and simple yes it does. I really enjoyed the scent of this as well. I’ve tried many hyaluronic acid serums and I understand dermalogica is a more luxury/spa brand but I feel like an effective HA serum should not cost this much. If you’ve got the extra money then you won’t have an issue using this product it works well. Be sure to immediately apply your favourite moisturizer right after serum. My go to for a long time now has been the skin smoothing cream. I am grateful dermalogica gave this product to me to try. #giftedbydermalogica #sephoracanada #dermalogicacanada nan
