I don’t like a lot of hyaluronic acid serums, but I LOVE this one. It’s not sticky at all, so it layers perfectly under other serums and my moisturizer. I apply an essence before the Dermalogica Circular Hydration System to get the most out of the hydration benefits. It makes my skin feel and look more hydrated and plump, plus I love how lightweight this serum is. It’ll be perfect in the hotter months, but I also love it now when it’s transitioning from winter to spring. I received this complimentary from Dermalogica, but I would repurchase with my own money once I’m out. nan
