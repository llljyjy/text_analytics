I would give 1000 stars if I could! Although this product is a little expensive, I absolutely 100% STAN this product. This product was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling, but Iâ€™ve used this product for years! It leaves your skin feeling baby soft and removes all the dead skin from your face! I have huge pores and oily skin, and this is my #1 product in my skin routine. However, be careful not to scrub too hard because you can burn your skin, and it will take forever to heal. This is a timeless product that I will forever use for the rest of my life. 1000 stars!
