Gifted by Dermalogica Sampling - This was my first time trying a physical exfoliant in a long time. A few things I enjoyed: not heavily scented, granules were very small (just like the name states), skin did felt smoother after first use. I also liked that it was a powder so I can control how thick or light the foamy paste ends up becoming. Will definitely add this into my routine 1-2x a week to help with brightening my skin. Granules are perfect size!
