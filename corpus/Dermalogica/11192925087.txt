Love this! I used to use their exfoliator one, the white/grey bottle. It was too harsh on my skin. This one is new, it’s perfect! My skin doesn’t feel dry and stretchy after. I use their pre cleanse oil first to remove my make up, so my hands are already wet. Then I pour some powder and mix together In between. Get a little more water, then rub on your face. Might need a little more water to dab on your face. good for sensitive skin
