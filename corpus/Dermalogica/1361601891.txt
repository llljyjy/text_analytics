I usually have a problem with puffy eyes. Specially when I don’t get a good night sleep. This cream gel works great on that! It’s lightweight and absorbs quick and can be used easily under makeup. I love how it diminishes the look of my fine lines around my eyes. Definitely recommend! I was gifted by Dermalogica and opinions are 100% my own! nan
