I recieved this Dermalogica’s New Circular Hydration seum  #giftedbydermalogica . I have been using this from last 2 weeks and I love this formula  . This serum creates a flow of hydration which immediately hydrates , delivers long lasting hydration and replenishes skin from within . I like to use this in the morning After I cleanse My face before moisturizer . It feels really nice and cool to my skin as I have very very dry skin . So that’s perfect fit for me . Loving This Formula
