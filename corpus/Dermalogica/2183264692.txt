First off - great for sensitive skin! I have tried a powder exfoliant like this before, so I was shocked when the product became smooth when adding water. I am seeing some differences in my skin after using it multiple times. The powder comes out easy and applies smoothly to the face once water is added. Let me reiterate, I was not expecting how smooth the application would be. It doesnâ€™t have a fragrance and washes off easily. Gifted by Dermalogica nan
