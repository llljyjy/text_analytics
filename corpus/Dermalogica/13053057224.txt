truly enjoy this powder exfoliating cleanser! It’s unlike anything I’ve used yet. The pack comes with a measured amount of power that you put into your cupped palm or a shallow dish and add water until the consistency is to your liking. I made mine a but on the thicker side so after I was done gently scrubbing my face, I was able to wear it as a mask for about 10 min before rinsing.  It is gentle enough for daily use and works amazing for me on my dry skin as it clears dead layers away revealing bright, fresh skin! Awesome!!
