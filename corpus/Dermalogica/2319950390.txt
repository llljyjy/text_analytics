I’ve tried many serums, and I LOVE this one! Dermalogica products work well for my skin because they never make me break out, and I’m glad I tried this serum because once again, it seems to work perfectly with my skin. I love how hydrated my skin feels without any stickiness. I use the serum after washing my face nightly and it feels nice and plump already after 2 weeks of using it! *This product was gifted by Dermalogica* nan
