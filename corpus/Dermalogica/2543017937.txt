At first, I didn’t really like this product. I could not get it to create the paste as I expected and I don’t like the way it smells.  However, I did do it while I was in the shower. I have never used a “powdered“ exfoliant so this was a new experience for me. After using this product at my bathroom sink ...the experience was a little better.  The product did  “paste up“ better but I still don’t like the smell. It does work well and seems to be pretty gentle.  I think I will try to add some cleaner to it as well to see how that works for me. I like it but not sure I would buy it.  This was a complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling  for review and there you have it! Just Ok
