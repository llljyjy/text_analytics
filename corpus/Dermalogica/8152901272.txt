Gifted by Dermalogica. I like how it leaves my face feeling clean.  It is satisfying how it foams up when you add water, but still exfoliates your skin.  My face feels softer after using it, but it may just be because it is exfoliating the dead skin. I do not think itâ€™s worth the price though. Ehh
