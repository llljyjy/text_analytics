I was given this product free for my honest review and I was  Pleasantly surprised by this face wash upon opening the container thereâ€™s a tiny hole in the top what you dumped the powder into your hand only a teaspoon amount is all you need out of a little water and lather your hands together to create a foam once you get that you wash your face there was no scent which I did enjoy it was quite easy use and it felt my skin afterwards it felt soft and not dried out I would definitely recommend using this daily morning and night in your skin care routine @dermalogicacanada @sephoracanada #giftedbydermalogica Pleasantly surprised
