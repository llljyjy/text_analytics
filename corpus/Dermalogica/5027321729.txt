I honestly look forward to putting this on every night and am scared for the day I run out because it’s so expensive - but definitely worth it! I’m picky about moisturizers and extra picky about anything that claims rich repair because my skin is extremely dry from accutane in my teens and regular tret use. This is gold. Make a jumbo size!! perfect for tret users and super dry/flaky skin
