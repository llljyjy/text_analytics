This is simply the best face wash I’ve ever used. It effectively removes dirt and grime (and zinc oxide sunscreen!) without stripping the skin’s natural oils. It is perfect for sensitive skin. If I had to compare this product to other brands, I would say it is less harsh than Fresh’s Soy Face Cleanser. It is also similar to Cetaphil’s Hydrating Cleanser, albeit slightly less moisturizing but also less likely to cause breakouts (Cetaphil’s cleanser always leaves me with whiteheads, and I think it’s because the cleanser leaves a film on my skin).Anyway, this is a great product overall - I highly recommend it. I’m happy to see that it has become increasingly popular with the Sephora crowd, because realistically, everyone can benefit from a gentle face wash. I think many of us have overdone it with the harsh cleansers, exfoliants, etc. and need to be kinder to our skin. Perfect for Sensitive Skin
