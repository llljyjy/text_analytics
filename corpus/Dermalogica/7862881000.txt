When it comes to cleansers I prefer something gentle, less is more with my skin. I really like how this one works for me. I love that it’s a gel, it applies really nicely. I also love that it’s not scented heavy but does have a fresh clean spa smell to it. This leaves my skin very smooth and clean feeling! nan
