I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica in exchange for my review. This serum has a creamy texture and absorbs quickly into my skin without feeling sticky. It’s gentle on my skin and doesn’t cause any irritation. It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. I will need more time to see better results, but so far, so good. So far, so good
