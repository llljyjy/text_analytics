I love the lightweight feel of this SPF.  It sinks in right away and creates a really pretty luminosity on my skin that is really hard to capture in a photo, but I’ll try ;) after application I don’t smell like sunscreen and that may be the best part! (See before and after pic) No sunscreen smell, invisible, sinks in quick
