I am new to double cleansing. But this precleansing oil felt pretty thick and greasy and the scent was like a strong Lysol lemon scent. It didn’t remove all my mascara and I had to follow up with a cleaner to get all the greasy precleansing oil out of my skin. Also, after using toner there was still always makeup on the pad. It’s not for me and might’ve ruined the continuation of precleansing in my routine . never precleansing in my routine again.
