I’ve been using this product in my morning routine for the past 3 weeks. After about 1.5 weeks there was a noticeable change in my face. My skin is glowing, it looks and feels smooth. I’ve had long term problem with blackheads and for the first time finally I’ve found something that’s working against them. It’s very gentle but cleanses my skin so well without leaving tightness. The fine powder turns to a pleasant creamy texture as it is worked into the skin. Best Exfoliant.
