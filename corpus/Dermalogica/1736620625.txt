I LOVE daily microfoliant and I have been using it for years. I only use it twice a week and I find thatâ€™s a sufficient exfoliation routine for me. But what i love the most about this is this packaging - AMAZING! I wish more brands would do this with their products (looking at you First Aid Beauty). I would also love if Sephora as a company encouraged this and shipped items with less packaging. Finding this refill made my day. Kudos to dermalogica! :) Thank you for green packaging!!! <3
