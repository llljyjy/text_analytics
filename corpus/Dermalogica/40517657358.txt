I was given some free samples of the microfoliant and at the beginning I was scared to use it because I have a very sensitive skin but I loved it! is so soft, is not harsh on your face, it smells so good and natural and it’s given me a glow since I’m using it, I’ve used 5 samples already and I want the hole bottle! Thank you dermalogica Sensitive skin? Don’t worry girl!
