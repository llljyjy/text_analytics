I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been looking for a new gentle exfoliant because my skin has been a little sensitive lately. I love that this one also supports your skins moisture barrier.  This product goes from powder to a very creamy texture with a little water. It doesn’t feel harsh on my skin or leave me with a feeling that I’ve over scrubbed my face. There was no irritation and it left my skin very smooth. I didn’t care for the scent very much but it’s subtle and expected since it’s not made with artificial dyes or fragrances. I’m definitely keeping this product in my skincare routine. Gentle and creamy
