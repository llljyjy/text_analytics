This product was gifted by Dermalogica, and I have only had the opportunity to use this product a couple times but so far I like it.. in theory. I like the level of exfoliation I feel that I get, and it seems that my skin is taking it well, but I have to say that I am not a fan of the powder to paste formulation at all. I feel like I get inconsistent product textures and applications because I can’t be precise each time. I’m sure there is a reason for it being packaged as a powder, but I’m not likely to buy it because of it. Does a good job, but takes a lot of work
