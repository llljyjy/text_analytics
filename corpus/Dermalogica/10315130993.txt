I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica for review. This is an incredibly hydrating, light-weight serum that I’ve found works really well as a daily hydrating step. It’s formulated with tons of skin-beneficial ingredients that I love in my products. I usually will layer this under a thicker moisturizer to get the most out of each product! nan
