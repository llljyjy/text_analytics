This serum was gifted by Dermalogica for testing and reviewing purposes! Itâ€™s definitely amazing, I have a very dry skin and I love Hyaluronic acid serums, this serum makes my skin hydrated and plump, no feeling tacky, light weight formula, absorbs quickly easy to use and smells amazing! I can see my fine line are hydrated and less visible, makeup looks great after adding it to my skincare routine, preferably apply it over damp skin to lock moisture! My skin feels hydrated the whole day! Highly recommended and worth trying Hydrating and feels amazing
