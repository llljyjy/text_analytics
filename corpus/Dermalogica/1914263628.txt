This exfoliant made my skin feel smoother after just one use. It’s a fine powder that you mix with water in your hand, at which point it turns into a creamy paste. A little bit of grit does remain, so it works as a physical exfoliant with cellulose and rice bran doing the polishing. It’s indicated for daily use, but I use it every two or three days and it still feels effective. I received a sample gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. Gentle yet effective exfoliant
