Arrived sealed in the original Dermalogica packaging. It’s a really great exfoliant especially if your skin is sensitive or if you suffer with rosacea. I found there was very little redness and no burning or tingling feeling afterwards. I use this as part of my morning facial routine after I double cleanse, and because it’s so gentle, it can be used everyday. I love the smell of this stuff and how soft and milky this feels on my skin when more water is added. My skin is looking brighter and feels smoother. I find other exfoliants far too harsh and damaging for my skin, so I’m okay with spending a little more money than I usually would - especially if it means I have found a product that works really well for me. Really good exfoliant
