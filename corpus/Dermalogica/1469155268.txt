I received this product from Dermalogica and have been using it as part of my nightly routine. I apply it after cleansing and before my moisturizer and I can honestly say that when I wake up in the morning, my skin feels so hydrated and cleared up! It gives you that moisturized/glowly feeling when applying it and it doesnâ€™t feel oily or heavy on the skin. I do wash my face and in the morning and it feels a lot smoother after using it! I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for a hydrating nightly serum! @dermalogicacanada, @sephoracanada, #giftedbydermalogica Love this serum!
