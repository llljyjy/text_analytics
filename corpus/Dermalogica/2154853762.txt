I love this Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant!It is easy to use by activating the powder with a little water to create a foaming paste. It uses very little product.  Then massage into skin in circular motions for one minute. Then rinse off. My face feels absolutely amazing! It is so silky smooth and very soft.  It is a great gentle exfoliator.  My skin looks brighter and feels so polished.  This is an amazing and effective product that I highly recommend.  Made predominantly of rice extract, papaya enzymes, salicylic acid, and colloidal oatmeal. I was gifted this product by Dermalogica sampling. Silky smooth polished skin
