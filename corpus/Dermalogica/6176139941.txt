This is a great physical exfoliant! It’s very gentle and does not dry out my skin. I’ve been using this a couple times a week which has been just enough for my sensitive skin.  It’s a powder that you mix with water to lather into a foam then work the product into the skin to exfoliate. I really can notice a difference after using this, my skin looks more glowy and feels so soft . Great physical exfoliant
