I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica in exchange for my honest review.I am a fan of Dermalogica products, especially their vitamin C line. I was delighted to get to try their retinol serum which is an ingredient I use in my evening routine. I have some dark spots and fine lines on my face. This retinol serum seems to help make my skin a bit smoother in appearance. I like the packaging, the pump packaging is usually better to keep the product from getting bad / contaminated. It doesn’t have much scent. The texture is fairly lightweight and absorbs nicely in my skin. So far I don’t have any irritation of using it every night. nan
