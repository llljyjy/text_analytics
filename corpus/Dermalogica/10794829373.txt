Best facial exfoliator out there!! I will think that my face is as smooth as it can be but then i’ll use some of this and i’m stunned. It gives you the smoothest, softest skin without irritating it. I also love that you can control the density/power by adding more or less water. You don’t need to clear skin to use this either, a lot of exfoliators tend to irritate acne but as long as the acne isn’t too severe you can still use this. Worth every penny but I would recommend getting the travel size one first because it will still last you a while ( that being said i don’t think you should use it everyday 2 times a week a most) go get it!!
