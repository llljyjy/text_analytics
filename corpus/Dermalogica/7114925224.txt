I love dermalogica products, and maybe this moisturizer has benefits to your skin but unfortunately I would never know because I can’t stand the smell! I don’t know why everyone is ok with the smell but it’s terrible!! It’s like I put peat on my face or something. So I’d rather stay with my favorite dermalogica calming moisturizer, which doesn’t have any smell at all and I believe it should be like that. nan
