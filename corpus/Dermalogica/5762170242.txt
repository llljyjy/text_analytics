Was always hesitant to try a retinol just because my skin tends to be very sensitive but really wanted the benefits of a retinol and this product did just that for me! I have not been able to tell a huge difference yet because I have only used it for two weeks, but it has not caused my skin to act up at all and does not dry out my skin at all. I have been slowly increasing my usage of the product just in case. It doesnâ€™t really have a scent which I appreciate and overall just feels great on my skin! Looking forward to seeing what it does for my skin :) This product was gifted by Dermalogica, but all opinions are my own. nan
