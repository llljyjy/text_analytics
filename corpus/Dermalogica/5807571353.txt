I have dry sensitive skin and I try to avoid exfoliants as they tend to irritate my skin. So I was hesitant about this new Dermalogica Daily MilkfoliantExfoliator, but it blew my socks off. This is just perfect! The texture is so gentle that I didn’t notice any irritationat all!The productwas designed to help with redness, dullness, anduneven texture. And it gets the job done. I’ve been using it daily for the last couple of weeks and my skin looks amazing. No more dry patches, no more clogged pores and my skin is so glowy! Love it!
