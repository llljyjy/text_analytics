I have been using this retinol serum from Dermalogica for 2 weeks now. I am a big fan of their products, so I was so happy to use it. The texture is nice and light and it absorbs nicely. My skin looks and feels smoother since I have been using it. It doesnâ€™t irritate my skin like some other retinol products. I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica. Great retinol serum!
