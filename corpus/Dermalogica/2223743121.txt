Such an awesome mask!! I love using it in the morning. It’s very gentle and lightweight, it makes my skin look more “alive”, plump and radiant. I love that it contains my two favorite ingredients: Vitamin C (for brightening) and oat (moisturizing and calming). I like to use this mask before applying my makeup, I don’t have to use that much foundation because my skin is more even toned and not as red. Brightening and moisturizing
