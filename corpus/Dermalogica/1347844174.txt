I love how silky this serum feels on my skin. I am actually enjoying this . I find we definitely need the extra hydration on our skin. Especially with the change of season which now here we are in spring. But I have to tell you it doesnâ€™t feel yet like it. This is why I think this serum came in perfect timing for me. As for winter months my skin skin tends to have dry patches. I use this day and night which is no problem at all. I can even feel my skin more softer and smoother. For me I use to two drops which is great because with little it goes a long way. I have been using this serum for about a month and I definitely see the beautiful results on my skin.  It does absorb very nicely and it has a light fresh scent to it.  It works for all skin types. I definitely recommend this serum.
