I’m very huge on sunscreen and I’ve tried the majority on the market. It has a lightweight feeling which I’m a fan of as I usually wear my sunscreen under heavy make up and most can cause a pilling effect which I don’t like (and I don’t get that with this!). It doesnt have that typical strong sunscreen smell either. It smells like your typical dermalogica Love!
