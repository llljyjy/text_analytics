This mask is legit! I bought it on a whim after putting a bit on my hand in the store & noticing how soft it made my skin. I am so glad I took the risk because this mask has been amazing for my dehydrated skin! It’s honestly like Botox for my forehead since it plumps up my dehydration lines. It’s made the condition of my skin better- definitely less thirsty, overall more glowy. It does smell funky but it’s well worth it to me. If you’re really sensitive to scents, you may want to skip this one, or at least try it in the store first. This is my first dermalogica product & I’m really impressed! So moisturizing!
