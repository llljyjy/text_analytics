Please note that I was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling in exchange for my honest review! I absolutely loved this microexoliant— I’ve frequently experienced defoliators which are either too harsh on the skin, or too gentle to get rid of dead skin. This is a lightweight, exfoliant which helps clear and brighten without causing excessive redness or any “tingling” feeling. My skin looked noticeably more clear and my makeup looked more skin-like! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. Loved this exfoliator!
