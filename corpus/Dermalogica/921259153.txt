I have a sunscreen obsession and know the importance of sun protection. I have dry and mature skin am always looking for sunscreen that can also moisturize my skin. It had a lightweight texture, had a light fresh scent, and blended nicely onto my skin. After waiting 15 minutes to absorb as directed, it left my skin hydrated and gave me smoother-looking skin. My face did not have a sticky or heavy residue. Overall, I enjoyed how moisturizing it was, loved that it had SPF 50 protection, and left no white cast. Great moisturizer with sun protection
