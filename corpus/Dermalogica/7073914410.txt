This product, like other reviews stated, caused me to have a reaction on my chin. It’s moisturizing, but the next day I’m itching and dealing with hive-like breakouts on my chin. I only continued the use after the first time to make sure this moisturizer was the cause, and it is. I use the pre-cleanse and special gel cleanser with no issue, but this is a no for me. I’m not sure if I’m allergic to an ingredient, or if it’s just not suitable for my skin type, which I’d say is more sensitive and acne-prone. nan
