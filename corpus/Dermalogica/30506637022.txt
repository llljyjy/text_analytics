I’m super impressed by this retinol! I like that it has three different retinols and a booster! I’ve never heard of that before? One is time released and one is fast acting. Im excited to continue to use this and see how my skin improves! It also has squalene and beta-glucan— two ingredients that I love!! Both are great for hydrating and replenishing the skin. It’s very lightweight and doesn’t leave the skin feeling dry or irritated. Definitely a yes for me! Gifted by dermalogica - Sephora Must try!
