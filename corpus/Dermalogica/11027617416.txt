my skin before was dull and not feeling very hydrated after using the dermalogica drops my skin still didn’t get the hydrating feel to it it just felt sticky on my skin and not very hydrating it might be a better product for someone else but for me it wasn’t it, this was complimentary from Dermalogica It was okay
