If you want to save a little money they do have a refill one which is 54 dollars it will just be in a plastic bag instead of container. Scent: When opening the product it”s hard to pinpoint what it”s, but to me the thing I only get is maybe the salicylic acid.Product/Texture: when putting the exfoliate on my hand at first it felt as soft dust. For this one you have to mix it with water to make it into a paste. I had to extra gentle opening the package because it I didn’t i knew the dust will go everywhere. Results: when I was down washing my face it did make my skin feel soft and I can see a little bit of dry skin flaking off but it didn’t give me no irritation. For me this exfoliate is gentle and didn’t make my skin hurt. This is the second product I got from them to review and so far both worked amazing on my skin. Ps: The product was free in your review and was gifted by Dermalogica sampling Made my skin soft
