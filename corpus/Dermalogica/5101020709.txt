This has a really nice gel texture but it’s not too thin or sticky. It says on my under eyes really well and I’ve noticed a difference in brightening and de-puffiness already! The bottle is going to last a long time so it makes the price well worth it! I was gifted by Dermalogica to try this and I’m so glad- will be a new favorite of mine! Great eye gel
