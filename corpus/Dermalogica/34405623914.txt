Dermalogica is one of my favorite brands so I was really excited to try this moisturizer especially with it having spf 50. I like that it absorbs nicely without leaving a white cast. My skin did not break out from it like with other products with spf and my face looks and feel hydrated without appearing oily. I definitely recommend. Another amazing product by them. nan
