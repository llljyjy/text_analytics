I’m in my late 20’s and my face shows the unfortunate battle I lost with acne as a teen & beyond. Large pores, still quite oily, basically very un-smooth. I saw all the great reviews of this product so I decided to try. I’ve used other products with granules in it meant to exfoliate the skin, but I was never happy with them and stopped using them after a few weeks. This one is different. Very easy to use, leaving unbelievably smooth, moisturized skin when I was finished. If you’re on the fence, go ahead and get it. Great stuff! nan
