I love adding a retinol in my skincare routine. This one works quickly and beautifully. Iâ€™m postpartum and my skin always goes a little haywire after having a baby, but this retinol has helped clear my skin up and keep it clear! I have very oily skin and I feel like this helps keep it not so congested and fresh feeling! lovely retinol!
