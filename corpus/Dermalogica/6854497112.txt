I’m very lazy when it comes to exfoliating my face. I usually don’t like physical exfoliators, but I appreciate that this is a blend of both physical and chemical exfoliating properties. The physical aspect is a rice-based powder that’s super gentle. I noticed right away that my skin was smooth and glowy after just one use - my pores were minimized, and my skin absorbed serums readily after. Even my makeup application was smoother after I used this, which I wasn’t expect. Be sure you use enough water to make it into a paste to avoid irritation. Gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. Love it!
