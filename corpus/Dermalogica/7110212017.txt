I received a trial set of these daily microfoliates  from Dermalogica Sampling. Admittedly, I was a bit hesitant to try a daily exfoliator, thinking it may be too harsh or drying. Fortunately I was wrong; I love this stuff! Iâ€™ve already ordered a small bottle; a little powder goes a long way! The micro beads are soft yet effective. My skin looks a lot smoother and healthier after using daily for two weeks. Highly recommend! nan
