If you have sensitive skin but feel like you need to exfoliate this is the one for you! I’m a Master Esthetician & got a chance to try this and purchase it before it’s released and I am IN LOVE. I love Daily Microfoliant & Daily Superfoliant both for myself and my clients but this is a million times better! it’s so soft and creamy when mixed with water, and it makes your skin so smooth and baby soft, it even took away some of my redness. As someone with rosacea I can’t exfoliate too often but I have used this the last 3 days in a row with absolutely no irritation. That being said you really only need to use this 2-3 times a week because the exfoliation is that good. I cannot recommend this more highly. it also pairs really well with Circular Hydration Serum! Definitely going to be my go to from now on!! nan
