This is my second time buying a full sized bottle . I wanted to make sure I was using it correctly . This exfoliation is too much for daily use , especially if you use toners and serums that will irritate the skin if coupled with it. I like to use it maybe once or twice a week now . The best thing about it is it makes your skin feel squeaky clean like a clay mask . nan
