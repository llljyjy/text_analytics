I have the biolumin eye serum and loved that so I was looking forward to trying out the face serum as well. The textures are similar, very light and mild and pleasant. The scent is more citrusy which is less interesting to me when compared to the eye serum. I wish it smelled more like the eye serum.. Works well and beautifully, vit c is forever a holy grail ingredient and having additional AHA is super welcomed. It unfortunately also has xanthan gum which I realized after months of using the eye serum that it does give me tiny breakouts as with all fermented ingredients, so now I only test them for a couple weeks before switching off from my face. Still overall a fantastic product! nan
