Complimentary from Dermologica sampling.  I have used this daily microfoliant before so I already knew that I liked it, but it had been awhile that I had used it.  Getting to try this again it’s a great daily exfoliant that doesn’t irritate or bother my skin.  I like using this in the shower, because it’s a powder and you add water to make a paste before applying to the face.  It’s a gentle microfoliant that keeps my skin feeling smooth. Love it!
