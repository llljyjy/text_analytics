I’ve been loving this peptide eye cream. My undereye area feels dry and is showing some fine lines. After using this cream, the skin feels soft and looks smoother and my fine lines have been slowly improving. I feel like the skin is left fragile now after using over a week. Highly recommend this peptide cream for over 30 something’s! Complimentary from Dermatologica Must have peptide eye cream!
