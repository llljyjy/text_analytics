Dermalogica kindly gifted me this product for my honest review. I’ve been using for a few weeks now and i have to say im pretty happy with my results! The skin around my eyes feel so nice, hydrated, they’re also noticeably brighter and overall look more awake! I love the fact that this serum doesn’t cause any irritation what so ever, as it is hard for me to find products for the eye area that don’t cause issues but with this eye serum I’ve had no issues with irritation at all which im very happy about! The texture is very nice and it has a lightweight consistency that absorbs right into the skin! nan
