This is such a good moisturizer. I loveeee it. I especially love the texture of it. A lot of times moisturizers with high spf feel really greasy or hard to blend in but this is the opposite. It leaves no white cast and absorbs to easily into your skin! It leaves my skin so soft and hydrated all day long while also proving ample spf! Love. Loveee the texture!
