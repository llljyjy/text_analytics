So far I’ve used this product and it leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft. I apply this product in the evening as instructed. It’s only been a week but my skin feels smooth and I feel like it evens out my skin tone. It’s very light, not greasy and it’s easy to apply. Thank god there has been no irritation on my face. so far, so good! Gifted by Dermalogica - sephora. nan
