Really enjoyed using this powder cleanser! First off, I love that it’s a powder. Makes it so convenient for traveling! I also found that it was a good level of exfoliation. It wasn’t harsh or rough on my skin, but it still felt like I got the benefits of exfoliating. Definitely a cleanser I would buy again! I received this complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling So Gentle, Yet Effective!
