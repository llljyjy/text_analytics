Such a great product! I fell in love from the very first use! The texture surprised me; it is such a soft and fine powder, that gets creamy when wet, and gently exfoliates without feeling harsh. My skin usually looks a little red after exfoliating, but not with this one. It leaves my skin feeling smooth, soft, and nourished! I will definitely keep this one in my skincare regimen! A must have!
