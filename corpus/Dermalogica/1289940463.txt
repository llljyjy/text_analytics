I’ve used this and I love how my skin feels after. The powder formula is unique and unlike any product I’ve tried before. I do genuinely enjoy this product HOWEVER if water gets into the bottle, the product is basically useless. When water gets trough the top, the product binds and it doesn’t come out. This happened to two of the bottles I purchased, and make it unusable after. This is unfortunate because the product itself is so expensive. You can buy the refills, but you waste money if this happens. nan
