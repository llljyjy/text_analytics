I love so many products from Dermalogica and had to give this awaken peptide eye gel a try which was gifted by Dermalogica. I love how it’s clear and a little goes a long way with this one. I don’t have puffy eyes but it does help plump up my eye area and keep it well hydrated even with makeup on. It also has caffeine and active peptides which is exactly what I look for in an eye cream. nan
