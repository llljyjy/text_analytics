This product is awesome, i was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling, I have rosacea and it’s not to harsh on my skin it also doesn’t flare cause flare ups which is a thing that most micro exfoliant does to my sensitive skin. Isn’t to abrasive on the face and really helps maintain skin texture soft Great for sensitive skin
