I was gifted seven packets of this product complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. I love this microexfoliant product! I have a bottle that I purchased prior to being gifted these packets also. It’s such a unique and effective way to exfoliate. This is a dry, powdery cleanser that I add to wet hands. It makes a paste that I lightly buff into my skin. It’s gentle and rinses off easily. I haven’t experienced any redness or irritation. I find it leaves my skin bright and clean. Gentle and effective
