My main skin struggle is that I tend to have discoloration and uneven skin tone. This is something that I’ve struggled with time and time again. So, I decided to give the Dermalogica Microfoliant which was complimentary from Dermalogica sampling a try. I’ve only used it for a couple of days but I have to say, I do see a little bit of improvement in that my skin is brighter. nan
