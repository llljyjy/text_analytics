This product is a powder exfoliant that gets mixed with water. This was admittedly difficult for me to get the consistency correct the first couple times I used it (too much water, not enough, etc) but once I got it down it worked great! I have textured skin and blackheads and noticed a big difference after using this product. It also has a gentle texture to it, not too rough & felt good for daily use. Complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling - plan to purchase full size in the future as I am very satisfied with the product. Gentle yet effective
