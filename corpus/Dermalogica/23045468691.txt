I’ve really been enjoying this product. I like the fact that you have to activate it on your own ... makes it a more interactive experience that makes ingredients seem “fresh.“ Lathers up with just a bit of water and is easy to apply to face. I did not experience any type of burning or discomfort. Washed off in a minute following package directions. My skin feels very smooth and soft after use.  Not tight or irritated at all. I would definitely add this product to my beauty regimen. (This product was gifted to me by Dermalogica Sampling in exchange for my honest review.) Gentle Yet Effective
