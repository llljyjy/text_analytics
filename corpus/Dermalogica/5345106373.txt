This is a super unique product. I have never used something like this before. Once you get it wet, it turns into a foamy face wash with a super mild exfoliation effect to it. I really like that it will last me a long, long time. I go through face washes quickly. To me this is not a strong exfoliator, so I feel like I can easily use it daily without issues and I  have dry skin.  If you need a stronger exfoliator, you would want to go with something else. For a great face wash, I love this. Great Product for Cleansing - Supe rUnique
