I received the Dermalogicaâ€™s Daily Microfoliant gifted by Dermalogica for my honest review. The exfoliate is very gentle on my skin and help remove any excess dry skin and unclogs any of my pores. I do like that there is oatmeal and allantoin that helps calm my skin. I did like that it is in powder form so you can pour enough for the face and neck.  The powder instantly works upon water activation and I see that it bubbles up a little and has some grit to help remove dry skin and excess oils. I like that I can take this with me in my bag when I need to cleanse my face. Smoother and Softer Face
