Gifted by dermologica: I have enjoyed using retinol for a while now and was on the market for something slightly stronger, that would produce better results. I admittedly havenâ€™t used this long enough, since you have to use retinol for atleast 3 months to see real results. So far I do like it though, I woke up with subtle skin which is a good start. So far so good
