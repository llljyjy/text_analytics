Every product from Dermalogica is amazing, this cleanser is yet another great product that actually works. I use it on my combination skin pron to acne and break outs. I feel that my skin is cleaned well after every use, yet it doesnâ€™t overdry my skin and does not cause any discomfort at all. Love the texture and the mild scent. Spectacular!
