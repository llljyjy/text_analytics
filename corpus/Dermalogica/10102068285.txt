I received this product complimentary from dermalogica sampling in exchange for my opinion. It was easy to use you just mix it with water into a paste. It has a nice what seemed like a citrusy smell to me. It was a milder exfoliant didn’t feel real harsh on my face like others I have used. Made my skin feel extremely soft and smooth. It is only a 7 day sample so I can’t really tell if it made a difference in my skins appearance or not but so far I like how it feels. nan
