After using it for several days I have to say YES! It’s easy to use, it doesn’t have harsh smells, it feels amazing both on, during, and after. It has reawaken my skin and I am so thankful I was able to try this product gifted by Dermalogica Sampling! After 7 days I have a new face! A routine staple must have!
