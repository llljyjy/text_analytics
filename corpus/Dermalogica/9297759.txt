I have to say that I am not impressed at all by this Dermalogica Microfoliant, and I would not purchase the full size for a variety of reasons. 1.)   It is very messy.  You lose a lot of product just by pouring granules in your hands, and rubbing palms together, which means that you are literally putting money down the drain.  2.)  It’s so gentle that I frankly do not think there are any results as compared to other similar exfoliating products in this price range.  If you are going to spend this much, why not get a product that gives you visible results after a couple of uses instead of this? 3.) I do not think it is that revolutionary or earth friendly that this is in granule form instead of a liquid.  It benefits the company in the sense that they can ship more product for the same amount of money by weight, but the bottles take up the same amount of space in a truck or shipping container, and take the same amount of gas to haul around, and the consumer has to add water anyway, so I don’t see much value-added.   I have used other Dermalogica products in the past and enjoyed them, but this specific item does not resonate with me.  This sample packet was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. Not a great product from Dermalogica
