like this sunscreen and the fact that it does not leave a white cast, but I found the actual product itself and texture a bit heavy.  That said, it is a very hydrating sunscreen/moisturizer combo, and while it’s not ideal for my oily skin I do like using this on dry skin days.  It just shouldn’t be so expensive. nan
