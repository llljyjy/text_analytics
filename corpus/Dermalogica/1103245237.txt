I really like how easy the Daily Microfoliant I received complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling is to use for a gentle, daily exfoliation. After cleansing, I pour about a nickel size in my wet hands and create a foamy lather before massing on my face, neck and chest area. It doesnâ€™t make my skin feel dry or tight and I have noticed a smoother texture overall! Gentle and easy to use
