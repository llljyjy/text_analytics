I love Dermalogica products! I use them in my daily routine…this sunscreen applies smoothly and wears nicely under makeup. I love that it’s moisturizing, but not too thick and doesn’t leave a white cast. I am 32 and have combo skin so I have to be careful with certain products or I will get cystic acne. As always, I can’t wait to try more from the brand. nan
