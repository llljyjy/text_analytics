I was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling and gave this product a try. On the packaging this product claimed to able to have visible results within a week. Just after the first use I experience results that had my skin feeling clean and nor stripped. With most exfoliates, the ingredients can be abrasive and hard on the skin but this product was amazing. With the powder consistency and slight grainy texture I was hesitant I was pleasantly surprised. After a weekâ€™s use I saw a lot less build up in my pores and less texture upon my skin. I struggle a lot with white heads and products clogging my skin due to weight. If you have the same issue I 100 recommend adding this to your routine. I have oily to normal skin and was completely fine after daily use. 10/10 will be buying 10/10 love this product
