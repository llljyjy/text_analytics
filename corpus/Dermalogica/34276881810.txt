I really liked the finish of this spf, I have dry skin but spf can sometimes sit on top of it and feel greasy. This one absorbs well! Avoid the mouth area — I didn’t get an eye stinging but I got some in my mouth, yikes. The packaging is great as well. Slight scent but nothing that lingers Great for dry, acne prone skin
