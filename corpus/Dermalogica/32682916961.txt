Gifted by Dermalogica sampling. I’ve never tried a powder exfoliant cleanser before and it was a good experience. I liked how soft my skin felt afterwards and the fact that it’s gentle enough that you can use it everyday. I didn’t experience any irritation or reaction, definitely good for sensitive skin. Add some water and scrub away! A great exfoliating cleanser
