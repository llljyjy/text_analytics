I honestly loved the texture of this serum. It was nice and light, so it sat nicely under my moisturizer and under makeup. At the same time, it still felt like it provided just the right amount of extra hydration for my skin in these winter months. Overall, this is a effective and very beautifully formulated vitamin C serum, but I still can’t say it’s 100% worth the money. It’s a very small bottle and because I use it in the morning everyday, I went through it rather quickly. beautiful formulation
