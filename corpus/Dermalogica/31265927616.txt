This moisturizer has been super hydrating for my skin & of course the major plus of it is the SPF.  It layers well with other products for me & is not greasy at all.  I feel like my complexion has been brighter & smoother with use as well.  Yes, it is a bit pricey, but just like most other Dermalogica products it is totally worth it! nan
