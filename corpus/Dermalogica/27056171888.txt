This serum absorbed quickly into my skin and seems to provide adequate hydration. I didn’t experience any tackiness & it layers good with sunscreen. It also doesn’t feel greasy, which is a plus for me. Downside is that it’s on the pricier side, but it’s a nice serum. Complimentary from Dermalogica. nan
