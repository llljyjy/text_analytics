I think the Daily Microfoliant by Dermalogica is a good product but I wouldn’t exfoliate my skin every day. I found out that it makes my skin drier... I was reading that sensitive and dry skin needs to keep its own natural cycle which is to exfoliate and then moisten it. I am happy to exfoliate my face every 15 days because I think it’s a more natural and healthier way of doing it. I recommend the product;I think the smell is amazing, and the packaging is easy... if you have oily skin maybe exfoliate it 3x a week but not daily...Disclosure: I was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling“ practical and easy to use
