It was very gentle on my face. I had expected it to be tough. At first I didn’t notice much of a change but by the end of the week my face seemed to be brighter. I used a lot of makeup and skin care has an influencer so it’s nice to have something to wash away the day’s work. My face also felt quite smooth. Would purchase, for sure! (complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling) Surprising great!
