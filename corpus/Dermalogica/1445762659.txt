Dermalogica gifted me their new Awaken Peptide Eye Gel in exchange for my honest review, My new secret weapon to looking bright eyed and well looks rested (even when Iâ€™m not feeling it!).  This gel is soothing and cool when applying, and almost immediately reduces puffy eyes and plumps up fine lines.  My skin looks smoother and more hydrated, which means my concealer goes on flawlessly.  If your eyes are all someone is seeing above your mask- you want them to look their best!  It makes my morning routine so much easier and the effect lasts all day.  Dermalogica does it again! nan
