I’ve had a wonderful start to my experience using this dynamic retinol serum, I’ve had no reaction, which as someone with sensitive skin is very surprising. I love the formula, it’s creamy, soft and leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean, not sticky or greasy. I’m excited to see further results after weeks of using it. A new essential in my routine
