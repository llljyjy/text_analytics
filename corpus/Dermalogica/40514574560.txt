My packet of the Daily Microfoliant samples was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. I was worried that it might irritate my skin, since it’s a little sensitive to some exfoliants I’ve used before. However, I really enjoyed this one! I had no skin irritation, and my skin was noticeably smoother. I think it even made my large pores appear less noticeable. My essence, moisturizer, and sunscreen applied more smoothly and absorbed faster after I used the Daily Microfoliant too. I would definitely recommend trying it out for yourself, and I’ll likely buy the full-size product in the future. Smoothing & gentle
