I wanted to love this microfoliant, but it has some hidden fragrance in it. The scrub isn’t too gentle or too harsh, but I feel like I have to use a lot of it at a time. It’s definitely for more oily skin types like mine, so I would probably avoid this if your skin is more dry and sensitive. Always Check the Ingredients!
