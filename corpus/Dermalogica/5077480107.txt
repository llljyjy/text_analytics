I really like the Dermalogica Daily Microexfoliant. It is a really good yet gentle exfoliating wash. My skin looks clear and polished. I love how it is a powder that when water is added turns into a nice paste. A little bit goes a long way. My skin doesnâ€™t feel dried out or stripped. Gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. nan
