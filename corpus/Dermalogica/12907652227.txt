Honestly, Dermalogica can do no wrong. This hydration serum is SO GOOD - and I am very picky because I truly have the dryest skin ever. It gave my skin a very hydrated, plump finish and paired really well with my moisturizer and makeup. Totally recommend this product to anyone, especially if you also have very dry skin. This product was complimentary from Dermalogica but my review is my own opinion. SO GOOD
