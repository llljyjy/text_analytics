This product has become one of my favorite. I noticed a different on my skin within the first week of using it. I use this mask 2-3 times a week. My skin hasn’t felt this good in a long time. I truly does leave my skin feeling soft “like a baby”. I have sensitive and combination skin and this works well. If you want quality than this is your best friend. It also smells really good. Hydrating, works well with combination skin.
