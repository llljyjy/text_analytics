Gifted by Dermalogica sampling. This product is a very gentle and you can be used in daily basis . This product’s formula is very unique. It’s come in a very fine white powder. you just add it to wet hands and rub your hands together, creating a paste and then massaged in circular motions over a freshly cleansed face. It’s so cool to see it turn from powder to paste just by rubbing with water! It feels so calming when I’m massaging the paste. It has a very faint scent of rice and oatmeal. After using this, my face feels very nice! It feels amazingly smooth and seamlessly polished.This product completely transformed my skin... it has helped with breakouts, hyperpigmention, oily skin and smoothing my overall complexion. I wish I’d had this stuff years ago.I recommend this product to anyone, young and old, who’s suffering with ance, breakouts, stubborn, dry patches or oily skin. I truly feel like everyone can benefit from product. nan
