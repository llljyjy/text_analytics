Dermalogica Dynamic Skin Retinol Serum has become my new favorite retinol. I’ve tried other brands and they were all unsuccessful with results. I’ve experienced irritation and dryness with other brands. However, this brand has the perfect formulation of a retinol product. I use this product twice a week at night and I’ve seen visible results such as minimized pores, soft skin, and fading of some dark spots caused  by acne. I like the ingredients listed in this retinol such as squalane and beta-glucan. Both of these ingredients help support and protect the skin by providing hydration to the skin. I have combination skin and occasional hormonal acne. Thus, it’s been very gentle with my skin. I’m very impressed by this retinol and I would highly recommend it! It’s a retinol for the long term and the best I’ve seen yet! A must-have retinol in my skincare routine!
