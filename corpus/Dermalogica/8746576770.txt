gifted by Dermalogica Sampling A bit harsh especially the first time i was like woah i recommend trying to mix it on something rather than just the hands so you can really get a paste. Also if you have more sensitive skin like myself I would not recommend using every night or even every two nights tbh. Definitely in moderation. But i do think it exfoliated my skin well and it purged a lot of things out. Good but not for everyday
