This product holds up to Dermalogica’s standard and plays well with others. Absolutely only for night time use and don’t forget to wear sunscreen in the day time!Retinol can be a process, but adding a thin layer of a basic moisturizer underneath can help those of us with sensitive skin. I found this to be the best way for it to work for me and after a couple weeks my pores don’t look as deep and my skin feel softer. I’m excited to see more results in time!gifted by Dermalogica Softer Skin
