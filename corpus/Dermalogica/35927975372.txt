The idea of the product is very innovative, I have never tried anything like that before. The package looks amazing with holographic seal, so you can be sure the product is new. The amount of the product is impressive, 74 grams will be probably enough for a very long time. The powder itself does not smell like any artificial fragrance, which is very important for me as I am allergic. Only a very small amount needed to clean the whole face, and it leaves the skin squeaky clean. I have noticed no dryness or any allergic reactions afterwards. I would definitely recommend it if you value natural ingredients and need fast cleaning without any residue on the skin. Good and innovative
