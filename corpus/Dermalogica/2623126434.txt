I’m not sure where I got the idea that Dermalogica products might not be heavily scented? I think maybe due to the simplicity (classic white/black) of the packaging? This oil smelled very strong - not bad, like essential oils, but strong. It also didn’t rinse off completely. I could feel that my skin still had a coating of oil on it after splashing water several times (perhaps a washcloth is required?). Based on reviews here, it sounds like many find it to be a great product, but not for me. Returning. Not great for scent sensitive people
