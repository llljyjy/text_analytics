I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling in exchange for my honest review. Rice-based power exfoliant activates when in contact with water. Papain, salicylic acid and rice enzymes gently exfoliate my sensitive skin. Colloidal oatmeal and allantoin help calm skin so I can use this exfoliant daily. My skin looks more even, smoother and brighter. Vegan. No bad stuff inside. Love it and would recommend it. Great For Sensitive Skin
