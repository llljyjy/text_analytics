I am delighted to introduce you this magic serum named DERMALOGICA CIRCULAR HYDRATION SERUM.I  have been chosen to try this and give my honest review about this serum.I have been using it since 2 weeks and saw a drastic change. It made my skin hydrated, glowing and pumping. It make my skin super smooth and soft. This serum is one of the best products I have ever tried for Dermalogica. The consistency is really good neither too liquid. I have been using both times during day time and night time and l love to keep it as a daily skin care routine. The best part is you can use it with your daily moisturizer or even hylauronic acid too. This has been really a magical serum where u can feel the difference right away. It makes your skin plumped and refreshing and glowy too. I will definitely recommend.#giftedbydermalogica @dermalogicacanada@sephoracanada love it
