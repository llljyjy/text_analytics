I was gifted the complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling.My first time trying the Dermalogica brand, and I think that it’s worth the price. Since I have combination and acne-prone skin, exfoliating products appeal to me. I’ve been using it for about 3 days, I haven’t noticed any clear improvement yet on my skin. However, this exfoliating powder is gentle, and my skin feels deeply clean.I highly recommend it for those who have oily, combination and acne-prone skin. Love it
