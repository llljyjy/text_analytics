If you have dry skin you will love this SPF! I’ve been using for several weeks now and omg it’s incredible! It blends in effortlessly and leaves my skin dewy at first and dries down nicely, not as dewy when it dries down but my skin feels nourished, hydrated and protected! The scent is light and subtle and fades as it dries ! I absolutely recommend giving this one a try! Must Try!
