This is a unique gentle exfoliant that can be used on a daily basis. This complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling comes in single-use sachets, which I like, so it’s easier to use or bring it to travel. The product’s ingredients are good for the skin, it’s a powder that becomes a paste when mixed with water. It feels gentle on my skin, with no irritation or tingling, and the result is good for me. After using this product, my skin feels smooth. Will continue to use it in the hopes of getting a better result. Gentle and smooth
