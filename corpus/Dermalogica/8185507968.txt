I love this cleanser!!! I have extremely sensitive skin with acne and fungal acne. Doesn’t make me break out, or leave my skin feeling super tight and dry after cleansing. The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is because it doesn’t remove eye makeup well, definitely need a makeup remover when wearing eye makeup. SO calming
