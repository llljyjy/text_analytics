I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica in exchange for my honest review. I was excited to try this product, yet a bit skeptical as I’ve never used a rice based exfoliant,now I am completely obsessed. The rice exfoliates better than any other product I have tried but it doesn’t irritate my skin. The combination of Rice Enzymes,Phytic Acid, Salicylic Acid,White Tea, Licorice and Colloidal Oatmeal leaves my skin smoothe,refined,refreshed,moisturized and completely exfoliated without any redness or irritation. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone and all skin types. AMAZING PRODUCT
