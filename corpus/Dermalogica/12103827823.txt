Amazing. Just amazing. It is incredibly soothing and feels so luxurious when you put it on your face. A little goes a LONG way with this product, so the price may be a little steep, but you’re going to get your money’s worth. After the first use, I noticed my skin felt clearer, and combined with my other skin care products, my face was glowing.It has a very slight and refreshing smell. Nothing overwhelmingly strong, it’s fresh and light which I love. The oil is gentle yet rich going on and comes off so easily. nan
