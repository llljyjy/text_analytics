The Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant is a great cleanser for my combination skin. After using it my skin feels super clean, smooth, and free of oil. I also love that it has a skin brightener in it that leaves my skin more even toned and gets rid of my redness. It was not too harsh either so I recommend it for all skin types. I do not have particularly sensitive skin but it definitely didnâ€™t feel harsh to me at all. I was gifted a sample complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. I love this product!
