I received a few samples of the Dermologica Microfoliant complimentary from Dermologica Sampling. Unfortunately, my skin did not react well to it. I think the foaming action mixed with the physical exfoliant dried my skin out and caused a good bit of damage. I’m used to using physical exfoliants, so I’m not sure why this didn’t work for me. I would recommend being extra gentle the first time you use it! Not for me, but might be good for you!
