Got this product gifted by the brand and it does NOT disappoint. My new favorite way to exfoliate my skin. It smells pretty nice too, and leaves my skin feeling refreshed without the tight feeling. It does not take away the natural oils of your face. It’s extremely easy to use, making a paste that’s too dry is easier to fix than one that’s too wet. Easy and gentle exfoliant
