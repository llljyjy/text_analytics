My favourite toner is salon-only and costs a fortune, so I can’t buy it as often as I’d like. This one is a solid everyday stand-in until I win the lottery. Refreshing; smells great; soothing. The spray nozzle is a little unruly (not a fine mist & difficult to aim), so I suggest spraying it into your palm & applying it with your hands. nan
