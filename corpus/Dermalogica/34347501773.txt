I was looking for a product that was clean, not all chemicals and something good for daily use for sensitive skin.. This is it. My skin feels so clean and super soft after using it.Not sure if it’s good for sensitive skin or not. Sometimes my skin can be irritated by products, but this doesn’t seem to bother it and I like how clean it feels after. Excellent exfoliator
