Does a great job at removing makeup but it leaves a greasy film on your face and hands. I have to wash my face twice after with my cleanser just to get rid of it. After using it on the eyes to remove mascara my eyes are blurry for about an hour. Really wanted to love this cause of all the reviews but i hated it. greasy film
