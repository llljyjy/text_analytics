Two important qualities in an SPF are that they can’t sting my eyes, or sit super heavy on my face. I live in Texas and when it’s hot, a thick layer of sun cream can actually make me sweat even more. I also have sensitive eyes, and it seems like a lot of SPFs these days make my eyes water and run. With this SPF, I can easily put it on without any red or watery eyes, and it’s VERY light and comfortable, which is so important to me. I have countless SPFs sitting in a drawer somewhere because I couldn’t bring myself to reach for them due to their heaviness. As with most Dermalogica products, the biggest issue for me is the price. But this one is worth it if you have sensitive skin or eyes! nan
