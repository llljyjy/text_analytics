I love this lightweight formula that helps with signs of aging and hydration from this dynamic skin recovery spf. My skin looks dewy and fine lines are more firmer after a few uses. This works great on my sensitive combination skin and I have not had any irritation around eyes. This also has a faint fragrance but goes away quickly and no white cast. Wonderful Spf
