I’ve been using the circular hydration serum for about a month now and love it so far! It’s light and absorbs quickly with no sticky feeling. It’s pretty much odorless which is great, especially when using other more scented products. I have really dry skin and this has been working well for me along with my usual moisturizers. Definitely would recommend! @dermalogicacanada, @sephoracanada, #giftedbydermalogica Amazing light, hydrating serum, ready for summer!
