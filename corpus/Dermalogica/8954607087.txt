I am really skeptical when it comes to exfoliants because of how harsh they can be. The Dermalogica daily exfoliant is perfect! It exfoliates without being rough, the powder consistency is better than a gel scrub. You can really focus on the exfoliation with the powder.  The product does have an oatmeal smell to it, which reminds me of oatmeal bath packets from when I was young. I will be purchasing this exfoliant after I use up all my samples gifted by Dermologica sampling! a staple item
