I received this powder cleanser as a complimentary from Dermalogica. I’m a big fan of Dermalogica products. I’ve tried Dermalogica daily microfoliant and I was very excited to try this one too. And honestly, it didn’t disappoint me. I have uneven and dry texture skin. it gently exfoliates the skin and leaves me clean and smooth skin. Furthermore, I love this powdered cleanser because I can control how much exfoliation I want. nan
