Wanted to love this product but unfortunately results were disappointing. It does leave your skin feeling fresh but causes breakouts. Perhaps if you use this product with other Dermalogica products you will receive different results. However, I use a variety of brands when it comes to my skin care routine one being Glow Recipe. I absolutely love their mask. Causes breakouts when used with other brands
