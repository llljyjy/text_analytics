I was received this product complimentary from Dermalogica and I think this product is a hit or miss, depending on your skin type! I have sensitive and oily skin in the summer and found that it did a great job at cleaning out debris for pores! It is gentle enough to use everyday, but I typically only use it every other day, and it doesn’t leave a film on the skin. The only reason I couldn’t give it 5 stars was because to me it has a funky smell and it’s also kind of messy to use. Other than that I really enjoy it! nan
