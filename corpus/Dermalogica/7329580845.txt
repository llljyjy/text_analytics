I have acne prone skin and lately I’ve been dealing with breakouts, especially on my cheeks & chin area. So when I was given a chance to try this exfoliating cleanser I had to go for it and I’m happy I did!This has definitely helped calm my inflamed skin lately and so far I am excited to actually try the full-size for this! Will definitely re-purchase this and add it to my skincare routine. Besides that, I definitely am looking forward to checking out this brand a little bit more! I heard so much great things about them! *gifted by Dermalogica Sampling Impressed! Recommend for acne prone skin
