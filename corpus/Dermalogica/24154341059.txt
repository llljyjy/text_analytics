Love this! I honestly feel like being consistent with this has helped my acne. I use it morning & night. Feels great on my skin. Doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin at all. i have not had any bad reactions at all and i’m slowing incorporating my other skincare products with it and seeing if there’s any reaction. so far, my skin is great and i love the product! gifted by dermalogica love
