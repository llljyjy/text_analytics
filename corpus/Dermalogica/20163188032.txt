The Microfoliant is the perfect consistency to gently resurface my skins texture. It is gentle and non abrasive and gave me such a pretty glow and a more even skin texture. I use the Milkfoliant from Dermalogica daily, but this is a great ‘boost’ when I need a little more intense of an exfoliating treatment. I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. nan
