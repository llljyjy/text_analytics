(complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling) This item is a daily exfoliant that is quite gentle. The formula for this product is quite special. A very fine white powder describes it. The powder is activated by adding it to moist palms and rubbing them together to form a paste. The paste is then applied to a freshly washed face and rubbed in circular strokes. This product features very small and fine exfoliating granules instead of the exfoliating beads used in traditional microdermabrasion and exfoliating products, which make the skin feel rough and gritty. When combining the paste, you can change the exfoliationâ€™s intensity by adding more powder and less water. I noticed a slight exfoliation of my skin after using this lotion. nan
