I recieved dynamic retinol serum complimentary from dermalogica . I’m in my 30s so retinol is must since it can help with so many skin concerns . This is a great effective yet gentle retinol serum. It’s a light easy to apply serum absorbs well and can be layered. I used it every other day to see how I would do then. Bumped up to daily . I have fine lines and light pigmentation so this is helping with it . So far skin is loving it and can see the benefits already . Great gentle retinol serum
