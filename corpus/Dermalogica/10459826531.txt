Cons -pricey-no notable difference in fine lines.-does not mix with vitamin C (explained below)-not enough moisture.Pros-seemed to brighten undereyes -Somewhat moisturizing-great under makeup.-last about 4 months with day and night use.-helped with orbital texture.I liked this eyecream but not enough to justify the price It did depuff my eyes when I didnt get enough rest but did not immediately remove my dark shadows.The part about not working with vitamin C serum is what broke the deal its not stated anywhere that your not supposed to use it with Vitamin C.     So when i was halfway through this tube i decided to implement vitamin c in my routine. So I patted some water based Vitamin C serum all over my face and a bit under my eyes.  After the product absorbed I applied my dermalogica eye cream and soon I noticed a strange smell kinda like those chalky flintstones vitamin pills the orange flavored ones I didnt think much of it.    Over the course of 3 days I notice my eyes felt more sensitive and slightly irritated but not much.   By the 4th day i woke up with millia.     I stopped applying my Vitamin c serum and all that  disappeared within 2 days. So word of caution  with vitamin c.   or any other active. as sometimes skincare reacts with each other especially when actives arent from the same lines..Aside from that hiccup I found my tube to last a while but not too long itd go bad by the time I finish it.    It was moisturizing and i feel it helped with firmness but saw my fine lines alot more. pronounced Ok
