I’ve had the chance to test this cleanser out for a few days and I must say it’s been getting the job done quite nicely. It removed a long work’s day of oil build up and my makeup without leaving a tight & dry feeling behind. I was worried that the glycolic acid might be a bit harsh for daily use but that is not the case with this cleanser and its really gentle on the skin. Definitely recommend it for anyone that is dealing with adult acne like I am. Really great
