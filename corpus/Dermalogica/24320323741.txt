I have never seen my skin clearer with an exfoliants like Dermalogica did. I received a couple of samples as a gift from dermalogica sampling as a complimentary gift and a used one over this weekend and I absolutely loved it. It cleanses from with an I would recommend using it at night washing it off and apply and thick layer of moisturizer on top of it and just see your face in the morning because it is glowing from within. It feels like I have been drinking a bloody cleanse a smoothie for 30 days and my skin is shining through so yeah highly recommend.  “Gifted by Dermalogica Sampling” Glow
