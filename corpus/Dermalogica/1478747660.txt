Complimentary from Dermalogica.Another product I love from Dermalogica.I’m mostly concerned with the appearance of fine lines on my forehead. I have been using this for two weeks and I’m already noticing a difference. My skin looks much smoother and the lines are more subtle. I really love the formula and it’s non irritating on my skin unlike other retinols I have tried. I can’t wait to see the full results. nan
