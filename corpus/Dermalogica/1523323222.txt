I used this after cleansing my face I tried it on top of my eye cream moisturizer and alone. Both times my under eye felt smoother and firmer. I prefer it on top of my moisturizer especially since it’s winter and my skin is drier and it’s not really moisturizing but does give your eye area a instant boost. I think I’m the summer I will use it without the moisturizer. It smooth my fine lines and my under eye area felt tighter. Definitely a great product. This was gifted by dermalogica in exchange for my honest review. Adding to beauty routine
