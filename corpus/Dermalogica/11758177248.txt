I really like this sunscreen. I love dermalogica products in general but I think this one is my favorite. It feels so hydrating on my dry skin and it leaves a beautiful glow that makes me feel like I would  ruin it if I put makeup on. I like the airless packaging, subtle fragrance and the lightweight formula. Glass skin effect
