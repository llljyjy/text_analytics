I received samples of this product gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. I personally don’t like that they were flimsy little packets and would’ve preferred a full sized instead. Therefore my opinion on it may not be as adequate as someone who had used it longer. I would say it’s meh, I feel like all exfoliants give that direct noticeable difference. I wouldn’t recommend due to the sheer price alone, as to me it wasn’t worth it. Honestly Meh not the best
