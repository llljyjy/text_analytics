Gifted by Dermalogica. Received this at the perfect moment. My skin was having a breakout and the dermalogica daily Microfoliant has oatmeal which really helped calm my skin down. I opted to use this at nighttime since I use vitamin C in the morning. I like that it gave me that extra domination, calmed my skin. I was able to see a visibly brighter complexion by adding this to my routine. Boost of Exfoliation
