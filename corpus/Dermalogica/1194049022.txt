I received this complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling“ for my true and honest opinion.This is a very gentle exfoliator that can be used everyday. It comes in a very fine white powder form. To work with the powder, you sprinkle it onto wet hands and rub your hands together to create a paste. Then the paste is massaged in circular motions over the face. It has very fine exfoliating granules that feel gentle on the skin. I feel the more powder you add the thicker/stronger the exfoliation becomes. After using this product, my skin felt smoother and softer even thought the results were minor as I didn’t make the paste really thick and just enough for what my skin needed.  I feel  with consistent use my skin will continue to become more smooth and brighter. Because it is gentle it’s great for daily use with no irritations that this product will keep my skin looking and feeling great. One downside to this is that it’s only an exfoliator. I like to use one product that  cleanses and exfoliates my skin instead of having to use two separate products. This is having me use an extra product and an extra step to my routine cuts into my time. Very Gentle Exfoliator
