I had no idea I needed this and now I never want to be without it. It’s so gentle, but my skin looks and feels so polished and glowy afterwards. My third shoutout to Crystal at Sephora Bay Ridge for this recommendation - she can do no wrong as far as I’m concerned, and same goes for the milkfoliant. My skin is better than ever.
