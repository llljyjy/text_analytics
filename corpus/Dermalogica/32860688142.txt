I received this product as a gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. Here is my honest review. I have tried this product for a week and I have to say I am impressed! I have oily skin and big pores. While using the microfoliant exfoliator for a week I have seen a difference in the amount of oil my skin produces and also my pores are less noticeable.  My skin feels much mor smooth, and my complexion looks more brighten. I will for sure be purchasing the big bottle of this product because I fell in love! nan
