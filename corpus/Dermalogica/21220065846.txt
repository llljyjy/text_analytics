Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant is now a staple in my skincare routine. My skin feels smoother and looks brighter. I love the fact that the ingredients are all natural, and thereâ€™s none of those skin damaging micro-exfoliating beads. After just two weeks of use, my skin feels like silk. It reduced the appearance of my pores, reduced my blemishes, and made my skin just look radiant! I will keep using this product! A staple in my routine!
