I love a two in one product for my morning routine! This is perfect to knock out two steps for me: moisturizing and SPF. I find the texture to be thick but easily spreadable. I feel like it absorbed well and was pleased there was no pilling with my other layers of product. There is NO white cast at all! It does leave your face quite shiny, but I always finish with setting powder anyways. My skin feels moisturized for sure and I love that my face is protected. Great daily sunscreen!
