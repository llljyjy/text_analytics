This product is nice. It is a gentle way to physically exfoliate your skin to get off some of the dead layers. Itâ€™s a powder that you add a bit of water to, and gently rub into the skin. It helps reveal smoother, healthier looking skin. I was kindly gifted by Dermalogica Sampling of this product in exchange for my honest review. Gentle but effective
