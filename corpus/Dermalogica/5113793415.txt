I didn’t have this for a while because using Paula’s Choice BHA consistently but I got this again during the Spring Sale and I like having something so fresh smelling and mellow to put on my face before serums / moisturizer without it being too harsh!  Dermalogica products are THE BEST. I’ve been a big fan since my pre-teen days (now late twenties) and though they’re expensive, this mini bottle would easily last me ~1.5 years as I spray 1-2 in my hand and then pat over my face.
