I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. The daily microfoliant is really good for my combination and sensitive skin. I use it as a second cleanse after their precleanse. It foams really well by adding a little bit of water with the powder and it leaves my skin feeling very smooth and clean afterwards. I can see the brightening effect as well as it gently scrubs away my dead skin. Gentle yet leaves my skin super clean and soft!
