I received this from Dermalogica Sampling to try out and I am VERY impressed. It says it smooths and brightens skin in seven days, and it definitely did with my skin. It contains Papaya Enzymes, Salicylic Acid, and Phytic Acid, which is from Rice Bran. It is super easy to use, and rinses off quickly. The powder isnâ€™t abrasive, and made my skin feel so clean and fresh. Fantastic!
