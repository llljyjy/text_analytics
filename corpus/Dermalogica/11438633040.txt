First of all, a good quality SPF is something very hard to find nowadays. Especially for my skin which is acne prone. This dynamic skin recovery SPF 50 has actually been the best thing I have owned ever. I am only 22 years old but I feel confident and excited knowing that this sunscreen is protecting my skin from aging and sun damage. I have recently become obsessed with ensuring my skin is safe and protected and I know as a fact with Dermalogica my skin will always be safe! An Essential in Skincare!
