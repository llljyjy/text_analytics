This is a beautiful lightweight daily moisturizer with broad-spectrum SPF50 that protects my skin from the harmful UVA and UVB rays while moisturizing, hydrating, and minimizing the signs of aging. It has a beautiful smooth texture that absorbs effortlessly into my skin without leaving a sticky feeling or a white cast. I love that this moisturizer has collagen supporting peptides to firm the skin and Squalane and Vitamin E to hydrate the skin. I love how it leaves my skin with a soft silky finish. It layers beautifully with my foundation. I highly recommend it! Non sticky, very hydrating
