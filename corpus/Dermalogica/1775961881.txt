I was gifted by Dermalogica a few samples packs of their Daily microfoliant. The Daily Microfoliant is a gentle exfoliant that comes in a powder form and is meant to be combined with water. I’ve been using this product for a long time and love it. This is one of the classics from Dermalogica and it works so well on my skin. Though it is labeled as a “daily” product I do suggest checking how your skin does with it. My skin is dry and at time can be sensitive, so I avoid using my daily microfoliant daily and stick to 3 times a week. It is a great gentle exfoliant that when used properly really enhances skin texture. Gentle exfoliant
