This Daily Microfoliant gifted by Dermalogica Sampling is a rice based powder that you mix with a bit of water in your hands until it lathers into a foaming paste. I like how it exfoliates gently using papaya enzymes and washes away cleanly without any residue. Definitely a plus for sensitive skin. Great for traveling
