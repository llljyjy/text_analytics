I always love a product that accomplishes more than one goal packed into just one step, and I’m a huge fan of this. Spf is an absolute must in my beauty/skincare routine, and adding anti-aging ingredients and properties to that is amazing. I love that I’m doing something good for my skin while protecting it from sun damage. I really like the consistency of this product and that it doesn’t make my skin super shiny and sticky feeling. It smells quite pleasant too, and I really appreciate the high spf. nan
