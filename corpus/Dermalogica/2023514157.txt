This was my first time trying a retinol serum and so far I am liking the results. It did not make my face feel sensitive or uncomfortable. I would suggest to have a good moisturizer paired with it. I plan to keep using it and see what else it can do for my skin. My product was gifted to me by Dermalogica - Sephora. Good retinol serum
