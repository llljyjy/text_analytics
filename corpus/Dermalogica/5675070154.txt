Initially, I was hesitant to use this product after receiving it as a gift because of its grainy texture - but I found that after a couple of uses, I absolutely LOVED it. It’s perfect for gentle physical exfoliation - getting rid of dead skin cells, dullness, etc. - but also doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry or dehydrated after. Despite my initial thoughts and assumptions about this product, I saw a visible reduction in the amount of blackheads on my nose and chin after a week of consistent use! I think I’ll keep using this product 2-3 times a week for max results. NEW HOLY GRAIL
