I received this complimentary from Dermalogica sampling and have used this product a few times and like it so far! Itâ€™s very easy to use and you can thin it out with water as much as you need to. I always worry with physical exfoliants that it will strip my skin too much but this one is very gentle! Skin feels nice and smooth, has helped a little with some blackheads and clogged pores as well. nan
