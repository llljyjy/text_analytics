I have been using these for about three weeks now and I have to say that they have helped my skin slightly.I struggle with eczema and dry flaky skin around my eyes and mouth area. I like to use this because it’s convenient and easy to use. I have to just wash my face with water and scrub with this product, my face feels dry and tight after I use it.You have to use a really good moisturizer to help with the chemicals you just used on your face, I love this product so far. It is on the more expensive side but if you want something that will work for sensitive skin; try this! It’s like a fine powder that you mix with water to make a cleansing pasteThis has been gifted by Dermalogica sampling Perfect for my eczema prone sensitive skin
