I like that this is a kit that helps to give a brightness boost to the skin. It’s a perfect travel kit or test size if you aren’t sure how it would affect your skin. I would note that if you aren’t used to glycolic acid or vitamin C there will most likely be a purging period before your skin gets used to it. Otherwise this worked well on my skin and did boost it’s overall glow. nan
