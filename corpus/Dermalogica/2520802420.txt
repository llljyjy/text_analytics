I received this complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. This product is less exfoliating than I expected. Itâ€™s more of a paste. It comes as a powder that you mix with water in your fingers or on your face. It did make my skin very soft. It felt like a gentle oatmeal wash/scrub. I like it- I was just expecting a more harsh exfoliant. I will purchase to see what longer term results are. nan
