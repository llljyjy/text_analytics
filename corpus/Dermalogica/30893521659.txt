This product is wonderful in every way. It is easy to use, not heavy, and it works effectively. It does not leave an oily feeling, and I am able to wear it beneath my makeup without any problems. The majority of sun protection lotions designed for the face leave my skin feeling dry after repeated usage, but this one does not. This is something I put on every day. nan
