I am honestly shocked by the results of this Eye Gel. Only after the first use, my under eyes feel so, so soft. The area I applied this to is so incredibly smooth. Your fingers feel just a tiny bit sticky after applying this Gel but it absorbs so well into my skin, not leaving any stickiness after applying. I am in love with this stuff! I received this as a gift complimentary from Dermalogica and absolutely will be keeping this in my skincare routine. Wow...in love with this gel
