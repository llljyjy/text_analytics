Iâ€™ve used this exfoliant many times in the past and recently returned to it, complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling! This exfoliant does a great job of smoothing texture while not being too harsh and stripping my skin. It says you can use daily, but my skin is a little too sensitive for this. Thus, I use it every other day typically (which makes it worth the price!) Great exfoliant for the price
