I have dry sensitive skin and I suffer from allergies, so overtime I had damage my skin around my eyes from rubbing it too much. This eye gel does not irritate my skin and started repairing my skin. It got rid of the dark circles under my eyes and drastically minimized the puffiness. Iâ€™m so happy I got to try this eye gel gifted by Dermalogica and quickly become an essential part of my daily routine. I recommend this eye cream gel. miracle in a tube
