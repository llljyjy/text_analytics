I loveee the Dermalogica Microfoliant but I just like the Milkfoliant. The oat based powder is really gentle and calming but a little too gentle for me personally. That’s why I prefer the microfoliant because it’s a “rougher” exfoliator. If you have sensitive skin this will be great for you! (gifted by Dermalogica) Great for Sensitive Skin
