Honestly, I don’t think there’s a single cleanser in the world that has WOWed me so much that I could RAVE about it, but I will say I’m enjoying this. I’m particularly enjoying this alongside Dermalogica’s hyaluronic ceramide mist (that stuff is insanely good). I wish it lathered just a bit more but appreciate minimal ingredients. I like using it with a face scrubby to get some lather. Pair it with their hyaluronic ceramide mist!
