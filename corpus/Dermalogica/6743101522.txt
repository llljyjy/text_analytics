I received a 7-day supply of microfoliant gifted by Dermalogica Sampling and in just a week, my skin has been very smooth, vibrant, and free of new breakouts! It’s gentle enough to use daily and really helps keep the dead flaky skin away! The only con is that even after a lot of rinsing, there’s still a little product left on my face. This is still something I would continue using in the future! An easy, gentle way to exfoliate!
