I’ve seen this product for years but never gave it a try—I’m glad I did! It’s a bit more abrasive then I thought it would be but with enough water it’s great. I’ll be buying the full size! Left my skin feeling soft & clean. Love the method of mixing water with the dry product. I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica sampling, however my opinion is completely my own. Love it!
