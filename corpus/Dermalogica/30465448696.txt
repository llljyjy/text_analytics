I’m glad I got to try some samples of this product! It is super nice because you can control the amount of water to add to the powder, that way the texture can be different each time! I like a more thick texture so I don’t add as much water. The thick texture really gets a nice exfoliating experience! My skin is left super smooth and soft afterwards! Love it!
