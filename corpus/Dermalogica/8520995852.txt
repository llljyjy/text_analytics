Definitely one of my go to cleansers! Although this was gifted by dermalogica sampling, this has been a cleanser I’ve used for months almost a year now. I absolutely love this daily cleanser which I use during my nighttime routine since it does well at getting rid of any excess dirt, make up, etc that is left over from the day. My skin feels thoroughly cleansed without being too harsh. I do have somewhat sensitive skin, however this cleanser doesn’t irritate my skin. Highly recommend this daily cleanser! An everyday favorite
