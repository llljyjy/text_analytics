Complimentary from Dermalogica. I received this product from the brand to test and review. After using this serum for the last 7 days, I have come to the conclusion that is a great hydrator. As it claims it’s nourishing and hydrating. I truly like the consistency, and the amazing ingredients but I’m sad to share that this product has essential oils, which can be problematic to those with sensitive skin, like myself. So far so good but I’ll proceed with caution. Over all this is a great serum and I’ll recommend for those non sensitive skin or people with allergies to essential oils. great hydrator
