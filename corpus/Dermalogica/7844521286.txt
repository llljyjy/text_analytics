I’ve tried this exfoliant in the past and I didn’t think too much of it but after trying other exfoliants and realizing how harsh and stripping they are I was excited to try this one again. It instantly brightens my skin and it is so gentle that it doesn’t interfere with the rest of my skin care routine. By far my favorite exfoliant. Gifted by Dermalogica sampling Tried it twice now and I love it
