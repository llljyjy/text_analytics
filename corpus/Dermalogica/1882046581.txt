I absolutely love the  Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant. It is extra fine so the exfoliating beads are so tiny so they get into all the micro places. When you add water into the mix and you lather, it turns into a mousse type soapy lather texture after. It is unisex friendly as I asked my boyfriend to try it on his skin. He has oily combination skin and I have dry combination skin. It worked wonders for both of us and we both loved how it made our skin feel so fresh. It can be used for morning to the evening because the beads are so fine this product can be used multiple times per day without heavy abrasion. It brightens up my skin, feels soft to the touch and freshens the skin up! Love this microfoliant
