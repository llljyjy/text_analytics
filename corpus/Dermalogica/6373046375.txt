I received this complimentary from Dermalogica in exchange for my honest opinion. Love that this retinol is lightweight and not heavy at all. So far my skin as been agreeing with this retinol. Some can be harsh for my skin since I have somewhat sensitive skin. But this gem has been agreeing with my skin and I’m so thankful. I want a potent retinol that works but also doesn’t irritate my skin. And so far this new dermalogica retinol serum has been it. Still in the testing stages but so far after a week it’s been so good. so good!!
