This eye gel was gifted by Dermalogica for reviewing purposes, and I had high hopes. It sounds so good and the texture is amazing: it glides on easily and feels cooling. However, every time upon application, I felt a burning sensation. Now, my under-eye area is very sensitive, so if you donâ€™t struggle with that, this might still work for you but I had to stop using is. Other than that it does have a nice smoothing effect. smoothing but not for sensitive eyes
