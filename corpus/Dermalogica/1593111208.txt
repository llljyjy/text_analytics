I was gifted this product by Dermalogica in return for my honest review.I have been using this product for a little over a month and am in LOVE.When I first received this product, I didnâ€™t think much of it. I have tried many hyaluronic acid serums that have always left a sticky residue on my skin/not a big difference between them. Right away I could feel a difference with the circular hydration serum. It is light weight, fast absorbing and works well with makeup. I was having a big issue with dry patches and pilling prior to incorporating this into my skincare routine. I work long days, and my skin still feels as hydrated at the end of the day :) New HG Hyaluronic Acid
