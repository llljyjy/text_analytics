I’ve been loving this SPF50 moisturizer. It’s just hydrating enough and I love the added polypeptide blend. This is a creamy consistency but it’s not greasy or oily feeling. After two weeks of use my skin looks bouncy and like it has more life and moisture. It only smells slightly of sunscreen which i enjoy. It is just a bit expensive! Great daily moisturizer!
