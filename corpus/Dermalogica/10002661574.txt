I only use this product when I feel buildup on my skin/when it feels extra dirty and every time I use it, it makes my skin feel SOOOO soft. I don’t think it’s meant for exfoliation, but it feels like it gets dead skin off too. The key is, you have to rub it on your face for 1 full minuet. Getting in all the nooks and crannies. Then use your normal cleanser for 1 full minuet too. To remove makeup, I would use this after using another oil based makeup remover because you can never be too sure. nan
