Dermalogica gifted me this product in exchange for a review.  I love to exfoliate a couple of times a month to remove buildup and dry skin. I appreciated the texture of the exfoliation. It was very gentle but enough where I could get a nice exfoliation. While I enjoy my fruit and sugar scrubs Indo love how this is a straight exfoliation product. Sometimes with the citrus scrubs if you have a cut it can burn. Donâ€™t have to wrorry about that with this product! nan
