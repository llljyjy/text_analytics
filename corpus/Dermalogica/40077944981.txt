I was gifted by this brand to try it out for a week. Let me tell you! I was very surprised. I didn’t think I would like this because how grainy it felt on my skin. When it was time to wash out, my skin was completely smooth. I ran to my husband to feel my face, it felt like when I just shaved my legs. It also did help with evening my hyperpigmentation! In only one week. I’m going to continue to use this product. Thank you!! BUY IT NOW!!
