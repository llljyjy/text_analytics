I really like this exfoliant, I have semi-sensitive skin and it doesn’t overly strip my skin or irritate it like other exfoliants I have tried. I also like that it’s SUPER fine, not large and aggressive. I would absolutely buy this product again and recommend it to anyone who suffers from acne/clogged pores. **tip*** wet your palms and emulsify the exfoliant before putting it on your face. Obsessed.
