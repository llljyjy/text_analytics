I was really interested in trying this because it was a powder exfoliating cleanser. I was a little unsure about the amount of water to use but pretty much did a 1 to 1 ratio. My skin feels really clean and smooth after and I would definitely use this again. I would probably give it 4.5 stars. I received this complimentary from Dermalogica sampling. Nice product!
