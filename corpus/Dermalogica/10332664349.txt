This was gifted by Dermalogica. I normally donâ€™t like face exfoliants beacuse I have very sensitive skin and they are too rough for me. This one, I was skeptic about at first because it feels very coarse when you first pour it into your hand. As soon as it is lathered, it is a very silky texture. It is the perfect exfoliant and not super abrasive at all. I have a lot of blackheads on my nose, which is where I noticed the biggest difference. It used to be super bumpy and you could feel the pores, and it is a lot smoother after only one use! Super smooth
