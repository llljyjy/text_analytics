i received 7 days packets as complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. This exfoliator is quite nice which makes my skin soft, smooth and clean. However, it is too strong to use it daily for my skin. The second day I use it, my skin is quite red and has tingling sensation. I would recommend to use it weekly if your skin is sensitive like me. weekly routine
