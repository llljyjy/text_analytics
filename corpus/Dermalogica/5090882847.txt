Wouldn’t recommend as an everyday cleanser if you have sensitive skin! It dries me out too much. I have dry sensitive  skin no acne if you’re like me I think use it 3 times a week mask and follow up with a heavy moisturizer. I do like this cleanser for all it’s active ingredients Careful if you have sensitive skin
