I received this exfoliator complimentary from Dermalogica. This is a really cool way to exfoliate. It’s gentle but you can definitely feel it working. It’s not too messy and it’s fun to add water to the powder. I have oily skin so it’s really important to find an exfoliator that does its job without stripping the skin and making it feel tight. nan
