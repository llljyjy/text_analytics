I don’t usually use an exfoliant because it’s too rough on my skin. I can get dry and flakey with patches of eczema. But the Milkfoliant is very gentle, I had no side effects, and it gently exfoliated! It has a mild oaty scent. You don’t need much , and the bottle will last a long time!@dermalogicacanada, @sephoracanada, #giftedbydermalogica Good for sensitive skin
