Really enjoyed using a powder cleanser. Itâ€™s easy to travel with and easy to clean if spilled. The exfoliating powder lathered well, and a little goes a long way. It is definitely gentle enough for daily use as it is not drying to skin. I have use this for a week, do notice my skin is a little bit brighter. I have dry and dehydrated skin, the cleanser did not cause any issue so I definitely recommend this. Not drying!
