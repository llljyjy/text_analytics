I was so excited to try the new Circular Hydration Serum with Hyaluronic Acid from Dermalogica. I’ve been a huge fan of the brand’s skincare line and this one is amazing too!I like the formula, it’s thick and hydrating, but at the same time, it doesn’t feel sticky or tacky. And it makes my dry skin feel so plumped and hydrated. Hands down, it’s my favorite serum at the moment. #giftedbydermalogica Amazing serum for dry skin
