This is a great powder exfoliant. It’s gentle enough for even sensitive skin. With great ingredients like Rice Bran, White Tea and Licorice. I’ve been using this for about 2 weeks now. Does an awesome job of removing dirt and dead skin. Leaving the skin feeling clean and  soft. It also makes the skin more radiant. It isn’t harsh. Didn’t have any reactions or breakouts. Also extremely easy to use. Would definitely recommend. This product was gifted by dermalogica. Gentle.
