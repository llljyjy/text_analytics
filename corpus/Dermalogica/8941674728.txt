This is a really nice eye cream. I like using it especially in the mornings since it helps me brighten and awaken the skin around the under eye area. This has a light weight silky consistency that absorbs instantly and hydrates and nourishes the under eyes without irritating the area.I love the ingredient list, particularly the papaya enzyme that gently exfoliates without being irritating. It also has tremella mushroom to hydrate and firm the skin and vitamin C and chia seed oil to help depuff the area.I really enjoy this product since it is depuffing and brightening enough that I don’t need concealer, especially for every day. I also really like the applicator since it’s easy to dispense a couple of drops the size of a pea for each under eye. Highly recommend!I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica - Sephora but this is my honest opinion. Depuffing and brightening for the AM
