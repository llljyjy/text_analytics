Dermalogica gifted me a 7 day supply of their best selling daily microfoliant! I love this stuff!! Itâ€™s a powder that turns into a foaming lather. It brightens the skin with Phytic Acid from rice bran and smooths the skin with papaya enzymes and Salicylic Acid.  It also has white tea and licorice which helps balance uneven skin tone while a super smoothing bend of colloidal oatmeal and allantoin helps calm skin. I saw results after the first use! Its fragrance free and paraben free.  Gentle enough for daily use too!! Results after one use!
