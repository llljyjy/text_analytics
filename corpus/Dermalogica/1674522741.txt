This was gifted by Dermalogica sample to me. After trying it, I will say it is a nice exfoliating scrub in that the amount of water you have on your hands almost equates to how abrasive it is. If you have really wet hands, it is more gentle and vis versa. I also like how it is a “daily” exfoliant which usually exfoliants recommended using a couple times per week as opposed to daily. I did not love the smell it honestly smelled like alka selzter tabs, very bitter. It’s also messy and May leave residue if you aren’t thorough. Also your face has to be clean before using, I prefer scrubs that are also cleansers to reduce the number of products I have to put on. Overall though I would recommend this exfoliant if you want “buildable” exfoliation and something that can be used daily. Good for some, not everyone
