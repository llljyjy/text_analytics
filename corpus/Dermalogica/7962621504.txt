This was gifted to me by Dermalogica and I been obsessed ever since I first tried this Microfoliant about 4 years ago, it was the very first product I’ve tried from them and I knew I just had to try more. What I love about this one is that it’s gentle enough to used daily but has such a major effect on my skin, it feels so soft and smooth after every use and during this time of year my skin gets so dry and their works so well to remove the dead surface of my skin. I definitely recommen this to everyone. Obsessed
