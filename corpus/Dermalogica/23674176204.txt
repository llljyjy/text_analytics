This product exceeded my expectations and is unlike any exfoliator I’ve ever tried. You just pour a little bit of the powder in your hands, mix with water, and rub it on your face. It’s surprisingly not grainy! It turns into a silky lather and even removes makeup. It leaves my skin feeling super soft with a lovely glow. This was gifted to me by Dermalogica, but all opinions are my own. And I definitely recommend it. Exceeded my expectations!
