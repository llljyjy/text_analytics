I was gifted by Dermalogica to test out this product and I was pleasantly surprised. I am often very hesitant when it comes to exfoliators but this one did the trick for me! It left my skin looking glowy and feeling renewed without being stripped and dry. This was a gentle exfoliant in my opinion and is perfect for everyday use. Good for sensitive skin!
