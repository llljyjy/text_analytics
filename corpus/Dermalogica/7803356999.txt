There’s one thing I like about this product which is that it’s pretty gentle on the skin and it’s not irritating and my skin did feel smooth after I was done using it after just one use. The thing I don’t like about it is that it’s actually very very gentle almost to the point of being ineffective because the powder disintegrates into a creamy lather right away. That being said my skin did feel smooth and not overly stripped after I was finished using it. Complimentary from dermalogica. Good and bad
