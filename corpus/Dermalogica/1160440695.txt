Complimentary  from Dermalogica me with the Daily Microfoliant that smooths with Papaya Enzymes + Salicyclic acid & brightens with Phytic acid from Rice Bran.   This Daily Exfoliant is a powder that I added a bit of warm water (plus a bit of toner) & mixed into a rich frothy paste that literally made my skin look & feel beautifully polished!!  It doesn’t feel like I’m stripping my skin, merely removing any unnecessary dead cells making way for fresh, renewed skin. I actually thought it sounded really familiar, so I looked into my extra, haven’t tried yet “stash“ & there it sat, still in its box saying “why haven’t you tried me“  So, I’m super stoked to know that when my lovely samples are gone, I’ve got an entire bottle!! So again, thank you for introducing me to something I put away but should of tried months ago!! Polished skin!!
