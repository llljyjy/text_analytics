I was sent this product complimentary from dermalogica. This is a very nice mask. My favorite part of this mask is how hydrating it is. It has a nice scent and is super creamy. My skin has been extremely dry and I love using this to add some of that hydration back to my skin. I also noticed that my skin feels a bit smoother after I used it. I havent noticed any other significant changes in terms of brightness or wrinkle reduction. Nice Hydrating Mask
