I was so excited to be gifted Dermalogica’s Daily Microfoliant Exfoliator gifted by Dermalogica Sampling  for a review . This is the first time I tried a scrub that was powder based , you need to add water to create soapy suds to then lather and exfoliate your face . It was soft but felt effective as I rubbed it on it wasn’t too rough . I have sensitive skin so I tend to be red after and that didn’t happen . I do usually prefer to exfoliate as I cleanse so I don’t have an extra step , so I would say that was the only con for daily use . Over all I really liked the way my skin felt smoother and a tad brighter after the first use. A new must have  for my selfcare routine !
