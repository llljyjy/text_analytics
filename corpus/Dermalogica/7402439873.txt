I absolutely love this exfoliator.  I bought the mini just to try and am not disappointed.  We have really hard water in our city so my skin, face & body, is often bumpy and rough.  This was so nice and simple to use.  Left my skin so smooth and not irritated like other exfoliators. The only reason I gave 4 stars is that it is far too expensive (regular size) which I canâ€™t afford so that leaves me very sad. Wow
