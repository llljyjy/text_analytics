Wow! I have been very impressed with Dermalogicaâ€™s Daily Microfoliant Exfoliator since I introduced it into my routine for seven days. The powder is soft, finely milled and, when activated with water, turns into a nice lathery paste. Some granules remain and provide a gentle exfoliation. I enjoy how it feels as I massage it into my skin for a minute (as directed). You can customize the amount of exfoliation with how much water to powder ratio. I also liked working this down my neck and the decolletage area. My skin has never felt better and I saw an improvement with large pores. My face is left feeling super smooth, soft, and a perfect canvas for my foundation. I am only sad that I received a seven-day sample, as I love this exfoliant now!  I received this complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling. Leaves your skin feeling Amazing!
