I got 8 sample packets to try this out. Gifted by dermalogica sampling. Since it was a short time I can’t speak to any lingering results.It does claim to smooth and brighten in 7 days. It was smoothing due to the exfoliating but I did not see any brightening.I didn’t break out from this but I also did not see any improvements with breakouts. I think it’s an okay product but I’m not in love with it. Daily Microfoliant Exfoliator
