I am actually not that new to retinols but I’ve been searching for one that actually shows results! This one I’m on the fence but I have noticed a slight decrease of the wrinkles on my forehead! It smells really light and sinks in perfectly fast. I also love the packaging. I’d definitely recommend this for any first time retinol users. Very user friendly! I was kindly gifted this product in exchange for my honest opinion. User friendly!
