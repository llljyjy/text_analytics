This is a really nice gentle exfoliator. Normally, you don’t want to exfoliate everyday because that can mess with your skin barrier. This is called a daily microfoliant.  While I still think you don’t need to use this everyday, it’s very gentle and non-irritating. When you add water to the powder and rub it between your hands, it makes a rich lather. When you massage in into the skin, the bits of powder in this are very fine and gentle. I think even if you have sensitive skin, this may work well for you! The scent also isn’t very strong which I personally appreciate. Nice gentle exfoliator
