This is an interesting exfoliating powder, gifted by Dermatologica sampling! You just add a little bit of water to activate it and itâ€™ll be s frothy paste to use on your face. It has no harsh smells and does a good job of cleaning your skin and getting rid of oils. It good for people with oily or combination skin who want to try something new. Very interesting
