I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling  in exchange for my honest opinion. This seems to exfoliate well. I’ve only tried it twice as I have kind of sensitive skin so I’m not going to use this everyday. First time I think I went a little to hard with it as my skin kind of burned when I put my skin care on. Second I didn’t scrub as hard and it was fine. Nice exfoliation
