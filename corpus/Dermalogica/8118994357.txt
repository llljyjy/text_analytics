This is the best retinoid to include in your nightly skincare routine! It’s non-drying and the perfect formula so that it doesn’t make your skin flake. I’ve noticed it’s dramatically helped improve the small imperfections on my face. I use it nightly after toning so it keeps my face looking refreshed and youthful. nan
