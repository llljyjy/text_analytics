This spf 50 moisturizer is great for dry skin! It’s not too lightweight or too thick…the formula consistently is kinda in between and hydrates skin well..it blends nicely too. It’s non-greasy and doesn’t leave any white cast on my tanned skin either. I really like the refreshing scent it has (no artificial fragrance though). It’s made with clean ingredients and is cruelty-free & vegan! I like it! Gave it 4 stars because it’s a bit pricey and since I use spf daily, I know I will run out of this bottle pretty quickly. Overall a good spf for dry skin!
