I was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling a 7-Day sample pack of Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant- it is absolutely incredible! I thought this would be harsh, especially as I am nursing, but it didnâ€™t seem to bother her at all. The scent, I mean, as product scents do tend to linger! My skin looks healthy, kind of tender, as this is not the type of product I typically use. But I am ever so thankful! Definitely needed!!
