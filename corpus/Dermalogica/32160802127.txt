I was so surprised to receive so much product gifted by Dermalogica sampling. This is a white texture product which feels like maseca when combined with water. It should feel like you’re making tortillas in the shower except it’s a face product. When I was washing my face with this product for about a minute I could literally feel my sling becoming super soft. Obviously not as smooth as a baby’s bottom but pretty close. I’m sure if I use this product more often I will see more of a skin smoothness transformation. I love this product already! Would definitely buy! A must for daily face routine
