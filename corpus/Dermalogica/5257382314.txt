This is my favorite exfoliant! I use it about 2 times a week but it is gentle enough to use daily. I have gentle skin and it doesnâ€™t irritate it when I use it, unlike other exfoliants that contain beads in it. My skin looks significantly clearer and it had done wonders removing flakes after retinol use. I have tried so many different brands but always find my way back to Dermalogica.
