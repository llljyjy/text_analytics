I wanted to try this product for the longest. It’s satisfying the way it foams up when adding water. I wouldn’t use this often because of my skin type (normal but sensitive) but, around my period i will use it once to prevent breakouts. Guys if you like playing with baking soda get this instead, your skin will thank you. complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling Yes for period days
