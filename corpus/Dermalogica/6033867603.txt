I started consistently using Milkfoliant for about a week now. A friend of mine said that she had great results from using it, so I was excited to finally get my hands on! It was a complimentary  from Dermalogica. The texture is so soothing and it makes my skin feel clean without stripping it. I had problems with textured skin and it looks smoother with less pronounced pores. And I love that I can use this everyday without worrying about drying out my skin! I love, this is my new staple :) Game changer!
