I received the dermalogica daily microfoliant complimentary from dermalogica sampling . I give it a 7/10.   The dermalogica brand came out with a daily microfoliant.   It is a brightening rice based powder exfoliant. It smoothes with papaya enzymes  and salicylic acid. And it brightens with Phytic acid from rice bran. Per the package,     It is a powder that you wet and lather and scrub your face with . It makes your face very soft while youâ€™re washing your face.  Once your face is dry it feels calmed and taut, not irritated and this product does seem to calm acne down. It is an all around good product. The one major  fault is it smells like vomit. Just my opinion. Will purchase great microfoliant!
