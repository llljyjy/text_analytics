The menthol in this product is super strong to me. I have sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin. I’ve used clarifying washes with salicylic acid similar to this product (such as Cerve and LaRoche Posay). I wouldn’t recommend this dermalogica product to anyone. Save your money and try out a drugstore brand’s version. Super strong smelly menthol
