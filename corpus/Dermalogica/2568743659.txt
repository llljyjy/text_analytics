I was so excited to be gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. When I got the consistancy correct, thatâ€™s when I found that I absolutely LOVE this product. The grainy paste texture makes it super easy to take off dead skin and exfoliate. You have to be gentle while using this product. This microfoliant leaves skin feeling AMAZING: clean, polished, smooth, and literally glowing. If you are looking for an exfoliant that will help clear up blemishes, reduce pores and fine lines, and leave skin feeling fantastic then you absolutely need to try this product! nan
