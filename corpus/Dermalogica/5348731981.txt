I was gifted by Dermalogica for the purpose of my honest review. I really enjoyed the Daily Microfoliant during my daily skincare routine! The product was easy to use and you only need a tiny amount at a time. It lathers into a lovely foam and it really made my skin look and feel soft and smooth, even after the first use! The only downside about this product, is you need to be very careful you donâ€™t get any moisture into the container with the rest of the product since this starts as a dry powder. Overall, I enjoy the Daily Microfoliant and would purchase it again! nan
