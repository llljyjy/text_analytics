Soapy smell which I don’t love or dislike… pretty easy to use and left my skin feeling clean and smooth. Very interested to see my results after I finished all of the packets that I have. I have never tried anything from this brand so far it was a good irate impression and glad to continue use.. this was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling but this is my honest opinion from my use of this product on my skin (which I would define as normal skin type) Photos are of my before with the packets and the after is after the first use when I removed my makeup and then used this exfoliator Very nice
