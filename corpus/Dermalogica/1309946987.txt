Eye serums and creams have been a hit or miss for me in the past. Most of them temporarily improve the appearance but not necessarily do anything to nourish long term and the creams are too thick/rich which can cause milia. I haven’t used this one long enough to tell if there are any long term benefits yet but I really like that this Dermalogica one is lightweight and sinks into the skin quickly. My skin slurps it right up which usually means it’s right for me and that my skin loves it. It definitely does that job of hydrating, which is welcomed relief during winter. Grateful to receive this complimentary from Dermalogica Good for now
