Dermalogica really did it with this one! First off this is a really lightweight serum - I like to use it at night when I really need a boost of hydration. It soaks in to my skin so nicely and just feels soft! It has a very light sweet smell almost like candy :) My skin always feels nourished when I wake up in the morning after using. Would definitely recommend to anyone who needs a good HA serum! Hydration all night long
