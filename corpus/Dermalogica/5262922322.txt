I had been looking for a good powder exfoliant for a while. If used some previously that I liked, but they were a little irritating. This dissolves well as you use it, so there arenâ€™t as many large particles that feel scratchy on the skin. I really like to use this like 2x a week because I have congested, combo skin. It works wonders to clear out the gunk and make sure your skincare can really be effective. Great for congested skin
