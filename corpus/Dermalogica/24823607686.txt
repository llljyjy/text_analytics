This cleanser was great dermalogica is one of my go to skincare brands I love to pair this with the micro exfoliatant makes my skin feel clean but not irritated one thing I love about dermalogica is they donâ€™t have strong scents which is amazing! My face is acne prone and I definitely recommend for oily skinners Good for sensitive skin
