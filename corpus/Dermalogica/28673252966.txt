I really enjoyed the way this cleanser left my face feeling after use. It gave my skin a clean, smooth and glowing look. The pump itself was easy to use and provides the perfect amount. Although it doesnt lather very well, it stay more on the side of gel when scrubing your face. I am usually more of a foam or lather kinda of person, but i do like the results i get from this cleanser. A good cleanser
