This is a nice physical exfoliant that isn’t too harsh on the skin! I was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling with 7 trial sizes of this. My skin wasn’t irritated and it did help one of my blemishes get better. I love how it emulsifies with a little bit of water because I have use physical exfoliants like this that still needed to be added to a cleanser. Overall, convenient and effective.
