Thank you dermalogica for gifted me Dermalogica Microfoliant Exfoliator in exchange for my honest review.This white powder might seem underestimated. What can a half-teaspoon do to your face? I was skeptical at first, but once I tried it, I was impressed with a half-teaspoon these powders can do. It felt soft and grainy at first. Once you put drops of water, it lathers well and dissolves all those grains. It doesn’t have any distinctive scent. Apply it to your face in a circular motion and massage it for one minute but make sure to avoid the eye area, then rinse thoroughly. Your skin feels so soft afterward. No more bumpy skin. It looks brighter too. The best part is it doesn’t dry out my skin that has already dried. It is recommended for people that have an uneven skin tone that wants to exfoliate every day. I definitely will purchase more in the future. A half-teaspoon is all you need.
