I was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling for my honest review. I was so excited to try Dermalogicaâ€™s Daily Microfoliant. It was interesting to see that it was in powder form and when activated with water it turned into a foam wash. The product was nice to use and it felt amazing on my skin. I can feel the dirt and grime coming off all while it exfoliated my skin. I would definitely recommend. Cleanse & Exfoliates!
