This product was gifted by Dermalogica sampling in return for an honest review.Overall I really loved this product from the easy application to the overall effects it left my skin feeling so smooth. The only thing I didn’t really like about this product would be the scent it’s kind of a chemical smell which it is a microphone and so it does make sense but that would be my only critique. Left my skin so smooth
