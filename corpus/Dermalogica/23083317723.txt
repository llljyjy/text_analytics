I like the texture of this product. It isn’t too thick or sticky but also not runny or difficult to manage. It feels comfortable and good on my skin during application. It rinses cleanly without any trouble. I am noticing a little change in my skin. It feels a little softer to the touch and it generally feels more hydrated and comfortable. I’m glad received this sample gifted by Dermalogica Sampling so I could become more familiar with it. I do like the results I am seeing from it. It is working for me
