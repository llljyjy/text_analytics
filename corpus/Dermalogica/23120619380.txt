I don’t usually write a review but there was something seriously wrong with my serum. From what other people describe the serum is water but viscus and slightly yellow and mine is just like straight up water. There are also little grey balls just floating around in it?? I’m very confused and very upset with this product clearly it’s a bad batch or something but for such an expensive serum I feel like it shouldn’t be contaminated with whatever gross moldy stuff this seems to be.
