Obsessed doesn’t begin to describe it. Number one, I love Dermalogica. Number two, I have been on the hunt for a really good moisturizer that ALSO contained SPF… this is harder than it sounds! Enter the Dynamic Skin Recovery. It meets all of my “must have” criteria, including age defense properties, a high SPF, and a smooth and invisible appearance. Yay for SPF!
