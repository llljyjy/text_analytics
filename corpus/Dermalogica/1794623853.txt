Received a weeks worth of free samples complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling in exchange for my review but I’ve purchased this item myself before. It’s a great exfoliant and my skin feels so fresh after using but not dry. I love the powder formula as it’s easy to dump a little bit in my travel bottles to bring on the go. Fresh!
