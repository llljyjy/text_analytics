I was lucky enough to received a 7 days packs to try it, complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling.This exfoliant by far is my favorite skincare product. The aesthetician recommended this, and I  Iâ€™ve been in love with it ever since. It works really well with my semi-sensitive skin, and clears out clogs that result from daily makeup use. I try to use it every 2 days, I use tsp amount each time. You are supposed to melt the little granules in your wet palms before you start massaging your face. Wonderful product. Nice exfoliant
