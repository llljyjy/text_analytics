Gifted by Dermalogica. The sample of the Daily Microfoliant from Dermalogica has been very pleasant. I love that it’s activated by water, very gentle on my sensitive skin. It lathers nicely almost like a foamy paste. Definitely worth trying out if you’re looking for a new exfoliator. Great exfoliator
