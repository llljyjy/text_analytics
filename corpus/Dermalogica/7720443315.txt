The powder to foam application is unique. I was genuinely surprised at this type of application because it actually makes it a great travel option. Even though it’s an exfoliant, it’s gentle on my skin. It doesn’t feel beady like some physical exfoliants are. I use it after my daily cleanser and it works well with it. nan
