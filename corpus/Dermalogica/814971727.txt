This is such a great moisturizer with sunscreen for colder weather. It blends beautifully and is very hydrating. I have dry-combo skin and it’s sufficiently hydrating and makeup goes on nicely without any piling. I try to wear min of SPF 50 year-around and this makes it easy to achieve.  What I love most about this is that it’s multi-beneficial. It provides SPF protection and hydrations and it also contains white tea extract and polypeptide blend for antioxidant boost and anti/aging benefits. It’s on a higher price-point but I trust MURAD and will gladly pay the price. Multi-beneficial Moisturizer with SPF!!
