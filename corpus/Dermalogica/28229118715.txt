I have actually used Dermalogica for years, but this is the first time I’ve tried this dynamic skin retinol serum. I am getting older and have noticed my wrinkles more around my eyes than ever.  I have tried a couple other brands and I did see some results but nothing like what I’ve seen with this.  I am so glad I tried it! Gifted by Dermalogica-Sephora I’m seeing so much of a difference already
