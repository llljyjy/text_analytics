The Dynamic Skin Recovery SPF 50 is a daily moisturizer with a chemical sunscreen that firms, hydrates and protects.  I use it in the morning after cleansing and toner and apply gently to my face  and neck rubbing it in with my fingertips.  I use a pretty generous amount since it contains sunscreen.  It has a light floral scent.  I prefer fragrance free skincare.  It does absorb well and does not leave any greasy feeling behind.  It has no whitecast.  It works well under makeup.  My face feels hydrated and protected from harmful rays.  Key ingredients include a unique polypeptide blend that improves the appearance of damaged skin, white tea which provides antioxidant protection against free radicals, and hyaluronic acid to provide hydration. I like that it is made of clean ingredients and has sustainable packaging. nan
