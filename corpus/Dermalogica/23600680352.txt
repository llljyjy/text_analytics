I got this product gifted by Dermalogica in exchange for my honest review! I’ve tried many enzyme based cleansers and a lot of them have made my skin irritated and broke me out in spots, but this one didn’t do anything like that! My skin was so soft and smooth, and over time, I’ve seen my skin get much brighter! This stuff works!
