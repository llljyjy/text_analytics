Gifted by Dermalogical for sampling. The Daily Microfoliant .This something I will be adding to my routine! The fine powder is extremely easy to use. You just add about a 1/2 of a teaspoon into wet hands, rub gently then rinse. Within a few days youâ€™ll see a difference. I did have some stinging when using a toner after but that stopped on day 4. I used this at night along with my regular routine. I had no breakouts or irritation.  If you do have some mild irritation I would start off every other day or every 3rd day. There is a slight chemical smell to the to the powder paste but not too harsh. This helped reduce pore size, bumpiness, and black heads. It really did help smooth out my skin quickly. The Microfoliant does contains Salicylic Acid and Papaya Enzymes. Both ingredients are know to help smooth skin and clear clogged pores. It also contains Phytic Acid from Rice Bran witch helps to brighten dull skin. This claims to smooth and brighten in 7 days. For me that was accurate! Love this!
