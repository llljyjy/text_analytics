This dynamic skin retinol serum has been amazing for my skin! I have been using it for a week now and my skin has been loving it. The retinol is gentle and hydrating, I use it nightly, even on my dry winter skin. My pores are already appearing less noticeable and my dark spots are fading! I canâ€™t wait to see my skin after longer use! I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica - Sephora. nan
