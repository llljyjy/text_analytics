Excellent face cream! This is a bit on the thick side bit it’s exactly what my skin needs during winter, I use it primarily at night and it seems to help my face look and feel hydrated and smooth. Not too sure about the brightening claims, also there isn’t a lot of product I’m the jar for the price in my opinion. Very hydrating!
