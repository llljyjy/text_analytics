The Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream is literally that… Magic! It is incredibly hydrating while leaving my skin smooth and prepped for makeup. My foundation applies flawlessly over it! I love how it brightens and ‘wakes’ up my skin as well— my skin immediately looks better. It is pricey but I do highly recommend if you are looking for a good, hydrating moisturizer that pairs well with makeup. Smooths & hydrates!
