First of all, can I just say that Charlotte Tillbury just gets me. This cream is amazing. The packaging is the cutest. Itâ€™s like your basically giving yourself a present. I have dry skin and fine lines. I have to say, I was quite impressed with the way it minimized the fine lines around my mouth. My makeup looked very smooth and overall just gave me a hydrated, dewy, luminous look. The cream itself is not heavy or oily and absorbs quickly. And it is has a light scent which does not aggravate my allergies. I love this Magic Cream and would definitely recommend it. Charlotte Tillbury just gets me!!!
