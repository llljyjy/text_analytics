It has my favorite ingredient, niacinamide (2nd on the ingredient list!), which you know this has higher potency on it. With that, my skin feels incredibly smooth and plump every morning. Skin tone is more even. I feel my skin is hydrated instantly. I would say this is all-around everyday serum if you’re not sure what serum to get. I was skeptical about the consistency at first. It’s a thick white milky liquid but turns out it sinks into my skin perfectly. It doesn’t feel like you have a layer on thing on your face. Smell-wise, it’s quite natural like kinda herbal smell. I would recommend to others if they don’t mind the price point. Feel incredibly smooth and fast absorption
