I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest opinion. A few months back I received the moisturizer from this line, and to say I was unimpressed is an understatement. It was a heavy, greasy, slippery mess. The rose scent was so strong it was nauseating. So when I received this my hopes were not high. But I have been pleasantly surprised! This serum is so good. The smell is enough that you can smell rose, but not so strong that it’s overpowering. It truly is “magic” it absorbs into the skin so quickly your almost think you didn’t put it on. But rest assured, when you feel how soft, supple, and glowing your face is afterwards, you’ll know you did. I’ve been using it daily, sometimes 2x day for about a month and have noticed it has really helped keep my dry under eye area more moisturized and helped dull down my redness. I will probably buy another bottle when this one runs out bc I like it that much. I took off one star, only bc of the $90/ounce price tag. That is very steep for a lot of people but it is a good product. Beautiful glowy skin
