I wanted to love this, based on the reviews and hype.  It feels luxurious and moisturizing.  The packaging is beautiful.  However, even for my aging skin I find that it makes me oily at the end of the day.  Also, since it doesn’t contain sunscreen, I’m finding myself at odds between using this, or sunscreen or both.  I don’t need another step in the mornings. I do, however, feel that it makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated and is a good primer for makeup.  It’s not the best choice for a long day.If your skin is super dry, this might be a great choice for a primer.My skin feels sort of oily and dirty after a long day of wear.  I am almost 50 and have very “normal” skin.Overall, it’s just okay.  I doubt I will purchase again due to the high price tag.  But I’m glad I tried it. I think I expected a miracle or “magic”!  LOL Just okay… It’s not that magical.
