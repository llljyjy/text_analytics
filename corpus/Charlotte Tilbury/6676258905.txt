This is my first Charlotte Tilbury product so I had very high expectations and this moisturizer didn’t disappoint. I loved how my skin and neck felt so smooth and plump after only one use. I have oily skin so I usually buy gel moisturizers instead of cream but this one didn’t felt heavy or greasy on my skin also it didn’t cause me any breakouts. I absolutely loved the packaging and that is refillable therefore less waste. I would definitely add this moisturizer to my beauty routine. 100% recommended specially for dry skin types. Luxurious moisturizer
