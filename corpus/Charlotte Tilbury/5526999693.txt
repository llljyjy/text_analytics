I really like this serum! It was a really nice sized bottle with an easy to use applicator, and with just a little bit, it left my skin really hydrated. A lot of serums similar to this leave a heavy oily feeling, but this one did not. Iâ€™m not sure I really see a difference in any fine lines or wrinkles but I do like how it makes my skin feel, similar to how it feels after a really great facial!  I would definitely recommend this to others and look forward to continuing to use and see additional results! Great Feeling Serum!
