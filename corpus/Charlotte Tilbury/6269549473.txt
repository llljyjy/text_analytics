I now understand why Charlotte Tilbury called this moisturizer “The Magic” — there is truly no other name so fitting. From the very first application, I was hooked for life. The cream is thick and buttery, but comes out delicately & applies smooth & evenly. Definite moisture, but not oily. It appears to actually blur the texture of my skin, making it appear smoother than prior to use. Cannot recommend this moisturizer enough! hooked for life
