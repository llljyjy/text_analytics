I used this eye cream morning and night for about 3 weeks and it definitely made a difference. I like this product more for the cooling feeling it provides, it feels amazing after waking up early. As a college student who wakes up early every morning and stays up late, i have prominent dark circles under my eyes. This didnâ€™t completely get rid of my dark circles but it did make a huge difference in giving me brighter under eyes. Overall I am a big fan and will continue to use! nan
