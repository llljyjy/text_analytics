I received the Charlotte Tilbury magic cream complementary from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review. This is an AMAZING moisturizer that feels like a heavy cream but goes on so smooth and absorbs completely into the skin  leaving you hydrated but not greasy! The texture of my skin has improved drastically in only a week using this morning and night. I have taken extremely good care of my skin over the years so to notice an improvement says something to me! Even my makeup lays down more beautifully and I’ve had less issue with my pores being so visible and have recently been able to skip primer entirely!  The opportunity to try this has made me a customer for life, it’s that good! It has a faint almost light floral scent to me but doesn’t bother me at all and absorbs very quickly so I’m not stuck waiting on it to absorb to continue with makeup etc which I love as I thought from the initial density this was going to be a night cream for me since it seemed “heavy” scooping from the jar. A little goes a long way which means even at the price point this will last quite awhile! The price tag initially seems steep but what is in this jar is absolutely worth every penny! I would highly recommend this to any and everyone as it has done so much to improve my skin texture and even make the process of applying foundation easier and look so much better! I wouldn’t change a thing about this and Charlotte you have a customer for life now! Picture shows the moisturizer after it is immediately applied on my right hand! Customer for life!!
