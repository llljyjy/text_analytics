This product is magic! I’ve been using it for years and I keep repurchasing it. It’s thick in texture but it absorbs into your skin like a dream, leaving your face feeling buttery soft. It never leaves you looking greasy and instead gives you a “kit from within” appearance. I call it my “facial in a jar”. The smell can be a bit strong if you aren’t used to it. So if you are sensitive to fragrance, this might not be for you, but the scent doesn’t linger for too long. I use this every morning before my makeup and it keeps me feeling hydrated all day Simply magical
