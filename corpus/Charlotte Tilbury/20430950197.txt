I’m a BIG fan of Charlotte Tilbury makeup, so I was really excited to use this cream. This is the one! Immediately hydrates my skin and gives it a glow. It doesn’t leave my skin feeling sticky, and absorbs really well. I know I’ll be using this before applying my makeup and during my nighttime routine. A staple for sure -- Charlotte Tilbury did it again! nan
