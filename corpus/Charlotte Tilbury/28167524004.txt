This is a very nice cream moisturizer by Charlotte Tilbury. The packaging is sophisticated and feels substantial. The moisturizer smells like a rose garden â€” if you like rose scents, you will love it. The moisturizer has a heavy cream texture that is great for someone looking for deep, overnight moisture for a ready-to-go face in the morning. nice!
