I have changed my mind on my facial cream. I’ve always used olay but after trying this moisturizer theres no debating what I’ll be using from here on out. It made my face feel incredible. I’ve notice significant changes to my skin. It’s brighter, softer and the lines are fading. I’m so pleased I tried it. The price is a little hefty... but for the outcome it is well beyond worth it. You'll rethink your whole facial routine
