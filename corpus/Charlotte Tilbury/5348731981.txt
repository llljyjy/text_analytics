I was so excited to get to try out Charlotte’s Magic Serum Crystal Elixir, but I really had mixed feelings about it. I totally loved the luxurious packaging and the entire bottle was absolutely gorgeous. It’s definitely a skincare product that you’ll want to show off on your vanity. The product itself was easy to apply and I usually used about 3-4 drops per application. I could instantly notice a difference in my skins appearance regarding hydration! Areas of my face that looked dry were suddenly brought back to life with moisture and a subtle glow. It didn’t make my face feel sticky or greasy and the formula was lightweight as well. My big issue with this serum, and the reason I didn’t love it, was the very strong perfum-like scent. I’m not normally bothered by scented skincare, but this was too much, even for me. I don’t think I’d buy this again, just because of the fragrance. Good serum, but heavily fragranced
