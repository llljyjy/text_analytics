Little luxury in a bottle. I was skeptical about all the promises the magic cream claims to accomplish but boy was I wrong! I’ve used it both at night and during the day and it just seeps into the skin beautifully. After nighttime application, I woke up to glowing skin soft as a baby’s bum. For daytime application it smoothed over all my fine lines and textural imperfections to create a clean base for concealer and foundation. My makeup has never looked more flawless! 10/10 recommend this magic cream! Little luxury, big victories!
