First I would like to point out how luxurious and elegant the container this product comes in is.  I love how pretty it is sitting on the bathroom counter.   The cream is thick but not over bearingly thick.  It goes on very smooth and does leave a little after grease once dried.  You definitely notice a difference in your skin after using just a few times.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a great moisturizing cream to their routine. Oh Itâ€™s Magic
