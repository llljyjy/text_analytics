Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream Moisturizer: After trying this moisturizer for 7 days I’ve got some thoughts! Immediate descriptors for this product are THICK, FLORAL, and LUXURIOUS (just like me *wink*). The “thick” isn’t heavy but it does leave a layer on the skin when you apply it, as opposed to a more immediate soak like some lightweight moisturizers. As a person with combination skin (very oily T zone and dry everywhere else) I was nervous about this causing a breakout but in 7 days it did not so that’s good! I definitely noticed a more silky, plump feel to my face after applying it before bed. In the mornings I felt it set up my face as a nice base for my makeup for the day. Now for the “floral”, the scent of this is definitely noticeable. It is softly floral with a bit of fresh cleanliness, not over powering but definitely a scented product. Lastly, the “luxury”.. this moisturizer truly has a lush and densely silky texture when you apply it to your face. A little goes a long way which means the jar will last you for quite some time! Overall, I’d recommend this if you enjoy/need a thicker moisturizer for dry or lack luster areas of your face/neck AND you like floral scented skincare! Thick, floral, luxurious- in all the right ways!
