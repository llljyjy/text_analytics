LOVE ITI Didn’t notice any scent which was nice. Feels very hydrating, nice consistency didn’t dry down completely unlike the Clinique eye cream which just disappears. I have been using this product every day and night for the last week and at first it did make my eyes sting but I think I put it to close to the outer corner of my eye. I have been more careful not to use it to close and haven’t noticed anything since so maybe just be careful if you have sensitive skin. I haven’t noticed anything drastic but my under eyes do definitely look brighter.And the Packaging is beautiful, will definitely be re-purchasing when this runs out. Thanks influenster Amazing
