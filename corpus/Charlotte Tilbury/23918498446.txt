Loving this serum. Itâ€™s given my skin an even, smooth appearance. When applied, it gives my skin a lovely glow and long lasting hydration without making it greasy. It is very light and fast absorbing and layers well under my moisturizer. It feels a bit sticky when first applied but absorbs quickly. The serum appears milky in the glass but becomes transparent when applied. It also has a lovely scent with hints of lavender. A little goes a long way with this serum! nan
