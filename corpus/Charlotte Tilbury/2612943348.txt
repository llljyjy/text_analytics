I received Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I had really high hopes for this cream, but I don’t think it lives up to the hype for me. It’s beautifully packaged and looks luxurious. However it made my skin feel and look greasy. It’s too heavy for day time use for me. nan
