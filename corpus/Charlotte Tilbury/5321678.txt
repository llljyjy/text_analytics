Received Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Serum Crystal Elixir in exchange for my honest review from @Influester. According to the description, this serum is “Inspired by holistic wellbeing and the healing frequency of light and energy Charlotte’s Magic Serum Crystal Elixir is MAGICALLY infused with a crystal complex of moonstone, ruby, rose quartz, crystal quartz and amethyst.” Now, I’m all for holistic & crystal healing but not quite sold on these properties for skincare. Don’t get me wrong, the serum definitely feels good on the skin & after a recent trip to the beach, I used it under the Tilbury Magic Cream & it left my skin soft, supple & very moisturized. With and without makeup, my skin is noticeably smoother, tighter & positively glowing. As with the last Tillbury product, the serum has an INTENSE rose scent. NOT my favourite & the packaging (while some call it “elegant” “old Hollywood” &/or “retro”) just seems heavy & dated to me. Very reminiscent of Estee Lauder (which I will forever associate with my Aba (Grandmother) & Tias (Great Aunts)) and not something I want to display on my counter. With so many skincare lines on the market nowadays, although it is a nice product, the smell & packaging are not my vibe so will probably not be purchasing once it runs out. Nice but Magic?
