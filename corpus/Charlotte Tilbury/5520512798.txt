I have been a product junkie for awhile. I have also been a makeup artist for almost 25 years. This serum is excellent. The packaging is beautiful and the product feels silky smooth. I have been using just a few drops in the morning under my moisturizer for a couple months now and I can tell a difference especially in my jaw line. I am 50 years old and am noticing some loss of firmness around my mouth and jaw line. This serum has helped. I feel like my skin is firmer, smoother, and more even. I would highly recommend this serum to anyone looking for a serum. I was very fortunate to receive this serum to test in exchange for my honest review. Thank you nan
