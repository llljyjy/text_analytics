I was excited to try the Charlotte Tillbury magic cream when I received it complimentary from Influenster. I’m not sure it lives up to its name. There was no magic. It’s a nice thick cream. Application is easy, it absorbs well into the skin and leaves my skin feeling soft the next day. There is a slight floral scent that isn’t overpowering and quickly dissipates. Overall it’s a good cream but it’s certainly not “magic”. I wouldn’t pay the retail price for this. Where’s the magic?
