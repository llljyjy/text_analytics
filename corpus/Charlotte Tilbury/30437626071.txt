I was so excited to receive this in the mail from Influenster,  Iâ€™ve heard such good things! My first thought was the smell whoa kind of overwhelming scent of rose but after applying it did make my skin super hydrated felt soft and moisturized I do like it but too much is definitely a no if you like the smell of roses I would recommend! nan
