Somehow the travel size seems like a totally different moisturizer than the full size. I don’t know why, but it does. The travel size (I’ve bought 3, all from different stores!!) is waxy, pills with other products and doesn’t sink in at all, not to mention the jar comes half empty to begin with. The *full size* on the other hand is a medium weight cream that plays well with other products, spreads nicely and feels good. It’s still not magic for me, but it’s waaaay better than the travel size for whatever reason. I’m so confused by this... Travel size is different than full size
