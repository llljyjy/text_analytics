Hmm, I don’t know how I feel. I don’t think this project is anything extraordinary or different. It is not a bad moisturizer, and it feels nice on the skin. It’s lightweight and easy to wear, but does not feel special. I have seen no significant improvements in my skin, especially for this being an expensive product. It makes skin look nice but didn’t leave it feeling super hydrated. Meh?
