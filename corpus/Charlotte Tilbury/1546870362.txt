This moisturizer has a balmy texture and it glides over the skin effortlessly. It instantly hydrates and smooths the skin m, making it perfect for makeup application. I find my makeup applies smoother, evenly, and adheres really well when I use this moisturizer underneath. I have dry skin and I often don’t find moisturizer that work well for both hydrating and priming the skin but this one is perfect! It has just enough emollience to hydrate the skin but doesn’t leave the skin feeling greasy or heavy. It has a lightweight texture that feels more like a primer but it contains skincare ingredients! I’m very impressed with this moisturizer and I highly recommend it! Hydrating and Perfect Primer
