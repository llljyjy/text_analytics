I was given this item from influenster & Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for an honest review. My skin did get a little irritated at first. The cream is so thick.. I actually started to use less of the product as I got more used to it.. I used way too much at first. A little goes along way. It absorbed into my skin fairly quickly as well. It has a light powdery floral scent.. which was probably my only real negative. I wish it were unscented. It smells “expensive”.. I love the packaging, it is really glam. It’s so pretty I’m gonna have to leave it on my vanity even when it’s used up. I love how there’s a refill option available. Yesssssir!
