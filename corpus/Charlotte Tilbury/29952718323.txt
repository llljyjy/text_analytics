Love love the packaging first of all! It smells very natural so I can tell the ingredients are clean. It glides perfectly on my skin and is easily absorbed. It’s the perfect base for my make up and the cream after all my morning serums. It’s a great product and I can see what all the hype is about! Seriously hydrating!
