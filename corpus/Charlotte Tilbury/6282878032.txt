I got this for free in exchange for my honest opinion. The packaging is absolutely perfect. Beautiful, it reminds me of those old school creams women would keep on thier vanities back in the 30s and 40s. The packaging is very heavy and solid and well-made. As for the product itself it was very nice smooth creamy and did a good job of moisturizing my face without making it greasy. I do like the very light scent. I feel that youâ€™re mostly paying for the name and the packaging. To me it was just like any other moisturizer. Beautiful bottle; ok formula
