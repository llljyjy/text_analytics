I really do love this moisturizer. I’m always apprehensive to try a new skincare product forfear it won’t agree with my skin. This one gave me no problems, provided excellent hydration, felt amazing, and looked beautiful under makeup. I do wish the fragrance was a bit lighter. Otherwise it’s a win! So nice!
