It’s ok, I don’t know if it’s worth the price? I would definitely say that it’s expensive. I have not seen anything yet that would make me want to pay $100 for this cream. I’m not a particularly big fan of the scent. It doesn’t smell bad , just not high end. I think that with long term use it could improve my skin but I didn’t notice any dramatic instant results. The Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream gets rave reviews however I just didn’t think it lived up to the hype for me. Ok
