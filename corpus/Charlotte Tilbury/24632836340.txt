I’ve been using Charlotte Tilbury’s magic cream for a week now and I’ve been very impressed with the results.  My face is no longer dry and feels/looks tighter.  In fact, on first use, within 5 mins, I noticed that the wrinkles between my eyes had disappeared.  Another aspect of the cream that I liked is the fact that it doesn’t feel greasy.  Not even when first applied.  At first, the scent can seem a bit strong, but I found that by the time I had messaged it into my face, I barely noticed it anymore. Finally, I was a little concerned because it has an illuminating look when first applied, however, it disappeared the more I rubbed in the cream.  So if you’re looking for a great moisturizer that will give you a firmer look and magically make the fine lines disappear then this is the cream for you.#complimentary #magicskin #magiccream @Influenster @charlottetilbury Abracadabra..fine lines..gone.
