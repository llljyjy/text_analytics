I received CT Magic Cream from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I had really high hopes for this cream, but I don’t think it lives up to the hype. It made my skin feel moisturized, but also left a “powdery” feel to my skin which I didn’t like. It’s nice and light though, and doesn’t leave a greasy residue. I just can’t justify spending this kind of money on a cream that’s just okay. Not for Me
