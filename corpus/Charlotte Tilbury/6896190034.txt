This magic cream by Charlotte Tillbury keeps coming up in my tiktok and Instagram feed. I was so thrilled to finally try it . The packaging looks elegant but houses very little product. Thankfully a little goes a long way. The magic cream has a faint rose scent that I love. The texture of this cream is dreamy. It feels so silky smooth and melts into my skin so easily. I instantly notice my skin looking radiant and hydrated . It also pairs well with makeup. I love it so much that i got one for my bestie as well. Truly magical
