Charlotte Tilbury Magic Serum Crystal Elixir is a great new addition to my skincare routine! It absorbs well and leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated. It’s nice to wear under makeup and doesn’t appear to clog my pores. If I could change one thing it would be the scent — a lighter scent would have been better in my opinion. Overall, it’s a great serum I will continue to use in the future. Nice serum!
