I am honestly blown away by this product. The packaging itself is breath taking. It is a soft baby pink either subtle gold lettering. You open it up in such a unique way kind of like a present. Inside you reveal this most beautiful reusable package. The product itself is a thick cream with a soft buttery feel loaded with moisture. This formula will flood your skin with moisture while diminishing the look of fine lines. First use and my skin felt impeccable and my makeup has never looked so good. I have been using this product for 5 days now and I have noticed a huge transformation. My skin is soft, plump, my complexion Iâ€™d glowing, and my fine lines are starting to disappear. This is the perfect product to use alone or before makeup. I highly recommend splurging and getting this product. I have found my new forever moisturizer. I was hooked after my first use. Truly mind-blowing
