I’ve tried many eye creams, but this one is definitely my favorite. I haven’t been using it long, but i can already tell that it will be the one I stick with.  I love the way it makes my skin feel and it doesn’t irritate my umder eye area like some other creams. I am so excited about this brand and can’t wait to try other items from them. I’ve also been using the Glow Toner....amazing!! Amazing!!!!
