I received this complimentary from Influenster to test, and I must say I’m a little disappointed. My skin didn’t have any noticeable improvements after replacing my typical daily serum with this for a few weeks. In fact, I got more spots and pimples than usual while using this. Another thing I didn’t love is that it has a very strong, synthetic scent that lingered for quite a while, even after it sunk in. What I did like was the way it applied. The texture is light and smooth, sinks in quickly, and doesn’t leave my skin feeling tacky. The dropper also feels great quality, and overall I did think my skin looked relatively glowy after use. However, I wouldn’t buy this again, especially at this price point. nan
