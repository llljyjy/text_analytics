I wasn’t super impressed, I have very dry skin and live in a dry climate. The bottle is beautiful, the dropper works well, but the product was not for me. I wasn’t a huge fan of the scent though I can’t quite describe what it smells like. It didn’t feel very thick, which is what I look for in my daily serum. I exclusively used this for about a month and I don’t think I saw a different, I certainly didn’t feel a difference. Not for me
