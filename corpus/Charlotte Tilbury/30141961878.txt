Overall it’s ok eye cream. I used is regularly for a few weeks and had no significant results. I have been using a retinol prior to this and that could be why I didn’t see a difference. It felt nice on my skin and absorbs great but thats about it. I used it at night under my creams. I don’t see myself purchasing this in the future. No significant results.
