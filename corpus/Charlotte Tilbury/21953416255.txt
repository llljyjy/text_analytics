Although I don’t have dark bags under my eyes, I did find this product brightened them and gave a health glossy look. I only noticed a difference when I used it, so not sure on the longevity of the product. The product goes a very long way, you only need a dab of cream so it’s pricey but worth it as you don’t need much. I got this as a free sample but would purchase it. nan
