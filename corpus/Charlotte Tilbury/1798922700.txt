I was skeptical of this at first but after using for a few weeks, Iâ€™ve honestly been amazed. I love how soft the cream feels on my face without being oily. It also seems to stay in place throughout the day without pilling, which is great. My face feels much more hydrated than normal as a result! Love this stuff!
