The magic cream is rich and plumping to use mornings and nights. It’s not too thick so it’s perfect base for the make up and makes my skin looks amazing without any dry patches on my face. I love this cream because my skin is on the drier side and my skin feels very moisturized and nourished. This cream is full of good ingredients and vitamins, which are perfect to keep the skin looking amazing. I’d definitely recommend it to everyone. Rich but not too thick
