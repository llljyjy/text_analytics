This is the first Charlotte Tillbury product I’ve gotten to use and the hype did not disappoint. I love how soft and glowy it made my skin look. It wasn’t heavy like other creams. However, the fragrance is a little strong, but nothing overbearing! I’m not sure if I’d purchase this on my own volition due to the price but I do love it! nan
