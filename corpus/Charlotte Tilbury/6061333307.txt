I thought the serum felt nice on the skin and absorbed quickly. I used the serum and flawless primer together and they did not disrupt my makeup application. The serum claims to reduce wrinkles, tighten and firm skin, and refine pores. I didn’t notice too much of a difference after using it for a few weeks. HOWEVER, I do have a regular skin care routine that targets some of the same claims. So this serum might work as claimed on someone who doesn’t regularly use wrinkle reducing/firming products. I think the price is a bit high as well. I do enjoy using this serum, but I don’t think I would repurchase at full price. nan
