I received this product from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review. I love the gorgeous packaging which is on brand as usual. I have been using this for two weeks now and I notice it really does make a difference with my fine lines. I love the added retinol and I wake up with nice under eyes, even though I have genetic dark under eyes, I loved this cream! Also I have noticed my under eye concealer is going on a lot better! Nice silky eye cream
