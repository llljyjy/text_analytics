This moisturizer comes with a hefty price tag so naturally I was excited to get it complimentary in my voxbox however I’m not that impressed. Its a nice thick cream that absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave a sticky or greasy feel behind which is something I usually look for in a moisturizer due to my oily skin but for the price if I’m being honest, there’s other creams out there that I’ve used that are equally as good without the price tag.I love that it has Hyaluronic acid in it as do most of my moisturizers but I can’t say it does what it says to reduce lines/wrinkles - I’ve only used it for about a month and I haven’t seen much change in my skin. nan
