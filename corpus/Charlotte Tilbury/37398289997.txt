This cream is great. I have dark circles under my eyes and quite a bit of puffiness. I found that after using this cream at night daily, the dark circles actually did lighten up, and the puffiness went down, which is amazing. I did have a little irritation in my eyes the first few days, despite the fact that I was not putting it close to my eyeballs. But after the first few days, the irritation was gone and you could see the results slowly. The cream is nice and soft and you only need a tiny bit, since it spreads pretty nicely. nan
