I received this product for free from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review of the product. I loved the feel of the Magic Eye Rescue Cream with Retinol and was very pleased with the results. I am 53 years old and have combination skin. I used this product for several weeks every morning and every evening. The cream was very soothing feeling and made the area around my eyes feel more refreshed as soon as I put it on. I have noticed that under my eyes appear to be less puffy and the wrinkles seemed to have faded some. I look forward to seeing how much of an improvement this cream makes. I will definitely continue using this product and recommend it to others. Magic Cream to the Rescue
