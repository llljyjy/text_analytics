I have been dying to try this product and now I can’t wait to try more of the Charlotte Tilbury products. I love how thick this cream is and it feels amazing on. I’m not a huge fan of the smell it has a strong rose smell not unbearable but I would love it more if it was lightly scented. I have sensitive skin and this cream does not cause any irritation. Amazing cream but don’t care for the smell
