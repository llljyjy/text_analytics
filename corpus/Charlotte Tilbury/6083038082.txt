My skin felt so moisturized and dewy after using this. A little goes a long way with this magic cream. It sits well and beautiful under the makeup. This is a perfect cream for people with normal to dry skin since it leaves your skin a very dewy finish. If you have an oily skin, I would only apply this to the area that need extra hydration, and avoid the T-Zone. Overall it is a beautiful moisturizing cream! Beautiful under makeup
