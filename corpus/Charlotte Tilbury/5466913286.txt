So I got this for free from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury. My only complaint about this was that my skin is extremely sensitive and it burned a little bit, but otherwise it seemed to do what it’s supposed to. I don’t know as I would buy it again for the price, but it was really nice to try out. I have a bunch of their other products and really love them. Not bad
