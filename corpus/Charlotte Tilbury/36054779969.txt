Instant moisturized skin! I tested it on the back of my hand, seeing instant results I applied it to my face and neck. I used the product for a week. To give it a fair review. My skin feels soft and looks hydrated. It goes on smoothly without any leftover residue or tacky feelings.  My only issue is the rose scent, I couldnâ€™t get past it. Total hydration! Instant Hydration!
