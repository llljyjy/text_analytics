I absolutely love this moisturizer! A really nice texture, doesn’t leave skin feeling oily, and absorbs into the skin really well. I have combination/oily skin and it’s hard for me to find a moisturizer that doesn’t feel too heavy but also hydrates my skin enough so it feels balanced when I wake up in the morning and this does just that! nan
