I’ve wanted to try this for so long and I’m so happy that I finally did! This moisturizer is quite thick and is perfect for my dry skin! It does have a bit of a scent, but it does fade away quickly. A little bit of this cream goes a long way! My skin looks luminous after I use it and feels so hydrated all day long! It also wears beautifully under makeup and helps foundation last longer. Dreamy for dry skin!
