I received this product for free from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review. This is a good moisturizer. It did plump my skin slightly. It’s heavily scented, which didn’t bother me. It is a thicker cream and takes about an average amount to apply. I’ll continue to use mine but probably wouldn’t repurchase, the price is a little steep. But I would recommend it. The packaging is absolutely beautiful though. The jar is made from sturdy glass. Decent moisturizer
