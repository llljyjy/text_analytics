I definitely understand the hype behind this cream. The packaging alone seems incredibly luxurious and heavy, which I appreciate especially with this price tag. The cream itself is thick and hydrating, does very well under makeup and doesnâ€™t leave me oily. Definitely pleased with its performance. nan
