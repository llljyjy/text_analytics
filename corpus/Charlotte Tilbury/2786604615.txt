PRO: - lovely unique packaging. makes for a great gift. - comfortable scent, smells like roses but not too strong - hydrating CONS:- it’s a nice lightweight moisturizer but I don’t like the marketing behind it that is required to justify the price - overpriced for such a tiny jar- made my skin itch I can see that this goes the La Mer marketing route and is made for a specific kind of clientele. Nothing wrong with that but it’s still just a lightweight moisturizer. In a very pretty packaging. nan
