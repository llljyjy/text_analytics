The Charlotte Tilbury Magic cream has to totally change my skin.I use it every evening in my skin care routine and the glow and hydration it gives me just can’t compare to anything else. I feel as though my skin has totally resurfaced, it feels so soft and smooth! I’ve also noticed that when I use the magic cream before I apply makeup, my makeup almost melts into my skin. Instead of what feel like makeup sitting on top of a primer, my makeup has a super skin like finish. My forever go-to moisturizer!!!
