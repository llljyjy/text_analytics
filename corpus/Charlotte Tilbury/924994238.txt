This was a nice product but due to some of the ingredients it was not for me. I liked the texture but I did not like the scent. It went on smoothly and kept my under eye moisturized, but I do not feel that I saw any difference in the wrinkles under my eyes. The packaging was ascetically pleasing to the eye!  I appreciate influencer for giving me the opportunity to review this product. nice cream not for me
