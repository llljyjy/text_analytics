I thought I liked this serum. I’ve had it for several months and at first used it quite consistently.  However, like several reviews that I’ve read, I have a problem with this serum pilling up and sloughing off after using with some of my favorite serums and creams.  This has also happened after using it when applying some foundations. The pilling is so annoying; I have to wash off my face and start the skincare of makeup routine over. If I liked it better, I would spend more time and energy into figuring out which products it pills with. It wasn’t bad for my skin, however, it didn’t do enough to justify the trial and error in order to make this serum work. And yes, I am certain the pilling and sloughing is from this serum and not another product. I finally dumped out a half a bottle and decided to write this review to help. If you are having this problem, it may be this serum. Serum pills and sloughs off w/ some other products
