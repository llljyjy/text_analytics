I received Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream for free from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review. I will try to give a snapshot of this product, which I have been using exclusively for the past couple of weeks. Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream is a luxury moisturizer, in price-point, packaging and product feel. The packaging is elegant with a reflective gold cap and writing. The price is that of a luxury product, but comes in a variety of sizes, including refills - options not often available with similar products. * Ingredient highlight - Hyaluronic Acid, known to retain water in the skin, providing moisture and hydration for all skin types.* Important to know – this is a floral scented product. Plumeria is listed in ingredients and while I personally did not find the scent problematic, it is something to consider for those who are sensitive and/or allergic to scents in products.* Product performance – Magic Cream has a beautiful soft feel. It is a lightweight cream that does not feel heavy or greasy on the skin. I have extremely dry skin which absorbed the product nicely without any residue. I also have mature skin, with lines that are considerably beyond “surface level” – I can’t say that this product reduced them significantly, but the overall hydration it provided made my skin look smooth and glowing. It is also a great daily moisturizer to use under makeup because it completely absorbs and does not stay tacky on the skin. * Final thoughts – I really liked this product in terms of delivering on its promise to provide glowing, makeup-ready skin. Future purchase? Not sure yet. It looks lovely, feels luxurious and goes a long way (a very small amount is all you need) – all ‘pros’.  It is pricey and I’m not convinced that there aren’t other, less expensive moisturizers available to give similar results. I will continue to use and look for the ‘magic’ in the Magic Cream. If I see even a tiny bit of magic, I’m in!! 10/10 Luxe
