Can I just say - wow, I was not expecting this! I use a high-end brand, but this does top it. It’s so thick and creamy. It is just luxury in a jar. It has that lovely light rose scent that reminds me of all the products my nana had from Italy. I double moisturize on Sundays and this was just heaven. I am buying the eye cream to see if it matches the greatness, but I really couldn’t recommend this enough. It is worth every penny! Dry skin? Aging? Fine lines? No problem!
