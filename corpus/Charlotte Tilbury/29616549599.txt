#complimentary #magicskin #magiccream @Influenster @charlottetilbury I really love the smell of this cream it smells like a fresh plucked rose. It did leave my skin feeling plump and hydrating but also a little to oily. I had to keep blotting my nose I feel like a little of this goes a really long way and it’s a cream that could typically last awhile. I’m looking forward to trying it on a more long term basis to see how my skin adjusts. Smells like a fresh plucked rose
