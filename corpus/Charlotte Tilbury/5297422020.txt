I received this with points and really had no expectations of what it was supposed to do other than “magic”. I am shook. The first night I used this I woke up with 4 new blemishes and I don’t usually breakout. I continued using for a week because all skincare needs a fair chance and let me say this is certainly not magic! Definitely go for a tester or sample prior to purchasing the full size because based on the reviews (which I wish I had read before a face full of blemishes to heal) this product seems very finicky and not for everyone. The texture is odd as well and doesn’t work great under makeup so it may also work best at night for those that want to try. nan
