I received this product from @influenster and @charlottetilbury  in exchange for my honest review. I must say formula-wise, it absorbs well on the skin without feeling tacky or heavy, and it’s a very light consistency. I just wasn’t a fan of the perfume-like scent it has. A little too strong in my opinion. Not my favorite
