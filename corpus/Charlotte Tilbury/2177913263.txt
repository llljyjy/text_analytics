Y’all. This stuff is the truth. I wish it wasn’t because when I need to replace this bottle that’s going to be an expensive purchase, but unfortunately this stuff really is magic. It’s moisturizing without feeling greasy, it makes my skin feel softer and renewed without irritation, and my skin actually looks better now without makeup on than it does with. As someone who normally does not leave the house without makeup, this is saying a lot. If you’re on the fence I would definitely recommend purchasing it. I'm a convert
