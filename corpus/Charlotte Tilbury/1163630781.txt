I have been using this for about a month and I love it. It’s perfect for my combination skin. Sometimes eye cream can be greasy on me, but this sinks in and doesn’t crease my makeup. I love the bouncy texture and barely have to use any. It immediately plumps my hollows and it is noticeably diminishing fine lines. I lobe the beautiful jar, it’s pretty enough to display and I plam on refilling it whem I run out, though that may be a while! It really doesn’t take much! Perfect For Me!
