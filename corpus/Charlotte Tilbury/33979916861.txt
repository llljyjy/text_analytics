I’m 41 years old and have recently been getting a crepey neck.  People think I’m in my early 30’s, but my neck has been showing my age lately.  CT night cream is so hydrating and plumping. I have very oily skin naturally so I just use this under my eyes and on my neck and décolletage.  For my neck and décolletage I first put on a serum  (I use Farmacy Filling Good) to help glide on the CT Nightcream, for it is verrrrry thick.  Honestly, the crepey-ness is 95% gone, after one week!  Yes it is very thick, but it’s extremely hydrating and leaves a moisturized ‘tacky’ feeling till you wash it off.  I even put it on during the day, just on my neck and décolletage.  Charlotte Tilbury is such a treasure to the beauty industry!  Her Magic Nightcream is the fountain of youth.   Highly recommend. Crepey Neck Fix!
