I received this product complimentary from Influenster and charlotte tillbury in exchange for my honest review. I really liked the smell, it wasnâ€™t too overpowering.  The texture was rather sticky though.  I felt like it took about of product to cover my face and neck.  I noticed my skin feels cool too touch and taut after use. It wore well under my makeup.  Not sure if purchase this again given the price,  the bottle is actually less than what you think and see at first. Decent product
