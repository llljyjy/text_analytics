Let’s start with the positives. 1. The packaging is beautiful. I love the luxurious look of this bottle. The glass and rose gold are perfection. 2. Unscented. I know a lot of people will appreciate that this product has no scent. 3. Hydration! There is so much hydration to this product.4. Easy to apply and run in  Now the conUnfortunately this product cause me to break out between the eye brows and along the chin/bottoms lip area. I’ve read of other people complaining of break outs and kind of brushed it off. I don’t usually have sensitive skin. I rarely ever get a pimple. There must be a ingredient in this product that just doesn’t work well on my skin. meh
