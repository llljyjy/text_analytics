Charlotte Tillbury lives up to it’s price and is an extremely luxurious cream, both in presentation and use! I have to say I’m a massive fan of the packaging, the unboxing feels exciting and the bottle itself is beautiful. The cream itself is very moisturizing and really does wonders to brighten and make the skin appear and feel hydrated and dewy. Definitely a great addition to my skincare routine! :-) Lives Up To Its Price!
