Lovely rich, thick creamy moisturizer gives amazing coverage and softness. It did take my skin about a week to get used to it so there was some redness the first few days(I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin) but that went away fairly quickly-and is something I am used to when switching products. I am not a big fan of the scent though. Itâ€™s almost medicinal to me. So while not my favorite-still not a bad addition to my routine. Would be better with less sensitive skin. Not sure about the scent
