This eye cream is lovely. Its lightweight, absorbs quickly and leaves my under eyes hydrated. As far as I can tell it is unscented and the packing is of course stunning like CT packaging typically is. I have extremely dry skin so I would love this even more if it was more hydrating/emoliant. I have very sensitive skin and eyes and had no sensitivity to this product will definitely keep in my collection. A great eyecream
