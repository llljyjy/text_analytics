I received this product from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for review. Originally, I planned to use this product on my face, neck, and chest, however, after the first night, I noticed an existing, mini acne had gotten larger, so, I began using it on my thigh and bottom stretch marks, and itâ€™s helped a little bit. Kind of disappointed that it clogged my facial pores in one night. Could Be Better
