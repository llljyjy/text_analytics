Before trying the Magic Cream from Charlotte Tilbury, I was convinced this had to be overhyped. Boy am I eating my words because this cream is even better than what I had heard! It’s the perfect base for makeup without that primer feeling, it feels like my skin can still breath when I’m wearing the Magic Cream. My skin looks so glowy and hydrated, and feels incredibly soft—this cream is 100% worth the hype it gets! Worth the hype
