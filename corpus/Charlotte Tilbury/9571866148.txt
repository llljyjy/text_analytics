This was a great moisturizer. It had a nice, soft scent. I was pleased with the texture, nice feel. It wasnâ€™t too heavy. I liked the fact that it had hyaluronic acid as an ingredient. It left my normally oily skin with a nice glow. After a few uses my face felt softer. I will definitely continue to use this moisturizer and recommend it highly. nan
