Charlotte’s miracle cream is exactly that, a miracle in a jar! It’s luxurious, easy to apply and feels wonderful on your skin. There’s a little instruction guide in the Box that explains how to apply it to the different areas on your face and you actually feel like you’re sculpting your face as you apply this wonderful cream. I have aging skin and I feel like at this time my skin looks the best it’s been in a long time. The cream has a wonderful soft feel to it it’s not greasy looks great under your makeup for fresh dewy look. I use it in the morning and before I go to bed. I see results and I’m loving what I see. Truly a miracle in a jar!
