I switch products a lot and would not consider myself to have sensitive skin, however, product made me break out all over my forehead and jawline. By the end of the day Iâ€™d be incredibly oily. Within a week of stopping using it my skin went back to normal. Would not recommend.  Moisturizer also has an overpowering floral scent. Causes Breakouts and Oily skin
