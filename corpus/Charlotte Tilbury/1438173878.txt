I truly hate to say how amazing this cream is because I always thought it was just hyped up by “beauty gurus“ getting commission, but this cream is amazing! I find it has a sunscreen like light scent (but it’s not SPF) that is pleasant. I use this cream in the morning as a primer underneath my makeup. Since I started doing this, my makeup wears a lot better and longer through the day. I also get tons of compliments about my glowing skin! Note: I did receive the product in exchange for an unbiased review. Woah!
