Love the packaging on this product, it feels luxurious and the dropper works well. The biggest benefit I’ve had with the magic serum is that my skin just looks healthier after applying, texture/pores are minimized and skin has a nice glow to it while also looking a bit more plumped. A little goes a long way with this product, dries down quickly. Wears well under makeup and serves as a great base for makeup application. I love that this product contains niacinamide and the vitamin c was not irritating which i sometimes have breakouts from. The only thing I’m not a huge fan of is the scent, smells like roses to me but it doesn’t linger for long. Overall would recommend! nan
