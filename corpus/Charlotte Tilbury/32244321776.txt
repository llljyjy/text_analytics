I was given a free sample from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury for my honest opinion. It came in perfect timing because my skin was becoming so dry from the transition of winter to spring and it is just packed with moisture. I absolutely love this product. Has a light rose smell that’s not over powering. The cream seams thick but it actually absorbed on skin very well without leaving it greasy. Iv’e been using it for about a month now and It even helped reduce some of my fine lines and wrinkles. It also decreased some of my dark spots. It works perfectly with my make up and she also has a serum that works great before you apply the magic cream. I’m so buying another bottle of this when I’m finish with it. Wonderful Moisturizing Cream
