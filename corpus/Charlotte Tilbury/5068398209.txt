Charlotte’s Magic Serum is the perfect name for this elixir. It works like magic. I can not say how much I loved using this for the past month. It has an eyedropper so you don’t waste any of it. It has a thin consistency but not too thin that it just drips off your face before you get a chance to rub it in, which is something I like about this product. I don’t like when the serum is too runny so this one is perfect. It absorbs into the skin with ease and really fast. It doesn’t leave my face feeling sticky. It makes my skin feel smoother but not to the point that it’s tight. It has a light perfume-type scent that isn’t bothersome and doesn’t last. I find since I started using this my pores are less noticeable and my skin has a nicer shine and overall healthy look to it. I really love the quality of this and highly recommend it, it’s a product you won’t regret using. A must have
