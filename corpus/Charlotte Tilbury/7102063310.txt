Charlotte Tilbury is synonymous with luxury for a reason and this moisturizer is no exception. I am loving how jam-packed this cream is with beneficial ingredients. The packaging is stunning and reminds me of vintage cream jars. It’s a nice thick consistency and left my skin feeling nourished, plumped, and hydrated. I loved using it as a skin prep before my makeup application. I didn’t experience any congestion issues as a result either. It’s spring/summer right now, but I imagine this would be wonderful for those dry winter months. It absorbs quickly and a little goes a LONG way. This jar will last me for quite some time, which is especially nice because this is a pricer product. Very Hydrating
