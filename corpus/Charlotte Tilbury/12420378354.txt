I’ve been using these eye cream for the past 3 weeks or so... and I really liked it. It’s very hydrating and your under eye skin remains like that for a very long while (I have very dry skin)... this works perfectly to prepare your undr eyes for makeup... it suits my skin perfectly. I also like the packaging, it’s heavy and feels luxurious. I thinks is definitely worth the money. nan
