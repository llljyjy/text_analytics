This cream is absolutely true magic. I apply in the morning, and it keeps my skin moisturized throughout the day. The redness on my skin magically disappears. I also like the light floral scent of this cream. A little goes a long way, so you can just apply a thin layer to your skin. I’m so obsessed with this cream and will continue using it. I’m so glad my skin is not sensitive to this product. Highly recommended! nan
