This serum is amazing! It’s so easy to use and makes such a difference. The formula is really nice. It isn’t super thick or too thin. It’s easy to apply, and the dropper included is great quality. The bottle looks really elegant and looks really nice on my vanity. It smells kind of floral-y but it isn’t overpowering and the smell fades quickly when the product absorbs into the skin. My skin has felt much better since I began using this product. I definitely plan to make this my new staple serum. So nice
