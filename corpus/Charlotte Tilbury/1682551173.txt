My skin has been incredibly dehydrated this winter and this magic cream really has worked its magic to keep my skin supple, hydrated, and smooth. While it’s fairly thick, it doesn’t feel heavy on my skin but it does keep my skin hydrated for a very long time. I have had issues in the past where my skin will dry out as soon as I put on my foundation, but I am not having that issue when using this moisturizer. It really does make the perfect canvas for your makeup application! Do you believe in magic?!
