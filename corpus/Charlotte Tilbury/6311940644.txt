This serum is a nice step to take when prepping for makeup application, so I’d recommend adding it to your daytime routine. It applies easily and provides a radiant finish, but does not make my oily skin seem oilier. I also have acne-prone skin and haven’t found it to exacerbate that issue for me. The price is steep for the results, however, since I don’t particularly notice an improvement in my fine lines after using for about a month. Radiant!
