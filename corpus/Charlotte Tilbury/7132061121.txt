This is a very nice moisturizer, but, for my skin, it is comparable to other less expensive moisturizers. It does leave my skin looking hydrated and plump, and i dont need a primer under foundation when using this— so in that sense its is a 2 for 1! However, the dimethicone and cyclopentasiloxane in it (which are in the majority of moisturizers) cause it to “pill”On my face if i accidentally put too much on. because of this i personally prefer silicon-free moisturizers so i can slather them on my dry skin without worrying about texture issues. I live in a cold dry climate and this moisturizer is not enough on its own for me, and i need to add a facial oil on top. (But perhaps i wont need to in the summer?) it did not irritate me at all or cause any pimples, which i am sensitive too. It has a bery pleasant light fragrance that is non-irritating. I knwo the silicons in the cream give the face a smooth texture, but i would probably bump my rating up to 5 stars if it was reformulated without them so that i could put a thicker layer on when its really dry in the winter. (I have not tried her night cream, which could be a better fit for me since my skin is so dry) Very nice, but not enough in harsh winter
