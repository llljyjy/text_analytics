I seriously canâ€™t get enough of this Magic Cream from Charlotte Tilbury. It is so incredibly smooth and silky, and skinks into the skin beautifully. It wears so well underneath your makeup, and makes for the perfect base. But the best part by far is the glow that it gives the skin. The radiance It gives it just otherworldly. It keeps skin hydrated and nourished all throughout the day, and play well with other skincare products in your routine. 10/10 recommend Beautiful, Radiant, Dewy Glow!!
