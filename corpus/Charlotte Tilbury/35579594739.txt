I don’t have bad wrinkles or dark circles, so honestly this product isn’t for me. however the texture and the feel of the actual cream is so wonderful, and I honestly love it so much that it has became a staple in my night time routine. the container it comes in is also so cute. it’s very light weight and cool when applied, it’s not sticky, and it doesn’t have a heavy scent. nan
