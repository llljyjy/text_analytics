WOW. I don’t usually write reviews, but for this, I just had to! I put this on the first time the night before being a bridesmaid to prepare my face for the next day and wow I am so impressed with how clear, bright and youthful this made my face look. I agree with other reviews that if you’re having a no make up day then this is a must have! It just makes your skin so clear, evenly toned and glowiiiing. I love it! I will be buying many, many more of these! WOWOWOW!
