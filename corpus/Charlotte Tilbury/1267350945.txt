Starting to really get into Charlotte Tilbury products, as I have mature skin and all of her products leave my skin absolutely glowing!! I’ve never had any issues with my skin and this doesn’t break me out either. As a cleansing  balm, it’s great for glowing skin. Love the smell and a little goes a long way. I use as a cleanser to take off my make up but I find it doesn’t work as well when I rinse it off. I took off one star for that reason. I use a wet towelette first as step one. I then use the balm with the towelette to take off the remaining makeup, sort of as a double cleanse. It leaves my skin more moisturized that way. I haven’t tried it as a balm or moisturizer yet. But the possibilities are endless with this product. If you’re on the fence, I’d say give it a try. Especially if you have drier skin. Glowing Cleansing Balm
