I’ve used this nightly for the last month and haven’t noticed too much of a difference to my actual skin texture or wrinkles but it feels nice on the skin and is quickly absorbed so the skin is hydrated. It does have a fairly herbaceous smell that disappeared quickly. Nice serum but I’m not sure I’ll buy again Nightly Serum
