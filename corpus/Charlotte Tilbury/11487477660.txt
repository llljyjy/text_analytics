I love the smell and the texture is sticky. If takes a little more product to cover the face and neck. The smell is not overpowering. My skin feels cool and taut after use. I love the product, but I have to point out that they have designed the bottle to be deceiving. If you look at the bottom, the bottle is a lot shorter actually and it is all plastic below. Something to note when considering the price vs value. Great serum- deceiving quantity
