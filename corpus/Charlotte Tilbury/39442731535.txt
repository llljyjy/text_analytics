I received this product for free from Influenster and brand(s) in exchange for my honest review. I have combination skin and so it is tricky to find products that work. I love the packaging and size of this product. It is not oily and has a very smooth texture. It goes on easily on the skin and does not give that whitish film most eye creams have. It does not irritate the skin and does not haves  strong fragrance. It also feels really smooth and gentle. It is very moisturizing and I immediately noticed that the skin under the eye does not feel dry anymore. It has a natural retinol complex but it is not drying like other retinol products. I have also noticed a gradually brightening of that eye area too. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone especially if you have darker skin tone. Best eye cream used yet
