I received free for testing purposes from influenster.I thought this would be very nice and do me some good but I just don’t think it’s for me. It is lightly scented & not overpowering however I did not like the scent. It is very sticky when applied but absorbs rather quickly and is no longer sticky. Another problem I had was after the first 2-3 uses, I started getting bumps and I don’t normally get them. 2 stars for trying and packaging etc looks great. I hope this works well for others but it’s not for me. Certainly not worth $80 in my opinion. Not for me
