I made sure I allowed enough time to provide an accurate review. I used this product for about 6 weeks. I must say, as a mature woman over age 50, there was a noticeable difference as it relates to my eye puffiness after using it. I also noticed a slight improvement with my under eye discoloration. Overall, I am satisfied and will continue to use. nan
