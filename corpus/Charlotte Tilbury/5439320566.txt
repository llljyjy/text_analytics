I am surprised by how much I really love this. Smooth and creamy, a little goes a long way.  Paired with an extra strength retinol that dried me out, after two nights of pairing this ad an HYA, dry spots were gone.  I was even using this as a moisturizer.  Dont notice a difference regarding their claims of Vitamin C and Niacinamide but i Really, really like it. I just wouldnâ€™t rely on this an your main skincare.  Make sure you this is an addition to your routine. Surprisingly Good
