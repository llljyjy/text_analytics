“Magic” is an understatement—this cream works miracles! This doesn’t just moisturize and plump my skin—the ingredients actually healed my skin too! I first tried this after a new cleanser caused significant peeling. I couldn’t use a moisturizer without feeling like my face was on fire. Charlotte’s Magic Cream, on the other hand, soothed my angry skin & provided the nutrients and moisture my skin desperately needed. My face was almost entirely healed overnight. I couldn’t believe my eyes! After my results, I decided to use it on my 12 year old’s chapped, cracked (hormonal) skin. We began applying a thin layer every few hours on a Friday afternoon. By Sunday morning her skin looked amazing! Neither of us have experienced any negative results despite having incredibly sensitive skin. No clogged pores, breakouts, irritation, or uncomfortable feeling. Just VERY happy skin! A little bit of Charlotte’s Magic Cream goes a long way too. This jar has been used every day by two people and is a little over 2/3 of the way full. The jar itself is simple yet elegant and heavy duty!  I also really love the fact that you can purchase refills to minimize waste.  Bottom line? Yes, it IS pricier than other facial creams, but I find it well worth the cost. It transformed my skin and my daughter’s skin. I will be purchasing a refill when this jar runs out—I never leave my house without it! If you haven’t tried this product yet, I highly recommend it! Magic Cream? More like *Miracle* Cream!
