Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream was my go-to moisturizer for the longest time. I then went on to experiment with other brands. Getting this Magic Cream reminded me of how amazing this product truly is. My skin is very dehydrated. I’m talking dry like the Sahara Desert. When applying foundation, I can see the exaggerated dry spots. I no longer have that problem thanks to this moisturizer. The Magic Cream instantly plumps, brightens, and hydrates the skin. It also leaves a radiant glow. My foundation applies so smoothly over it, and it leaves my face looking flawless. Just be sure to let the moisturizer really sink in, because if you immediately try to apply your foundation over it, it could ball up and turn into a terrible mess. It has a thick texture, but it sinks in quickly, and it’s not sticky, greasy, or heavy feeling. I do want to point out that I’ve never experienced any clogging of the pores or acne while using this product. Also, for those that are sensitive to fragrances, please be aware that this is a scented product. However, I personally don’t find the scent to be too strong or overpowering. The upgraded glass jar packaging is very luxurious looking, and I love that you can buy a refill of the cream only, so you can reuse your jar. Beautiful skin and environmentally friendly? Yes please! This product is expensive. However, I do believe it’s worth it. One jar will last you a long time as you only need the smallest amount. I’m so happy to have this fabulous product back in my life. The Magic Cream truly is a magic cream. nan
