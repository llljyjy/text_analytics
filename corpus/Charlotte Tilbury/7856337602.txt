I received these products for freefrom Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review.I have heard good reviews about Charlotte Tilbury products and luckily I received this product. I honestly loved the finish it gave my makeup. I have combination skin and it gave my face a beautiful glow without leaving it oily...it went on very quickly. It has a light aroma between roses and mint, which is not unpleasant, but it fades after a short time. Although I know that this is an expensive brand, I try not to use it for daily use, but rather as part of my makeup routine.#complimentary @Influenster I liked
