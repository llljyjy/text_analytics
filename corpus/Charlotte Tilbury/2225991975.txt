This cream is very nice. Itâ€™s a little on the thicker side which I was worried about with my oily skin type. It smells like roses/floral. I used this after is used my PMD microdermabrasion tool and it absorbed quickly and left my skin soft. Great for the fall and winter months but probably too heavy for my skin with warmer weather for a daily cream. Definitely recommend using after a harsh skin treatment tho! I did receive this complimentary from Influenster for an honest review. oily skin type
