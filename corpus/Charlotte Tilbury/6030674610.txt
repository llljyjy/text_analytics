I was so excited when my influencer Charlotte tilbury magic eye rescue. I immediately followed the directions and began to use it. I felt a tingling sensation after the first use and thought nothing of it. I continued to use it daily until day 4 when my hubs and kids asked “what’s wrong with your eyes?” Well my eyelids were super red, swollen, blistered. So after discontinued use, my eyelids begin to drastically peeling and flake for a week. So no good review here but I do love the reusable glass   container. Charlotte Tilbury Magic Eye Rescue
