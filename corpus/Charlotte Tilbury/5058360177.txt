I am absolutely in love with this cream. Initially I thought it might be too heavy for my skin (combination) but within a few days, I knew this would be a new staple. It doesnâ€™t irritate my skin or cause breakouts. My skin is plump and well moisturized and looks so much better than it has in years. My New Favorite Skin Cream
