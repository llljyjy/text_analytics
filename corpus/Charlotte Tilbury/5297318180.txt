I received this product for free from Influenster and Charlotte Tilburry in exchange for my honest review. Overall, I’ve loved using this product. I’ve been using it for 4 weeks now and have noticed several impacts. First of all, I have slightly dry under eyes and usually have issues with concealer getting patchy under my eyes. Since I’ve used this product, I know longer get patchy and my conceal sits beautifully! Although this product is pricy, a very small amount goes a long way. After 4 weeks of day & night use I still haven’t made a dent in the product.Since using this product my under eyes have been much brighter too! nan
