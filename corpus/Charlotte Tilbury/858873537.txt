I received this product as a free sample. I was excited to receive this product to try. My first impressions were that the packaging was impeccable and sustainable, with glass containers instead of plastic and recycled paper for the box. The smell of this serum is off-putting to say the least. It is strong and unappealing, especially since you are putting it on your face. I did feel like it improved the overall look and feel of my skin but due to the scent, I am not a fan and wonâ€™t continue using it. Terrible scent
