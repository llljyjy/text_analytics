Very hydrating daytime moisturizer for dry skin. CT Magic Cream quickly absorbed leaving a nice dewy smooth finish. Works very well to plump, smooth, and prep for makeup. Beautiful packaging and love that it is refillable. Had some issues with congested pores in the morning after night application. If it had SPF it would be my new “must have“ daytime moisturizer. nan
