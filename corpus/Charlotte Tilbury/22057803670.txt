I recommend this cream. I’ve noticed my skin aging, specially under my eyes. And after using this, I’ve noticed a big difference. I use it at night before bed and in the mornings for an extra moisturizing boost before applying makeup. It leaves my skin feeling very hydrated and smooth. Only reason I don’t give it 5⭐️ is because I haven’t noticed any brightening or much of a plumping effect. I’m really liking this cream so far
