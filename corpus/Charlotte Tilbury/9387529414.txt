I’m in loveeee with the Charlotte Tilbury Charlotte’s Magic Cream. It helped to plump up my skin, brightened my complexion, and reduced the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It kept my face moisturized for 24 hours without feeling heavy or greasy, which I was concerned about because it does come out of the jar a bit thick. The hyaluronic acid fights signs of aging and the vitamin C brightens my complexion, making it look refreshed and dewy. Finally, it works well under my makeup and does not cake or crease it, and it smells amazing!  I would definitely recommend this! Obsessed
