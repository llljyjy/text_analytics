The hype about this Magic Cream Moisturizer is real!! This is my first time trying a Charlotte Tilbury skincare product and my first time trying a moisturizer with hyaluronic acid in it! It is no wonder itâ€™s an award winning moisturizer!It is a very thick cream but applies easily and quick absorbing! It leaves my skin well hydrated and soft.I have been using this cream for a few weeks now, and see a noticeable difference.My skin looks and feels healthier and has a natural glow.Bonus : comes in a gorgeous jar. It is a pricey cream, but it sure is worth it!A little goes a long way... Pricey but worth every drop!
