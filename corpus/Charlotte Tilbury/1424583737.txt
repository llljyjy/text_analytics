Just started using this product and so far so good! It’s very creamy texture and goes on my skin smooth. I do feel like it leaves a slight “sticky” texture, but if your immediately applying your makeup over it the. You don’t even notice it. I also love the container it came in. It has time released retinol which is very intriguing! Hoping it gives me the results I’m looking for and helps with my wrinkles and my dark circles.Note** I received these products for free from Influenster from Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review Great Eye Cream with Retinol
