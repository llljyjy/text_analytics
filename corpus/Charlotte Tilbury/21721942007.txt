This serum is pretty on the skin but does have some essential oils in it. If you’re sensitive to fragrance or oils you should be careful. I usually use Lancôme genefique 2x a day but I used this in the morning for a few weeks and it wasn’t as moisturizing. You could probably pair this with another serum or use this as a makeup serum primer for a smooth sheen. nan
