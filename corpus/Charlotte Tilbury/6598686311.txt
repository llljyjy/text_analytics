I received these products for free from @Influenster and @CharlotteTilbury in exchange for my honest review.The Charlotte Tilbury Magic Eye Rescue Cream with Retinol is a thicker consistency that absorbs quickly and feels lightweight on the skin. For having retinol it is very hydrating and works extremely well under makeup. I didnâ€™t previously use an under eye cream and this has made a big difference in the appearance of my skin and makeup. Best eye cream I've tried!
