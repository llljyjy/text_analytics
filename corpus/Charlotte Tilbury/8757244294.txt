This cream is everything!!! The packaging and the formula is so beautiful! It contains hyaluronic acid to give your skin a plumping effect and to prep your skin for makeup! I have been trying out this moisturizer for about a month now and I’ve been loving it! It is very hydrating yet doesn’t feel too thick and heavy. Instead, it feels so silky and smooth! My face felt brighter, moisturized, and radiant instantly! I’ve only been using this during the day as I prefer a heavier moisturizer for nighttime. This moisturizer even wears very well under makeup and gives a glowy look without making me look oily, even though I have oily skin. This didn’t cause any breakouts either! Didn’t have to seem a harsh scent either, so if you are sensitive to smell, you won’t have any issues with this! Another plus to this moisturizer is that it is refillable, reducing packaging waste! The container is so stunning and looks beautiful on anyone’s vanity!!! After testing this product out, I will continue to use this! It’s now part of my daily skincare routine! The only downside to the product is the price, but I think it is worth it! Such a luxurious product! Definitely check this out if you’ve had your eye on it! Amazing Moisturizer!!!!
