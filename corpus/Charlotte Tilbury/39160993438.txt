I received this product for from influenster and Charlotte tilbury in exchange for an honest review. I have been using the Magic Eye Cream for 2 weeks . I did enjoy that the product is easy to apply , feels very hydrating under the eyes . I did see that my dark circles appear less , and it gave me a brightening effect. Now for the wrinkles being diminished , unfortunately I didn’t see that . But , I will still continue using this product daily as it is recommended to do so both AM & PM . I’m happy that it’s a refillable product so that is good for the environment I was impressed by that . Overall , I would say that if you want to try an eye cream give this one a shot . ✨Magic Eye Cream ✨
