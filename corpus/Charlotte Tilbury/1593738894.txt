When they called this serum the “magic elixir” they really weren’t kidding. I have waited to write a review for this serum because I wanted to use it for over a month on my skin and see if there was a difference. The difference was noticeable almost overnight. I have problematic skin that breaks out a lot due to easily clogged pores. After I wash my face, I apply this serum and it hydrates my face and makes it have a nice glow to it. However, the next morning when I wake up, my skin looks and feels like a million dollars. This serum has successfully eliminated ALL my breakouts and left me with perfectly clear skin, until I forget to use the serum and then break out again. It has significantly lightened some prior discoloration I had on my face as well which was amazing to see. Unfortunately I went on vacation and left my serum at home, so of course I’m breaking out again but I already can’t wait to get home and use this magic elixir again. Despite the pretty high price tag of $80 for a large sized bottle, it is 100% worth the buy. It lasts numerous months and the benefits your skin gets from it is absolutely worth the price. I honestly didn’t expect much from this elixir but this has become and absolute must have in my home now. pleasantly surprised.
