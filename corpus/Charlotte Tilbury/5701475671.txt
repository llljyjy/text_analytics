I received this product for free from Influenster & Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review. I’ve tried a few cheaper eye creams & never felt like they did anything, so I was a bit skeptical to try this. I was pleasantly surprised that this made such a noticeable difference on my skin! I have dark circles and puffiness & on the nights I use this I wake up with my skin looking more well rested! It’s a very rich cream consistency, it doesn’t immediately soak into the skin but I don’t mind since you’re applying to a small area of your face. It’s expensive but the packaging is incredible and you use such a small amount this will last a long time. I’d consider this a small luxury item, you’ll use it everyday so it’s a worthwhile spend! wake up looking well rested!!
