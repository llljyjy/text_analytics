This cream truly is magic! I had high hopes for this product, and wasn’t disappointed. I like to use only once a day because I have combination skin and due to the hydration factor, I find that my skin gets a bit greasy if I use twice. When I use this cream, my skin instantly feels rejuvenated and refreshed. I have noticed a significant difference in my complexion since implementing this product into my skincare routine. If you’re on the fence about buying this product, DON’T be. Just buy it. Just buy it!
