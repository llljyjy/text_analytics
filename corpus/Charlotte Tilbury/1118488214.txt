Thank you to Influenster for sending me the Charlotte Tilburry Magic Cream Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid in exchange for my honest review. The packaging is fancy, and the cream feels luxurious. That being said, I didn’t care for it. After applying it, it never completely absorbed into my skin and I was left with a sticky feeling. It was uncomfortable to go to bed feeling that way. In the morning my skin was very oily. I did like that it did not break out my sensitive, acne prone skin, and that my skin felt very soft after I cleansed it in the morning. While it’s gentle enough for me, it’s just too heavy for my skin. sticky
