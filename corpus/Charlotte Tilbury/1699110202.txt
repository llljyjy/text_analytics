I honestly really love this mask! Sure, it’s a fancy ice pack and I don’t believe that it lifts your face BUT IT FEELS SOOO GOOD!!! It’s a purely, luxury item and it’s bougie af but tbh it’s awesome! It really does relax my face muscles kinda like a gua aha would. It’s super unique and I’m obsessed!! Such a fun luxury item!
