This serum truly is magical, a few drops and my skin was immediately plumper and better hydrated. After a few uses, I noticed reduced redness and a brighter overall tone. The price tag is a bit hefty, but you only use a few drops at a time so a bottle will last you quite a while. It has a lovely subtle rose fragrance too and is gentle enough not to irritate my sensitive skin, eczema, or rosacea. I definitely recommend for those just getting into anti-aging products that donâ€™t want the irritation of retinols! Magic in a Bottle
