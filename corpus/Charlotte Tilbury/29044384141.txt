Thank you to Influenster and Charlottetilbury for my Complimentary VoxBox of Charlotte Magic Serum Elixir.I have been using using this in the morning and evening for a while now. I personally have not noticed my skin more glowy. However, it definitely makes my skin feel moisturized and soft. The one thing I myself am not a big fan of is the scent of the product. But this goes away within a few seconds of being applied. Over all it works very nicely under makeup. I also use it at night after I have cleaned my skin. It is a thicker consistency but easily massages into the skin. A few drops will easily be able to work into your entire face and neck. Leaves Skin Moisturized
