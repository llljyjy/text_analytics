I was gifted Charlotteâ€™s Magic Eye Rescue Cream with Retinol by Charlotte Tilbury and Influenster in exchange for my fair and honest review. I love the beautiful and elegant packaging. This is a great cream for stopping aging in the eye area. After using the cream for a few weeks, I noticed that my eye area was more moisturized and more firm. The formula is very creamy but not heavy. I also love that it has a light fragrance and absorbs easily. I recommend this product to anyone who needs TLC in the eye area or a great anti-aging cream.
