Better than I expected. I figured it would be good but it’s really good, I’ve been using for about two weeks and it’s changed the texture of my skin. My skin feels more supple and softer. I was expecting it to feel more hydrated however I do feel that it actually changed my skin so even the days that I didn’t use the moisturizer I still felt that my skin had changed. Now I’m not sure if these changes would have lasted more than the 48 hours but there was a difference. I did receive this product as a free sample in exchange for my honest review. amazing
