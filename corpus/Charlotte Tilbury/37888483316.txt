I really really like this product. It leave my skin noticeably softer and with a slight glow. It appears more hydrated.  My only complaint is the smell. It’s not bad just not something I like to much. It does dry and fade very quickly to apply lotion over it but it also isn’t a deal breaker. I would buy this again and continue to use it Younger skin in days
