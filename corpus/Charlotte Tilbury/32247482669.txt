I have seriously never had the pleasure of using a face cream that actually feels well worth it price. Hitting 42 and living in the Sonoran Desert climate, this cream is worth it weight in gold. Its super quenching and plumping, with a luminous glow factor.  Wear alone or under a full face, this will be the staple in your regime. Bonus for the lovely smell derived from the floral extracts used. Truly is Magical
