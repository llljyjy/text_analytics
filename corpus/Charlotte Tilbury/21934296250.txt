I have only been using this for about 2-3 weeks so I canâ€™t speak to the long-term effects, but I do notice a brightening/glowy look to my skin when applying. I do prefer to use this in the morning because it has a little bit of a tacky feel and I like how it wears under makeup. I absolutely LOVE the packaging!! It is a heavy duty glass bottle and the dropper is nice. It is very pretty for displaying on your bathroom sink. Some things I am not fond of is the smell!! It is quite strong IMO, but it does dissipate and I am not quite sure that it warrants the high price. Very Nice Product
