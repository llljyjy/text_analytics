I’ve been using this for a little over a month now. I have oily and sensitive skin so I’m always a little afraid of moisturizers due to being so prone to breakouts. Not only did this not break me out but it leaves my skin feeling so refreshed. I hate that I love this because it’s a little pricy but I will be rebuying this. If you’re acne prone try this!! Didn’t break me out!!
