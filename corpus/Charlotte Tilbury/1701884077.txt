I received my free sample of this product from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury a week ago and have been using it every night as part of my nighttime skincare routine. At first I thought it was greasy, but it has really grown on me. I just scaled back on the amount I applied. The results are what keep me using it. As a full time working mother of a two year old who is also in graduate school, my eyes were starting to look worn and tired. Since using this product one week ago my eyes have not been puffy in the mornings. My dark circles are no where near what they were before. I also love that this product is refillable! My eyes are sold
