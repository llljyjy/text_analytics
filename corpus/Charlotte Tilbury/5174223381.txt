I received this product for free from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review. Where has Charlotte’s Magic Cream-Instant Turnaround Moisturizer (Charlotte Tilbury) been all my life!? I used this on my entire face, neck, and my decolleté area. I have combo skin, where it’s oily it’s super oily and where it’s dry, due to getting older, it’s dry and getting these wrinkles like a tiny little grid. This cream did not make the oily part oily at all and I didn’t break out, that’s a first! This cream has worked miracles on my wrinkles, crows feet around the outer part of my eyes, and the areas of my face that are dry. I’m starting to get lines/wrinkles on my neck and my decolleté area. This cream worked so much magic there that without saying anything to my daughter, age 14, noticed and said something to me about my neck and chest looking different and younger, that she can’t see my new wrinkles! At that point I’d only been using this for a few days! I’m in love with this cream! My dream cream! Love this!
