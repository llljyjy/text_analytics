First time trying a charlotte tilbury product and here are my thoughts. The container is deceiving as the amount of product inside was minimal. For $64, I expected a decent amount compared to other moisture creams I’ve used that are half the cost. I’m not a huge fan of the rose aroma and it was strong with this cream. I’d love to see a formula without a scent because some can be sensitive to those types of things nan
