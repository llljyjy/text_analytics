The magic eye rescue cream does what the title says. This eye cream is very moisturizing and feels great on the skin. A little goes a long way. The cream itself is silky and smooth. I enjoy putting this product on in the morning because of its moisturizing properties and because it helps my dark circles seem lighter. The eye cream is not oily or runny. It has a perfect consistency. If you are experiencing dryness under your eyes, dark circles, and wrinkles, I recommend giving the Magic Eye Rescue cream a try. This eye cream has some good ingredients which helps the under eye appear revitalized. Charlotte Tilbury Magic Eye Rescue Cream
