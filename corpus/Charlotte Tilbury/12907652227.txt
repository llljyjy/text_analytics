Charlotte Tilbury products honestly never disappoint! This moisturizer cream has been perfect on my really dry winter skin. It feels thick but doesn’t leave your face feeling greasy or clogged. It also pairs really well with my makeup, probably the best cream I’ve used with makeup!! Overall, I highly recommend it to anyone with dry skin! Perfect on dry skin!
