I was quite scared to start using this serum because of the negative Sephora reviews. Apparently this serum is hit-or-miss!I have been using this serum twice a day for 2 weeks, and it surprisingly works well for my skin. I have acne prone combo skin, and I am usually cautious using products with vitamin C (they tend to break me out). I am so glad this serum did not cause any breakouts.The consistency is lightweight, it absorbs fast and well, and has a dewy finish. IMO, this serum provides hydration, tightens enlarged pores, and skin appears firmer. Overall, my acne prone combo skin surprisingly likes this serum, it seems to improve skin tone in the long run, and overall appearance (especially if you have enlarged pores and loss of firmness). Hit-or-Miss.
