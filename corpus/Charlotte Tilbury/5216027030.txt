This is my favorite moisturizer EVER. I’ve been using it about a year now & I have not found a dupe for it. It just instantly revitalizes your skin. Leaving you looking plump and hydrated but not greasy. I like that they are refillable now plus there are different sizes for different needs & budgets. The product has really good slip to it meaning that it glides on your skin, not tugs at it. And it doesn’t absorb too fast which can also cause tugging. I would highly recommend this moisturizer to my friends. nan
