I used my points to get a decent sized sample jar of this moisturizer, I was able to use it for a couple of weeks. Expectations were high because of the price point and the name “Magic Cream”. The first time a tried it, the scent was overwhelming, it was months before I decided to give it another go. I used this cream twice a day, I saw zero magic, I could smell it for hours after application. I’m not against fragrance entirely but this is similar to a perfume body lotion. This cream was hydrating and reminded me of Elf Holy Hydration products. After 20 minutes I still had an oily film on my skin and looked greasy, my skin felt greasy too. About 10 days in I started to break out on my cheeks and forehead, I used the rest of the little jar on my legs. I didn’t feel any magic from this overpriced, overly scented, very basic cream. Magic ???
