Charlotteâ€™s Magic Cream is a lovely facial cream in in gorgeous jar. I heard that you can purchase refills instead of replacing the entire packaging each time. There was no oily feeling, no clogged pores although I have oily skin. Although when I know that it costs 100$, you may say that it is expensive, but it is worth this price, as it treats dry skin within 24 hours, so worth it. Very good
