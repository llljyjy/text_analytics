This was sent to me for review, and I’ve been loving it as a night cream. This doesn’t work that well for me under makeup because I already have pretty oily skin. A super moisturizing product like this will make my makeup melt off my face, but this is GREAT at night. I turn 34 today, so I’m happy to have a super rich night cream to help me look my best. Amazing night cream
