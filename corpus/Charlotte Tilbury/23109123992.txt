I like how this cream feels on my eyes. It’s a thick cream but goes on smooth and melts pretty quick into my skin. This cream wears well under my makeup. I’ve been using this for about two weeks now and it makes my eyes feel softer but I have yet to notice less wrinkles. I probably have to use it longer to see the results. Feels nice
