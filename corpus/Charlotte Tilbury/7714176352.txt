I’m in love with this Charlotte Tilburg Magic Cream. At 62 and recently losing a lot of weight I was left with some sagging skin on my face and neck, but after adding this moisturizer to my daily routine I’ve seen a noticeable difference in the look of my skin. It’s firmed and plumped up my skin and added a radiance i havent seen in years. This well remain in my skin care routine from now on. Fantastic Moisturizer.
