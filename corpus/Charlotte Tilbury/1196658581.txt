I love Charlotte Tilbury makeup and skincare and this is one of my top favorites. This cream is very hydrating, moisturizing, and easy to apply. It does feel thicker compare to most creams I use but it does the job beautifully for my combo skin. I haven’t notice a dramatic result to using it but it helps with my dry skin in the winter time. Overall, this is a MUST try if you’re interested in any of her products! Luxe and beautiful!
