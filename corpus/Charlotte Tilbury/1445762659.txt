I can see why they call this “Magic” Cream!  My skin is on the dryer side, but this cream plumps, hydrates, and gives a gorgeous glow! Even without makeup my skin tone looks more even, which means I can use less makeup.  What I do put on stays beautifully, as this acts as a primer. The effects last all day, and I will be reinvesting in this cream! Gorgeous Gorgeous Girls GLOW!
