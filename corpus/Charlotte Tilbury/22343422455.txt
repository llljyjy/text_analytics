Worth the money 10000%. Feels luxurious on the skin, I have super sensitive skin and this is not irritating at all! Definitely has a bit of a fragrance, I donâ€™t find it to be unpleasant. I would compare the texture/feel when applying to the feel of the Bobbi Brown face base primer. I love using it during the day as a moisturizer/ primer along with the flawless filter. nan
