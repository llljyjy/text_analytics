I received this free from Influenster and charlotte tilbury in exchange for my review, and I’m so glad I did! I have oily easily congested skin so unfortunately this is not an everyday moisturizer for me. It does say it’s best for normal to dry skin though. But it still sinks right into my skin and leaves a beautiful glow without a greasy feel.. For me and my skin it’s perfect for self care days and whenever I want my complexion makeup to look perfect. Everything about this screams luxury. Received free from Influenster and CT.
