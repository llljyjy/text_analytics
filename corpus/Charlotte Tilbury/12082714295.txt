I love Charlotte Tilbury products they work great for my combination skin. I knew I would love this moisturiser and I wasn’t wrong, it’s really amazing. The texture is  little heavier than what I am used to with my gel moisturiser but it feels really light on my skin and absorbs quickly. It doesn’t make my skin feel greasy or oily. It doesn’t irritate or cause any breakouts. I have been using it for 2 weeks and my skin feels great, hydrated and soft. Definitely buying it again. Amazing hydrating moisturiser
