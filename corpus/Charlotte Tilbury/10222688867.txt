I received this complimentary from Influenster to try in exchange for my review. Upon first use I loved it. It is lightly scented but the scent is a delightful one. Makes your skin feel soft and gives it a nice glow. However, after about a week I started breaking out. Something that in this stage of my life isnâ€™t typical. I discontinued used and it cleared up. nan
