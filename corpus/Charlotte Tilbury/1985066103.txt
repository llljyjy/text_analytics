I have been using this product for over 4 weeks, I noticed right away after the first use the skin around my eyes felt so hydrated in the morning. Most importantly my crows feet are much less visible. I love the consistency of this product it’s almost a gel like and so thin but yet so hydrating. I would recommend  using only at night and not under make up as it does not fully absorb. A little goes a long way. I received this product to test from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I’m enjoying it
