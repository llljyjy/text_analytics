My skin feels softer, it’s hydrated, I love its ingredients, especially hyaluronic acid, it’s easy to absorb, it has a mild scent that I really like, it comes in a nice package, I don’t feel that my face is greasy, I use it day and night, during the day it helps me to make my makeup have a better finish.  Happy to use this moisturizer Gaby05
