I have to admire the beautiful packaging of this serum. It comes in the beauty glass bottle. Serum feels very lightweight, hydrating  and my skin looks plump and glowing. One of the main in-house niacinimide which helps to brighten complexion. Great serum to use under moisturizer. I like the texture. It has light scent which doesnâ€™t bother me at all. good serum
