I received this product for free through an influenster campaign. I just started using it and already seeing results after 5 days. The formula and texture is light, creamy, non-sticky, moisturizing and smells great. The fragrance is barely noticeable but smells good. I tend to get little sleep and have large bags under my eyes and hereditarily have dark circles. I have also been starting to get wrinkles and loose skin around my eyes. After 5 days of using this product, I can already see a difference with less baggage under my eyes and tighter skin. I will have to continue using this product longer to see if it helps my dark circles. If this product can rid me of dark circles, I would change my review to 10+ stars. I will have to keep on using the product for sometime to see if my eyes get even better. Overall, great product so far. Iâ€™m impressed. I love this eye cream !!
