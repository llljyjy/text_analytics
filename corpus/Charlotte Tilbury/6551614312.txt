I received this product for free from Influenster to try and was very impressed. For that much im not sure if I would purchase it myself but it does show results. I use it in the night since it does contain retinol, retinol is not meant to be used during the day since the sun hits it. It helps to improve fine lines and wrinkles. It does not make it disappear but less noticeable! It is a fast absorbing eye cream and applies smoothly. Itâ€™s not too heavy! nan
