I received this in exchange for my honest opinion. But honestly I love this. I’m on my 3rd bottle and it’s a staple in my routine. Makes my foundation go on amazing.and gives me a gorgeous glow and hydrates me sooook freaking much. I absolutely love this. I hate that it’s so pricey but it seriously is worth every penny. And I will never go back nan
