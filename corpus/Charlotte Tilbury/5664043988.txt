I really enjoyed this product. Very moisturizing around the eyes and felt firmer. Absorbed nicely into skin. The cream is on the thicker side, doesn’t feel sticky and doesn’t really have a scent. I liked that it didn’t sting or irritate my eyes. After continuous use, my eye area seemed to look brighter and more firm. Will continue to use. Eye Cream
