*I received Charlotte Tilburys Magic Eye Rescue compliments of influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest opinion. *I am very pleased with how bright Charlotte Tilburys magic eye cream made my eyes!! I really like the texture of this cream, it soaks in nicely. I use a little less in the am, it is a rich cream, so It doesn’t take much, a small amount will do! I don’t use nearly as much as in my picture, that’s just to show consistency.  I can’t speak for how well it works for wrinkles as I haven’t used it long enough to tell a difference. But I do love how open & bright it made my eyes! I’m going to continue to use it to see what the long term benefits are. That’s the only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars. I love that it’s refillable!! The jar is quite pretty, so I’m super glad you don’t use until it’s gone & toss the whole bottle!! Bright eyes
