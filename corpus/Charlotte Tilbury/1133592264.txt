I received this product as a free sample to try for my honest opinion. And wow! Was I blown away. I typically use another brand’s face base as a primer/moisturizer but it can be a bit thick and doesn’t apply easily. Plus it’s highly scented. The Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream, however, feels like a soft fluffy cloud and just melts into my skin. I have been using this as a moisturizer and as a primer before my makeup, which goes on so smoothly. Even more importantly, it doesn’t break me out like a lot of primers or moisturizers do, and it keeps my foundation going strong all day. I’ll be rebuying this when I run out because it’s a holy grail product! Soft as a cloud
