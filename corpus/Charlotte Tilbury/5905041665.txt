I received this product for a honest review for influenster. I was hesitant because there’s so many mix reviews on this product but I love it . You can use it as a part of night time routine or before applying makeup . It helps moisturize and give a glow which is perfect for summer time skin . I love to wash my face and apply when I just want to wear no makeup and do errands when it’s too hot for makeup . Great
