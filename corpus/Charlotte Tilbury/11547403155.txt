I love Charlotteâ€™s Tillsbury Magic Serum Crystal Elixir. The bottle it comes in is so beautiful. It has a great texture and no scent. It feels like silk I was shocked when I realized it only took five to six drops to cover up my entire face and neck. My face felt immediately hydrated after my very first application. It dried very quick. I look forward to this now being a part of my daily routine. Best serum ever
