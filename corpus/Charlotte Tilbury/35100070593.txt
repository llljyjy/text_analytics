This cream is the perfect thickness and consistency, and doesn’t have an overwhelming fragrance (if you are sensitive about smells). It applies smoothly and absorbs fast. It Immediately brightens skin around the eyes for a healthy glow. It’s very moisturizing. I wish I could apply it all over my face. As a bonus, if you suffer from itchy eyes due to allergies or any other reason really, this cream also feels very soothing. Top notch as eye creams go. …Also love that it comes in a refillable jar. Magic in the prettiest little jar.
