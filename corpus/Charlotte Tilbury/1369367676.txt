I had really high expectations for this serum, mean that it is Charlotte Tilbury and at such a high price point. I was a little skeptical when I read the ingredients and saw that there was a lot of like Crystal extracts which isnâ€™t really proven to do anything. but I am in love! this serum is the perfect glowy serum for daytime no makeup or for wearing under makeup for that I woke up like this glow it is so beautiful! nan
