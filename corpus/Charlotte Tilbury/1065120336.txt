Nice serum! I received a bottle to try in exchange for my honey review. I really like the fragrance it smells like a high end spa. It’s lightweight on the skin and not greasy at all. I’ve been using it for about 2 weeks so not sure I see any changes in my skin yet. The bottle is beautiful, I may go over to the Sephora and get the matching skin cream nan
