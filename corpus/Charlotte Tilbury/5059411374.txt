This is absolutely magic in a bottle! Made with hyaluronic acid, and his anti-aging moisturizer visibly plumps your skin. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and looking glowy! It has a light floral scent but nothing overpowering.  The consistency is medium to thick, so a little goes a long way. It’s also a great base for makeup, especially on those “no makeup”, makeup days. It definitely works as a primer as well as moisturizer. Definitely worth the price! I got this for free, and I will for sure be repurchasing. I believe in magic!
