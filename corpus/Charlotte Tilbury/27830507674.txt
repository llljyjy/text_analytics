This is my go to moisturizer and primer every morning before I apply makeup, whether I plan to do a full face or natural look. The formula absorbs quickly and doesn’t pill under makeup, and it leaves my skin hydrated and glowy without feeling greasy. I would recommend to anyone who doesn’t like a heavy primer and wants a radiant, glowy finish to their skin. nan
