I received this product for free from Influenster and from Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review.So lets get to the point…I like this eye cream a lot!It has a light scent and it feels very luxurious.I have genetically dark circles so it won’t do much to help me with that but wow, it made my under eyes look bright and hydrated! I was impressed because they still looked hydrated in the morning.I have only used this cream for a few days and retinols can take weeks (sometimes even months) to see the full benefits but so far I’m loving this! It’s definitely an eye cream I will keep using in my skincare routine.Since this cream has retinol I prefer to use it at night and I always wear sunblock since retinols tend to make your skin sensitive when exposed to the sun so keep that in mind when you get this cream.But overall…YES, I recommend this eye cream! Luxury in a jar!
