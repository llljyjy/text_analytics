It’s like magic in a jar! First off, the packaging is so luxurious and beautiful. I love the rose gold cap and the octagon shaped jar, it looks lovely on any vanity table! The cream itself is just as luxe and leaves your skin glowy (I have dry skin). it works great as a base before foundation since it’s hydrating. Love it! Magic in a Jar
