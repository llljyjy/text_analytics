This moisturizer felt amazing on my skin! The packaging is beautiful and luxurious. It definitely made my skin glow and made my makeup look 10 times better. The only thing I didn’t like was that it felt like it never soaked into my skin. It felt a little too heavy for me. But it could be that I’m used to very thin moisturizers that soak in instantly. It really is a nice moisturizer and wonderful to use as a primer. Beautiful and luxurious for sure!
