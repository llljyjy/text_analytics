I was super excited to be trying this product and it did not at all disappoint. First of all the packaging is super cute. As for the product it’s like magic in a jar. It wasn’t to thick in consistency and kept my face super moisturized. It didn’t leave my skin feeling oily. I will be adding this to my regular routine and will recommend to anyone. Magic in a jar!
