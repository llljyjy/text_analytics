I have been using this Magic Cream for about 3 weeks now and it’s been doing wonders for my skin. I love that it has hyaluronic acid to provide extra hydration for my skin especially since my skin is very dry. I love how thick it was in comparison to my other moisturizers. It also comes in a pretty glass jar that you can buy refills for. Very eco-friendly. It does have a scent to it. I’m normally very sensitive to smells which can result in headaches but this was tolerable and after a couple of uses I stopped noticing the scent. I would recommend it to someone with dry skin. It works great bit the only down side is the price. nan
