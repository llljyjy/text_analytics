I received this product for free from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review.I have nothing negative to say about this products at all. I had no reactions to it, it layered well with my other products. I’ve only been able to use it for a month, which I don’t think is time for enough change, however I will keep using it! After a months use, it’s not even like there is dent in the product. A little goes a long way! It’s more of a gel feel, but still very moisturizing. It’s pricey in my opinion, you could definitely find cheaper options, but if you don’t mind spending some money then go for it!! Good, just not Great
