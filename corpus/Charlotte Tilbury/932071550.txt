I was excited to try this cream after hearing all the hype.  It applies nicely and absorbs quickly, but I would not say that it is ultra hydrating.  I have very very dry skin and would characterize this as a mid weight moisturizer.  It makes a beautiful base for makeup application though, I just layer another moisturizer underneath.  It has a substantial rose fragrance, which may be irritating if you have sensitive skin.  While I will finish the jar, I likely would not purchase it again based on my skin type. If you have oily or normal skin it might be perfect for you! Great Makeup Base
