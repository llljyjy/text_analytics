I was really looking forward to trying this because of all the great reviews but it wasnâ€™t good for me at all. It never seemed to fully absorb and it was crazy oily by lunch time. And I found the fragrance very unpleasant. Like a powdery, old fashioned, floral. This is definitely not worth the price tags for me. nan
