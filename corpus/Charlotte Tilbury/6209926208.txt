I received this product for free through Influenster. I have been a devout user of Lancome genifique serum for the last few years but just finished my last bottle, so I was excited to test this out. I’ve been using it for ~1 month now. I don’t have negative feedback at this time but time will tell. I like the packaging - the dispensing dropper has a nice twist to it compared to a standard dropper. Product absorbs quickly and feels light/weightless on the skin.  Scent is soft and not too strong.  I haven’t noticed a big difference in skin texture, but I also haven’t noticed negatives either. I will continue to use and update if anything changes. magic serum?
