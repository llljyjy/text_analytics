I’ve been around the block when it comes to eyecreams and it’s pretty safe to say I’m a skeptic.Why can’t I just use any other face product? Aren’tmy eyes a part of my face? Well, my friend, this eyecream shut me right up. It’s a dreamy combinationof rich moisture in a light, watery texture. Althoughit hydrates my under eyes beautifully, it hasn’tcaused my finicky skin to break out at all. Thesustainable packaging is the cherry on top of thiseye-ce cream sundae. nan
