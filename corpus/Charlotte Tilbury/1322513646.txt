I’ve used this once so far but will def finish the bottle. Not sure if I’d repurchase due to the hefty price tag + having a ton of other skincare to use. I used it it combo with an essence + moisturizer. It smelled natural. It didn’t irritate my skin. It gave a really pretty glow. Worked well in combo w| other skincare + makeup. I love most things from this brand so was absolutely excited to recieve nan
