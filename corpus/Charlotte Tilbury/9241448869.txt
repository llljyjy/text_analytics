Wow! This cream and hyaluronic acid combo is truly amazing. Gentle on skin yet packs a powerful, hydrating and rejuvenating result to skin. Nice creamy consistency with a light fragrance. Easy to massage in with great results.  Definitely helped with dry skin immediately and after a couple weeks of use my skin was tighter, more elasticity and brighter with less noticeable fine lines. No sticky residue. Love, love, love this for my dry skin. Soft Hydrated Skin
