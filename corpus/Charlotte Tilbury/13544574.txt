I was so excited to try this “magic” serum by Charlotte Tilbury and was pleased with the overall benefits from this product. The glass bottle and dropper are nice and my skin really drank up the serum. There is a scent to this product that I rather enjoy- I noted that the scent lingers but it is not overpowering. I use this product in the morning and evening after I wash my face and before I use my moisturizer. I did notice that my skin feels nice and hydrated after using this product. Lovely serum for hydrated and glowing skin
