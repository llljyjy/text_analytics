Magic eye rescue cream is so good. I was using it for 4 weeks and my under eyes skin looks so nice. No more dark circles and puffs. Skin is so soft and smooth. When I use it in the morning it goes well under my makeup. Not oily or greasy at all. The texture of the cream is silky and smooth. Little goes a long way.What i like the most is that cream doesn’t have any smell. Most of the fragranced creams tears my eyes, and some fragrance free creams have bad scent that makes me feel bad. So this one is perfect!Love the packaging and that it’s refillable. I will definitely repurchase it. Magic eye cream - magic result
