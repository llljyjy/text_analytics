This is a beautiful high-end skincare product. I love the list of ingredients, I love the finish on my skin and how it feels, and it is a perfect step before make up. It is expensive but the packaging is beautiful… Do you absolutely need it? I don’t think so just based on the price point, I think there are other products that can do this job. I don’t think I will buy it again but it is a nice experience to use it. Very nice
