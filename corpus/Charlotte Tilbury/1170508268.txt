This is one of my favorite moisturizers because it pulls double duty as a moisturizer and primer. It smooths the skin, offering a blurring effect that minimizes pores and neutralizes redness. I have combo skin, so I donâ€™t need more than a pea-sized amount to cover my entire face. It hydrates without getting too dewy. I find that if I use it too many days in a row, it can cause congestion, so I reserve it for days when I wear makeup. So good!
