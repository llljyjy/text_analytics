Absolutely in love with this lightweight facial moisturizer that provided “instantaneous magical hydration “. Faintly rose pedal sent it and it doesn’t take much for a full face and neck application. Smooth on and then gently tap in or circular massage onto your freshly cleansed face and neck. After one to two weeks, I’ve already noticed how soft, revitalized and plump for my skin feels and appears. Make up goes on almost flawlessly and fine lines and wrinkles seem to be minimized. It’s also in an Eco friendly refillable chart insert. Incentivizedcomplimentary for my honest review. @CharlotteTilbury #MagicSkin #MagicCream #CharlotteTilbury Charlotte Tilbury “instant hydration” Magic Cream
