I wanted to give this product a thorough “trial run,” as it is on pricier side. Sometimes I find that a product seems to be working for me, and then it just kind of doesn’t anymore.  I LOVE Charlotte Tilbury cosmetics, and was excited to try my first skin care product from the brand.Well, with all of that being said, this product HAS NOT DISAPPOINTED! I’m 40, and still struggle to find that perfect moisturizer for my combination skin. This magic cream “magically” gives me a beautiful glow under my makeup, without looking greasy. I just be sure to let it dry sufficiently, and then my makeup glides on so smoothly.I have certainly noticed a difference in my skin’s plumpness, and a decrease in fine lines. I also find the scent to be very pleasant.If you are able to make the splurge, and have been looking for a nice moisturizer for “maturing” skin, I suggest giving this product a shot! It really is magic
