I got this complimentary from influenster for an honest review. Let me start off by saying I absolutely love Charlotte tilbury but I was a little nervous to test this moisturizer out because of my really dry sensitive skin. It does have a very faint scent( it really isn’t strong at all) and makes your skin super plump and glowy (more than the tatcha indigo cream). However, I don’t feel like it’s enough for my dry skin and it stung a bit after applying. I probably have some sort of allergy to this, so if you have EXTREMELY sensitive skin I would try something else. It is really light weight but due to my sensitive skin I don’t think I can use it on a daily.I’ll probably save this as a base for before applying makeup. I recommend giving this a go if your skin isn’t super super dry and you are looking for a lightweight plumping glowy moisturizer. give it a try!
