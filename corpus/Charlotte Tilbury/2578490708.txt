This moisturizer was not what I expected. It is very thick and feels uncomfortably heavy on my skin. No matter how little I used my skin felt like it was suffocating. It did moisturize but, again, felt heavy. Upon applying my makeup over it I didn’t feel like my makeup went on any better or smoother. I didn’t see my makeup looking any better or worse. Sadly, I didn’t see the “magic“ of this cream. I’m grateful to have had the opportunity to try this via Influenster. I would not repurchase. Where's the magic?
