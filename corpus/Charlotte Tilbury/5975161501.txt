This serum is so hydrating and didn’t cause any weird breakouts or redness for my sensitive skin. When applying this serum at night the next morning my skin would feel so smooth and plump. After using this product for a couple of weeks I did notice my pores getting smaller. The smell of this serum wasn’t too strong and I love the packaging! Hydrating
