I received this serum for free for testing and reviewing purposes. I have some fine lines and wrinkles here and there and was excited to try this. The bottle is so pretty but I’m not excited about the dropper, I don’t think it’s hygienic but oh well, it’s just my preference. The product itself it’s thick but absorbs fast and it’s not sticky and the skin it’s glowing inmediately and it looks hydrated. I don’t see any major changes on my wrinkles but I don’t think with just a bottle I’ll get the desired effect. nan
