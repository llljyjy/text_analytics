Feels like a hug for dry skin.  I have combination acne prone skin, but my skin around my nose and chin has been so dry this winter and makeup has been looking awful in those areas. This cream really helped provide a lot of hydration making makeup sit so much nicer. Definitely recommend if you have dry skin and need that extra moisture under makeup. Feels like a hug for dry skin
