Background: I’m 45 years old and struggle with large pores and sensitive skin. I have combo skin which is not dry anywhere (normal to oily). When I apply products to my face, my skin turns red and then settles down. Just sensitive overall. I do not have issues with acne or regular breakouts. I do use retinol, lactic acid and other serums. Review: I’ve heard many people raving about Charlottes Magic cream so I was very excited to get a full size product to review. The cream is thick and a little goes a long way. It is heavily fragranced. I’m usually not bothered by fragrance but in this case my attention went to the smell several times in the first hour or two after application. I tried the cream in the morning, under makeup, and can’t say that I liked it this way. Because my skin isn’t dry, the cream sat on top of my skin and made my makeup look a bit splotchy. I tried the cream at night, following skin care, and liked it much better this way. I woke up with baby soft skin. My pores seemed minimized. I did not experience redness in my skin after applying this. Conclusion: In my case, this is not a holy grail item for me. I will continue to use it at night as a night cream but would not repurchase. The cost is off putting, too. There is a refill available for a little less but I  have other creams that I prefer over this. That said, I think this would be amazing for people with dry skin or if you experience chapped skin from cold weather (or maybe a sunburn?). It has a very healing feel to it. I gave this 4 stars because it is good, it just isn’t good for my type of skin. ;) Great for Dry Skin
