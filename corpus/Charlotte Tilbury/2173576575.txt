I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion and review. I have been using this serum for the past few weeks and I really am loving the results. I use a dropper full every morning and night. It goes on really nicely with a fresh fragrance that goes away pretty quickly.  It soaks up well into the skin. I follow up with my moisturizer and am ready to face the day. Iâ€™ve noticed my skin is clear, luminous and moisturized.  It even layers nicely under my makeup. I reccomend! Wonderful Serum
