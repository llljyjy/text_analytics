Charlotte’s Magic Serum Crystal Elixir has a bright, fresh fragrance that’s a cross between wild roses and wild apple blossoms. It has a rich, almost milky texture. It’s easily absorbed into my skin. After application, it feels very light. I can’t even feel it on my skin. It leaves my skin hydrated, smooth, with a luminous appearance. *Cruelty Free *Free of sulphates*Free of Parabens *Free of Phthalates *Gluten Free *Vegan Hydrating, Clean Beauty
