This is a very luxe high end face cream that would likely work well as an all around fantastic moisturizer for normal, mature, dry and combo skin. I have naturally oily skin and found this to be a bit too heavy to use as a daytime cream so I was only able to use it as a night cream. I did enjoy using it that way and my skin felt very soft and smooth in the morning. I don’t usually use scented face creams and this does have a noticeable floral scent to it, however it didn’t seem to irritate my sensitive skin but I do wish that it also came in a fragrance free option. Magic for MOST skin types…
