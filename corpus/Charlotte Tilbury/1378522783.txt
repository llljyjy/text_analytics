This is way to heavy for summer unless you are dry as the Sahara. Perfect for dry winter tho. But....I cannot get past this scent. It is one of those obnoxiously cheap smelling florals that burns your nose and you can even taste it when you breath the scent in. Pass for me due to the scent. overpowering floral scent
