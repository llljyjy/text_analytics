I received this full sized Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream complimentary from Influenster and Sephora in order to give my review. Let me start by saying I have been faithful to a certain moisturizer for over 20 years! During that time, I have of course tried other brands, but was never satisfied with their results. This is absolutely the first time that I have considered switching brands! This cream is thick and luxurious without clogging my pores. It absorbs fantastically under makeup too. I literally noticed results the first day. My skin felt soft and hydrated for at least 12 hours! I will definitely be purchasing this in the future! nan
