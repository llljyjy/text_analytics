Bought the travel size to try due to the overwhelming hype of Charlotte Tilbury. I have very oily & starting to age skin and I have really never found a moisturizer that soaks in and not make me greasy within 30min. This stuff I found not only moisturized my skin but did not leave me greasy whatsoever, a little goes a long way so no need to goup it on. The fragrance is nice but not overwhelming but do not get near eyes or in my case made my eyeâ€™s water.  This product is a great base prior to foundation and even primer! Only 4 stars due to the ridiculous price this is, if it was more affordable it will get 10 stars and beyond! Worth the hype but pricey!
