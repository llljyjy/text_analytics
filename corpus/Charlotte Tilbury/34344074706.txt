I have pretty sensitive skin and a sensitive nose . This cream does have a heavy scent but it did not bother my nose and thankfully did not irritate my skin . It covers the skin well but Unfortunately after usage  it started pilling.  This is super disappointing and not something I would ever expect from a facial cream of this price point . horrible experience
