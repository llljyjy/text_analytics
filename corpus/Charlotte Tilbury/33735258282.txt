I received Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid for free from Influenster for my honest review. I wanted to wait awhile before leaving my review so I had time to make sure it done what it supposed to do and I am so glad I did! I have combo skin. After using this product for nearly a month and a half now, my wrinkles are not so visible. My complexion looks so much healthier! The cream is so soft, and does not leave your face oily at all. You do not need to use alot, a little goes a long way! I am most definitely purchasing this product again! nan
