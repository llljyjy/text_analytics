i don’t understand the bad reviews. this cream is amazing! it’s the thickest moisturizer i’ve ever used but as others have stated, it’s a high cream and is supposed to absorb over time. i mix it with evening primrose oil and it melts into my skin. the scent isn’t overpowering, after about 10 minutes i can’t smell it anymore. if hesitant, wait until a sale or try the sample size. i personally think it’s worth every penny. the best!
