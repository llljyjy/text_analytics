I really wanted to like this face cream (52yo), my daughter wanted to as well (16yo) - we both tried solid for two weeks. Did NOT like this product at all. It made my skin break out, hers as well.Normally use Caudalie - LOVE. Daughter uses Tatcha - she LOVES. Her skin broke out before uses and now is blemish free. Charlotteâ€™s make-up is amazing - love all of her products. Sticking with make-up. Not Magic - Poison
