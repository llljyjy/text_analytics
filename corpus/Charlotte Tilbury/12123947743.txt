It looks and feels like vaseline. It is NOT the white creamy texture from photos, but hard and yellow. I’m not sure if this is even the real cream. I’m really bummed and if this is supposed to entice folks to buy the full size I can’t imagine anyone doing it. The problem is i still want to experience the product- this just can’t be it. Hard pass.
