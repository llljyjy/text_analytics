I bought this on a whim. I am not a toner girl but the promise of a glow intrigued me and I figured why not. I didn’t notice much change the first few days but it felt nice and it has a very light pleasant fragrance so I kept using it. Fast forward a couple of weeks later and I am impressed! I glanced at my skin in the mirror first thing in the morning and I did a double take. My skin looked so clear and smooth and hydrated and glowy! I would prefer good skincare to mounds of makeup and this helps me do that. It’s a little pricey but you get a decent amount and it lasts a long time. I apply just the littlest bit with clean hands and smooth it over my skin before serum. It is definitely something I didn’t know I needed until I got it. I will be repurchasing well before I run out. Definitely a must have!
