I got terribly sunburnt a few weeks ago and while my face wasn’t peeling, my skin texture was rough in a way it’s never been before. Enter: Crystal from Sephora Bay Ridge. She suggested that I use the Magic Cream as a daytime moisturizer for my combination skin (in conjunction with Skinfix barrier+ as an overnight moisturizer) and it keeps me hydrated and balanced. I’m curious to see how it does in winter, but so far I’m really happy with it. It feels luxurious and my skin feels softer than it ever has before. I think the hydration from both moisturizers is even reducing the appearance of my pores and I don’t know if that’s an actual thing or just wishful thinking...! But I’m considering investing in the full size Magic Cream so that it continues. Luxe Hydration
