I like this Magic Cream from Charlotte Tilbury for the most part; it works well on the patches of dry skin I have  and you don’t need to use a lot to get the coverage you need.  The downside is that its really thick and it doesn’t absorb as well on skin that isn’t as dry.  I find its best to use it at night before bed because if I use it during the day, all I notice is the feeling of it still sitting on my face and I hate that. Nice but really thick
