There is a good reason that they call this Charlotte Tilbury cream “magic “!!! It works like magic on your face. I have very oily skin, with a lot of fine lines and some wrinkles. The cream is lightweight and very absorbent, it is also lightly scented. It makes my skin feel very smooth and soft. After 3 days, I noticed a visible difference in the fine lines on my face, especially around my lips. The best thing about it though, is that I can forgo my primer under my makeup! This magic cream leaves my face velvety and smooth, and my makeup glides right over it. My face didn’t get super greasy by the end of the day, like it usually does. I’m really pleased with the product! @CharlotteTilbury #MagicSkin Truly Magical
