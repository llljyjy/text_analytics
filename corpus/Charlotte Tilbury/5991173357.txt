iâ€™m very picky when it comes to eye creams as my undereyes are insanely sensitive as they will burn, puff up and crust if i choose the wrong product. at first i was nervous because of the retinol but OMG it is absolutely amazing with no burning undereyes!!! my undereyes look dewy and i look more alive than i ever have. my main concerns are dark circles and fine lines. the consistency is creamy and butter-like but thick enough to stay super hydrated and bright throughout the day while filling in those fine lines. the color of the product also helps with the color correcting of dark circles. i will be using the entire jar!! left finger is with the product on and right has no product. i received these products for free from Influenster and brand(s) in exchange for my honest review. must have for sensitive undereyes
