This serum spreads beautifully and absorbs quickly,  leaving my skin feeling smooth soft and moisturized. It worked well under sunscreen and makeup.  I didn’t experience any pilling. This serum layers beautifully under the Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream. It comes in a heavy glass bottle and as with every other clCharlotte Tilbury  products I’ve tried, it felt and looked luxurious. nan
