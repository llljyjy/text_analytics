The Magic Cream from Charlotte Tilbury,   is the best base cream for foundation I have ever used, I like it as a moisturizer as well, but when I put it underneath makeup it instantly plums my face making it super glowy and so easy to apply as a base non-sticky at all. I would get the mini size to try out first before you get the big tub. but honestly, you wonâ€™t be disappointed. glowy plump skin
