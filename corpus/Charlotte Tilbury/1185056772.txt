I didn’t want to love this but I do. It’s expensive and it’s not a miracle. However, it gives a kind of unreal glow to my face and sinks in beautifully. Smells lightly floral and pleasant - which I like. The heavy glass jar is substantial and has a nice vintage look on my vanity. I have been using this every day for 3 weeks and I will use every last bit of it. Love it!
