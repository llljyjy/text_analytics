This is a great overall moisturizer. The packaging is high end and very aesthetic if you want to leave it out on display. Its a nice thicker cream that is a great base for other makeup products or alone! I would say that the price tag is too high in my opinion and I think there are other products that are comparable at a lower price point (with less fancy packaging though). Beautiful Packaging
