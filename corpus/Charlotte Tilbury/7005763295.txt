I was so excited to try this very hyped product & I can say its worth the hype. It is a nice thick cream that has a light perfume scent. It leaves my skin so soft & smooth after using it. It also keeps your skin feeling hydrated for a while, it doesnâ€™t sink in too quickly where it feels like goes away. Love it!!
