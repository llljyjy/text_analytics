This has been my introductory experience with Charlotte TilburyMagic Cream, and I love it so far! I haven’t used it long at all, but I did notice a boost right away in hydration and plumpness to my skin. Only a very thin application is necessary to cover the face and a little more to get the neck as well, and it feels gentle and nourishing on the skin, resulting in no breakouts, irritation, or heavy, greasy feel. The texture itself is very creamy, rich and smooth, and there’s only the faintest scent to it, which vanishes shortly after application. I found that it even works quite well under my makeup, providing a super smooth, glowing, and hydrated base. I also love the eco-friendly refillable packaging, which is gorgeous, luxe and has a nice weight. Make Your Skincare Routine More Magical!
