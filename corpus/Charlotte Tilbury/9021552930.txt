This moisturizer is so nice! The packaging is beautiful and made of glass so it feels luxe. The moisturizer itself is so nice and high end feeling too. My cheeks feel so supple and plump after use. I like that it doesn’t have a strong scent like a lot of high end brands tend to do. Taking off a star just because it’s a little expensive and I have other moisturizers that are equal or better in quality for less. So nice! But pricey
