I recently added this into my skincare routine and I love it! I’m only 28 but I’m a mom of 4 very young kids and as much as I love them, they keep me busy! That being said I get tired and sometimes it shows in my face and this product does great at giving life back to my face when I’m feeling drained! It smoothes and leaves your skin plump and hydrated! I will definitely continue to use this product along with the CT glow toner and would recommend anyone to do the same! Love this!
