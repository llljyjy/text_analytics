I’ve had dark circles under my eyes all week, but after only a few days of the magic I cream my face is looking much brighter even though my body is not feeling that much better yet. I’ve definitely seen the puffiness go down a bit and my skin feels smooth and well moisturized despite the dry climate I live in. The texture of the product is thick but not too thick and the packaging is beautiful! I received this product complementary from Charlotte Tilbury and influenster in exchange for my honest review. perfect timing
