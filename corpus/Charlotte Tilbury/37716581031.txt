I received this product for free for my honest review and it’s a great product it leaves your skin looking fresh and glowy! As a full time mom I love putting this on in the morning it makes me feel like I look a little more alive! The only thing that I don’t really like and honestly it doesn’t bother me too much is I feel the scent is a little strong but it’s not too overpowering nan
