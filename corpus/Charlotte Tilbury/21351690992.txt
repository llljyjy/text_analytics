I would like to thank Influenster for allowing me the opportunity to try this product for free. I am generally a drug store buyer & I don’t know if I would have spent the money to try this moisturizer. Out of the box it has a clean pleasant scent, not overwhelming. I’ve been using this product for a little over 2 weeks and have seen an improvement in my “ smile “ lines. The Tilbury method of application is to gently tap the product onto your skin. In retrospect I can understand how that is more beneficial than rubbing as it doesn’t cause stretching of the skin. One thing I have to complain about is the jar. ( and this goes for most companies) it is very difficult to get the product out of the jar if you have any length nails. I a tired of having to scrape the underside of my nails for product. nan
