I wasn’t expecting much bc I’ve always thought CT is a bit overpriced (even tho I own their eyeshadow and lipsticks), but this cream is actually pretty nice. It’s on the thicker side but is very moisturizing and spreads easily. Smells like an elevated rose scent which is nice. Other than the price I think this is a good option. Feels great
