* I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review *I love this product for keeping my face looking young!  First, it has a flowery smell that is very subtle that I like. Next, a little of the product goes a long way, I apply to both my face and neck areas and approx five drops is all you need! For me, the product is a little more sticky than other serums so I do use a lotion or primer on top before applying makeup or sunscreen for a smoother finish. I love how it makes my eyes look, less baggage and fine lines. For the time that I did use it (I’ve got a eczema breakout that I’m trying to clear) it’s worked magnificently and I would buy again!I would also be interested in trying the matching lotion to see if it improves my face even more! nan
