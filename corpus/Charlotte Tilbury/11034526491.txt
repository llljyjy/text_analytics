It never gets cold enough and warms up in 2 minutes, HOWEVER, I use it for migraines and cluster headaches and the beads are perfect. You donâ€™t feel them when they are on (I have a pretty small head) but when you massage them the hurt so good. It is perfect for relieving migraine pain so for that it gets stars. For skin stuff it gets none. Migraine: YAY. Skin: Meh.
