The packaging is luxurious which had me intrigued straight away. I am usually sensitive to anything with fragrance in it but after using this for 4 weeks I have had zero break outs and my hyperpigmentation from previous breakouts has seemed to fade. My skin is overall more glowy and really enjoys this serum. I like the dropper applicator as it makes it easy to apply and get the right sized amount. nan
