I was very excited to try this product.  The Magic Rescue eye cream has a great texture.  Almost like a creamy mousse and very little fragrance.  I have not noticed much change with my dark circles, but a definite change in the texture of skin around my eyes.  Much smoother.  Would definitely recommend! nan
