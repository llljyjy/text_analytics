I have dry dehydrated skin with visible wrinkles and have been searching for a cream that truly works. This is it. Almost immediately my skin felt  smooth, silky and nourished.  I added this magic cream to my daily routine and have been using for 2 weeks. My skin looks refreshed, healthy and glowing. It looks so good that I don’t need any foundation. Even my wrinkles are less noticeable. I take a very small amount, rub between my fingers and than apply using the tap technique. I have been a big fan of Charlotte Tilbury lipsticks for a long time and when I read about the awesome ingredients such as hyaluronic acid and other ingredients that help “turn buckle the clock“ I knew I had to try it. Thrilled I did! It really is a Miracle Cream!
