I received this product from Influenster and was delighted to receive a full size! I have oily skin prone to breakouts, which has always shy’d me away from this product in the past. I’ve used this after my night serums and wake up with visibly plump and soft skin. So far no breakouts to report. Due to my oily skin type and no spf, I won’t be using this as a daily moisturizer, but would suspect this would work great for drier skin types. I also apply to my neck and chest and it feels great going on. TBD on if I’ll repurchase but so far so good! Oily skin
