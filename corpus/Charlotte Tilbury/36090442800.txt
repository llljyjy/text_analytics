Insanely good! I would normally not buy an eye cream for this price but since I was given it to test and review and have been blown away by the results I will not hesitate to buy it from now on. I mean, just look at the before and after with just 1 week of use!  I love the beautiful jar and plan to keep it even after it’s empty. The texture of this cream is just perfect. It has a nice thickness but it’s not heavy or greasy or even sticky. It just glides on and then vanishes. I can actually feel it working and was blown away by the results. In just one week the skin around my eyes has softened and the wrinkles are less noticeable plus the bags that were always there just disappeared. I am so impressed with this cream and would recommend it to anyone needing a great eye cream. This Stuff is Magic Indeed!
