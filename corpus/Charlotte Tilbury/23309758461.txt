This eye cream is ok, I honestly believe it was meant for a mature skin. I do have a few lines a wrinkles but not enough I feel to visibly see a difference in how the product works. I do love the packaging, the container is very posh. The actual cream has a very thick consistency and sits on top of the skin it doesnâ€™t really penetrate the skin and soak in like I would like. But still I feel this would be perfect for more mature skin or even fair skin. Okay cream
