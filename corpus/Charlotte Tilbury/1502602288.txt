This product has multiple uses my routine; I love it as a serum “primer” for under makeup. It’s so lightweight yet delivers a huge dose of hydration. I prefer to layer a thick cream moisturizer over top for skincare only days, and then the SPF 50 primer CT just launched. Together it’s a simple combo that keeps me looking radiant and balanced. Great product for sensitive skin in my experience. Product was received complimentary for review. 5 star formula
