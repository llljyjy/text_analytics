I am blown away by this moisturizer! It truly is magic - I was dealing with some really flaky, dry patches of skin around my nose and chin and within just a few uses, my skin is much more hydrated and the flaky patches are thankfully a thing of the past! This is a thicker product, and a little bit goes a long way. I think for the quality and results, this is completely worth the money! nan
