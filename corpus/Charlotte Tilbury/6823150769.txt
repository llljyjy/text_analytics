Iâ€™ve been using this product for about 2 weeks now. Overall I am really enjoying it! A little goes a long way which I love because it means the product lasts longer. It goes on and runs in smoothly and really does leave my face feeling hydrated. So much to the point that when I go to wash my face the next day, the hydration and product is still there. I feel that my skin is certainly brighter and tighter too! Great Product
