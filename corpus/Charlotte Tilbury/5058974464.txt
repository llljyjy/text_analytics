Just a few moments after applying this cream, I can see a difference! This eye cream provides instant results. It’s like abracadabra and no more tired-looking eyes. The buttery texture of this cream feels amazing applying. It plumps and smooths out my under-eye skin leaving it feeling soft and silky.  Also, bye-bye dark circles!! I’m 40, and this is my first time trying this cream. I’m now a forever fan of Charlotte Tilbury Magic Eye Rescue! Abracadabra!!!
