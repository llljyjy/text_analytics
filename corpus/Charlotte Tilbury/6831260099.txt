Another fantastic item from Charlotte Tilbury! I never tried this cream before and just assumed influencers were over-hyping this. However, my skin feels literally FLAWLESS. I have dry combo skin and after using the Magic Cream I have noticed a significant difference in my skin texture. My skin is soft and supple, and I have actually noticed fine lines become less noticeable. The only other cream that had a similar affect for me is my La Mer Creme de La Mer Moisturizing Cream. And to be honest, the light scent almost smells a little bit like the La Mer cream as well! I wonder if this is sort of a dupe? As far as packaging goes, it just looks SO dang luxurious and it makes me happy to leave it sitting out because it looks so classy and fancy. It is also very very sturdy and has a good weight to it to add to that luxurious feel. I will 100% be purchasing this cream again as it is my new holy grail, and I highly recommend this cream to anyone! Absolutely in Love!
