I absolutely love this toner, I used it every night. Packaging is beautiful, I love the rose gold colors on it. Toner is like a light milky, creamy consistency and I dont use moisturizer after it, especially in the hot days. It smells faintly like roses and the doesn’t last at all if you’re worried about it. Leaves my face clean, soft, pores seems to appear smaller, I love that it seems to even my skin tone. Overall a good product, I love that it contains niacinamide and I will purchase in the future when I run out. I received this product free of charge in exchafor my honest review. So nice ❤️
