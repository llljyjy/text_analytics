I’m mixed on this cream even though so many people adore it. If you put it on bare skin it absorbs well and feels hydrating, but if you put anything else on first it can feel a little slick and less hydrating- more like a primer layer than getting full absorption into the skin. What I do really like about it is it never feels greasy. But for such a pricy item you do need to use it quickly. I’ve gotten samples of it previously that when not used fast enough they dried up into sticky goop in the jar. It doesn’t have an extensive shelf life once opened. Solid, but you need to use quickly.
