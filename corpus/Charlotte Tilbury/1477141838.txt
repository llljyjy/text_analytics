Thick and hydrating. This Magic Cream goes a long way only using a little. It absorbs pretty quickly into the skin and has a primer-type consistency which makes it easy to apply makeup on top. It also has a great floral scent but can be kind of overpowering so I use the product sparingly. Thick Moisturizer.
