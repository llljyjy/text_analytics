I received this product to test it out. It is my first time using an eye cream with retinol. I have combination skin and wrinkles on my eye lines. Applying the eye cream to my eye lines is smooth and moisturizing. My eye did not shows any redness and I noticed my fine lines getting smaller in my fifth week of using it. I applied it once a day. I would recommend this product to anyone on a hunt for an eye cream. nan
