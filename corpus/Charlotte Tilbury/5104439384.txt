This moisturizer is the most luxurious I have ever used. The consistency is so rich and thick and it feels so moisturizing on the skin. The packaging is so stunning and looks beautiful on my vanity. It does contain fragrance, it’s not my favorite scent but it doesn’t linger for me so it’s not that big of a deal. My makeup went on really nicely on top of this moisturizer. Definitely a new staple in my skincare and makeup routine. Beautiful cream!
