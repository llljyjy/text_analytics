The packaging is very pleasing to the eye although the plastic cap feels very cheap. The cream has a heavy cream texture and the perfume is heavy although after a while it dies down. I used it under my foundation and found it to be extremely shiny for my combo skin. Just as recommended by CT, it is better for dry to normal skin. Not the best for combo/oily skin
