Surely the bad reviewers are doing something wrong when they apply this (or are expecting an actual facelift for $22), because the results I got were simply stunning.  It’s pricey, so I should probably be giving it 4 stars on principal-- I do think the results are more significant after the first use, and by the third not as pronounced-- but it’s just so darn good that first pass.  If you use it after the clay mask the results are insane.  Received as a sample, and now purchasing more for my wedding week.  A must have for big events. beautiful product
