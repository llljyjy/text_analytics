This is a very dense and Rich moisturizing cream that leaves a slightly glistening finish on your skin but it is not greasy or tacky. It works really well as a base for makeup to help your products slide onto skin and not stick onto rough patches. The texture of the cream feels almost solid when you first touch it but as soon as your finger touches and warms it up it becomes quite soft and absorbs into your skin quickly. the packaging is also very luxurious and beautiful, a great product to have displayed on your vanity. Skin feels very soft and supple immediately upon use. Rich and glossy but not greasy
