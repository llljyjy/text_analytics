Magical cream! Is it a moisturizer? A primer? This is one of the most glamorous and yet practical creams I have tried! My skin is so plump and fresh after using this, plus my foundation just slides right on! Hyaluronic Acid and several vitamins make this the perfect cream. It does have a very rich feel but sinks into the skin very easily. The container is old Hollywood glamour. Golden lid and heavy glass. It is also refillable so great if youâ€™re environmentally conscious! I own a lot of Charlotte Tilbury and this is another winner in my collection! Magical!
