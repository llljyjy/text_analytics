I was already a huge Charlotte Tilbury fan… And I currently use her Magic Cream and I’m in love with it! But adding her Magic Serum Elixir to my skincare regimen has changed the game! I love the silky texture, it glides on my skin, leaving it smooth, primed & plumped… which I love. It’s the perfect alone or before the magic cream depending on how my skin is feeling that day. A girl’s gotta have options! I’m extremely pleased with this product… and slightly obsessed. She’s done it again!
