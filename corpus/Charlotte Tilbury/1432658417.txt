Charlotte’s magic cream has lived up to its name for me and has exceeded my expectations. I has helped me with my goal of glowing skin. I love that it has hyaluronic acid, vitamin C and E. These ingredients combined help brighten and even out my skin tone and helps hydrate and plump my mature skin. I’ve been using the Charlotte magic massage technique when using this cream and have had been happy with the way my skin looks and feels.

I enjoy the experience using this product as part of my skincare routine. My new skincare secret
