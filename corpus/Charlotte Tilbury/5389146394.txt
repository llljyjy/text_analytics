I’ve been using this for a couple years now, and while I like it as a moisturizing base/primer, I do not use it as moisturizer alone. I have dry skin, and using only this as a moisturizer is not enough but it has paired well with every single other moisturizer I have used in the past couple years. It also always leaves my makeup looking fresh and glowy and I’ve never had any issues with breakouts. The only thing I’ve noticed is that less is more and adding too much will causing it to start pilling under make up but that’s it!! Great product otherwise and would recommend! nan
