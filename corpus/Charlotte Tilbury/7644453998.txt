I love this cream. I donâ€™t have  dark circles or eye wrinkles but it does brighten my eyes. The cream is not running and has a thick texture and there is no overpowering smell. I used it for about three weeks and my eyes looks brighter. The cost of the cream is okay and the amount is good for an eye cream. It comes in a beautiful glass jar. If you are okay with getting pricier eye creams then you will like this one. I got this item free in exchange for a review. Love this cream!
