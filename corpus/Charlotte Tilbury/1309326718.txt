I have always wanted to try this cream and was very excited to finally try it out. I have dehydrated skin and slightly oily around the nose area. The cream smells lovely and feels luxurious. The scent is not strong and I am a fan of the scent. This moisturizer feels thick coming out of the jar but it absorbs well and doesn’t feel heavy. I like the ’Tilbury Tap’ Facial Technique (facial massage instructions) that’s written on the box for a great application. I found it to be the right amount of moisturizing and it does not pill with my other skincare + sunscreen. I found this to be a great product and I would add it to my daily beauty routine. nan
