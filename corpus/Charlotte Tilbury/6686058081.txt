I have tried many moisturizers and serums but I never got this kind of results which I got from Charlotte Tilbury Magic cream. The jar looks so luxurious. It smells so good. My skin was so dry and my skin tone was not even at all. I also had fine lines on my forehead. After I started using this I could see instant results. I used it at night for the first time and the next day my skin felt so hydrated and soft. After a few days of usage I could see more differences in my skin. My fine lines were less visible and my skin felt pumped too. My skin started getting brighter and smoother with each usage. I am so satisfied with this magic cream. It has great ingredients which make my skin healthy. I liked the fact that itâ€™s not greasy nor it leaves an oily look. It makes my skin shiny and radiant. I am loving this overall. I am so glad that I received this in exchange to my honest feedback. Love the cream
