I’ve been using this for about three weeks now and while i can’t tell if my wrinkles are less or pores smaller, i am Noticing my face seems brighter and less blotchy without make up. This is super lightweight and doesn’t feel heavy or greasy under makeup. This makes an excellent primer. I’m loving it so far
