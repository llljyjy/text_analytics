Lush!This packaging is absolutely stunning, the rosey gold top and almost diamond like base, it truly makes you feel like you are holding the value of what you paid for it.The feel of the cream is luxurious and thick. It spreads so nicely and sits on the skin well absorbing just enough, giving it such a hydrating feel. I’ve personally always used it in the evening because of its consistency so I like to just massage it on how it describes on the packaging And then let it just BE on my skin and go to bed to have it soak in.However, I am going to start trying it on before I do my makeup and see how that works because I’m sure it would make the foundation glow!My only downside is it does make my skin flush a little bit and I get Rosy cheeks. This is also why I usually put it on at night because it feels very powerful and my sensitive skin does react a bit to it!Overall though I personally think this product is worth the cost, it’s very luscious, has great coverage and spreadability and the product last a long time because a little goes a long way!
