I have a full routine and regimen of skin products that I use religiously and this is now one. This serum smells just like an expensive 5-star spa facial and it leaves your skin looking and feeling like it too. I highly recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin. My skin didn’t have any reaction to it and no breakouts so that’s huge for me. 100/10, I can’t recommend it enough. The packaging is also drop dead gorgeous and would make an amazing gift for any skincare lover! A complete game changer!
