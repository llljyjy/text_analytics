I’ve been using this serum for the past 2 months, so I got a good feel of how this has worked for me. The bottle is gorgeous, and the dropper provides perfect drop sizes.The smell is excellent!  It’s very earthy, in a hippie kind of way. The texture is silky and absorbs easily, leaving you with a radiant, healthy glow.It works excellent on reducing pore size on your nose, etc. and is one of the best serums that I’ve used for dark spot correction. As far as the wrinkles go, I have not noticed any improvements at all. I was really hoping to see some results in that area, which was a bummer.  I would still recommend it because of how well it works at reducing pore size and dark spots. Good for pores & dark spots
