The packaging is very simple yet high quality. The moisturizer is light and leaves a good amount of coverage to let you know it’s there’s and it’s going to soak into pores. Pairs nicely with foundations. However, I live in a dry climate so I notice it start to wear off about halfway through the day. I recommend this for normal to oily skin. Softens skin, not so much firms. As for hyperpigmentation…. Maybe not the best choice. Still love it though!!! You should try it if you fit the quota!! Love your skin!
