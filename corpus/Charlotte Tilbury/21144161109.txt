The Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream is a thick and moisturizing product! I’ve always heard people rave about this product so thought I’d give it a try! Upon first impressions, the packaging was stellar and there seemed to be a good amount of product. After my first use, I noticed hydrated skin, but for some reason, my skin stung a little bit. I don’t typically have this reaction to moisturizers, but I just wanted to make that note as I have dry/sensitive skin! nan
