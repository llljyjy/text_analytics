Oh, this stuff is pure magic in a bottle! This is one of THE best anti-aging products I’ve used to date. I received these products for free from influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review. This serum has a beautiful opalescent tint which also brightens dull skin. This makes my skin super soft after cleansing. I’ve noticed my fine lines became minimal after continual use. This product is a Crystal Elixir, so what’s not to love? CT is one of my favorite makeup brands, but now has become one of my favorite skin care brands. If you struggle from fine lines and wrinkles, look no further! #complimentary @Influenster @charlottetilbury HEAVEN IN A BOTTLE
