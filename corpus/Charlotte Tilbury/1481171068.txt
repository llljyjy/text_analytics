I received this from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion, and I WILL be honest here. Pros: Very luxurious, both in packaging and feel. Great as a night cream for my super dry skin. Gives the face a nice glow. Skin felt plumper over time. Cons: Scented (not a strong scent, but might irritate some. I personally like the scent though). Can be finicky. If you use too much, even by the TINIEST amount, it will pill on the skin. Start small and add more as you need. Overall, I REALLY enjoy this cream, but just wish it was completely goof-proof. Lovely, luxurious, but finicky
