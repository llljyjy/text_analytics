I’ve used this for 3 months now and I will buy it again as soon as I run out which will be a while. A little dab will do. I’m on rx Tretinoin and this calms & soothes the dryness, flakes and irritation. I’m 65, with rosacea and dry allergic reactive skin. TIPS:  It’s very thick, so I avoid tugging on my skin by applying it over damp skin that has a thin layer of Hyaluronic Acid cream. I’m using Peter Thomas Roth Cloud Cream over freshly washed damp skin. That gives some “slip” and it seals in the Hyaluronic acid layer so that doesn’t dry my skin out further (common problem with HA). I THEN put my dots of RX Tretinoin (Retinoin) on top, spread that and that gives me a slower time release of the Tretinoin which reduces the skin irritation tremendously. I wake up to smooth calm skin and reduced redness. I splash water on top & go in with Charlotte’s Magic serum for vitamin C and top that off with Magic cream. I’m sold on those 3. Not her other skin care but these are fantastic. Skip the eye cream- save the money because these work there too. Young women with oily skin or who hate a rich thick occlusive cream might hate this- but for older dry fragile skin try using the Hyaluronic acid serum or cream underneath to spread it easily and you might be very happy with the results. It smells of one of the ingredients- the plumeria seed oil but it hasn’t set off my skin and I usually have problems with fragranced skin care. Your mileage on that may vary. It wears off but if you get migraines you might want to try a sample first or buy the small travel jar. I did that before investing in the big jar. LOVE THIS STUFF
