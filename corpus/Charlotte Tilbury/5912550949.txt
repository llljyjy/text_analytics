Solid 4 stars. Emollients are legit but I did get a few blemishes while my skin got used to the new cream nothing a little foundation couldn’t fix but start slow with this one. The cream is so thick it’s impressive. I actually need less product and it sinks in great. Has a light powdery floral scent which I enjoy. It smells for lack of a better word expensive. I love the packaging with most charlotte Tisbury items but this just screams 20’s glam. It’s so pretty I’m gonna have to leave it on my vanity even when it’s used up. So much to love
