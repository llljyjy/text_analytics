I received this product for free from Influenster to review but my thoughts are my own. I love this product! I am a huge Charlotte fan and have used many of the products in the past including the original Magic Cream. I am liking this one even more with the addition of the hyaluronic acid. It is moisturizing without being heavy and has a very light scent. Great product!
