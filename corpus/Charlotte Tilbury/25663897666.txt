This has easily become my favorite moisturizer! This moisturizer feels so luxurious and soaks into my skin effortlessly. It seems very thick coming out of the jar but it literally melts into your skin and does not feel heavy at all. My skin is always left so soft with a subtle glow. It has a lovely scent that is not overpowering at all. My makeup sits wonderfully on top of this moisturizer. I also love that you can buy refill pods instead of having to buy a new glass jar every time. I highly recommend this moisturizer! I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review. Great Moisturizer!
