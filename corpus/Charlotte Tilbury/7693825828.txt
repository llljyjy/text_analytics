I received this product complimentary fromInfluenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchangefor my honest review.There is no doubt why this moisturizer is named Magic Cream. I have been using this product almost daily for four weeks now. This cream is rich and has a light heavenly scent. I immediately noticed my skin appeared more luminous and  radiant. My face feels silky smooth after applying and no irritation or breakouts. I love the ingredients and feel they match well with my other products including actives/treatments. The hyaluronic acid plumps my skin to make my fine lines less defined. Best part is you don’t need a lot of product and the 50ml is packed. The scent is beautiful and lingers for a little bit during my routine but fades. It also plays well with my make up and I don’t really need a primer. It is now has been added to my line up and I will definitely purchase this cream when it runs outI am obsessed with the glass jar and overall presentation. I love the sustainability of the refillable option. A little goes a long way and #magic happens. Magic in a jar!!! I love it
