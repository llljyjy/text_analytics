This is one of the best creams I’ve ever used, no exaggeration.  The jar itself is beautiful and definitely makes a statement, but the cream is truly the star.  It’s thick and very rich going on, but there is no hint of it being greasy or heavy.  It is very moisturizing without congesting my skin and leaves my face plump and luminous.  I like that the cream also contains anti aging ingredients, so that over time it helps erase signs of aging.  I love products that multi task as well bc that means less steps for me.  My skin was improved with minimal use, which is also a plus.  I also like that you can purchase refills for the jar.  Very eco conscious move.  I think everyone should try this for themselves to see how beautiful it really is. nan
