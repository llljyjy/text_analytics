I have been using this creme for past two weeks twice a day. My under eye area is getting less puffy and more hydrated. Works great for my eye messages and under the makeup. I see less lines and darkness. I am recommending this product with my own experience of two weeks. Of course don’t forget to get proper sleep and hydration. Best part about this creme is it doesn’t sting your eyes. Hydration is good for dry aging skin. Just Enough retinol for sensitive under eye area. Magical Under Eye Rescue Creme
