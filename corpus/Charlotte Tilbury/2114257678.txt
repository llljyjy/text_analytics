I loved this! I have always been very into makeup and not as into skincare but, as I approach my mid 30s I know how important it is to step my skincare game up. I love how hydrated and soft my skin felt after using this cream. It instantly felt supple and I was impressed at how that feeling lasted throughout the day. I think I found my new staple! Soft and supple skin
