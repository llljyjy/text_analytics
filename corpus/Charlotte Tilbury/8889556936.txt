I’ve been using this for a month now so I feel I can give honest views on it. Firstly, the fragrance is very earthy which I find to be calming. Secondly, it helps soothe the irritation on my skin (my skin has been reacting badly to products these days). It hydrates in a weightless way, leaving your skin all supple. A little goes a long way so I think it’s cost effective from that perspective. Earthy suppleness
