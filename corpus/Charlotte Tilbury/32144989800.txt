SO GOOD. I adore this product. I waited a little to write this review to really evaluate the effectiveness of the cream. I have terrible dark circles when I wake up, and this eye cream helps. My skin drinks it up and stays hydrated. Puffiness is definitely reduced. Itâ€™s perfect to apply before makeup. Just make sure to wear sunscreen because this product has retinol! LOVE.
