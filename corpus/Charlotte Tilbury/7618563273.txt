I have to give this product nothing less than 5 stars, to start off Charlotte Tilbury provides such a luxurious packaging for her products which I absolutely love. I have used this product for almost two weeks now and have noticed a big different with my under eye being brighter, hydrated and smoother. I noticed that when I use this product before applying my makeup it makes the area so much smoother to apply concealer and gives it a great finish as opposed to before where without applying and using this product before it would get cakey and dry out after some time. The only “con” is really the scent but it honestly doesn’t bother me. They give a good amount of product, a little goes a long way and I genuinely believe the price point for this product is great for the benefits it provides. Will 100% recommend this to my family and friends and will definitely be purchasing a refill once I hit pan. Worked wonders for my under eye
