This serum is luxurious! The bottle is heavy and the dropper works well. The ingredients include crystals listed at the very top of the ingredient list, which is great to note. I’ve been using it twice a day but I haven’t noticed any huge difference. It leaves my skin soft and hydrated, but other than that no notable difference. I will however continue using it, as it feels so nice and luxe on my face! Great Serum!!
