This review was incentivized.  I’m solidly middle aged now and under my eyes is one of the key places my age shows.  I have a lot of trouble with bags and darkness under my eyes plus just a real issue with dryness.  I’ve used other retinol eye creams but they’ve often made that area even dryer, which can become painful.  I love that this cream provides both retinol and really good moisturizing elements as well.  I’ve been using it for about a week and, while I can’t claim a huge change, my under eye area is definitely well moisturized. Love this eye cream!
