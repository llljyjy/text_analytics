This serum is absolutely beautiful and luxurious! It comes in a thick glass bottle with a dropper that works well. It’s lightweight, absorbs quickly and it does feel a little tacky but that goes away after applying my moisturizer. It has a mild fragrance which to me smells like lemons but it’s not overpowering and it doesn’t irritate my skin. This serum helps keep my skin hydrated and gives me a natural looking glow. My favorite part is when I can actually feel my skin tightening as it’s absorbing. I’ve been pairing it with the Magic Cream Moisturizer and my skin is loving it! love it!
