I’m a huge fan of Charlotte Tilbury products and this cream is no exception. I love putting it on before my makeup. My skin type is dry and this makes me feel more moisturized and prepped before putting my foundation on. It’s not greasy like some other creams I’ve used which is ideal since I apply it before my makeup! Worth the hype!
