I received a full size jar of Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream from Influenster, Sephora and Charlotte Tilbury complimentary, for my honest review.  Wow!  That is the first word that comes to mind when I open this amazing luxury in a jar.  From the packaging to the trying of this magic cream, has been a dream come true.  I grew up with the advice from my parents, that first impressions set the stage for the rest of the opinion.  With the Charlotte Tilbury, Magic Cream, this holds true.  Next, the feel of this cream is rich when you rub it into your fingers.  It has a light clean smell to it.  Spreads like magic onto your skin.  Your skin feels so hydrated once applied.  Like it states, this magic cream is infused with hyralonic acid, instantly adds two times hydration to my skin.  My lines appear almost goneâ€¦..Best part is it seems to continue to work on my imperfections daily.  I absolutely love this product!  Thank goodness Charlotte Tilbury created such a revolutionary product for all of us.    Thank you so much for entrusting me to review such an amazing product, that otherwise I would never know about.  I definitely have become a new customer of Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid for instant results.  I suggest you try it too.  #MagicSkin #MagicCream#charlottetilbury#Influenster Luxurious Magic in a Jar.  Extraordinary!!
