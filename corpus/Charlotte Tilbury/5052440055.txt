This is a very luxurious, rich cream with tons of high achieving ingredients: -peptides-vitamins C & E-hyaluronic acid-frangipani flower extract -aloe vera-shea butter-rosehip oil-camellia oilAs you apply it, you can tell this super rich cream absorbs deeply into your skin and gives you a lit from within glow almost immediately. So, 10/10 for moisturizing!The cream is quite heavy, so if you have oily/combination skin like me, this will make your skin very shiny during the day. Iâ€™ve applied it as part of my night time routine and woke up with beautiful skin in the morning. All in all, a great cream, but for me it was too heavy to use twice a day and it is very expensive for $100/jar. I would love to try the light version of this! Lit from within glow
