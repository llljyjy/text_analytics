I am so in love with the Charlotte Tilbury moisturizer. It is just what my make up routine need it. First let me say the packaging is out of this world. Straight off it creates an amazing experience that leads to just beautiful results. The moisturizer is so creamy but not too heavy just the right amount of moisture and prime that you need to set a nice smooth foundation for your foundation. I would definitely recommend this to everyone. A Must Have !!
