This serum definitely presents itself as luxury in a bottle. The applicator and sleek look are lovely. There is a floral scent upon application, but it fades quickly, which might be a relief to those with fragrance sensitivities. Although it does feel quite nice upon application, I woke up the morning after to clogged pores. I have sensitive, acne-prone skin and this formula just doesn’t agree with mine, unfortunately. Too bad because I otherwise enjoy a lot of Charlotte Tilbury products, but this one just wasn’t a match for me. It’s not for me…
