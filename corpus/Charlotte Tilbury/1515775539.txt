I really really wanted to love this.  I adore CT products in general.  This serum feels nice to the touch, the texture is smooth and applies easily, but it makes my skin too oily and greasy for daytime use.  I would absolutely continue to use this at night, but it’s not the perfect serum for me.  I feel more greasy than moisturized and more shiny than glowing.  This would be wonderful for someone with more dry skin. She’s alright…
