I really enjoyed this and wish I had been gifted it in winter rather than spring almost summer. Because it is probably too much for summer time. My skin did feel super soft after even using  it just once. If doesn’t have an over powering smell. It was very think and hard to distribute and get out of jar I felt like I had to go back in and get more.I will keep it in my arsenal but won’t be my every day. super thiccck
