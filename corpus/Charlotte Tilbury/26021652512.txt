Ok, so I gave it some time before doing a review, to ensure I actually gave the product enough time to “do it’s thing“. I have combo skin, with some acne scars, discoloration/hyperpigmentation, and the glorious signs of aging. I do like the texture, thickness, scent, and the way this cream sets into my skin. It’s definitely helped hydrate the parts of my face that are more dry. I think it’s a great moisturizer. However I’m not sure if I’d call it “magic“. I haven’t noticed much, if any improvement of the scarring, pigmentation, or fine lines on my face. Maybe I will with longer/continued use. However I don’t think the name, the promises, and the price  point actually match up. At least at THIS point. But again, it is a really good moisturizer. Really good moisturizer
