After using this eye cream as part of my a.m and p.m face routine for over a month I hardly noticed any change in the fine lines around my eyes. In defense of the eye cream though I donâ€™t have dry skin around my eyes. I was impressed with the light fresh feeling of my eyes after applying and not having a greasy residue remaining. I would recommend this product because I feel that it will benefit others eye routine. Light and fresh eyes
