This has to be the most hydrating moisturizer ive ever used, my face is baby smooth my fine lines have eased up my face looks more youthful. The smell is light and the cream is thick  and a little goes a long way, im beyond  happy to be using this product, this is absolutely  worth it! Dont hesitate! Its worth it!
