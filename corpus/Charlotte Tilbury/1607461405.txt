I received this product free from Charlotte Tilbury and Influenster free in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using this product for a little over 2 weeks now and, while it’s not my first choice, it’s also not my last choice. Because it’s got retinol this product should be used in the evening. Additionally, the formula doesn’t sink in for several hours so it’s not great for wear under makeup. Good For Evening Use
