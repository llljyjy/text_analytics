I’ve heard countless people rave about this cream for years now, to the point that when I finally got to try it out myself, I was almost skeptical about it living up to the hype - in my experience, many “cult favorite“ products end up inevitably being at least a bit (if not more) underwhelming because it creates unrealistic expectations. That said, I stand corrected because it’s TOTALLY WORTH THE HYPE!!!! My skin felt amazing as soon as I applied it, and I woke up the next morning with insanely soft skin! I forgot to take before-and-after photos of the line/wrinkle on my upper forehead, so I can’t say with absolute certainly whether or not there was a visible difference, but it definitely firms/plumps skin. I’ve mostly used this as a night cream rather than a base/primer for makeup, but given the lightweight yet rich texture, I can see it working well under foundations, especially medium/full coverage ones. FYI, a little goes a long way, and even though it sinks in quickly, I’d recommend applying a smaller amount to start and then add more as/if needed. nan
