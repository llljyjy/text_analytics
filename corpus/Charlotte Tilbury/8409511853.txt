I got this moisturizer in my gratis and I really wanted to hate this product because of the price point, but it has become one of my favourite moisturizers. I have sensitive acne prone skin and this moisturizer is gentle enough to not cause a reaction but still hydrate my skin. The only issue I have with this product is the price. Amazing Moisturizer, Not So Amazing Price
