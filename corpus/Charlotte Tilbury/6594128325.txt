It comes in a beautiful glass bottle, with a very nice dropper applicator, which is unique in itself as it’s slanted towards you. 1-2 drops is all you need to cover your entire face, I noticed the moisture as soon as I put the first drop on my face. Once I massaged it around I could instantly see a natural glow and radiance on my skin . It dried very quickly which was nice, didn’t leave any sticky feeling .  After just a little time , I also already noticed a visible difference with firming my face and smoothed out my lines , I can’t wait to see what a difference it makes in a couple weeks .  I look forward to this now being a part of my daily routine. thoughts.
