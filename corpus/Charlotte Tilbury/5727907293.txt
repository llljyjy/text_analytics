I’ve been looking for a great moisturizer and then I received this through Influenster. I appreciate a good shine/dew of a moisturizer. It isn’t thin like water nor is it thick and takes forever to absorb; at least for my combo skin. I think it is a great consistency and it works very well under make up too. Shine through skin!
