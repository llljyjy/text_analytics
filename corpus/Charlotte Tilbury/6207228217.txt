I received this free in exchange for my honest opinion. I absolutely love this face cream. It smells like roses. It’s a little thick but so hydrating! After a couple of uses I definitely saw a reduction in my fine lines. It has a plumping agent in it that didn’t make my skin look weird but sure did make me glow. I very much enjoyed this product and I will continue to use it under my primer and make up routine.  I also use it at night by itself. It’s so luxurious! It’s magic, for real.
