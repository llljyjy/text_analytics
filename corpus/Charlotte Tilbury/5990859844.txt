Charlotte Tlbury never misses! I consider this the first step of my makeup routine and what makes or breaks how the rest of my look turns out. Itâ€™s such a great base for makeup - truly offers amazing hydration, glow, and a little complexion boost. I like to give myself a mini facial massage as I apply to wake up my skin before applying makeup! The product has a soft, light scent. Makeup Magic
