This product absolutely lives up to its name, it really is magic!! I’ve never used a moisturizer that absorbs so fast into the skin as this one. I have normal skin, and I can instantly feel the added hydration after I apply the moisturizer. I purchased one for my mom as well and she loves it too! It’s creamy and rich without being too heavy or greasy, but it does have a slight initial scent that fades away quickly. I personally love using this moisturizer to prep my skin before makeup as a smooth, hydrating base! Truly Magic!
