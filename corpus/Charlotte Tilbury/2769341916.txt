The jar is super cute and comes with a generous amount of moisturizer. The consistency isn’t too greasy and gets absorbed quickly when applied. I loved how it looked under make up and my skin looks flawless. It’s really great for dry skin or used in the winter months. Overall I loved this moisturizer and will purchase again! Great moisturizer
