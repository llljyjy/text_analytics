To start, don’t come for me! I normally love the brand, and I do have VERY dry skin. I had high hopes. The smell is nice, not over powering. The texture of the cream is nice, thick, almost indulgent. And a little goes a long way. That being said, it simply doesn’t absorb into the skin very well. It makes my skin feel like it’s suffocating. I’ve tried for almost two weeks, but wind up having up to clean my face off, every time. There is no way I could/would layer makeup on top of this, and sleeping in it feels almost claustrophobic. I’ve tried using way less product, but it’s the same result. I’m not sure why. I can honestly say it’s not something I would purchase again. #complimentary #magicskin #magiccream @Influenster @charlottetilbury It's...okay-ish
