This lightweight, non greasy, ultra hydrating oil has completely changed the texture and bounce of my skin. Not to mention the blend of essential oils to help calm me before I go to bed. I’ve used this during the day as well when I’m not wearing makeup (oily skin) and it never feels heavy THE BEST OIL YOU WILL EVER TRY
