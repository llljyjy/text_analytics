1. The powder smell reminds you the fine makeup that our grandmothers used, the smell disappears quickly once you applied,3. The packaging is luxurious and looks gorgeous.4. The serum is highly moisturizing and creamier than others.5. you start to see the changes from the first application. I do not recommend it for sensitive skin because polyglutamic acid can irritate the skin.6. I started using it in the morning and at night, in a week I noticed quite significant changes, until my skin got irritated, then I lowered the amount and started applying it only at night and that was enough. Luxury Serum, not recommended for sensitive skins
