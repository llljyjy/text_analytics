Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream Moisturizer is effective and a pleasure to use. The texture is rich, thick, buttery smooth, and luxurious. The consistency is similar to ultra expensive creams above this price point, making it feel like a bargain. My skin drinks it up, and looks instantly softer and smoother. It layers beautifully under makeup and makes my foundation look smoother and prettier. I even love the glass, feminine packaging.  It’s a total win. Luxurious
