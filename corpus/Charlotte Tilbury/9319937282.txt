Fresh out the shower and had to show off one of my favorite new serums! Charlotte Tilbury knocked it out of the park with her Magic Serum Crystal Elixir! My skin soaks this right up without leaving a residue behind. I hate when my face feels tacky or sticky after applying something to it. This has a nice pleasant,almost herbal smell to it. Not very overpowering but very subtle. My face feels very hydrated after using. After a few days of use I feel it has definitely hydrated my face and has a nice glow to it. I did receive this for free to test and review. nan
