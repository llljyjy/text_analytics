I have been looked for a eye cream for awhile now. I was beyond excited to be gifted this eye cream from Charlotte Tilbury and Influenster for my honest review. And my honest review is that I absolutely love it! I have been using it twice a day for several weeks now and I love how it brightens and hydrates my under eye. I couldn’t be more obsessed with this product. Honestly anything I have bought from CT I have fallen in love with. It is pricey but if products work then it’s totally worth it! I recommend this if you are seriously looking for a good eye cream! Love love love!
