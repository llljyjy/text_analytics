I’m a black American. My age is in the low 40s,lol.I have combination skin with more on the oily side.I am in love with this toner.My skin instantly looks smooth and radiant,not shiny,but has a radiant look as if I’ve had a facial. I wanted to change my previous toner and I’m glad I did.Also I live in a humid and hot environment. I would recommend this one! CT Toner A Must-Have
