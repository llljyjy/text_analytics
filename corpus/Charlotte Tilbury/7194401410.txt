This facial cream is packed with oils and vitamins that are essentials for your skin. This facial cream does make my skin really smooth and gives it a slight glow . I received this cream complimentary from influenster and Charlotte Tibury in exchange for my honest review.  Because of how thick it is I can only use a little if I am going to apply makeup . The cream has a very pleasant mild smell which is perfect . If you have dry skin you would love this cream because I was able to tell a difference in the moisturize in my skin after one application.
