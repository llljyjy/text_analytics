I absolutely fell in love with the magic cream and can I just say that I’m obsessed! I use this for prepping before makeup and at night after I wash it off and I have seen a difference in my skin! Texture has gotten lighter and I don’t seem as swollen from my face. I definitely recommend. It has so many amazing ingredients you won’t regret it! Sooo good!
