Ok- I am going to be dead honest. This is just a hyaluronic acid and niacinimide serum. The vit c is one of the last ingredients. For the price, it simply isn’t worth it. BUT, if you have $80 you wanna spend, sure! Get this. It’s not a BAD serum, it’s just simply not worth $80. I’m also not sensitive to scents, so I like this, but if you hate scent, this product is strongly scented. This also is a nice serum to use before makeup. Like I said, if u really wanna spend $80, go for it. Otherwise, there’s other things on the market that will do the same. Not worth $80, but a good serum. Makes skin plump.
