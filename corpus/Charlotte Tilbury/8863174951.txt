This product is one of those moisturizers that is simply satisfying to use. The packaging is an experience all by itself - it’s stunning.As for the moisturizer, it’s a bit more on the heavy side in terms of initial application. However, it’s very cosmetically elegant and settles into your skin quickly. With my dry skin type, this is a good option year round.It’s important to know that there is a rather intense floral smell to this that will not be for everyone. On me, it does fade through the day. Beautiful
