I received this product free through Influenster. I am very impressed with the overall quality. The smell is a little rosy/strong but it goes away with the dry down. This leaves my skin feeling moisturized all day and looks great under makeup. I still feel like I need something heavier at night as this is more of a daytime moisturizer. Great - daytime cream
