I had the opportunity to try this product and I love it! I’ve been using it for the last month daily and have noticed a difference in my skin. My fine lines have gotten so much better! Not all the way gone but definitely not as bad as they were. There’s not really a fragrance and it doesn’t leave my skin oily. I have a new favorite moisturizer and this is it! I highly recommend it if you haven’t tried it yet. Great product!
