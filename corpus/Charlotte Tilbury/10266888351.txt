I got a deluxe sized sample and this product was such a let down. My foundation & concealer looked so patchy, items I love all looked dry and would flake off my face and the only new item used was this product. I had such high hopes, but it did not work for me. Additionally, the texture is incredibly thick. It’s almost like solidified and was very difficult to warm up with my hands. It also has a fragrance that I find to be very outdated.. It smells fancy, but also very old smelling.. Very hard to explain. Not a fan. I would not recommend this product for under makeup, which was my primary use. As a moisturizer I didn’t think the texture was nice. Like I said, it was very hard to warm up and spread. I think there are much better products for a much better price. Makeup looks patchy & dry with this product.
