This was a very thick cream and you use very little. This has a subtle rose scent which I liked. This went on smooth and absorbed well. This made my skin glow after using and actually had two people ask me what I was using differently. My skin is sensitive and I found this did make Mr breakout when I started using it but it cleared up and my skin got used to it and I used it more sparingly. I received them complementary to try and review. nan
