The texture of thus serum is really great it is super easy to apply. However for me it didn’t really seem to make a difference. My skin didn’t look any brighter or smoother. For me it didn’t minimize fine lines either. I will not continue to use the product after this. I think the two biggest turn offs for me was 1. I didn’t see any differences at all and 2. I really was not a fan at all of the way it smelled. Wasn't The Product For Me
