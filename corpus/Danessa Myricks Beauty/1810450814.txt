This is a great dry oil that I love to use in multiple ways! I use it during skin prep when my clientâ€™s skin needs a bit more moisture. I also use this oil to sheer out my cream foundations and it works beautifully without making the foundation oily (if that makes sense). GREAT oil -- I ALWAYS reach for it!
