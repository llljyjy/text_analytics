I received a sample size with my ipsy subscription a few months ago and was shocked at how amazing this oil is. I’ve used oils in the past but they’d sit on the surface of my face and leave my actual skin dry underneath but this oil immediately smooths and softens the skin. I’ve started using it as a base before doing my makeup and I always get a dewy and fresh look and my skin doesn’t dry out as the oil is extremely hydrating. I absolutely swear by this oil. nan
