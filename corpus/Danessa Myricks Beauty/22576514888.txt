I received a sample of this in my Ipsy bag and I genuinely have never felt so strongly about a product. My skin is sensitive and a mix between oily and dry so finding a product that caters to both of those needs is always a challenge. But this beauty oil has solved all of my problems. I used the whole sample to make sure the effects were constant and the results were so incredible that I ordered a full sized bottle. Not only have I noticed a difference in my skin looking bouncier, clearer, and more radiant but others are constantly commenting on my skin as well. Iâ€™m weird about oils being too heavy and this one is so light that it has made its way into my makeup routine by adding a drop to my foundation. Overall, the product is amazing and Danessa Myricks & her team did an outstanding job on this beauty oil. An absolute must-have
