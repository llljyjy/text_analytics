I believe I received this in a boxycharm box and I really enjoyed it but I don’t see it as a must in my skincare routine. I used up two of these (my mom didn’t want hers) It sinks into your skin nicely and when I woke up my skin looked plump and hydrated and super soft. I used this when I was feeling super dry and it perked up my skin instantly. But I feel like it’s a step I don’t really need in my routine so I won’t repurchase. Enjoyed it while I had it though. Maybe once it’s out of my routine and I see a huge difference I’ll buy it again but as of right now I’m not gonna go out of my way to buy it. nan
