After a couple days of using this I had major breakouts. I have never had skin this bad. I started to research this product and realized it has Lactococcus Ferment Lysate and Yogurt Powderâ€¦ aka dairy! Whyyyy would they have us rubbing dairy on our face when dairy is known to cause breakouts. Dairy disaster!
