I got this is part of my fabfitfun box and I was so excited to finally try this because I’ve heard good things about it although I didn’t know much about it. Unfortunately, this product is not for me. I used it two times before I needed tell scrub my face clean. The scent is so powerful. It’s not even like delicately fragrance, but it is so overwhelmingly floral from that lavender. I’m not even particularly sensitive to scents, but this was just so overpowering. Also, for those who aren’t aware, apparently this has patchouli oil which I did not know before I decided to choose it as an option from my box. Patchouli oil can cause adverse reactions in the skin. After using this product for the second time, I had little bumps, my eyes felt like they were burning, and my skin just felt...not good. Which is a shame because so many other people seem to be having great luck with it. But I will never be using again and instead I’ll just go back to my Inn Beauty moisturizer. not for me
