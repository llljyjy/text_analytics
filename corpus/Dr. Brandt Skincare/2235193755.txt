This is the only brand of skincare I’ll use.  I loved the Blemishes No More line but since they discontinued that this is the next best thing.  I have very oily skin and this stuff keeps it at bay long enough to make it through the day.  It also helps me not break out constantly.  I’m 50 years old and have probably tried every cleanser on the market for oily, blemish prone skin and this is the only product I’ve found that works for me. I Love Dr. Brandt Products
