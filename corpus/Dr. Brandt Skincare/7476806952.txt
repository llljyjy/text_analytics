Excellent Hydration & Super Gentle.  This is my holy Grail and I have started using not only as a mask, but as my daily moisturizer (just a thinner layer) since I react or breakout to almost every other moisturizer I’ve tried. This mask/moisturizer is the only one (out of close to a hundred - yes, I’m a product addict!) I’ve tried that does NOT make me breakout, hydrates my skin well and is non irritating. Great for dry, sensitive skin, acne prone skin
