Mineral sunscreen that doesn’t leave a white cast! My screen looks dewy after applying but not greasy. I’ve been using this sunscreen for a few months. I haven’t really noticed a difference in my hyperpigmentation. Minus one star because the dropper sucks!! I’m on my third bottle and the dropper sucks on all of them. I found a screw on cap that fits so I just removed the dropper entirely. Would be great if they updated the packaging. Nice mineral sunscreen; terrible dropper!
