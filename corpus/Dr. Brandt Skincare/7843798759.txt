This has become a must for winter skincare for me! It’s helped kick my dry flaky skin and gives me such a nice natural glow!I absolutely love the texture and scent of this. It’s thick and gritty but not too much. It feels nice as it’s applied and is super satisfying to feel it exfoliating my skin. I also love the cooling sensation my skin gets after I start rinsing.It exfoliates really well and made my skin look so smooth. I really loved how it helped get rid of some dark spots where I’d had breakouts along my chin. I began noticing my fine lines were smoother too! which definitely made me happy! The scent however, even though it’s very light, gave me a bit of a headache when I used it. But if I used it in the shower instead of at the sink, it didn’t seem to irritate me. So if you’re sensitive to fragrances I would be careful.I love that I don’t need to use a lot of it. Very little goes a long way. My favorite part is the cooling sensation it had at the end. It was really refreshing.Definitely patch test (like you should) before using it all over your face. I have semi sensitive skin and most of my skin was fine and didn’t react, but on my more sensitive parts of my face it did irritate some.I think this would be perfect for anyone with dry skin, especially in the winter. It helped knock out my dry winter skin. I usually have dry patches once the cold weather sets in, but this kept them away. My skin felt soft and smooth! It was brighter and I had a nice natural looking glow when I used it every few days. Winter must!
