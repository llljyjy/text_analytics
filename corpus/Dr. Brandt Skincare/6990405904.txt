This stuff is amazing. It softens the skin with just a tiny amount of product. If you like a moisturizer to be unscented, this is not for you. However, I personally adore the smell. I think it is mainly lavender. Wonderful before bed. Very expensive stuff, but I wouldnâ€™t be without it. Just amazing...
