There is a small gritty feeling, but it is not intolerable for me. I do feel a slight menthol tingle when I first apply the product, but it disappears within 2 seconds. The packaging is sleek and easy to use. I wish it came with more, and didn’t have that “menthol“ tingle, other than that I am in love with this product. Worth Having In A Regime
