The product has a pleasant aroma and delicate texture.  The product spreads easily over the skin.  Scrubbing particles are very small, clean very gently without scratching the skin. I use the product twice a week.  I apply immediately after washing on damp skin and massage for about two minutes, then rinse off - it is washed off easily.  Thanks to menthol, when applied, there is a cooling effect on the face.  The result is noticeable after the first application: the skin becomes smoother and more elastic, visually looks refreshed and rested, there is not the slightest feeling of dryness or tightness. I am absolutely delighted with this tool!  I love that feeling of freshness and cleanliness. Great product!
