The first bottle I got was from the vacay all day set. The dropper worked well and I loved the product. I couldn’t tell how much was left in the bottle so I purchased another bottle to have on hand. When I went to use the new bottle the dropper didn’t work. I even tried using the old dropper in the new bottle, still did not work. I tried to exchange it but my exchange was refused because it was just past the 60 days. I have learned not to stock up on product because you might end up with a $65 bottle of sunscreen you can not use. You think at the least they would exchange a defective product, not Sephora.
