Let’s start with, I have combination skin. My T zone with addition to cheek bones is where my skin fluctuates the most with environmental conditions/new products I decide to test...  This mask was just alright! It’s more so a novelty, cool to try once. The magnetic would get caught to other items in my wash bag. (I learned to wrap it in tissue first) I mean it gave me a bit of hydration/slip on my skin.. But I wasn’t feeling blown away. There are definitely better masks out there for this price point.  It’s almost mess free as the magnetic clears away the mask. But again.. I’d possibly recommend this for a girls night slumber party.. Get a few magnets & enjoy the experience together. I got a few uses out of this, it also allowed me to let my friends have a try at this magnet mask. Going to give this one a miss!
