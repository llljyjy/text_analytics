This is a wonderful microdermabrasion product!  This one of a few that didn’t leave my skin red and dry. I have been using 2x a week for about 4 weeks. I noticed right away that the product reminded me of fine sand that didn’t scratch but could feel it exfoliating my skin. Afterward, my face felt so smooth and my makeup applied smoother. After a couple of weeks, I can see fine lines seem to be diminishing a little. I will continue to keep using this product and my face will continue to be soft, smooth and hydrated. Product description claims: 97% of ing are of natural origin, physical exfoliation with biodegradable micro-granules and chemical exfoliation by using AHAs glycolic and lactic acid t resurfaces textural irregularities and diminishes the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
