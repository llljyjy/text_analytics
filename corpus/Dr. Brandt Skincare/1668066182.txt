I’ve been using this for a couple weeks and I haven’t noticed a huge difference in the appearance of my skin, but the texture does seem softer. The physical exfoliants feel like soft microbeads and are very gentle. The glycolic acid is great for my acne-prone skin. My skin does feel on the drier side after using, but a heavy moisturizer easily fixes that. Gentle exfoliation for softer skin
