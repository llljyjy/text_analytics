I am a huge fan of Dr. Brandt’s microdermabrasion exfoliator and have been using it for years. I was excited to try this product and wow it is terrible. First I don’t like the smell very much, but more importantly it can’t be helpful when it comes off your skin and gets all over your clothes no matter if I apply it before bed it right after a shower.  Silly me thought maybe I had a bad batch and bought it a send time and nope it’s still terrible. I can’t understand why anyone would rate this product highly.. Awful
