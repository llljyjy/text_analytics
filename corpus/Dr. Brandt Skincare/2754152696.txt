I really like this sunscreen. I got it in the summer sunscreen kit, so it was a great value. I hate wearing sunscreen because they always feel too heavy or white, or smell bad. I also don’t like using the chemical ones out of caution. So I was excited to try this sunscreen and I do find that it’s really nice. I can get myself to put it on most days. I would say it is white but leaves very little color cast once blended in. It’s a very dewy feel, it goes on almost like an oily serum which I actually prefer. I pretty much use it instead of moisturizer because it would feel too thick for me on top of moisturizer since it is already moisturizing by itself. I did not have an issue with the dropper yet like other people have mentioned. Overall I would recommend this and I will probably buy it again. Nice zinc based sunscreen
