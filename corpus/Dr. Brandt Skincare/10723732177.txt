The smell is very citrusy. I’d love an unscented version. The Texture is that of a lemon sugar mix. Easy to dispense simple tubing. It definitely works! Im loving the ease of use and that it makes my skin so soft & smooth.It helps turnover dead skin cells! Anyone that doesn’t have super sensitive skin that wants to gently resurface their skin Soft & smooth skin!
