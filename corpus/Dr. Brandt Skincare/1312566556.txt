I received this in my FFF box and am pleasantly surprised! My skin is so soft!  I am glad I didn’t read about the scent since I would have been hesitant to try it. Nonetheless, I don’t mind it and it seems to dissipate quickly. I will say I don’t care for the packaging! It’s a waste and could probably be cheaper without it. nan
