First time I used this product I wasn’t really impressed as I didn’t see a difference. Two days later i used it again and I noticed the pores on my chin had little white bumps. Another two days later which was my third treatment I can see my pores are being cleaned out !!! The gunk in my pores are  coming to the surface  ( gross I know ) I have never used a product like this in my life and I have been using Zo skincare for the last 10 years. As other reviews have stated yes it stinks but who cares if it works. I prefer companies don’t mask products with perfume or essential oils. It is what it is !Definitely buying this again ! nan
