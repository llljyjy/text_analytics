The packaging is a lovely matte black, in a perfect low waste squeeze tube.  It has a lightly gritty texture similar to fine sand and a light delightful scent that is mild and not overpowering in any way.  It feels like it’s working when your rub your skin, but doesn’t feel damaging or harsh in any way.As soon as I put it on my skin and started to rub, I knew I was going to enjoy this as my new physical exfoliating part of my routine.  I like to feel the scrub when removing the dead skin and other unpleasantness from my skin and this gives me that satisfaction.I also like that this is a dual exfoliating product giving both the physical scrub and AHA for a chemical exfoliating double punch to help resurface the skin.I would recommend taking this one slow.  I am currently using this twice a week, any more than that and I feel your skin may get angry.I would recommend this to everyone, but especially those with rough texture or aging skin that needs a little buff and polish. A new exfoliating love for my skin
