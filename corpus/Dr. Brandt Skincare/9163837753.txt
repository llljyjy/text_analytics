The Microdermabrasion Renewing Age-Defying Face Exfoliator by Dr. Brandt Skincare is a great solution for my combination type skin, uneven texture, fine lines, wrinkles and moderate acne. It delivers double exfoliation to skin. It acts like a physical exfoliator at first and if you leave it on your face for a little bit it turns to a chemical peel.This product is cruelty free, vegan, 97% natural microdermabrasion exfoliator has a new formula to exfoliate and smooth skin. This exfoliator also gently removes dead skin cells, encourages faster cell turnover. After using it twice a week, for a few weeks, my skin has much more even textured, radiant and youthful look. It also helps skin to better absorb products next in your routine. I would recommend it everyone who would like to transform their skin into nourished, polished, refreshed and younger looking skin.
