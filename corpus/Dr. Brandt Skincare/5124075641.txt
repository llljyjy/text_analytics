I’ll admit, I didn’t care for this serum when I first started using it. It felt greasy when applying it and it has a weird herbal smell, but looking at my skin I will say that this stuff truly works! My skin looks bright, glowy, and healthy! I usually blot my face with tissue after applying my moisturizer to get rid of any excess oil and that seems to work. This product has some really good ingredients too. I usually trust that a product works if I see it has good ingredients but this is one of the few products I’ve used where I actually see a difference in my skin. Bright, healthy looking skin
