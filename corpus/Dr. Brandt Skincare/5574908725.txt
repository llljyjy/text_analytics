I wish I could get refunded but kept it too long to see if at some point it would work. It actually made my skin worse. Sometimes I’d actually have to wash it off because it burned & would leave my skin bright red. I have combination skin & if I left it on overnight, I’d wake up to my skin flaking off. Very disappointed. Wish I could get a refund
