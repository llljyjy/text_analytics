The scent was pleasant, the texture is perfect for a microdermabtasion scrub.The packaging has a clean modern look with subtle hints of artistic expression. Perfect for this line of products.This is one of my favorite cleansing products. My skin suffers from congestion, and using this gentile scrub feels like a spa day. The way it exfoliates is perfection and releases firmer and me supple skin.Over a few weeks I notice the visible deeper layers of skin damage are healing and healthier, smoother skin is surfacing.If someone has sensitive skin they should slowly increase their usage. This type is scrub isnâ€™t meant to be rubbed harshly into the skin, soft repetitions of circular motions will release the beauty underneath.I have recommended to family and friends Absolutely Love this Product
