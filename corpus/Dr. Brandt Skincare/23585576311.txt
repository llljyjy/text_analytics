I got this in a kit a while ago and am finally almost done with it. For how much it’s listed you’d think the dropper would be better. I have eczema prone skin, thankfully this didn’t trigger or irritate it but it doesn’t smell good. Does give you a nice glow if you like your skin to be glowy/dewy. nan
