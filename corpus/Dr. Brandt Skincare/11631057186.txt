When I first received this, I was so excited.  I had used the old type from Dr. Brandt and thought this will be great as well.  The box is plain, and the component is perfect to be able to leave in the shower.  I love to leave mine in the shower, so it is there on the days I use it since you use it only 2 times a week.  The product when dispensed is just a normal and you cannot see the physical exfoliant till you move it around.  There is a scent that reminds me of a Lemon Meringue Pie almost identical it takes me to desert in a restaurant when using it.  After about a month of use I can say honestly, I love it.  My skin feels softer and looks healthier to me also. Perfect For the Shower
