This cruelty free, vegan, 97% natural microdermabrasion exfoliator has a new formula to exfoliate and smooth skin. It is great if you have dull skin, uneven texture, fine lines, wrinkles or acne scars. It delivers double exfoliation to skin, being both physical and chemical. This exfoliator also gently removes dead skin cells, encourages faster cell turnover, sweeps away impurities and gives skin a more even textured, radiant, youthful look. It also helps skin to better absorb products next in your routine. After use, skin is nourished, polished, refreshed and ready to combat signs of aging. I love how this Microdermabrasion Exfoliator makes my skin look and feel. My dull skin is immediately brightened and looks much healthier. Just twice a week massaging it on for 2 minutes for skin transforming results. WOW!
