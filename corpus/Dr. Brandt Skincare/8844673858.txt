So shocked by the product. I never leave reviews but this moisturizer should never be advertised for dry skin. This made my skin not only feel tight and dried out but it mattified my natural glow. I have combination skin and was looking for a moisturizer that fully hydrated my skin and this did the opposite. This should be offered as a primer if anything… do not recommend. NOT FOR DRY SKIN. This is a matifying primer…
