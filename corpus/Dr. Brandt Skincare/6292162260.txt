I’ve dealt with genetically large pores and texture issues and I have tried everything from microdermabrasion to countless retinols and other skincare products. None of them have done for my skin what this moisturizer has. As someone who has been through a million of those little tatcha dewy skin cream samples with no noticeable results compared to my usual cerave route, I was not expecting much from this pricey option when it showed up in my Ipsy Glam Bag X box last year. Boy was I wrong. Within a week I noticed my pores appeared smaller and my makeup was going on more smoothly. The full-sized container wound up lasting me just under 3 months and while I didn’t want to justify the price for a moisturizer as a full-time grad student, Sephora offering Klarna allows me to continue to enjoy this product and be able to love my skin! My only complaint (aside from the priciness) would be that the packaging is bulky and heavy and not the most eco-friendly. I would love maybe a refillable option for those of us who buy this product regularly! life-changing moisturizer
