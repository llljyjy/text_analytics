This is the best travel size Iâ€™ve tried before. Compared to other travel sizes, these products come in a larger size, ideal for a long trip. The serum is quite moisturizing and seals the hydration of the skin very well, I like it for night use. The creams are slightly heavy but once you apply them to your skin they spread and absorb very well without leaving your skin greasy or clumpy. I will definitely get the serum and the eye cream again. Great value size for a long trip !
