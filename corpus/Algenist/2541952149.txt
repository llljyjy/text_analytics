I did enjoy the Algenist Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm. As I age, the area around my skin is drier than normal and this eye balm definitely delivers moisture. It is so moisturizing that by the end of the day I can still feel it on my skin. It is not a greasy balm and I did see that my dark circles were very slightly improving. This is a decent eye balm. I just canâ€™t get past the price point. It is pricey. nan
