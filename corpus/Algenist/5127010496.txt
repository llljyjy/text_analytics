This was gifted by Algenist and i started using this eye cream in hopes it would help my concealer lay nicer throughout the day after continued use and it most definitely helped. My under eyes have been significantly less dry and much less creased while I’m wearing makeup through the day. I was nervous about the consistency of this product being too thick as I am prone to milia but it was perfect and didn’t clog my under eyes! Great to combat dry under eyes
