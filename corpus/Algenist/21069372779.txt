First, PinchMe sent me a generous sample for which I’m quite thankful because I wouldn’t have found this product otherwise!Next, I was impressed with the results on the skin surrounding my eye area.  I have dark circles and really did not see a reduction in color but believe the improved skin made them less noticeable and easier to camouflage with concealer.I’d also like to note it’s expensive IMHO but a small amount is needed so in reality it’s a great bargain; and worth the cost! Worth it!
