I’m not really sure if I like the Algenist Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm with Multi-Peptide Complex. It feels nice and it definitely hydrates, but I’m not sure that it does it any better than my other eye creams and serums. I think I would probably need to use it for a few months before seeing any significant changes. nan
