Algenist is a brand that my mom and I reach for often. This eye balm immediately hydrated and slightly deputed my under eye area. I also noticed a slight difference in the darkness under my eyes. I haven’t noticed a dramatic difference in fine lines yet, but I’ve only used this for a week. I am hopeful, though, based on how other Algenist products have worked for us. *complimentary from Algenist Hydrating!
