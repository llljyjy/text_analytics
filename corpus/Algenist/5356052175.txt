Algenist triple algae eye renewal balm is just an okay product. I feel like my wrinkles are my pronounced after 3 weeks of use. My skin does feel more hydrated and I do like the feeling of this product. It is fairly creamy, but goes on like a light Vaseline. There is no real scent, which I like very much. Too often facial products have a strong scent, and who is that for? Weird. Not worth the money
