gifted by Algenist. First I’ll start with the couple of things that bother me about this product. First of all topical collagen does not do anything for the skin so I don’t like that that is advertised. There is also fragrance in the products which isn’t my favorite. However that being said I really really have enjoyed using these products. They have a beautiful consistency and a soothing effect on the skin. I feel like my skin has looked more plump and radiant since I’ve started using this. I really do like it a lot! I think my favorite of the trio is the eye cream which is great because it is the one full-size product. I like it!
