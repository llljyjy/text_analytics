I really love this collagen. I’ve always taken collagen supplements but this is the first time I’ve used a liquid collagen meant for external use and this is really a lovely product. The bottle is nice size and it’s very pretty. The pump works wonderfully! Its much better than the droppers that sometimes come with serums. I use about 3 pumps to cover my face and neck. There is barely a scent to this and what tiny scent there is, is fresh and clean smelling. It doesn’t smell like perfume or like something was added strictly for scent. It’s a very functional smell if that makes sense. I’ve been using this for about a week and a half and I really love the way my skin feels. This product was gifted by Algenist. Great Collagen
