I used this product over the recommended 10 days, and I did notice changes.  When you first apply, there is a tingling and cool sensation.  I would recommend to not use the product alone as it can be drying.  The best way is to use a balm on top of the product when you’re going au naturale.  Apply twice daily though it says you can use it more often, I probably wouldn’t do so.  This lip collagen does what it says in terms of preventing bleeds and feathering.  my lip color was staying put for many hours. Effective, but use minimally
