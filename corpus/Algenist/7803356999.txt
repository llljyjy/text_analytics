I use this as directed for about 10 days and I can honestly say I saw no difference whatsoever. In fact my under eyes actually felt a little bit more dry than before I started using this and the times it irritated my under eyes and felt like it dried it down and made my under eyes feel tight. I gave it to my mom to try out but she said the same thing about it. I wouldnâ€™t recommend this, pricey and not really doing anything for us. Complimentary from Algenist. Not for me
