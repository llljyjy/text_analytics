I used this eye cream twice a day for two weeks before I saw some results. The results weren’t instant but gradual. I noticed my under-eye area appears to be smoother and firmer. The fine-lines under my eyes also look minimized.The key ingredients of the balm are alguronic acid, triple algae, and a skin-responsive Multi-Peptide Complex that claim to hydrate and brighten the under-eye area.  I didn’t see much improvement for my under-eye puffiness or dark circles though. The eye cream is great for sensitive eyes (I have applied it overnight and it didn’t irritate my eyes). The texture is creamy white and light in consistency. It doesn’t feel sticky or greasy as other eye creams.I would definitely recommend this eye cream to people with aging eyes. I would advise someone using this balm to have patience and use the cream consistently to see some changes. Smooth under eyes areas
