This serum is decadently moisturizing and leaves my skin feeling cared for. The plumping and overall long-lasting collagen nutrients are an incredible way to take care of your skin and this product truly feels luxurious to use. I am not a fan of the price of this product,  I think it’s very overpriced, but to be fair this productively much meets the quality that you’d expect at this price point. If you have the money, it’s worth it. Otherwise there are options almost as good for much less. This product was gifted by Algenist. Decadently Moisturizing
