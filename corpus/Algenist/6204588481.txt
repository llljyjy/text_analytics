I love this Algenist Resurfacing Toner! After 1 day of using my skin felt so fresh and clean and my pores looked smaller.  After 10 days I noticed a significant reduction in my leftover acne marks and my skin was much much smoother.  Toner usually irritate my skin, but this one did not. I would highly recommend giving it a try.  It is my holy grail facial toner now.  Side note: I would recommend using an SPF while using this product.  I received Algenist complimentary from Algenist for my honest opinion. Smooth skin!
