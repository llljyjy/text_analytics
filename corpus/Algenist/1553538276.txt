Love this mask. It really does seem to calm and balance the skin. I love the idea of the mask rejuvenating the skin biome. Who knows if thatâ€™s actually happening... but there are immediate results. No outbreaks after and quick use. No sitting around for 25 minutes waiting for it to dry. Great mask!
