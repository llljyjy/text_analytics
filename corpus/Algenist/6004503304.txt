I received the sample version and I have very sensitive skin. I did notice that there was a slight tingly feeling after applying. But overall, the quality of the product is good. It does seem to my under eyes brighter, especially on the days I don’t get enough sleep. I don’t think that I would spend the money right now as it’s not a necessity in my 20’s. But I would definitely recommend it to my mother who would definitely benefit from this product. Something I would use in the future
