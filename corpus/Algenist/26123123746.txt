i purchased this product for preventative skincare more than “i need results” skincare, so i cannot speak on it’s effectiveness…but i absolutely love this! it gives a great experience and is so moisturizing. in my opinion, it’s a really good value because you need so little of the product. i just barely tap my finger in the cream and it is enough for both of my eyes! love it!
