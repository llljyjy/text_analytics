I absolutely love this set for four reasons: 1. It absorbs immediately into my combination skin and keeps it moisturized without making it greasy looking. 2. The set will last more than 10 days.3. The serum comes in a pump and comes out effortlessly 4. It wears beautifully under makeup I use all three products in the morning starting with serum, eye cream and moisturizer and follow it up with foundation.  The only con which is not a big con but the serum is scented it’s not obnoxious but it’s there you can smell it for those sensitive to scent. I would highly recommend you try this set Highly recommend this set
