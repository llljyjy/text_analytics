When I first got this I used it in the morning and it was a little too much for my combination skin; but now it’s my staple night routine item. I read that collagen is mostly for moisturizing when applied topically so I’m not upset when I’m not seeing a ton of plumping effect (honestly I don’t believe anything that’s applied on the skin’s surface can plump lol), but man this thing nourishes the skin well. I was getting a ton of pimples along my jawline and it pretty much has stopped ever since I started using this. The scent is soft, and the product is gentle enough to be paired with most other serums and creams I have. Very happy and will continue to buy. LOVE
