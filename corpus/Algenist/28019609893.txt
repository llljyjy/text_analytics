I’ve tried samples of this eye cream in the past and like it, and now I’ve used it for longer, I like it even better. The consistency is great. Not too thick, spreads and absorbs nicely. Smells a little like grains, but the scent is very light, hardly noticeable. Instantly hydrating but doesn’t weight it down or give me milia, it plumps up the area so my wrinkles look less pronounced. Gifted by Algenist. nan
