This is such an amazing way to try out some really great products. It’s enough to see if it’s going to work for you personally. I always snag a few holiday sets and I’m glad I got to try this one. The collagen feels really nice on the skin and absorbs quickly. The eye cream is thick but absorbs and doesn’t sit on the skin. The moisturizer is perfect for the dry winter time without being heavy. It all has my skin looking plump and healthy. Gifted by Algenist. Lovely set.
