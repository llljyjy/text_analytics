I used Algenist Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm twice daily for 10 days. The rich formula has a creamy consistency that melts into skin immediately. It feels weightless and leaves no residue or greasy feel on skin. The balm was compatible with my other skincare products and sat well under my makeup. Within 48 hours of using the balm, I saw improvement in the puffiness under my eyes and my dark circles. Throughout the 10 day trial, the results got better and better.  My undereyes look smoother and firmer, my dark circles have nearly disappeared altogether, and I haven’t been waking up with puffy bags under my eyes anymore. The formula is moisturizing and the hydration lasts for hours.This product delivered on it’s promises. My undereyes look brighter, smoother, and firmer in only 10 days. The formula feels silky smooth when applied and is very gentle on skin, I had no irritation or sensitivity issues. I plan to continue using this product and recommend it for anyone who has puffiness, dark circles, bags, or lines around their eyes. Delivers Noticable Results Fast
