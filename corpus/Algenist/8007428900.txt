I have used Algenist before and haven’t always been a fan. When I started this resurfacing toner I have felt like I wasn’t seeing changes at first, but after two weeks I had started to see some. My dark spots were noticeably different and I started to feel my skin become refreshed again. This was gifted by Algenist in exchange for my honest review. nan
