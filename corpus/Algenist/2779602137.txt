This Genius Liquid collagen from Algenist is one of my new favorite products! As someone who reviews so much skincare, that’s a tough honor to win. I loved the packaging but for some reason, was expecting it to be a watery serum. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised and how soft it was, reminded me almost of the Smashbox Poreless primer. It’s insanely beautiful to smooth skin before makeup, so I’ve been reaching for it more during the day. My skin after one week of consistent use feels more soft, plump, and just dewy. This was complimentary from Algenist, but I really do love it! Really soft serum, so plumping!
