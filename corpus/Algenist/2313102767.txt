I got a small size with my points because I’ve always had good luck with collagen products and wanted to try this one, but I couldn’t even finish the small size due to the heavily perfumed fragrance that does not dissipate. I did have issues with the bottle dropper as well which seems to be fixed in the new version of this product, but the smell is a deal breaker. If I wanted to wear perfume in the first place, it definitely would not be all over my face in a skincare product. I may try to wash out and keep the bottle dropper to use for other products. Huge fail and waste of a 100 points. nan
