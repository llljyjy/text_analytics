I’ve been using ALGENIST TRIPLE ALGAE EYE RENEWAL BALM for about a month and am loving the results. The skin under my eyes is definitely smoother and not as dark. Honestly speaking, I’m super busy during the day and sometimes forget to apply it for a few days but I can still see the effects, if that makes sense. Also a little goes a long way, so this will last for a while. Really Love This
