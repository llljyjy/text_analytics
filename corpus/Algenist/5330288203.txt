Gifted by Algenist. Older reviews mention difficulty with the dropper. This product now has a pump instead that makes it easy to use and dispenses the perfect amount. You don’t need a lot of product so the pump is nice to make sure you don’t use more than you need. It has a slight smell but nothing overpowering in my opinion. It has made my skin feel nice and hydrated but I haven’t used it enough to see a difference in fine lines. nan
