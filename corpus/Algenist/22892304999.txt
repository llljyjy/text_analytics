I was excited to use this product around my eye area to minimize fine lines + dark circles. This has a nice texture to it and no irritation after 2 weeks so far. Haven’t used long enough for dramatic change in appearance yet, but it is a good moisturizer. It goes a long way. It’s light and smooths on easily.  It feels like silk & brightens up my skin nan
