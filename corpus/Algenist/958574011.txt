The Algenist Algae Eye Renewal balm is just what I was looking for! I have been alternating this with my Kate Somerville retinol eye cream. This is amazing at moisturizing my under eyes which typically get dry from my retinol. This also helps with puffiness, fine lines, and circles. I have been a fan of Algenist for a while now, and will keep this eye cream in my arsenal. I have treid so many eye creams, and I feel like most of them really donâ€™t do much. I can honestly say that I do have great results from using this eyecream. Actually Works!
