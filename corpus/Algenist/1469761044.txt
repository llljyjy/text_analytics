Honestly I never liked serums because I had a preconceived assumption that they were thin and oily. I was so wrong. I’ve been using serums over the last year as I nail down a more regimented skincare routine. I’m 31 and taking skincare more seriously. I have extremely dry skin and I’ve been applying the algenist collagen serum after I cleanse/tone. After using the genius collagen serum and a moisturizer for a week, my skin looks more glowy and plumped up instead of dry and tired. Gifted by Algenist. Integral part of my routine
