Gifted by Algenist. This kit is perfect for trying the Algenist products, and would make a great gift! Also great for travel. The liquid collagen is holy grail for a reason. It’s so hydrating and really revitalizes the skin. So far I’m really enjoying the eye cream and moisturizer too. I can’t wait to see the long term results after a few more weeks. The moisturizer is really rich and perfect for the colder months. This eye cream is great for depuffing, which is perfect for early mornings. A great kit for gifting or travel!
