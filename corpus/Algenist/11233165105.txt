I received this complimentary from Algenist. I think this is a great set to try out the products. I have been using the eye cream on my eyes as well as my “11“s. It doesn’t last long term yet but after I use it for a little bit my hooded eyes don’t seem to be as hooded. I am hoping with continue use this will last longer.  There is no scent. the moisturizer feels very hydrating. I do have to make sure to allow enough dry time between the serum and the moisturizer otherwise I do get some pilling. Great gift set
