The liquid collagen has benefited my skin after using it for 10 days so far. The formula is very hydrating and is made of a thick consistency that I love putting all over my face after cleansing my face and before putting my moisturizer on during my skin care routine. My face feels so smooth and soft after using this skincare product. My elevens on my face have always been something I’ve noticed and this liquids collagen has seemed to reduce the appearance of them and that makes me very happy. I love this product and would recommend to anyone wanting to reduce fine lines and wrinkles while using a hydrating serum and also strengthening your skin at the same time. “Gifted by Algenist” Hydrating and Strengthening serum!
