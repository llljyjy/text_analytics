Used the Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm with Multi-Peptide Complex for about 12 nights continuously under my eyes. I’m 30 and have one deep wrinkle under each eye. To me it seemed like by the end of my trail with the product, the lines looked a bit more blurry, but I’m not entirely sure. I wonder if the results would be more clear if I used it for a much longer period. I didn’t notice a scent, which was nice. The biggest con to me is the steep price point. Pricey but perhaps promising for long term use
