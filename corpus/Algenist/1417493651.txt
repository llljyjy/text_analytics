I’m almost 43, so I love that this Algenist Genius Liquid Skin Resurfacer can help with hormonal skin concerns, including blemishes, wrinkles, and loss of firmness. Even after one use, it felt refreshing and like it was doing something. I’m excited that after 10 days this product can visibly improve skin radiance and glow, reduce the appearance of pores, and help skin feel smoother, healthier, and restored. Algenist recommends using SPF while using this product.*Gifted by Algenist Great anti-aging toner
