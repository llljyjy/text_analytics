I received this product from PinchMe for my honest review. I am always very skeptical when using beauty products I’ve never heard of but Algenist Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm was a game changer. It’s a thick moisturizer that absorbs quickly and really have a smell. I used this for 10 days and would definitely say I noticed a difference. This feels and works like a very high end moisturizer. Just try it!
