I received Algenist new product liquid skin toner as a gifted by Algenist for my honest review. This does come with 2% bha toner.  This is an amazing toner I have seen so much improvement with my skin. My pores are cleaner and my skin is brighter. I use this after cleansing my face. Rubbing it on my face lightly not to rub to hard on my skin. Then I add my serum and moisturizer. My skin felt fresh and extremely clean after application. This has patented and exclusive alguronic acid. Thatâ€™s to smooth lines and wrinkles.  This has made my skin firmer and softer. Reducing the appearance of my fine lines and my blemishes extremely. Absolutely one of my favorite products and I defiantly recommend. Fresh skin
