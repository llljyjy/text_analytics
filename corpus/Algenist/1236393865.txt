Wow, this product actually prevents lipstick feathering and bleeding!  I never thought I’d see the day when the red lipstick I love would last for over two hours without that nasty bleeding or feathering.  I used it for about a week and a half at least twice a day and saw fantastic results.  It went on smooth, felt a little cool and tingly which meant it was working, and not only did the lipstick last, I didn’t have the peeling and flaking I normally would get after having lipstick on for that long.  I will be using this and feeling free to wear my red (and dark plum in winter) colors without worrying about looking old.  Thank you Algenist! This prevents lipstick feathering!
