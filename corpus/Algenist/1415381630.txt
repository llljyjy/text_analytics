I’ve been using this serum before my moisturizer in the evening and have noticed that my skin looks plumper and healthier.  It really hydrates my skin without making it feel greasy or breaking me out. I love the pump bottle since it’s easy to use and dispenses the perfect amount of serum. This was gifted by Algenist. Leaves skin hydrated and plumper
