I recently used ALGENIST TRIPLE ALGAE EYE RENEWAL BALM for 10 days, morning and night. Nearing 50, I’ve had dark, puffy circles and recently fine lines are really noticeable. I’ve used several other eye creams, which many worked well with one problem or another. Algenist targeted all 3 of my problem areas in just 10 days. It’s rich and creamy, glides on my delicate under-eye area like butter. If you are loosing the battle against age,  I highly recommend trying Algenist Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm. I wish I would have found this year's ago!
