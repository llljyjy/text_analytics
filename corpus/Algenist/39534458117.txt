Gifted by algenist. I absolutely love this serum it not only hydrates my skin it brightens and make it super plump too. My skin feels so soft and smooth i have dry and dull skin I feel like I have gotten a a Hydra facial my skin feels so good just after a few uses. Im 35 i cant say about fine lines but its a great serum if you have dry dull skin. Found my alternate for hydra facial
