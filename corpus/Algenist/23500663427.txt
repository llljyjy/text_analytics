I received a sample of Algenist Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm with MultiPeptide Complex for my honest opinion.  I do have dark circles around the eye and puffiness as we and this balm worked great for me. With continued use, my dark circles faded and had less puffiness. It absorbs deep into the skin making it soft and suffle.  My dark circles and deep lines are way less visible and skin around eyes is firmed. Works great!
