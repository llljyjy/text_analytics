I am in my early 30’s, have olive medium-tan skin that is combination. My skin is mostly oily but I have dry patches. My biggest concern is acne and hyperpigmentation. My acne leaves dark spots, so I am always looks for A. treatment for my blemishes, and B. followup treatment for the dark spots they leave and trying to get them to fade faster. I’ve had the Algenist dark spot corrector for about 6-8 months. After using it, I do notice a more even complexion. But at the price point, consistent use once a week has not rendered any amazing results. Definitely didn’t do anything for my hyperpigmentation after consistent use. with that being said, I do still use it once in a while for 20 minutes. But if you’re looking for dark spot treatment, the $100 price point really doesn’t justify the results. Insufficient results at a high price point
