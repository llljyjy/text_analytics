This product is amazing and truly works. This is a regular part of my skin care routine and my skin is plump, healthy, and youthful. I have oily skin and this product does not increase oiliness in my skin nor does it dry my skin out. I don’t have wrinkles or fine lines, I use this for preventative measures, but the lines I had around my eyes are gone. The product does have a perfume scent but I don’t think it’s strong enough to deter me from using it. I also put other products on top of it so it’s not like the scent is long lasting. The dropper is kind of irritating but that’s also not a big issue. The benefits of this product in my skin outweighs any minor inconveniences with the dropper or the perfume scent. I highly recommend this product if your skin needs a boost of collagen and a youthful plump. Excellent results!
