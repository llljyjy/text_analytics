After 10 straight days of using this kit I noticed my skin appears more plump especially around my mouth. My little mouth wrinkles look softer. Also my foundation wears much nicer too. It’s not a miracle but it does seem to help soften my lines. My skin looks fuller if that makes sense. Also this kit would make a fabulous gift for anyone and it would also be super easy to take on holidays too. I used to never use anything with algae on my skin as I was under the impression it was comedogenic but even with the 3 types of algae in these formulas I had no new breakouts or irritation. I have oily skin but the liquid collagen serum is so hydrating without making my skin feel heavy or greasy. I wish it was unscented though because it’s definitely got a pretty potent fragrance so be aware if  that if you are sensitive to scents. Gifted by Algenist but I wish I had tried the brand much sooner. Wonderful gift for anyone
