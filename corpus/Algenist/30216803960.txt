I received this complimentary from Algenist. This is a really nice, thick eye balm. It’s not too thick though; it blends in nicely, never chunky. I had to double check the ingredients list because I swear it has a little mica in it but it doesn’t! It just somehow makes my eyes look great even though I’m super tired. It seems to magically reflect light and help me look better than I feel. A+ eye product! Great eye product
