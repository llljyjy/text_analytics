I love to keep my eyes always bright and the area around my eyes to be smooth and hydrated. Currently i dont have wrinkles around my eye area but as a daily routine I use eye creams to avoid premature aging around the eye area and my first impression after using algenist eye renewal balm is that it is very very moisturising and felt hydrated. Would highly recommend to someone who is looking for best hydration around the eye area. Very Very Hydrating Eye Balm
