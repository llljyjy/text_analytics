Applying this serum is a treat for my face.  It’s so lovely and just glides on with a gel like consistency.  Each ingredient is better than the last and the biggest change I have noticed in my skin is that it seems more plump.  I can’t deny the hydrating effect it is having, but I do wish that it absorbed a little cleaner into my skin.  I was trying to wear it without a moisturizer over the top because sometimes my sensitive skin can’t handle too many layers of skincare products, but it felt a little tacky, now I apply a moisturizer over it and don’t have the issue at all.  I’m happy to see that it is now scentless AND that the applicator has been upgraded because I plan to use every last drop! Gifted by Algenist. Love the ingredients!
