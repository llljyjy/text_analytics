I recieved this for free from pinchme in exchange for an honest review. I actually love this. It is a thicker cream but not greasy at all. It goes on smoothly. It also lays nicely under makeup(wonâ€™t make it cake up or look gross). Overall my under eyes felt really moisturized and visibly made me fine lines smaller or not even there. I will continue to buy this. Love it
