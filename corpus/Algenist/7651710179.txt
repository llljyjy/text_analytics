A perfect holiday kit for Christmas! I’ve already been through two bottles of the GENUIS liquid collagen and it’s one of my favorite products for dry skin. Collagen is a great humectant to help drive moisture in. You feel a noticeable different with how plump and smooth your skin is. One pump goes a really long way for me and it absorbs right in as it’s more of a gel consistency with little collagen beads suspended in the formula (you don’t feel the beads as they burst on contact). I like the eye cream a lot at night at the balm has a thicker consistency so it melts right into the skin. It’s more on the nourishing side which is perfect as the weather is getting colder. Great for holidays!
