This is the perfect kit to try out the brand. I have heard amazing things about the liquid collagen so I was very excited to try it. I used it for a full 10 days and still have some left in the bottle. I like to use this in my night time skincare routine as it leaves my skin smooth and supple that I wake up with better looking skin. It also works great in my morning routine, it makes my skin look bright and nourished so I don’t really need to wear foundation.The triple algae eye renewal balm has a very nice silky texture that doesn’t feel heavy on the area. Love that this one is full size!The ultimate anti aging cream is very nourishing and goes great after the serum. It doesn’t pill and it moisturizes my skin without feeling heavy or greasy.This is the perfect kit to gift a beauty lover for the Holidays! It’s also perfect for a two week trip as the bottles and jars are very compact. Highly recommend!I received this product complimentary from Algenist but this is my honest opinion. Great to try out the best sellers!
