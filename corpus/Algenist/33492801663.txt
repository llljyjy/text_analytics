I was gifted this toner by Algenist. Normally my skin is not sensitive. But on the second day I started using this, I noticed that my skin became sensitive and stinging a bit after applying the toner. So I’m using it only once every night and now my skin doesn’t feel irritated and sensitive anymore. It definitely exfoliate and make my skin hydrated. Surprisingly I saw instant glowing effect on my skin on first day. I like the effect and I’ll keep using it. nan
