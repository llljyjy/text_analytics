I recently tried Algenist Triple Eye Renewal Balm with Multi-Peptide Complex. This eye balm helped hydrate and smooth the appearance of my under eye area and visibly minimized the appearance my fine lines and wrinkles. However, I did not notice any improvement with my dark under eye circles. The texture is lovely, almost like a whipped mousse-like texture. It also worked well under my under eye makeup. Overall, I liked this product and recommend it for anymore who is looking for a luxurious eye cream. Lovely eye balm.
