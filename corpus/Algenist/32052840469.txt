Algenist gifted to me the new Genius Liquid Collagen pump bottle to try it for 10 days, and let me tell you this liquid collagen is pure gold! Love the consistency and how fresh, hydrated, soft & silky my face feels after applying it; it doesn’t have a smell, the pump is very convenient to use the right amount needed and it’s very luxurious looking. I was dealing with dry skin, but after incorporating this product to my daily am & pm routine for 10 days I noticed a difference, it’s more hydrated & nourished looking; definitely will continue to be on my everyday routine until the last drop. Gold in a bottle
