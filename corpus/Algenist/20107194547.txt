Algenist gifted me their Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm.. and wow have I noticed an improvement since I began using this. Iâ€™ve been applying it under and around my eye area religiously for the last 2 weeks, and not only does my eye area appear more healthy, hydrated, and nourished.. but the dark circles are less noticeable, and the overall appearance of my skins tone just looks so much better. And it feels so soft and soothing under and around the eye area, i just love it. I would absolutely recommend trying this product! Yes to dewy hydrated under eyes!
