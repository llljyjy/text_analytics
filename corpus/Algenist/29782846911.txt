Algenist gifted me their new Liquid Skin Resurfacing 2% BHA Toner recently in exchange for my honest review.  I’ve been using this daily after cleansing, making sure to follow up with moisturizer and sunscreen as recommended. I like how it’s not drying or irritating as some toners I’ve used can be.  It has a nice light scent, and even after the first use, I was surprised at how my skin really felt so much cleaner and clearer.  After a few weeks of use I have definitely noticed my skin is smoother, more refined and healthier. This is a great exfoliating toner that smoothes skin while unclogging pores and controlling excess oil. Purifies And Smoothes Skin
