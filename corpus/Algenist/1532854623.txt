I really like this eye balm. It has a nice thick cream texture that goes on nice and smooth. I have been using Algenist Triple Algae Eye renewal Balm twice a day for about a week and have noticed a difference in my under eyes. The dark circles have become less and brighter. I feel like my under eyes are more hydrated and firm. I highly recommend this product. WOW
