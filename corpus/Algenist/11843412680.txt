I received free samples of this in my PinchMe box and of course I’m always a bit skeptical when it comes to eye creams because I’ve tried numerous ones, well I’m definitely going to splurge on this one! Yes, it may be a little more pricier than some out there but it’s definitely worth it!!! By day 10 I could honestly see a difference in my dark circles under my eyes and the puffiness had just about gone away! I was blown away! I freaked because I was on my last packets of samples so I went out that same day and bought a full size bottle! It is definitely a must try!!!! My go to eye cream ❤️
