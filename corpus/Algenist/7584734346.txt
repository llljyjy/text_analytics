After two weeks of continued uses (twice a day - once in the morning, once before bed).  It’s firmed up the skin under/around my eyes and reduced puffiness, bags and dark circles.  It’s not a miracle worker, but for the price and time it takes to see a difference, worth the purchase.  I did not purchase this initially, as I was incentivized to try, but I am now a purchasing customer and probably will continue to be.  I’ve recommended it to a few girlfriends already and can see this being a part of my daily regimen from here on out! Renews skin and removes bags & dark circles!
