Algenist products never disappoint! I’ve used this serum for 2 weeks on face, neck and chest and I have noticed that my skin seems firmer and smoother already. The product is also really nourishing, easy to apply and spreads nicely. I didn’t experience any breakouts while using this. The only negative of this product for me is the price. Considering i use this morning and night on face/neck and chest I will probably need to repurchase in ~3 months maybe. This product was gifted by Algenist. Great, but pricey!!!
