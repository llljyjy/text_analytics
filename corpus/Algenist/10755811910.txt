I was actually sad when I used up my sample, as I was pleasantly surprised with this under eye cream. Many creams clog my pores and cause white bumps, but this one did not and moisturized beautifully, along with making the area seem smoother. I noticed a slight change after 10 days to my under eye circles--not as much as I hoped, but given the issues I have had with other creams, I thought this one was great. nan
