I received a sample of this from Sephora and ended up using it completely up and really liking it a lot! I have other vitamin C products in my collection right now, but I will 100% consider repurchasing this one if it turns out I liked this one more than the YTTP one I’m trying. The formula of this is really great and non-drying and non-sensitizing, but it’s strong enough to actually work as well. A really great sample!
