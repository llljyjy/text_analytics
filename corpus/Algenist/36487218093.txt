The ALGENIST TRIPLE ALGAE EYE RENEWAL BALM is a very thick cream that surprisingly spreads very well. It definitely doesn’t take much to get a good coverage area. I’ve only been using it once a day for about a week now and I can already see a difference. The dark circles around my eyes are already starting to dissappear and the bags under my eyes aren’t as puffy after applying this balm. I feel the skin around my eyes getting firmer and smoother. I see myself buying this in the future Sample worth adding to daily routine
