I’ve been using this for about 5-6 months and it has not  reduced the appearance of dark circles. My dark circles aren’t even too dark. I did however notice that the texture under my eyes is better than it’s even been! It’s super smooth and the bumpiness is gone. I keep using it because it gives my skin great texture, but I haven’t noticed any effects on the dark circles. great for skin texture, no effect on dark circles
