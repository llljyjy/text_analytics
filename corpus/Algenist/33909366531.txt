The Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm from Algenist product was gentle on the skin and a little went a long way (I got twice the uses in the amount advised for one). The texture was smooth and creamy without being oily. The results were mild after two weeks of use. I think it is comparable to half the eye balms I have tried. I wasnâ€™t wowed but not disappointed either. Gentle results, good quantity of product
