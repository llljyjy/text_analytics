Please make this product without fragrance!! There is literally no point to it. Fragrance is bad for skin and by leaving it in discloses an entire population of people who can’t use fragrance due to skin sensitivity issues (that’s a lot of people!). I will return bc I’m so disappointed. Please talk to your customers and make this change bc other reviews say the same thing. PLEASE REMOVE FRAGRANCE
