Algenist gifted me their 10-Day Results set. This is a great set for trial, travel, or gifting. I am so glad to see it is vegan, especially when I first saw the liquid collagen and thought I wouldnâ€™t be able to use it, but it is vegan as well! Everything applies nicely and absorbs well. They are hydrating and really help moisturize my dry skin. I like the firming abilities of the eye balm best. great trial set, ready for the full sizes!
