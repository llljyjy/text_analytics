My dark circles and puffiness around my eyes have been a concern for me for a long time. In the past, I’ve used caffeine serums and other skincare treatments to help with my dark circles. Algenist Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm with Multi-Peptide Complex seems to work a tad faster than other serums (which is great). The balm also does not have a strong scent and did not irritate my skin. I would say that I’ll likely stick to my other serums for now, but I would consider buying this in the future. nan
