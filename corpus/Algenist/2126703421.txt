This algenist toner is not harsh on my skin at all. If anything I love that it does leave behind a small tingle on my skin. I feel that it does a really good job as a toner. I felt my skin feel soft and smooth after using it nightly for almost 2 weeks. I actually appreciated that this toner picked up any left over remnants of my makeup even though I double cleanse. It makes me feel like this product is really trying to make my face clean and get deep into the dermis. The only problem I had was with the bottles application. It just was super messy to come out and there is a guard on there so you don’t spill, but once you take it off and try to get product it’s not as easy to come out and you have to really shake it and that’s how I make a mess and lose product to my bathroom counter. Gifted by algenist. Tones very well.
