As a person with a scientific background, I know that active ingredients need to be in the right amount and combination to exert their effect. Algenist’s Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm seemed to achieve this. This rich balm is full of beneficial ingredients that work wonders on regular use. I’ve been using this product for a week, twice a day (day/night). I didn’t use any other product to see if it really works. I must tell you that my under-eye area looked better instantly even after the first use. It has a silky smooth texture that doesn’t look greasy. Therefore, it is suitable to wear under makeup. I like investing in my skin. Therefore, I am going to buy Algenist’s Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm regularly. Works wonders
