Iâ€™ve been using the Algenist Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm for about three weeks now and I started noticing positive results after the very first week! It managed to brighten the dark areas around my eyes and after each application my skin feels softer and refreshed! I am definitely making this eye cream a part of my skin care routine. I love this product and I would definitely recommend it! Impressive results!
