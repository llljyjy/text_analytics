I have naturally deep set eyes and under eye circles. I was extremely surprised at how well this worked! I noticed a slight difference on the 3rd day after applying it 2x/day. I usually am disappointed in these types of product b/c they donâ€™t work on natural characteristics and are more meant for fatigue. However, this was fabulous and I will absolutely be trying it again. My only reason for giving it 4 stars is it is pricey. Amazing, but kinda pricey
