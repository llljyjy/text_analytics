I’m super impressed with this serum! I’ve been using it twice a day for the last 10 days and I’ve already noticed my skin feeling (and looking) much more plump! Some of my fine lines have even started smoothing out! I have oily skin and find this very hydrating!  It has a slightly sticky feeling for the first few minutes but then fully absorbs. I can’t wait to see my results after I finish the whole bottle!! * gifted by Algenist Amazing!
