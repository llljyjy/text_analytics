I was thrilled to receive this special set complimentary from Algenist, as I’ve long wanted to try the Genius Liquid Collagen and Anti-Aging Cream but the cost of the full-size bottles has kept me back. The full-size Eye Renewal Balm was an awesome bonus! After using these for 2 weeks I can say, my skin feels so much more hydrated, firmer, & more supple. I especially love the silky feel of the liquid collagen & how it feels emollient but not as greasy as an oil - it’s like a serum-oil combo & it just feels so good! I know it’s expensive but this one is totally worth the sensorial experience for me & the feeling after consistent use. This would also make such a lovely gift for someone who is into skincare! The sizes are actually generous, not like sample or trial sizes, and will last much longer than 10 days. So glad to add these to my well-aging routine!
