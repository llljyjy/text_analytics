I’ve been trying different brands of eye creams and this Algenist Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm with Multi-Peptide Complex felt really nice but I couldn’t tell if it made a difference.

It might be too early to tell yet since I haven’t been using it for that long. I’m going to keep using it because I like how it feels. Like the potential benefits
