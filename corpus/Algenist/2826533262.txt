My all time fave eye cream is the Algenist Genius one. Ive just finished my tub when this eye balm arrived. Texture is thicker and it is richer. I think I applied too much bc I developed milia. I am milia prone so I am careful with the eye creams that i keep in my routine. I am still giving this a chance and will try not to apply too much. So just a precaution to milia prone ppl like me. Awesome ingredients Very rich and thick cream!
