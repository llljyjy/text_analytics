I can’t say that I’ve seen a difference in my skin, I basically bought it for prevention more than thinking it will set me back 20 years. The texture is a bit sticky, but what bothers me the most is the awful scent. It makes me want to put less of the product on my face, or not at all. It smells like a weird sweet chocolate mix with I don’t know what. Literally makes me gag every time I pump the product out. Please change the scent
