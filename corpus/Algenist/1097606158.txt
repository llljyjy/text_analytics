I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing. All of the 5 star reviews are inflated by Algenist and not actual customer reviews. First off, this product is HEAVILY scented, it’s honestly unbearable. and secondly, it’s so sticky. It left a film on my skin that didn’t soak in and not only was I smelly but sticky all over. I’ll be returning it the same day that I received it. NOT WORTH the price. read the 1 star reviews
