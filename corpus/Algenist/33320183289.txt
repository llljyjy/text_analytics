I’ve tried samples of this eye cream in the past and like it, and now I’ve used it for longer, I like it even better. The consistency is great. Not too thick, spreads and absorbs nicely. Scent is very light, hardly noticeable. It plumps up the area so my wrinkles look less pronounced. Free sample by Pinchme. nan
