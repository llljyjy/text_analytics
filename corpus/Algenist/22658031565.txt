Complimentary from Algenist. This is such a great introductory kit for those (like me) who haven’t yet tried Algenist beauty products. I really noticed a difference in the dark circles beneath my eyes, as effectively as Tata Harper’s under eye serum which is far more expensive. I will definitely be gifting a few of these kits to the skincare lovers and healthcare workers in my life who share my concerns with under eye circles. Ps. This is an amazing gift set for the holidays for any skincare afficionado! Moisturized, Brightened, and Plumped!
