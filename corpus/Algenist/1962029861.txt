I really enjoy using this eye cream. It has a really nice, creamy consistency that blends and absorbs beautifully around my eyes. I have applied my makeup as normal with no issues. Iâ€™ve noticed the color under my eyes has gotten a lot better since I started using it. I would definitely purchase again! Really Nice!
