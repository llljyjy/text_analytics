I am so excited to be trying this liquid collagen by Algenist. They have changed to the dispenser to a pump vs. the original dropper and it works so much better! I love the vegan ingredients and the lack of scent. I wear it under my makeup and it does not leave a greasy residue. Over the short time I have noticed a brighter appearance in my skin tone and I am looking forward to having less visible wrinkles! I was gifted by Algenist. Much better!
