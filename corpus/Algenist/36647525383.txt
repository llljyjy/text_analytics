Very thick and feels like it absorbs through my delicate undereye skin! Thick enough to spread through into your crows feet area as well. I use this as part of my nighttime skincare routine and it helps that this eye cream is a balm-like texture instead of a watery liquid. I saw no change in dark circles but perhaps it helped plump up this area to look more full and moisturized Perfect nighttime eye cream!
