I tried this product years ago when I was way more oily and thought it was too heavy. Now that I’m peri-menopausal and drier I have it a second go and I’m so glad I did. It’s got this gel texture that is really moisturizing with the fun beads that burst on dispensing. It doesn’t pill and layers well. It seems to play well with everything I’ve tried it with. Definitely more than just a gel serum, it has a slightly emollient feel. It’s really nice for dry skin. I also remember it had a strong scent before but honestly I can’t smell anything now so no discernible scent. I’m so glad I revisited this product five years later. Gifted by Algenist Loved it
