I’m really loving this Triple Algae Eye Balm by Algenist. The formula is thick but literally melts into your skin without tugging or stretching your skin. It leaves a balm behind that isn’t greasy or shiny on the skin. It makes my skin feel like velvet. After using this every day for a week I can already tell how much brighter and softer looking my skin is around my eyes. I will be purchasing the full size soon! I'm really loving this!
