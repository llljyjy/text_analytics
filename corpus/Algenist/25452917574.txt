It does what it says - and it instantly plumps & floods my lips with hydration... However it goes on like water or a serum & the spheres are pretty difficult to dissolve. Most end up on the edges of my lips or in my mouth! So I do wish it were a bit thicker, but it does indeed work! Does what it says, but runny!
