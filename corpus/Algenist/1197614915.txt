This product was gifted by Algenist. I absolutely love that this has a new pump packaging because it’s so much more user friendly than the dropper style. It dispenses a perfect amount as well. After using this serum I have noticed that my skin seems to be a bit more glowy and plumped. I haven’t noticed a huge reduction in my fine lines but I do feel like the plumping effect has helped them look not as noticeable on my forehead. One thing I don’t like about this serum is the feel on my skin. I have normal/combo oily skin and I feel like this leaves a bit of a lightly sticky feel that goes away after about 30 minutes but leaves my skin feeling more oily after the fact.  It’s not a huge deal and definitely not enough to keep me from using it because I think the benefits outweigh the cons but it is something to note if you do already have quite oily skin this may leave you more oily than you’d like. Makes a difference!
