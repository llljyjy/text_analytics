This was a great kit! The serum was probably my favorite part as I could tell a difference after using it. My skin felt hydrated and smooth upon using it. They eye cream was also nice and moisturizing. It felt calming under the eye. The cream also felt the same way. I did notice after applying the cream though that there would be some clumps on my skin due to the texture of the cream. Maybe I need to warm it up more in my hands before using it, but I still like how it felt on the skin. Gifted by Algenist. nan
