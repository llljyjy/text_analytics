I started seeing some results on day 5 of using this. It wasnâ€™t very noticeable but I definitely saw that something looked subtly different that day. I think with continued use I will see more results. The only thing is that it is a bit on the thick side, so it does take some time to rub it all in. but a little goes a long way! nan
