I am 41, with combination skin, subtle fine lines and no major skin issues aside from sensitivity to fragrances. My skin was already quite clear and bright due to my diet and skin care routine so it is rare for me to notice benefits when trying new products. I got 2 samples of it. At first, I was a bit disappointed to see that the liquid is shimmery- an extra glow is  not something I was looking for when I already have a very oily t-zone, but after spreading it well on my skin, I thought the effect is not as intense, and very tolerable. Also, because this product  claims to help with oiliness and pore appearance, I initially started using it as a primer before makeup, so any shimmer would also be further reduced once I put my tinted moisturizer or foundation on. I was very pleased with how it performed under my makeup -better than many primers that claim to help with oiliness. After washing my makeup from my face,  I could tell my bright skin was even brighter and fine lines softened. My pores also look reduced. I am now on my second sample, and I am so glad to have it handy because I  started using Tretinoin (retin-A) 2 weeks ago. The tretinoin treatment is said to make skin peel a lot initially. I am using tretinoin every 3 nights, and except for the nights when I use tretinoin, I am using this Niacinimide serum day and night, and I truly believe it is helping my skin adjust  to the tretinoin treatment, keeping the peeling to a minimum. I will be purchasing the full size next. I considered taking one star off due to the price, but I will apply some points to my purchase to reduce the cost, and a little does go a long way, so Iâ€™ll keep the 5th star on my review. I saw slight improvement to my already good skin
