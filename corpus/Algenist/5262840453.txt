I was gifted by Algenist the Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm in exchange for my honest review. I want to start off by saying a little goes a long way with this product! It is so light and creamy to touch. I can definitely see a decrease in my fine lines under my eyes. After 10 consistent days of using the product I noticed my under eye area has gotten firm, and I look more refreshed. SOOOO GOOD
