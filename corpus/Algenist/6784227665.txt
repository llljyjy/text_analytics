I tried ALGENIST TRIPLE ALGAE EYE RENEWAL BALM and it was decent. I used the product twice daily for 10 days. After taking pictures and even comparing results, I saw zero difference within 10 days. I enjoyed the balm itself, it was creamy, smooth and went on beautifully. I would be open to trying a full sized product for an extended period of time to compare results. Smooth texture
