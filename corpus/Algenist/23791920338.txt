I tried Algenist Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm with high hopes. I’ve always had dark circle even as a child. I like the ingredients and the moisture this product provides. I think I noticed a slight improvement,  but I think it’s too soon to tell. I will keep using Algenist and hope to continue seeing even more improvement over time. Improved the look of dark circles.
