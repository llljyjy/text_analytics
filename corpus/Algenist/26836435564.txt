After using this product for a few weeks, I just really see no difference for the price. I do think my under eye looks a little brighter and the product is very hydrating. I’m also glad this product has no scent, especially for the eye area. However, I did randomly experience eye itching and swelling that required me to use Benadryl when I used this product. I do have sensitive skin. So, just be aware if you’re also a person with sensitive skin, you may have some issues. nan
