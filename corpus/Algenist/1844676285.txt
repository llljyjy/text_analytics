Smooth, creamy moisturizer that absorbs easily. I like the texture and feel of this cream. A bit silky feeling. Using it twice a day most days. Although I have not noticed much of a change in my eye area so far as appearance. I would use the cream but would not go out of my way to buy it. Overall, I really like the line of Algenist products.
