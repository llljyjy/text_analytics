*I was gifted this complimentary from Algenist for review*Firstly, this looks so cute with my other skincare and has one of the best packaging for a serum. I love that this serum is safe to put all over whether it is under the eyes, neck, or face! After one use you can instantly see the increase in hydration and that youthful glow. I feel like if I keep using this, it will definitely help me avoid wrinkles when I’m older. Although it’s a little expensive, it’s worth it because investing in your skincare is so important especially one like this that keeps you looking your best for decades! You need this! A Skincare Must Have!
