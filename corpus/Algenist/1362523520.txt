I need to start by saying I ALWAYS use eye cream, twice a day, and have for over a decade.  So when I say I didn’t see a difference, it’s because I’m comparing it to another high-quality eye cream. I’m not brand loyal, so I try all kinds from the prestige brands here at Sephora to the red jar at the big box stores. This felt wonderful on my skin, and has the ingredients all the websites say I should use. In the month-plus I used this twice a day, my undereye circles and corner crinkles stayed the same. I’m putting this in the rotation for winter, when it’s dry and cold here in Colorado and I need a little extra pampering. I received a bunch of free sample packs from Pinchme in exchange for this review, and they lasted me just under five weeks. Great-feeling eye cream
