Tried Algenist Triple Algae Renewal balm for 10 days. Definitely saw reduction in dark circles almost immediately while using the cream in morning and night. Only downside was some slight irritation to my eyes if I got the product too close to my actual eye (caused some watering throughout the day). nan
