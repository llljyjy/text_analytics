This stuff works amazing. People ask if I got my lips done. I totally understand why they redid the packaging. I was worried when it wasn’t available I love it so much. It could be messy I guess? But this new packaging just gets wayyyy too much out, it’s a huge mess. I don’t have small lips, this makes them smoother and plumper. But why redo the packaging of you’re just going to make it messier? And it just wastes so much product the way it comes out. If it’s too much for product for my lips I imagine it’s too much product for most people using this. I wish they would have just left packaging the same with more control. Great product, minus star for new packaging.
