I love and trust Algenist products, the best moisturizer I have ever tried is from this brand, and I could not be more excited when I received this eye balm, because it is the area of my skin visible more affected with dark circles.Though I do not have puffiness or deep wrinkles yet, my goal is to pospone the appearance of them by keeping my eye area hydrated and moisturized.This is a beautiful creamy balm, small jar, but highly effective, my skin loves it! The texture of my skin seems smoother, it is even easier to apply my makeup. I definitely can tell the difference when I do not use it, so I plan to keep it permanently in my routine the longest possible.Gifted by Algenist. nan
