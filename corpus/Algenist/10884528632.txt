I am loving this serum so much! I have always wanted to try the Collagen Serum but the dropper bottle always deterred me. Now that it is in a new pump, I had to use it! Itâ€™s been amazing for my skin - I use it right after the shower and after about 10 days I have really noticed a difference! My skin is much more supple and and soft, as well as more elastic to the touch! I highly recommend this serum especially as the colder months are approaching!
