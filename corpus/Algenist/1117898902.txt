Great product. It is so moisturizing. However, there was a huge air bubble in my container and it was only half full :( I feel a little screwed on the price. Not sure if I got a defective product or if all of them have air bubbles. Besides that, it’s great. Not sure I’ll buy it again given you don’t get the full jar. Great  but Jar isn’t filled all the way
