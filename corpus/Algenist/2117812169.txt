I was looking for a product with Azelaic acid to help with a major rosacea flare up. It was kind of a Hail Mary attempt before I tried medicated creams from the doctor. I cannot believe how well it worked. I also bought the creme to use and now I feel like I canâ€™t live without them. I wish I had taken before and after photos because I went from those little pimples/pustules/white heads and redness everywhere - to very calm and clear skin.  Would give ten stars if I could. Worth every penny. Rosacea relief
