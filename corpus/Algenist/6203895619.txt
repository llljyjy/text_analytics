I depend on eye creams so much. I would never have thought that I would need it as much as I do now but it truly makes a difference to keep your delicate under eye area hydrated specially when you find the right one like this one that I was gifted by Algenist. This cream melts right into my skin instantly plumping the area. I see that it helps my fine lines look less accentuated and more filled in. There is less creasing of my concealer when I wear makeup too.  After 10 days of daily use my dark circles already looked slightly brighter. I really love this one and to be honest I would repurchase. More plump and healthier looking under eyes
