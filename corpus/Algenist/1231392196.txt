I’ve been using both Genius Liquid Collagen & the Sleeping Collagen (& occasionally Genius daytime collagen moisturizer) for 3 years. I LOVE Algenist Liquid Collagen and use it 2-3 mornings a week when I’m not going to be wearing makeup; in winter I apply Genius Moisturizer on top, summer by itself. I’m almost 70 & people often comment on my youthful skin so I highly recommend both Algenist Genius products. Also...because its so expensive and I also because I do not love the dropper-style packaging, I have tried other similar liquid collagen products with very little benefit--no question Algenist is the best quality out there, effective collagen boost to keep aging skin soft & improve density.
