I received a couple of samples of this eye cream and I had honestly never tried anything from the brand and I must admit that I did like it. It seems a bit pricey personally for me but a little goes a long way and it would last a good while so I would say I can justify the price. It is a balmy texture and sinks right into the skin without feeling sticky or bothersome around the eye area. Keeps the area moisturized and has helped a bit with fine lines. Works well
