The Triple Algae Aye Renewal Balm from Algenist was a nice addition to my skincare routine. The area around my eyes felt more hydrated and appeared slightly brighter after using. I cannot say much about wrinkle improvement since it is not my main concern in my 20â€™s but the additional moisture seemed to help with undereye creases in my makeup. The formula is not greasy which makes it easy to apply day or night. If someone were looking for an eye cream to help with hydration and brightening, I would recommend this eye cream.
