I am in my third year of this and the long-term effects are astonishing! This took years off my face. Years ago I went through a bad time in my life and I completely let myself go and my skin suffered tremendously. When I finally decided to do something about it, I tried every expensive serum and cream I could get my hands on, and non worked as I wanted. My next step would have been Botox but this serum was recommended to me. After the first few days, my face was bright and smooth, after a few weeks the fine lines and wrinkles were starting to fade and my skin was firm. Now years later when I look in the mirror, I see a younger version of myself and not the 45-year-old I am. I struck gold with this and if you get it, I hope it works for you as it is for me. Amazing!!
