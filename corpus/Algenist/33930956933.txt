This product is such a nice eye cream! It did not have an unpleasant fragrance nor did it irritate my eyes or make them water which many eye creams tend to do to me, and it absorbed into my oily skin quickly without making me greasy or have a film on my skin. I recommend this and felt that it moisturized my eye area thoroughly! And a little goes a long way. nan
