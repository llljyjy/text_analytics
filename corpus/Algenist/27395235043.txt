What an amazing set! After using all 3 products for 10 days, my skin feels so soft, smooth and supple! It feels healthy and is more radiant than before! The serum is so unique and truly beautiful! I Think the eye balm is my favorite and it’s FULL SIZED! Both the eye balm and cream have such a unique, light and fluffy whipped texture. They melt into my skin so nicely and it is such an experience to use all fo these products! This would make a great gift for someone or just a way to try multiple products from the brand. Knocked one star because of the scent of the face cream- it’s kind of fake vanilla-y. Complimentary from Algenist. Great set!
