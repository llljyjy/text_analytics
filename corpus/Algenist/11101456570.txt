I’m really satisfied with the results I received since trying this Algenist Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm for 10 consecutive day’s! I had the best results with this product, out of all the eye balm products I have used thus far! The cream glides across my skin easily and soaks into my skin fairly quickly without leaving any greasy residues behind and leaves the eye area looking brightened, nourished, smoothed, and hydrated. A small amount goes a long ways, It’s really gentle without giving me any irritation, and doesn’t have a strong chemical or perfume scent. I have also noticed my concealer makeup aplies well after applying this eye balm with a smoother application. Overall, it’s an amazing luxurious eye balm that makes my eye area feel and look healthier and I would highly recommend it. Great Eye Balm!
