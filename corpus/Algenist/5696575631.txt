I received this GENIUS Liquid Skin Resurfacing 2% BHA Toner complimentary from Algenist, and I’m giving my honest review. This is a study glass bottle so it’s a bit heavy.  It leaves a sting feeling on my skin but is acceptable. My skin feels a little smoother after a couple of times of usage. Unlike some other exfoliators that instantly smooth the skin, this is relatively gentle so you’ll have to keep using it for a while to get comparable results. nan
