I loved this product! It appears to do everything it claims to do...plumps skin, reduces fine lines, and evens out texture. I used it consistently twice a day for 28 days to really see if it held up to its’ claims and it definitely did. I have a job that requires me to be on camera weekly and you can see a noticeable difference in the radiance of my skin over the course of the four weeks. I received a free sample to try but I am hooked and will purchase more independently. I can’t say enough about this liquid gold! Liquid Gold
