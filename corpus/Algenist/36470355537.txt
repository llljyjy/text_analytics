I enjoyed this product! I was a nice addition to my routine. It wasn’t too thick and didn’t leave me feeling sticky. Layered into my current routine (HA, vitamin c/retinol, moisturizer) it paired nicely and was absorbed quickly. There were actually a couple mornings I forgot moisturizer and skipped to spf because I was in a hurry and my skin didn’t feel starved for moisture surprisingly because my skin is on the dry side. It has a very subtle but nice scent to it as well. I would say for the price point there have been things I loved a lot more but I’d use it again. Nice texture, leaves skin soft!
