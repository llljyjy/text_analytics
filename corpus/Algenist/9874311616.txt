This is my first time using the Algenist: Genius Liquid Collagen and let me tell you it’s GOD sent. I haven’t used this product for more than 10 days and my skin feels and looks youthful. I noticed my grin lines looking smoother as well as underneath my eyes. I can’t wait to see how my skin looks after the 10th day. I like using this all-you-need serum in my daily skin routine. I’ve been cleansing the skin first, doing a quick wash-away mask for toning, following my skin with this collagen, and sometimes moisturizing with a face cream depending on my daily activities. Not sure what the troubles were with the original dropper but this pump has seemed to work sometimes it takes a while for the product to dispense but the pump tube unscrews and goes all the way to the bottom so no need to worry about wasting this expensive product. I used two pea-sized pumps for my face without a beard. I love that I was gifted by Algenist skin care is the best gift of self-love. nan
