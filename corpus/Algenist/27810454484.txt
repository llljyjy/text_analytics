I have not used the toner for a while as I saw it as a non-obligatory skin care products. Iâ€™ve started to use this Algenist Resurfacing BHA toner  gifted by Algenist and I must say  -  it is a game changer. My skin feels much smoother after I used it even a couple of times and in a week my pores look smaller and the surface of my face (which suffered bad acne scars) is visibly better. Great product for daily usage! Great results!
