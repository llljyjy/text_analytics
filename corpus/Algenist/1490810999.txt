This product, ALGENIST TRIPLE ALGAE EYE RENEWAL BALM, is just ok. I already used a high-end eye cream in my daily skin ritual, and did not think this performed any better than the brand I have been using for 20 years. I definitely saw no difference in my under eye dark circles.Other than that, it’s a nice product, I will use up the remainder of the sample I have. But I will not be purchasing, as it is DOUBLE the price of my high-end eye cream I currently use, and don’t think this product is worth the price. It’s ok - didn’t see a difference
