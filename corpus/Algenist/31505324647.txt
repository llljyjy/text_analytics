I was gifted by Algenist. I used this for the past week and half and my skin has been glowing! I really like the texture of this product and it makes my skin feel plum and hydrated! It doesnt feel greasy or uncomfortable at all. I’ve been putting it on top of my vitamin c, then i’ll use this, and then lotion and SPF and my skin feels great. I really like the pump too, it’s super easy and not messy to use! Really love this product so far!
