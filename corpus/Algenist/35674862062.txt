I love the algenist brand. They use algae to make their products. This eye cream feels like a whipped butter type of texture. It absorbs easily without leaving any residue. It’s perfect for under eye before makeup. I haven’t seen any brightening effects quite yet but i have high hopes for it! Whipped butter texture!!
