Ok so I wouldn’t day this ‘diminished the look of fine lines’ in 10 days BUT it is still a great serum! It makes my skin feel very youthful and hydrated, almost plump. The bottle is very luxe and the smell is mild. Makeup and moisturizer layer well onto pic it and it didn’t cause my skin to break out or anything weird like that. I look forward to seeing the effects after another few weeks of use. Gifted by Algenist. nan
