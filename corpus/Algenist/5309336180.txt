Gifted by Algenist in exchange for honest review. I did not try the dropper bottle but I obviously prefer the pump because dropper bottles are messy and it seems like very expensive product gets everywhere. To me, this had no scent and absorbed very quickly! I dd notice slight improvements in my skin over 10 day use (2x per day) nan
