I received a sample of Algenist’s Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm a couple of weeks ago, and I’m absolutely loving it. It does wonders for hydrating around the eye area, and it goes on so smooth and silky. On the day I had taken the attached photo, I woke up with extremely dark under eye circles, and I looked extremely fatigued. This cream works to cancel out the darkest areas under the eyes, leaving the skin looking refreshed and revived. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to try a new eye cream! A Fantastic Eye Cream
