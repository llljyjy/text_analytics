This product was gifted by Algenist in exchange for my honest review. This toner is great for my combination type skin. I noticed instantly that my skin was a lot less red. The product does not sting when I applied like others do. The bottle is really cool too because it has a stopper so product doesnâ€™t spill. After ten days of use I saw that my skin was so much less oily and red. It also did not dry my skin out! Definitely recommend for combination skin. My kinda Toner
