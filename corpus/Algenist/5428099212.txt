I used ALGENIST TRIPLE ALGAE EYE RENEWAL BALM for 10 days, morning and night. I love the consistency of this eye cream and how well it absorbs. I used this under my makeup with no issues. I destined a significant decrease in dark undereye and almost no puffiness! Iâ€™m sold! Additionally, I had no sensitivity or breakouts. P.s. the Sideview photo is after my 10 days trial. Magic!
