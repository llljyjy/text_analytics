WOW… does this product live up to the hype. I even noticed results in LESS than 10 days! I’m in my mid 30s and my skin immediately began looking for hydrated and supple. Though the product isn’t inexpensive, it does come with a lot in the bottle. It’s super simple to incorporate in your skincare routine after cleansing and toning and before moisturizer. I read a lot of reviews about the previous dropper and the new bottle seems to be a huge improvement— I have had no issues getting the perfect amount out of it! Gifted by Algerian. Liquid GOLD
