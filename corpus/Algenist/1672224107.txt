Reviews for skincare products are my least favorite to write. Most brands over-promise and under-deliver. So I’m pretty much almost always underwhelmed. This Algenist Eye Balm did impress me though. I used it before bed and I can’t believe I’m saying this but the next morning I looked better! More awake! More brighteyed! Very impressed here. I’m happy to continue using it. I’m not sure if I would purchase this often though at this steep price. I'm impressed
