I am a real user of this product, it wasn’t gifted to me or anything. No eye cream is a miracle but this one really does work, which is surprising since it’s so gentle and retinol free! It’s extremely gentle, has a nice moisturizing feel without giving me the little bumps. I’ve been using this for years and I get compliments from women younger than me about my eyes. I will be slathering this on them until the day I die. nan
