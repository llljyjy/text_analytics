I’ve only been using this product for a couple of weeks but I am already so impressed. I have combination skin and definitely always avoided using anything oily on my face. This stuff is magical… Does not leave my face feeling oily, but instead incredibly soft, smooth, and plump. It’s honestly mystifying how it can work so well. I’m obsessed. I put about 5 drops in the palm of my hand, rub together, and then press onto skin. Allow to absorb for about 15 min and then finish with some basic CeraVe lotion. I already see a change in my skin from this product! Try it, you won’t be disappointed!
