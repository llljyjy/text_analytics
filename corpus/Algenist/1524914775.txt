I have pale, oily skin and live in south Florida, finding comfortable and non-greasy SPF 50 is nearly impossible. I usually prefer all-mineral, but the one chemical sun filter in this doesn’t bother me or make me break out. This needs to be rubbed in quite a bit, I find the white cast disappears, but I also wear foundation everyday over it. I’ve read that you should wait 15-20 minutes after applying sunscreen, so once you do that this soaks in better than everything else I’ve tried (except Paula’s Choice, but that’s only SPF 30). I have tried dozens of sunscreens, and generally the ones geared towards controlling oil/mattifying leave a gross film on my face and end up exacerbating oil production throughout the day. I wouldn’t say this one mattifies, but it doesn’t increase my oiliness, so I’m fine with that. Great SPF for Oily Skin!
