Complimentary from Algenist.I am using this eye balm daily to keep my eye area luminous, hydrated and with a well rested appearance. This balm is working great for my dark circles and it is also helping diminish the fine lines around my eye area. The formula is thick and creamy, but not greasy and absorbs nicely into the skin as you apply it. You only need a very small amount of product to replenish and hydrate your skin, which is fantastic! My skin is super sensitive. This balm very gentle on the skin. I have not experienced any itchiness or irritation. The scent is light and pleasant.Yes! It is a must have! Beautifully replenish skin!
