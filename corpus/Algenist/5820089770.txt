I received this product complimentary from Algenist in exchange for my honest opinion. This toner is awesome! I’ve never used such a hardworking toner before, usually at most they make my face feel marginally cleaner and sometimes even dries my skin too much but this stuff  is amazing. After using my skin feels so incredibly soft, it feels like I used an exfoliating scrub as well as a moisturizer. My only issue is that because it’s packed full of awesome ingredients I’m not sure what serum, and moisturizer to pair it with. I would recommend to anyone with skin to try this out- you won’t regret it! This stuff is amazing!
