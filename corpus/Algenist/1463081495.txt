After trying this every day for 8 days straight, gifted by Algenist, I do see a difference on my skin. I feel it has helped with texture and some fine lines. I used to have acne scaring and while my scars are not gone, they have diminished. I love that it’s a pump bottle and not a dropper because I feel it gives more control to how much comes out. I will definitely continue to use this product however I don’t think I will use it every day. I have noticed my skins tad dryer and I feel that after using this product I need a really good moisturizer.  So if you have dry skin, this product may not be for you. I do enjoy it though and am excited to see more results. Fast Acting
