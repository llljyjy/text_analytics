I received this complimentary from Algenist. This toner left my skin feeling hydrated and feeling great. It didn’t over dry out my skin which is hard to come by when you have combination skin. I used this  twice a day with a cotton pad. It dried quickly and left my skin radiant. I also love the design on the bottle and the fact there is a plug so the toner doesn’t come out. I am always afraid that the product would come out if tipped just right. Great idea for a product.  This product definitely gave me what my skin needed without being to overpowering. I definitely saw a difference in my skin after a few days. My skin was more vibrant and bright just after a few days. Absolutely love this toner! nan
