I received Algenist Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm with Multi-Peptide Complex as a free sample from PinchMe. I never even considered adding an eye cream to my beauty routine, this balm has completely changed that. I will definitely purchase this balm in the future, it made a difference. The consistency is as expected with a balm, thick, which is nice. I see brighter under eyes with less visible wrinkles, I can only hope the results are much better with using this for extended period of time. In only ten days of use, the difference is there, highly recommend. Good product!
