There is no doubt about it-this balm works. I have really dark under-eye circles and it cleared me right up. The balm is easily absorbable into the skin. It is very lightweight and I didn’t find a fragrance to it. I did find that it stung a little if it got into my eyes (if I got sweaty or water on that area) but it wasn’t bad. Quite honestly, I could see a difference within 4 days. It’s worth having it in my facial routine. Works!
