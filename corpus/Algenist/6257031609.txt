This has a nice grippy finish (not too sticky) so it’s great for both night time and daytime skincare routine It’s very nourishing and gives perfect amount of moisture back to my combination-oily skin. The pump helps getting the right amount of serum. I’m in my 20s and love using this for days when my skin lacks moisture or elasticity. I can see this serum working great for mature skin as well. Great for my combo-oily skin
