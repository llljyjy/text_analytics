This is pretty good stuff! I had no expectations and tried it for 10 days initially and have continued to use it. It has made my lips smoother and evened out some rough spots, especially along the edges of my lips. I have also noticed my lip products tend to go on more smoothly and stay on longer. The taste is a little different - itâ€™s on the sweeter side, but I never could really identify it. Overall, a nice improvement for the condition of my lips. nan
