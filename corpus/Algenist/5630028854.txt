I’ve tried a lot of eye treatments before and this is one of the best I’ve tried. Its not greasy, absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling silky and hydrated.  I also have fairly dark circles around my eyes and after using this at night, they are much brighter looking in the morning, This stuff works!
