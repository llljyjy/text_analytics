Been using this sunscreen for few years and really love it. I live in Key West with very hight heat, humidity and brutal sun all day. I am also an artist with booth outside so I am directly exposed to sun. This sunscreen works so well for me, I am truly amazed. I don’t even get a tan with it on let alone sun spots, it’s that good. It’s very light, doesn’t clog my pores or make me look oily. It sinks in the skin rather well. It does have a bit of ‘whiteness’ to it that doesn’t completely disappear once it’s applied but I personally love that as it actually evens out my skin tone, making additional heavy make up in this heat unnecessary. I do have light skin tone so I don’t know if that will work for people with darker skin tones though. I imagine that’s why we see so many contradictory reviews for the same product. nan
