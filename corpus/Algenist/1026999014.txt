Wonderful texture, and I am an Algenist fan. However, couldn’t get past the smell of this, and I tend to tolerate medicinal or herbal or Perricone MD smells pretty well. For the four days I used it, I didn’t find any improvement. I’m comparing everything against my current favorite - Neostrata Dark Spot Corrector  (not *yet on Sephora)  Murad also was meh for me. not yummy
