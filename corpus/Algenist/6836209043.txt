I Absolutely Love the packaging, the texture, and how my skin feels afterwards! I’ve combination skin and this serum gives me the perfect amount of hydration and my face feels so smooth and radiant with this new pump bottle. I’ve been using it for 10 days and I will tell you…It’s like liquid radiance in a bottle. It’s such a beautiful serum and I’m sold! I’ve been kindly gifted by Algenist in exchange for my honest review. Liquid radiance in a bottle!
