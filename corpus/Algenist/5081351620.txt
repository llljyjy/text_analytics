Ok so, as is probably obvious by now, Pinchme gave a bunch of us free samples of this Algenist Triple Algae eye renewal balm. I’ve used it faithfully morning and evening. Overall, I think it is perfectly fine! It’s extremely moisturizing; I can still feel it on my skin midway through the day. It takes a few minutes to fully sink in when I apply it. So far it doesn’t irritate my eye area or migrate into my eyes. Nobody seems to have mentioned this, but it actually smells a bit off-putting. Sure, very mild scent overall, but it does have a smell and it smells like chemicals. So that’s a minus. Ultimately, I like this product but it costs more than twice what I am currently using, and it’s not *that* good. Hope that’s honest enough! Perfectly OK
