I’ve been using this on and off for many years now and I love it, along with the entire Liquid Collagen line! It is on a higher price-point but it’s totally worth it. Love how velvety and plush it feels and it makes my skin look and feel so supple, healthy, plump and glowy. Its unique vegan collagen formula works well for my skin. It also contains alguronic acid & microalgae oil and it works in synergy with the vegan collagen. I love using this both in the morning and evening and it works well under makeup. Keeps my skin well hydrated all day. I appreciate the new pump packaging! TRULY AMAZING VEGAN COLLAGEN SERUM
