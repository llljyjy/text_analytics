I loved this eye cream! It’s very creamy, but lightweight at the same time. It wasn’t greasy & it did not irritate my eyes. It delivered just enough moisture. After using for 2 weeks, I was able to see a noticeable difference under my eyes. They looked much brighter & even a little bit tighter. Consistency is key with this product in order to see a difference! One Of The Best Eye Creams I've Tried
