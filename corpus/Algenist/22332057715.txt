Ok so I was using Sunday Riley and Estée Lauder right before I started using this and what a difference. The consistency of this is so different that it absorbs so much better into the eye area. It’s super thick and balmy and keeps my eye area supple the entire night while I sleep. My eyes looked so much more youthful and the skin was taught. The consistency is thick. Little goes a long way. Hydrates and firms. Helping with chicken skin under my eyes. Love! Superior eye cream
