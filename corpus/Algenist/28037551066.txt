I received a free sample from PinchMe for  ALGENIST TRIPLE ALGAE EYE RENEWAL BALM. I did notice a slight change on some fine lines around the eyes, pretty small change but I will continue to use. The cream is light, non greasy and absorbs well. I would recommend this product and foresee some great results with continued use. The only flaw would be the high price of this product and the size of container. ALGENIST TRIPLE ALGAE EYE RENEWAL BALM
