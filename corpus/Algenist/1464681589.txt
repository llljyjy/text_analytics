This is a great intro kit to Algenist. The serum is quite large and will last a long time. It feels hydrating on the skin and plumping. It does have fragrance but I don’t mind it in this serum. The eye balm is just heavenly! Very balmy and moisturizing. A bit occlusive. I think this is a great kit to try out to see if the brand works well for you but 10 days is a lofty promise. If you don’t have a consistent routine right now, you will see results in 10 days. Gifted by algenist. nan
