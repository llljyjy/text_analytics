I was intrigued to try this eye cream as I have been in need of something to help with fine lines and darkness under my eyes. I used this for about 10 days as I received a free sample to try. I liked it, felt like it was moisturizing. I only used it at night. I didn’t notice a big difference though, so for the price I wouldn’t purchase a full size. The brand I was currently using seems to work just as good, if not better so I’ll stick with that. However, I would recommend this as I did like how it was moisturizing and not greasy, so just since it didn’t give me a noticeable difference that’s not to say it wouldn’t for someone else.
