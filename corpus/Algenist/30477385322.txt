This set is a nice little kit to travel with or gift for a holiday! Unfortunately it wasn’t the best match for my skin, as I found that I broke out more while using this. I enjoyed the light textures of the creams and everything smelled quite nice. I didn’t love that the products pilled even when I only used the products in this set. Gifted by Algenist. nan
