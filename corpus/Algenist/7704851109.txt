I like the balm like texture of this eye cream. I thought it might tug my under eye area considering it is a bit thick, but suprisingly it absorbs well, and melts into the skin as you apply it.during winters I started having whiteness/flakiness around eye area in the morning. I noticed that on the days I applied this balm the flakiness didnâ€™t happened. I really liked this balm. I dont have prominent dark circles so cannot say anything about that. But it i hydrating smoothing balm which applies well under makeup. A good balm for winters/ under makeup.
