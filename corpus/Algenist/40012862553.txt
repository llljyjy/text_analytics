Yes I gave it 5 stars and I will tell you why... I am a 64 year old man that really, because of the sun and smoking at a younger age, was starting to really get some deep wrinkles and just old looking skin. I have tried a LOT of products some pretty expensive and while some seemed to help a little a lot really did nothing. Then I was told about GENIUS Liquid Collagen. I used it as suggested and I could start to see changes in my skin texture in 10 days. After 20 days I could not believe the difference. Those deep wrinkles were so small now and the texture of my skin is smooth again. I will continue using this and only this. Thank you Algenist. Finally something that works.
