I was lucky to be able to try a 10 day trial of the Algenist Eye Renewal Balm, and I can honestly say that it’s a very solid product. The texture is most definitely best described as a balm, but it’s not overly heavy or waxy. You really only need a tiny bit of product to sufficiently cover your eye area, so I imagine a jar would take you pretty far. This balm left my under-eyes feeling moisturized and smooth, and I do feel like it helped 10 minutes signs of darkness and helped plump up the area under my eyes! A little goes a long way!
