Nice reach cream. I’m generally not a fan of creams for under eye area as they tend to feel uncomfortable or mess with my makeup. However, I quite like this Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm with Multi-Peptide Complex. The cream is rich and buttery, but doesn’t feel heavy at all. It does smell a bit funky, must be the algae, but the smell isn’t strong and can’t fee lit at all once applied. The cream made my underage area supple and soft, but I haven’t noticed any improvement in my underage circles. Perhaps, I need to use it longer or just need to sleep more. I didn’t expect any miracles from this product, but I really enjoy using it, feels very nice. Very nice eye cream
