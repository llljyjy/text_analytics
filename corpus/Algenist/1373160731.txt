This eye balm is very hydrating without being oily. It sits well under my concealer. It didn’t cause sensitivity to my eyes. This balm has a unique and impressive list of ingredients. During my 10 days of use, I found that the skin around my eyes looked more plump. My fine lines were significantly  reduced. I don’t experience  bags under my eyes, so I can’t attest to how it functions there. I do have some degree of dark circles; however, they are sun damage and age related. I typically use a retinol eye cream, but would definitely continue to use this eye balm since it’s so hydrating and doesn’t cause irritation. I highly recommend. Very hydrating and non-irritating
