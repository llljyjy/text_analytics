I first tried Algenist through their premise that the brand delivers results in 10 days. I was blown away by the changes in my own skin, especially in the plumping and smoothing effect, and I have been a big fan ever since (going on 4 years). I believe them in their claims that alguronic acid is an ingredient worth paying attention to!I was thus grateful to receive this set gifted by Algenist. It contains a full size of their eye balm and generous minis of the liquid collagen and the genius anti-aging cream, which I will elaborate on below:The eye balm is rich but elegant in texture, and I love that it features peptides in addition to the triple algae ingredients. Liquid collagen features hydrating vegan collagen combined with microalgae oil and alguronic acid. Iâ€™m a longtime fan of this product as I feel it combines hydration and soothing properties and feels wonderful to apply. Finally, the anti-aging cream is a medium to heavy weight cream that relieves my dryness while adding ceramide and algae based ingredients.Overall this set is a wonderful intro to the brand or great for those who are already fans!
