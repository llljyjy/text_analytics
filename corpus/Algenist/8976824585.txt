I really like how the Algenist triple eye renewal balm w/multi-peptide complex feels as I use it under the eye.  It has a nice smooth texture that easily glides across and rubs in easily.  I have noticed how my under eye begins to soften the look an give it a nice little glow. Nice texture, glides easily an rubs in smoothly
