The kit samples are pretty small but good enough for me to trial for some days. I do think that the serum stood out more to me due to its consistency and ingredients! The moisturizer is also very hydrating for me in the cold weather now. I think if you’re prone to dryness plus dullness you’d enjoy these. Gifted by algenist hydrating and glowy
