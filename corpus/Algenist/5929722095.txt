I definitely have to say that this cream hydrates, nourishes and day by day is helping my under eye to be more firm. The concealer stays better and longer when I first put the cream. The only thing pf which I donâ€™t go crazy is the smell but still is not so strong. I super recommend this for fine lines and dry under eye. Nourishes perfectly
