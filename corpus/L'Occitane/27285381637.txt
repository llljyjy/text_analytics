I really did like this cream but I don’t think I’d buy it again just because of how expensive it is. It smells great with a slightly spicy scent and spreads so smoothly but leaves a slightly greasy feel after application. It’s really moisturizing and lasts a while too but I don’t think it’s a really good value for what it is. nan
