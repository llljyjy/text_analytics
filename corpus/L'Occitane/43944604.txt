I received this product in a sample box. It has a fragrance that isn’t unpleasant, but it’s a bit strong and smells more like a hair product. It did make my skin soft and it felt moisturized as well, unfortunately it also made my skin breakout. I think this is probably a good product overall, it just didn’t work for me. Pretty good…but
