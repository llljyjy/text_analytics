Well. Let’s go for a big paragraph lol. I saw this product on Sephora website and was immediately interested, because my pores were always been a concern on my face. The price was a problem for me and the bad reviews, so I gave up. But one morning, I just ordered it because I was welling to try it. I received it really fast (3 days). My first impression on this tool was : so light. This is VERY light, which is awesome for the manipulation. But, I don’t think it justifiates the price. For the trial : I used a Biore pore strips after my shower to have better results. I used DERMAPORE on my hand first, because I tend to have redness a lot. I made sure my face was always wet when I used it on my face and I begun on a side of my nose. I waited ten minutes. Redness wasn’t a big deal so I did the other side of the nose. When I cleaned up, I barely saw dirt on my kleenex. I have dry skin and I think this is why. After using DERMAPORE all over my nose, I made extractions and it came out so beautifully. Final answer : if you have dry skin, DERMAPORE will perform for extractions, as a starter in my opinion. According to the pictures, I think DERMAPORE gives better results on oily skin... In my case, I don’t know if I’m keeping it or not, because the price is really a concern for me Hmmmmmm
