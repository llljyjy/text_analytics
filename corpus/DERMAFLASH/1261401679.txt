Like many other reviewers I love my dermaflash and the blades are great. I’m starting to get very frustrated having to order replacement blades though - I immediately throw out the cleanser and moisturizer each time and I really can’t understand why there isn’t an option to purchase the blades without these low quality ad-ons. Please sell them separately so I can stop feeling guilty and wasteful purchasing a product that goes straight in the trash! Love it but hate that I can't buy blades separate
