My boyfriend and I both tried it and it didn’t do much. My skin is normal and my boyfriend’s is acne-prone. We followed the instructions closely and it didn’t extract anything… I’ve also tried the infusion side. I found that with some serums it works (such as the estée lauder night repair serum), but other serums (such as the Kiehl’s clearly corrective dark spot solution) doesn’t work at all because of its consistency! nan
