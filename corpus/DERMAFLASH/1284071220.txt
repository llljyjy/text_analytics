I have oily skin that is oily or in the tea zone, and is constantly gunked up with blackheads. This thing makes it so much easier to clear all my clogged pores. If I have one suggestion it would be to have different shaped heads, the shape doesn’t work very well for the curves of my nose and chin. It also does not work as well on my cheeks, Where I don’t have as many blackheads but they are dryer I guess. You must constantly saturate your skin with water for it to work. It will pour a traumatizing amount of gunk out of your pores. Works pretty darn good!
