I love this little device! I had been hearing great things about dermaplaning facials and had been wanting to schedule one, but the cost was keeping me from trying it. I’m so glad I purchased the Dermaflash Luxe+ instead! This tool is the cost of one or two spa facials, but can be used for many more treatments (comes with 4 single-use edges, and refills are inexpensive) so it’s a much better deal. My face feels so soft and clean after using it for the first time. I like that there are two treatment levels depending on how much exfoliation you are looking for. I have sensitive skin so my face was a little bit red afterward, but that faded within an hour and always happens to me with any kind of exfoliation on my face. I love that I now don’t have to worry about peach fuzz on my upper lip. The Dermaflash Luxe+ was easy to charge and easy to use! Much better deal than a spa facial!
