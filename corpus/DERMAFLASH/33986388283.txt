I really really wanted to love this product.It is cute, sleek, the concept of it is amazing - however, it just doesn’t work.I’ve read instructions, followed directions, and tried every method possible with minimal results.I’m someone who generally has oily skin, and large pores and was very excited to try this product hoping to see change. I found at most this product would help scrape off the excess oils on my surface but rarely decongested my pores. In order to get any build up out, I would have to press decently hard, and my face would be irritated, sore, and red. I was so disappointed after researching this product, and spending the amount of funds to not have any results.I’m forfeiting my entire points promotion to return the product as I cannot justify keeping it for what it costs. I’m so disappointed
