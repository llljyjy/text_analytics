It doesn’t last more than two years! The charger gives out in less than a year because build up occurs in the charging port which you can’t clean out and it get s damaged. They replaced the charger once and now asking for a fee. I love it so much it’s sad it doesn’t last long/ won’t charge anymore. nan
