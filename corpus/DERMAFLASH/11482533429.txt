The extraction part of this device works as well as most extraction devices. They work, but they’re not going to miraculously push out all your blackheads. Don’t expect a miracle from this. I find devices like these work best with other products like pore strips and aha/bha products. It will irritate your skin and your skin will turn red, but it’ll go away after a while. I really like that this device is waterproof because you can do the extractions in the shower when your face is all steamed and wet. What I really love about this device though is the infusion part. It speeds up the absorption of the product into my skin. Really decreased the time spent on my skin care routine. Also because of how much quicker it helps your skin absorb the product, it’s much easier to use heavier products which are the bane of my existence. The heaviness from the product doesn’t last as long. It’s also really easy to clean the device after with soap and water since its waterproof. I wish the lenght of the paddle was longer though because I found it difficult to place it flat on some areas of the face because the handle got in the way. Overall, it’s a decent device and I got it on sale so the price was okay, but I don’t think I would pay full price for it though. Decent
