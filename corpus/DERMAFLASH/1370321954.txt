I think there is a quality control issue. I got this and the first two razors worked great, the other three still left peach fuzz on my face. At first I thought maybe it needed to be charged again but that was not the case and I even used it in the higher setting. I really like the Luxe, my face felt and looked great but if I’m going to get some of the razor refills which are not as sharp I think that’s going to be an issue for me.  My whole purpose was to avoid the $50 a month at the spa Great but the refills need to be better quality
