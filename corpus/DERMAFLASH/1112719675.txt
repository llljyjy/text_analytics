I have PCOS. I bought it to trim things up like I need to often. I usually buy the battery operated long stick ones. I will go back to those. This did nothing. It hurt. It would not trim or cut anything. At all. I tried all different angles and ways. If you need to use something often, it even says you shouldnâ€™t use the same blade more than once, which would get incredibly expensive. This was a fail. nope
