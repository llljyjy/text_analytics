I have been using this once a week for my Sunday “spa“ night. I have sensitive, redness proned skin which gets angry at most products. This device works well with my routine and doesn’t cause any flare ups. my skin is smooth and makeup glides on. I compare it equally to the dermaplaning at MedSpas. I get the same results. A Part of Weekly Sunday Night Routine!
