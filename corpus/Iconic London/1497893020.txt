I used the iconic  tan mist with the brush, and loved the pair together. In the past Iâ€™ve used a mouse and tan mit and i definitely preferred this combo. The most has a gentle sheen which helped me apply. And the color was warm and natural when fully developed. Brush made application a cinch. Brush for iconic tan mist
