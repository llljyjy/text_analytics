Gives a subtle glow on the face but in not impressed by that, it’s what it claims it’s supposed to do. Mister is terrible. Comes out very aggressively, in globs and very wet. You have to hold it at arms length otherwise it’ll get all over your hair and clothes (I swear I’m still referring to this self tanner lol). Leaves face slightly tacky after drying which I don’t mind, it helps with makeup application. Has a fine glitter in the solution that settles to the bottom when not used bug mixes well when the bottle is shaken. Has a prominent but pleasant smell. I don’t mind fragrance in products I put on my face but if you do, this may not be for you. Just Okay
