Gave a really natural glow that developed over a few hours. My only complaint is that this is SMALL — I guess that’s on me for not looking at the description more closely. But the bottle is the size of a face setting spray. I was hoping to use this all over my body, but it would be gone really quickly if I did that. I think this will be great for maintaining a tan on my face since that fades so quickly with all my skincare. Beautiful glow, small size
