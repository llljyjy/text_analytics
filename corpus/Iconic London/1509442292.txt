I found this product to be a pretty good self tanner. It was quite subtle but blended out nicely and I liked the subtle shimmer. It was still sticky so I had to powder but was wearable with powder. My biggest concern was that one full body application used almost half the bottle and at that price point (the bottle is extremely small at 2.5oz), I could get an actual spray Tan. color is good, application alright, expensive
