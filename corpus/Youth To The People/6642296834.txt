Love this company and their values and ingredients. This mask was nice in that it was very effective with not very much product, so the container lasted me quite a long time. The only downside unfortunately for me is that my skin seems to be too sensitive to handle this mask on a daily or even weekly basis, so I don’t think I’ll be buying it again. It did smoothe my skin but after gently washing it off like instructed my skin was red and warm underneath where the product had sat, even though I always made sure to only have it on no more than two minutes. I wanted to love this but I think it just isn’t for my skin type. I would still recommend it though to people with skin not as sensitive as mine, because it did help with my texture and overall evenness of the color of my face. works but is too strong for my skin
