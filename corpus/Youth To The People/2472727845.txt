This is the best smelling cleanser/PRODUCT I’ve ever used. It’s so light and fresh I wish my whole life could smell like this. On top of that it has really cleared up my acne prone skin, it’s not perfect but I can see a difference after a little over a week. It’s gentle but my fave definitely feels clean. Probably my favorite cleanser I’ve ever had and I’ve tried a LOT. nan
