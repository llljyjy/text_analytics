To start with, the packaging was very thoughtful. They put it in a brown box that’s giving the “clean“ vibe. They also provided 2 caps (handy when traveling)! Not to mention the fact that the color and smell is amazing. It does make my face feel tighter, refreshing, and clean- however, I have a dry skin, and this make my skin feel tighter in a dry way afterward (you can see the flakiness below my nose). I would say it’s a bit overprice for its quality. I don’t feel that much different. Another thing is that it doesn’t effectively remove my makeup. Especially, eyeliner. I can see why though. This is a gentle and clean cleanser, so nothing surprising. I found that by using cotton pads to wipe of the foam help removing my makeup (a great way to see if there’s any makeup left or not). If you wear light makeup, you’ll be fine. For anyone wearing waterproof or somewhat lots of makeup, consider purchasing a makeup remover. Overall, it’s a great product! It did what it supposed to do. So that’s why I’m rating it 4 stars. Oh- did I forgot to mention the fact that it’s clean and vegan (+ no fragrance)? I’m in love with how effective it is compares to the other gentle cleansers out there. Just 1 star off for overprice and unable to remove all my makeup :)) Perfect for a refreshing spa day!!
