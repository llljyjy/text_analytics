This is my third time trying this products since I was told it’s suppose to help with my oily skin and was told it doesn’t make my face dry… like any other products just because it doesn’t work for me doesn’t mean it’s not going to work for you. It makes my face extremely dry. And it makes me even more oily. My skin has been peeling from how dry this is and I’m a very oily skin girl and this has been making my face extremely drying that my skin feels like it needs to produce more oils. Not for me. nan
