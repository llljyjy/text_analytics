I received this product from YTTP for the cost of shipping in exchange for review. I have had the opportunity to use it once so far. The formula is not sticky and absorbs into skin quickly. There is definitely some amount of slight tingling once you put it on. I noticed a little bit of redness as well, but it quickly went away. After applying moisturizer my skin felt smooth and soft. I would give this five stars, but my skin did purge a bit after using it, so just be aware of that. Iâ€™m definitely going to give it another try though because I like how my skin looks now that the purging has gone down. Nice Toner
