I’m obsessed with this toner. Beware if you buy this and there are floaties, the product has likely just precipitated due to temp change but is still okay to use :) It’s really helped with post inflammatory hyperpigmentation and texture and as someone who has pretty sensitive skin I’ve never had any issues using this daily. Great for sensitive skin
