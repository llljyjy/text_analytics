Youth to the People never misses! I love this hydrating serum. Itâ€™s super lightweight and soaks into my skin, but feels hydrating enough for the winter at the same time. I love the glass packaging as well. The pump can be a little intense so you need to be careful with that, but overall I love this serum. another win from yttp!
