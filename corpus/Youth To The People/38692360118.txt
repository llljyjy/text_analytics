I would only use this to remove heavier make up. But either way you’re better off with a more gentler cleanser. This one is more hand soapy and stripping. It would be fine if it offered exfoliating or other benefits to be worth losing your skin oils but for it’s cost it provides little return. Too stripping and for no reason
