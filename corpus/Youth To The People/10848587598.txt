So many mixed feelings with this one! The scent is absolutely amazing, once you melt it in your hands the texture when massaging your skin is amazing and it removes all makeup without much of an effort. If you just grab a chunk it will crumble, key is to “shave” it. My biggest problem with this one is if it gets in my eyes they will BURN, not cloudy but actually I’m blind my eyes tearing like crazy. love hate relationship here
