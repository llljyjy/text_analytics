Let me start with saying that I have combination to oily skin. I was using laneige water bank gel and wanted to try something more heathy conscious. This product claims to be “clean & vegan” with a little reassurance from the store clerk I brought this baby home. It left a nice smoothing velvety finish at first try. But when I tell you I woke up with a full breakout! My skin also felt less hydrated than when I initially put it on. I had to wear a face mask to work from how much this broke me out. All over my cheeks and chin. Needless to say I ran and picked up the laneige kudos for same day delivery. Immediately my breakout has started to calm down. nan
