The best combination of physical and chemical exfoliants, this mask has a gritty texture that is more fine than the harsh St. Ives Apricot Scrub, more akin to sand on the beach. Let it sit on your skin for a few minutes to let the chemical exfoliant do its job before sloughing away the dead skin. Even my skin that is used to regular chemical exfoliants responds well to this. I removed one star NOT because of any deficiency in the product itself, but because the glass packaging makes it feel like you are getting more product than you are. Which is sneaky, because for the price you think you are getting about twice as much! The good news is that a little goes a long way, and this is not a product I would use more than twice a week at most (and only then if I did not use other chemical exfoliants in my routine). Exceptional product, sneaky packaging
