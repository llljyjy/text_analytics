Full disclosure - I received a sample of this product from YTTP. Youth to the people makes some great products - and this is my new favorite. The retinol + niacinamide goes on smoothly (although the bright yellow color seems alarming at first, it disappears upon application) and didn’t leave me with any of the residual redness or dryness I’ve experienced with some other retinol products. It layers easily with moisturizer without pilling and feels super lightweight on the skin. I can’t speak to long term improvements but my skin the mornings following application has felt dewy, smooth and bright without being stripped. It’s definitely on the pricier side for a retinol product but for the quality and without the side effects, I’ll definitely be purchasing a full size. I also really appreciate the use of glass containers as opposed to plastic - you see exactly how much product you’re getting and the packaging can easily be re-used. New favorite retinol product
