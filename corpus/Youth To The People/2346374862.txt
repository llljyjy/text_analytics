Hydrating and lightweight! Like all recent YTTP launches, this product is incredibly moisturizing without being heavy or oily, especially for combination skin and during these hot, dry months. It is thicker in consistency than the kale + spinach moisturizer cream (reasonably given the ingredients + benefits) but goes on lightly to the skin. I will be repurchasing this in the full size for daily use! nan
