Absolutely love this product. I originally thought for the price it was going to be too much. However, it has lasted me over 1 1/2 years!!! I use it semi-regularly as a night cream (leave on all night). I have very dry skin and this helps to solve that for me. I have acne prone skin with acne scaring and this helps to lighten those scars. A little really goes a long way with this product. Amazing for Dry/Sensitive Skin
