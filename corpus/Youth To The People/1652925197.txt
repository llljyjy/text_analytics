This is my second jar of this product, I love the citrusy smell it has and it’s creamy texture. It does feel sticky on the skin if you’re not used to it and my hair sticks to my face and tickles my nose, but that’s my own problem. My skin feels so hydrated all through the night and it’s worth a tickly nose! Makes me feel like a glazed donut
