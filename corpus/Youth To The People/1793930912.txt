The Retinal + Niacinamide Youth Serum is by far one of my favourite Youth To The People products to date. Yet again, I’m left speechless at their innovative formulas and concepts with their products. As you can tell from my results, the product worked for me instantly. In the trial period that I’ve been testing the product, I’ve shockingly not gone through ONE purging phase. My skin barrier is genuinely the smoothest it’s been in a very long time, my redness has decreased significantly and so much of the texture on my cheeks is vanished. (That niacinamide is working overtime!) But truly, I’m at a loss for words how effective this retinal is in the short amount of time I’ve used it. Their chemists absolutely nailed this formula and I’m sooooooo curious to see everyone’s retinal journey who tries this. I think what I love most about my experience with the Youth Serum is how gentle it’s been on me. The blend of the ingredients compliment each other seamlessly and it comes to no shock that I haven’t experienced any irritation, sensitized skin or harsh reactions to the retinal.Why I love it the most? It helps in texture and redness reduction. *I’ve been testing this for two months* Speechless results overnight!
