it’s a love and hate relationship with this cleanser. adored the smell because it reminded me of a facial or a spa. the only two things that didn’t work about this is: didn’t feel like it cleansed my face fully and the pump it came with never worked. depends uniquely on each person, if it didn’t work for me, it could be possible to work for you. more dislike than like.
