Going back to Adaptogen but I don’t hate this. Just not moisturizing enough for my dry skin. I have very dry skin and I had high hopes. Upon initial application, it felt very moisturizing. But after it dried down, my skin felt dry although I looked greasy. It’s almost like the product just sits on top of the  of  of the skin. Weirdly moisturizing yet drying
