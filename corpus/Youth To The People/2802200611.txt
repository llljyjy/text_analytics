I have been using this for about a month, starting once a week and moved up to twice a week after no bad reactions. I haven’t noticed much difference with fine lines, but I do think that my texture is improved and my skin feels smoother. It hasn’t irritated my sensitive skin which is great, and I only get very light tingling on my forehead where my skin in most sensitive. As mentioned it goes on yellow but fades after about 30 minutes, and I haven’t had any issues with staining. I’m on the fence if I will buy a full size, and hopefully will be able to decide by the time I finished my sample. Subtle results but a good start into Retinal
