I got this as a sample from Sephora and honestly, I really loved it. It makes my face feel soft and very hydrated, brighter, and plumed in the morning.  I use this product as my night moisturizer instead of an overnight mask. This product has really nice smell to it, very pleasant and light. favorite night time moisturizer!
