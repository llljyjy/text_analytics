I bought this stuff on vacation after I left my usual cleanser at home. I’ve heard great things about it and decided to give it a try! Unfortunately the extremely heavy fragrance just did not do it for me. My skin also felt stripped and dry after using it. I wanted to love this face wash because the glass bottle is so cute, but it wasn’t for me. If your skin is sensitive whatsoever to fragrance or imbalance in your moisture barrier- beware!! Sensitive Skin- Use W/ Caution!
