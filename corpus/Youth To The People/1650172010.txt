Overall, I am a huge YTTP fan. I felt comfortable using their products through pregnancy and this product is a staple in my skincare regimen. I took a break from this product and bought an alternative.. I couldn’t use up that stuff fast enough to get back to the glow dream oil. I have combination skin. I use about five drops and I’m able to get adequate coverage of my face, neck and decolletage areas. My skin feels soft and moisturized after. Keep coming back for more!
