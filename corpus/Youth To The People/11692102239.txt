I really love how hydrating this is, and that YTP has provided us with more options on serums. I have started using this at night and it has made a huge difference in my hydration and applying liquid BB cream smoothly. I wish I hadnâ€™t just re upped on my caffeine serum or else I would have purchased this one instead! Super hydrating!
