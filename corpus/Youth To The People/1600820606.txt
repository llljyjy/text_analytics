I’ve tried so many vitamin c serums. Most of them irritate me or cause breakouts. I gave up for a while but then saw this and decided to give it a try. So glad I did. This is the only vitamin c serum that’s ever worked for me. It’s gentle yet effective and gives such a nice glow instantly under my makeup. I especially love that it’s more of a watery consistency. Many of the other vitamin c serums I’ve tried often feel sticky and oily. I love that there’s caffeine in this one as well. So glad I found this. Amazing Vitamin C Serum
