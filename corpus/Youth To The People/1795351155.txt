I’ve used this product now for about 3 weeks, and ramped up from once a week to twice a week when I didn’t experience any irritation. The product has a somewhat alarming bright yellow color, but it does absorb fairly quickly with no trace of the color. This serum isn’t necessarily moisturizing, but I do hope that it will provide long term benefits. I am using it in combination with another YTTP serum (Oasis) to provide moisture. I do kind of wish I only had to use one serum. Absorbs well, no irritation
