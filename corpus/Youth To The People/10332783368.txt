The product overall is not too bad, the consistency reminds me a lot of Kiehls facial moisturizer, has very little scent to none at all which is nice! I have combo skin and in the short time I was using it, it did tend to leave me greasy even with the thinnest of layers I could do. Overall Not Bad, kind of Greasy
