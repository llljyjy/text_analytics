This was my first youth to the people purchase and I was sorely disappointed. I applied on slightly damp skin after a water toner (which I’ve done with my other serums) and unlike other hydrating serums I’ve used this felt watery and thin, and felt grainy or like it was pilling. It does seem to draw moisture into the skin but I did not enjoy the texture. Frankly I would go back to the ordinarys hyaluronic acid, this product just wasn’t worth it. No bang for your buck
