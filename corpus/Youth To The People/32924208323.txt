I love YTTP, I was obsessed for the longest time, but I’m honestly a little disappointed in the actual “moisturizing” aspect of this cream. I have combo skin, and even in my oily areas, this just isn’t moisturizing enough. Often I apply a facial oil over top my driest areas after my moisturizer, but with this cream, I have to apply my oil all over my face, even what’s usually my very oily areas where I’d hesitate to bring any oil near. It’s effective at boosting firmness, which I like, but I don’t think I’d repurchase this because it’s just not an effective moisturizer, and for $64, I really expected more from YTTP  :( Nice!! but for 64 dollars…?
