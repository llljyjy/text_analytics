unfortunately, this product did not do well with my skin, made me break out. I guess it MIGHT work for people with super dry and not acne prone skin. Felt really sticky on my face and was not absorbing at all ☹️ will try to use it as a hand mask maybe, the only good thing about this product is that it has very light, not irritating fragrance nan
