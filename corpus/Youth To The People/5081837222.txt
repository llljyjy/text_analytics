I got this to remove my makeup and cleanse my skin at the end of the day. I am a fan of one step oil or balm remover and cleansers. My biggest issue is it slightly stings my eyes. It is very mild discomfort and does not linger after, but this makes it not the most pleasant to use. I expect it to not irritate my eyes since it is meant to be used on my face..especially at this price.It does remove my makeup without feeling like its harsh on my skin, (which I like) but it also leaves a slightly oily residue .. I tend to use a bit of toner after to remove any makeup or oily feeling that did not rinse with water. People who double cleanse may like that this product removes makeup and cleanses without stripping the skin of moisture?Overall not the worst product, but I am not planning on purchasing again. nan
