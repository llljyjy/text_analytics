This helped clear my skin a lot. I’ve been suffering from major acne breakouts for the past few months and it left my skin blemished with plenty of red spots. As I was looking for anything to help me save my skin, a Sephora employee recommended I try this. I was hesitant at first since it is pretty expensive however I decided to give it a try since my skin was in such a bad condition. The first night I used this I was amazed to see that my skin redness was already way less red than it was. I continued using this product 2 times a week, then every second day and now I use it almost everyday. It can make your skin super sensitive and if that ever happens I just skip a day or two of using it. So far it’s helped a lot with my acne blemishes and I will definitely continue using this product. My skin is slowly going back to how it was and it’s amazing!! Also, the bottle appears small however you only need to use a pea sized amount so it last a looong time, I’ve been using this for two months and I still have a lot of it left. Helped my blemished skin
