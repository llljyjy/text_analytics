This is my first review ever because after spending probably thousands of dollars on skincare the past few years, no exfoliating toner has impressed me as much as this one.  I have “thick” congested skin and have for months, pimples that were so deep under my skin that would never come to the surface… finally after a few weeks of using this, they’re all coming to a head, but not in a crazy way.  They’re barely noticeable.  I’ve finally been able to get some extraction success (one on my cheek has been bothering me for months).  Usually any bha toner makes my skin react, i’ve tried Paula’s choice bha and stridex pads, among other things but this is the first product that seems to be CALMLY helping my skin.  It is gentle enough that I can use it twice a day.  I started out only once a week, then 2-3 times a week because I was afraid of a bad reaction and I’ve yet to have an issue now that i’m up to sometimes twice a day.  I’m very impressed.  My skin looks much clearer and this is the only difference i’ve made in my routine. Gentle magic
