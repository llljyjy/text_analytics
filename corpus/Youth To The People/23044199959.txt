I got this serum on a whim after reading about the benefits of peptides and cactus water; I would not splurge on a hyaluronic acid serum alone. This serum is light and layers really well with other steps of the beauty routine (essence + cream/sunscreen) without pilling. It is hydrating but I have noticed any groundbreaking plumping/firming effects that last yet. Hydrating!
