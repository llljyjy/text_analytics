There is a nice berry/fruity smell to it. First time using it, my nose and skin were itchy but I did wake up to “glowy” skin. Second time, didn’t have the reaction with nose or skin but didn’t notice a difference by morning. Third time, no difference at all. I don’t think it does much, there are definitely other better hydrating masks that do much better and see instant results. Will be returning. Surprised It Has the Allure Best of Beauty Award
