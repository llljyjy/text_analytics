i purchased this directly on the yttp because they had a sale and i was worried this wouldn’t be worth it. i was right. i noticed no results, it pills with certain moisturizers, and the pump is just awful it squirts the product all over the place. also it’s a shame that out of 400+ reviews only 20 are verified sephora shoppers. it’s so hard to trust reviews. also yttp was purchased by loreal so i expect quality to go down. not worth the pricetag. no results.
