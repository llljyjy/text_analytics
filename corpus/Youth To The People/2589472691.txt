This is a really lovely formula. It spreads easily (the yellow tone actually helps me ensure an even application before it dries down) and seems gentle. I’ve only used it a few times so I can’t speak to the long-term benefits but my sensitive skin was comfortable with multiple applications the first week and I noticed exfoliating benefits. My skin never did adjust to PC’s cult retinol so I’m excited to continue using this formula. lovely formula
