I have sensitive skin with rosacea and psoriasis. This product works well for exfoliation and anti acne, as a spot treatment, area (t-zone or forehead) or as a full face mask, without irritation. This summer I have used it 1-3 times a week and tolerate it well. If you are very sensitive, you may want to start off with 2-5mins at first, and build up to a full 10-15 min dry down, to avoid irritation until your skin is used to it. I am almost done with my first bottle. The 2 oz size goes a long way. I will definitely be re-ordering again. Works for spots and brightenig, while still mild.
