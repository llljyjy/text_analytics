I was a die hard Farmacy Green Clean fan. Still love it but I dare say this is better. This is thicker and feels more moisturizing. It really feels amazing on your skin. Smells fresh. This also foams up much better than Green Clean once you add water. This is also gentle in your eye area and does not burn. I typically double cleanse. With this stuff I can double cleanse or leave the second step out if I don’t feel like washing my face again. The only thing I don’t care for is that the container it comes in is glass and pretty heavy for how big it is. For travel, this isn’t ideal. I think it could also use an applicator so you dont have to dig your fingers into the product. Other than that I think i may have a new favorite cleansing balm. Good stuff!! nan
