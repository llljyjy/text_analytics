after using my other facial cleanser for years I’ve decided to try something new so I went ahead and bought the small size of this cleanser. I absolutely love it.  It has a decent accent n it’s very gentle on the skin. doesn’t leave my face feeling too dry. Feels fresh and clean.  For reference I have dry skin oh so gentle
