I have pretty normal, (not dry, not oily) acne-prone skin and when I first tried this cleanser in San Francisco, it was intense and felt like my skin was squeaky clean, stripped of all moisture, so i thought that I hated it. However, when I tried this cleanser in Florida, I loved it! Left my face feeling really clean and fresh after a day of sweat, sand, salt, etc. so I think this cleanser works best if you don’t have the elements working against you (I.e. a dry climate). If you have dry skin and/or live in a dry-ish climate, I don’t recommend, but if your skin is more oily and/or you live in a humid climate, then I recommend! Worked in Florida, not in San Francisco!
