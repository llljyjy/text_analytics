This product works very well - my skin felt immediately more hydrated! I like that YTTP uses bio-peptides, as opposed to copper, so it can be easily used with any Vitamin C serum. However, the pump is very finicky. It often shoots out the serum at odd angles and gets stuck halfway while pushing it down. The price point also seems very high for only 1oz of serum. Each application is 2 pumps, and it seems like I’m going through the bottle very quickly for $54. I’m not sure if I’ll re-purchase. If I find another clean/planet+ product that’s similar formulation (I know- YTTP is really a unicorn in this sense), but cheaper, I’ll likely purchase that instead. nan
