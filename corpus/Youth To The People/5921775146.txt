Probably my least favorite YTTP product. This product require to be emulsified, preferably with a hot towel and then second cleanse off with a cleanser. I do it anyway with every balm but the feeling of needing to because it stays greasy after rinse is just not so ideal. Don’t feel it’s any special, a lot of better balm out there with better using experience in similar price range if not cheaper. nan
