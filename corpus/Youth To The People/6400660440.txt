I really love this product. I have been hesitant to fry a retinol because of all the potential things that could go wrong because of the strength of the ingredient. I have normal/dry skin and donâ€™t have acne or scarring so I was hesitant for a long time to introduce something that may add more harm than good. I was really happy to try this product because I could visibly see a glow the next day. And there are no issues - no peeling, no needing to stick to schedules, etc. I would highly recommend to someone wanting to try a retinol without all the stress of it. Great east introduction to retinol
