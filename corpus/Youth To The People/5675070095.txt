What an amazing retinal product. My skin really took to it! It didn’t dry me out like other retinol products, but I still suggest using adequate moisture. It was gentle enough to put on my neck, which I can’t do with other products. It feels smooth and moisturizing when I apply it and easily sinks into my skin. I have only used it for a week and so can’t say if I’ve seen results just yet but definitely interested in the full size! Gentle and Effective
