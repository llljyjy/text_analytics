I have dry, acne-prone skin and a minimal routine, so I really need a cleanser that fights acne as well as cleansing, and this one does a great job! Love this stuff, my skin always is considerably less red, plus I wake up the next day and my face looks and feels noticeably better! You look forward to using it if you have any kind of irritation. However, after consistent use, though my acne was nearly gone, my face began to feel very dry and tight. A thicker moisturizer or oil would probably compensate, but since I’m sensitive to heavy creams, I ended up switching to Krave’s Matcha Hemp Cleanser, which feels the same but doesn’t foam, so is less stripping (and a lil cheaper lol) Still, I recommend this one to anyone who asks, especially if you are on the oily side! I think it’s the best cleanser at Sephora and still might come back to it in the summer. 10/10 for acne prone
