I’m really enjoying this product. I received a sample for free to review. This product is lightweight, but is moisturizing enough for summer for me. My skin is sensitive and combination oily. I have used the product for 3-4 days so far without any reaction, and it doesn’t make me dry or oily(unless I put on too much). The only thing I wish was different is the packaging. The product is a cream but more on the thin side and I think a pump would be better. I like it
