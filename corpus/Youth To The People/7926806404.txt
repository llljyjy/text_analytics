I originally got this product as a free sample then decided to purchase it despite the cringe of spending almost $90 on a face product. This product has noticeably changed my skin, making it smoother and more luminous. I’m also fairly new to retinoids and have sensitive skin, I find this product is delicate enough for me. The downside is that when you apply it, it makes your skin a bit yellow but I only use this product before bed so I don’t really mind (it doesn’t stain your skin to be clear). I use this product about 2-3 times a week and I don’t think I would ever use it daily, you just don’t need to to see the benefits and it can make your skin peel if used too much. Gentle and Effective
