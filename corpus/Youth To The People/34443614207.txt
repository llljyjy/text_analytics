Great cleanser. Didn’t like the salad smell at first but grew to like it. Works good for my skin. It doesn’t remove makeup tho so u need to double cleanse with makeup remove or micellar water first which is a bit annoying. The packaging sucks tho. While I appreciate what they trying to do with them being glass instead of plastic, it makes them a bit dangerous. I don’t like having to worry about dropping it bc it gets slippery when wet. Also according to reviews their pump design is awful and i don’t like the screw cap either. So i solved that problem by buying some cheap plastic 6oz bottles with flip top on amazon to store the cleanser in and then just refill it from the ytp cleanser bottle. I would suggest ytp use a plastic bottle with a flip top on it for the smaller size and then only use glass with screw top for the large refill bottles. nan
