i was really excited to try this because of all the good reviews and i wanted to love it but i really wasn’t a fan of the “squeaky clean” feeling it left on my face. it felt like it stripped my skin(i do have pretty dry skin so that could be why?!) i also broke out the next day lol maybe just a coincidence but meh
