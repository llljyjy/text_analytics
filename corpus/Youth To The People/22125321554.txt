This is a great moisturizer! I only got this as a sample, but honestly could feel immediate results. It locked in moisture and instantly hydrated my skin. I put this on at night and the next day my skin still felt so hydrated and moisturized. I would buy, but unfortunately, I don’t have the money for it. Disclaimer: My skin is different from yours and everybody’s else’s what works on me might not work on yours. And that is fine. Love at First Free Sample!
