I really wanted to like this stuff. I love the brand and like the caffeine vitamin C mixture. I got a sample and only used it twice. Both times it was so tacky and felt terrible on my face that I had to wash it off. The second time I tried using a different toner, thinking it just didn’t go well over the one I was using, but nothing was different. I hadn’t even started putting on makeup yet, with my moisturizer alone it started pilling and left a residue on my skin which you can see in the picture I’m not sure if the formula has recently changed or this was a bad batch, but the rating doesn’t make sense for the product I experienced Sticky texture and awful pilling
