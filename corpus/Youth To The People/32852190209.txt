I have combination oily skin. Oily in the summer and more dry in the winter. So finding a summer moisturizer that doesnâ€™t make me even more greasy can be a challenge. I was using the Clinique moisturizing gel and wanted to make the switch to something that was cruelty free. I finally found this moisturizer almost a year ago and IM IN LOVE!!This is a great summer moisturizer or great if you live in a humid area. It leaves my skin glowy and moisturized but it literally feels like nothings on my face. I feel like it helps control oil production too.Just a warning for some people:Hyaluronic Acid works by pulling moisture in the air to make your skin appear more plump and moisturized. If you live in a dry area, keep in mind that HA will draw in moisture from you skin instead of the atmosphere instead, making your skin more dry. I use this in the summer but use the other YTTP moisturizer in the winter. My new favorite I LOVE IT
