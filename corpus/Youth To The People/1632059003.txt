I only bought the mini of this cleanser and it succeeded in its aim of making my want to buy the full size this coming VIB sale. But gurrrrrrl, you’re $47. I had vowed to never pay more than $20 for a cleanser because it’s literally money down the drain. It just goes against my skincare philosophy. And like the Pacifica Kale cleanser is a perfectly good cleanser as well.... buuuuuuuuut, buuuuuuuuuut, my skin does undeniably feel more stripped when I use it. Also when this says you can use a first AND second cleanser, it’s true you totally can. The eye irritation is minimal when getting off eye make-up. It’s great for the days I’m feeling lazy about my nighttime skin care routine which is like ALL THE NIGHTS. And the smell! I feel so clean, so squeaky clean and like I just had a green smoothie before bed.Can I get some halp here guys? What should I do? (in cart... outta cart) Hi!
