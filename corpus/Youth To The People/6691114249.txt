I like this product a lot, but the price is way too high. Smells like Pepsi. I would say it’s good if you have combination skin. I am very dry so have a tight feeling after putting it on. It gives a slight dewy look without the feel of being dewy. I like it but don’t love it especially for the price. Like it a lot but not a love for dry skin
