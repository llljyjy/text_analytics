This smells like the freshest of spring days. It’s so packed full of amazing ingredients I adore this cleanser every single time I use it! Some find it a bit drying, but I find it leaves my skin clean without being dry. I use this as my second cleanse when I feel my skin needs a refresher, kind of like veggies after a night out drinking. Good for the body!I’ve bought the massive refill bottle to keep this topped up at all times! Favourite cleanser ever!!!
