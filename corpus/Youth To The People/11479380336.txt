I first purchased the Youth To The People Cleanser as a travel size but as soon as I ran out, I right away went to buy the bigger bottle due to how much change I saw in my skin. I have suffered with Acne my whole life as well as very oily skin. I always have an issue with cleansers due to how dry they can be or how oily my skin can get after using it, but i found my new favorite holly grail. It’s helped a lot with my hormonal acne as well as reducing the appearance of my acne scars. I do recommend not going crazy with it since it can dry out your skin just a tad bit but nothing a moisturizer can’t help. nan
