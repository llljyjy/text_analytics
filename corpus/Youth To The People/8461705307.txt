I got this product as a mini from the Sephora points and I was eager to try it. My skin is generally too sensitive for vitamin c, but this product didn’t sensitize or dry my skin out. I also noticed that several PIE marks were fading already after a week of use and my skin looks and feels more supple. My only two qualms with the product are these: it is sooo damn sticky, and the smell reminds me of a combination of root beer and carne asada. Thankfully the product sinks in quickly and the smell dissipates as you rub it in. I’d say this vitamin is (pricey) worth the splurge if you can afford it. worth it but stinky
