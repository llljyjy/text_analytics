I am late to the game on this as my skin was super sensitized for awhile so I didn’t want to use it just yet. I am happy to say that this didn’t irritate my skin at all on application! It sinks in nicely and doesn’t have an overpowering smell. Really looking forward to seeing more results from this. nan
