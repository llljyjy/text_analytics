I now know to never trust samples! Second time I used a sample and loved it to just be disappointed after I buy the full product, I got a sample of this and I loved it so much and seen so many good reviews so I decided to splurge and stray away from my normal face cleansers and ever since I’ve been breaking out like crazy , and that’s with the bottle almost gone , nothing has changed regarding my face routine besides this , I went from hardly ever having acne to now completely broken out I noticed this after using half the bottle and I decided to use it till it’s gone since it’s a bit pricey to just throw away but I just can’t, not a fan of any of the youth to the people products , nothing but terrible for my face , this and the face mask. I’ll stay away from this company like the plague lol love that it’s sustainable and vegan but my face hates it lol nan
