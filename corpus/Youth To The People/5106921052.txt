My favorite cleanser to date! Every time I try to switch to a new cleanser, there is always an “I like this but…” moment. However, with the YTP cleanser, I’ve never had a moment when I questioned whether or not it worked. My skin remains clean, it takes off all of my makeup, and it doesn’t overly dry out my skin. It works best when paired with the make-up remover balm, but if you don’t wear a lot of makeup, then I’m sure you’ll be fine just double cleansing. nan
