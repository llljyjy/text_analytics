This is a great substitute for my prescription tretinoin while I’m traveling. Alternately, if one’s skin care needs were modest, one could probably spend years using this retinol without needing to prescribe to tretinoin. It does a better job of keeping my skin barrier intact. Highly recommend! Effective and gentle retinol
