Used biotherm homme all my life (make 34) and even though I’ve been pleased with their products decided to cut out alcohol denat and upgrade my skin care. In the process iv tried many different brands and have to say yttp is by far the most unique and enjoyable. This moisturizer is heavenly and even tho it’s not advertised as oil-free it’s still very light and just glides on like butter . I would say it’s a little too light to use during winter but this as my day time moisturizer and skinfix barrier+ during the day my skin hasn’t felled and looked better. Also LOVE the subtle herbal scent. Skin is toned and refreshed. Definitely a fan! nan
