i bought this cleanser because a certain someone raved about this cleanser and how good it was for oily skin and oil control and for me cleansers just,, cleanse like i dont have a holy grail cleanser because every cleanser just does the same thing some worse some better but this cleanser. holy wow was this cleanser bad, it didnâ€™t smell good at all, the pump at the end had huge issues for me and the cleanser started to accumulate around the pump and turn brown and become unusable. the cleanser itself dried my skin out so bad and my skin is an oil mountain, just a never ending stream of oil and for a cleanser to leave me feeling so tight and dry was pretty much unheard of for me. The person who recommended it said that it would leave your skin not stripped and refreshed....no. my skin felt so stripped afterwards and i was rushing to put on my toner each time i used it. used it up, never again, no please go spend a good $36 dollars elsewhere, personally i like the inkey list salicylic acid cleanser or the tatcha deep cleanse why did anyone say this was good
