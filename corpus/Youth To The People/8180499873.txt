I didn’t like it from the first use, but I thought I would give it 3 full weeks of use before I decided how I actually felt about it. I honestly thought I just needed to give it a chance since I was loyally using my previous cleanser for about 3 years. I have tried twice a day , once a day , a full pump , a half pump …. Nothing I do seems to help get my skin actually feeling clean… within minutes of getting out of the shower, my skin just feels tight and dry. left skin feeling dry but not clean..
