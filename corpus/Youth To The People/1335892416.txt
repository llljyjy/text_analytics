I have been using this serum for the past week and can already notice a difference in the appearance of my pores/texture and brightness of my skin. I have a few blemishes and those are fading more rapidly then before. It does not burn or tingle, applies smooth like a moisturizer and does not cause photosensitivity. I am using the serum 3x a week and desire to use it every other night now that I am noticing great results with no reactions. I typically am very sensitive to retinals/vitamin c/AHA’s & BHA’s.
