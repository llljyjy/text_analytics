I have used this mask about 4 times now and I have not really noticed a difference in my skin after using it. I have combo skin that leans dry and was looking for some added moisture during the winter time. I followed the directions on the packaging on how to use it but was ultimately just left with a thick film on my face. Disappointing. nan
