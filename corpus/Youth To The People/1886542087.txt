Really nice moisturizer. I love the superfood air-whip moisturizer so much I think that will stay my daily moisturizer for the morning, only because it’s lighter and I’m addicted to the smell. This one is a bit richer, and is a nice option if you prefer unscented products. I have been using it at night and really like it. nan
