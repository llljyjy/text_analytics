This is 100% worth the price point! I have been using this cleanser for almost two weeks and I have already noticed a huge difference in my skin’s luminescence and clearness. I typically only struggle with hormonal acne, and as I’m approaching “that time of month“ my skin is still pretty clear. Overall, just makes skin appear healthy. Worth the $$$
