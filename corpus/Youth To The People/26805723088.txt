At first I wasn’t going to buy this cleanser because of the price but a lot of people were recommending it to me so i purged and bought it and I definitely don’t regret it. I have dry skin so i have trouble finding a cleanser that wont strip my skin and this does just that! Amazing at taking off makeup including waterproof mascara! Will be repurchasing nan
