I love this brand of products. I was excited to try this polypeptide – 121 future cream. I was not disappointed, I will tell you that! This stuff is amazing!AH-mazing! The way my skin felt, how smooth and the texture because I have huge texture issues because I have lots of problems with my skin from Lyme disease… I will be buying this product when I run out of the sample size! I love it! I love it so much and the results that it made it possible to overcome the smell. The smell is very healthy, I would say you can tell it’s very plant-based which is a great thing but it is pretty stinky. The first several times I used it I could not stop thinking about the smell, but I kept thinking about what I wanted to see as results. The results blew me away and each time I put it on I told myself to just get over the smell! It’s just incredible the change in my skin in terms of texture and how hydrated my skin feels after just the first use. I have used it about five times since I received it and I still have plenty in the jar. I received the sample in exchange for my honest opinion and I am so grateful. What an amazing product you should treat your skin to! Get it Now!!
