I have extremely dry skin and I’ve struggled for months to find something to help. I bought the tester as an impulse buy and immediately fell in love and bought the full size two days after trying it. I use it as a last step at night after a moisturizer & I make sure to use it at least 30 mins before falling asleep. It doesn’t always feel like it absorbs but I wake up every morning with plump, hydrated skin. I have two moisturizers and I found that this doesn’t work well with extremely thick and rich moisturizer. I use it with first aid’s collagen moisturizer and found that it really wouldn’t absorb when I used the purple tatcha cream. I HIGHLY recommend getting the tester if you have dry skin!
