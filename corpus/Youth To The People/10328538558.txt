I’ve been incorporating YTTP products into my routine for years now. Their Adaptogen cream & face mist are staples for me, I’m also use their eye cream from time to time. I received a 15ml sample of this new launch from the brand which I was incredibly thankful for as I am always excited to try their new products. I’ve only been using the cream for about 5 days so I can’t speak on long term results but I do have some thoughts about cream. It has no scent at all which I love as I have sensitive skin and it very lightweight so it’s great for summer or mornings. It absorbs well, works well with my other products so far and does give my skin immense hydration. The ingredients list is impressive so I’m excited to see how the results progress as I will be purchasing the full size! longtime YTTP customer.
