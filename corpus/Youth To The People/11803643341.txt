I am honestly a huge fan of this cream. I have combination but mostly oily skin, and prone to breakouts. It’s the perfect day moisturizer, and I would’ve given it a 5 star but honestly the price is too much. If you’re using it every day, the jar goes very quickly, and $63 for this tiny jar just seems absurd. Although it is a staple in my skin care routine, it would be great for the company to recognize that this might be too expensive for their buyers and potentially mark it down in the future. $63 is too much
