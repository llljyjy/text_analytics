Had to make the effort to write a review because this is unacceptable. I have half a jar now with eye cream that is simply unusable. It does not deserve the price it has. For some reason it solidified and if you try to work with it it starts on pilling on you. Pity. There are few cruelty free and vegan eye creams out there, let alone one that has vitamin C in it. Could have been my favorite if it wasnâ€™t for this unforgivable flaw. Not worth it
