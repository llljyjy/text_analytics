I have bought this a week ago and did not notice a difference using it, until recently I felt a burn on my forehead and it unfortunately broke my skin barrier. I never had an issue with the Kombucha and 11% AHA overnight toner and I love their Adaptogen Deep Moisture Cream but this specific toner is not right for me. I have sensitive/combination acne-prone skin so I thought I could try this, but unfortunately this is a purchase I regret buying. nan
