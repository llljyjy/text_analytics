I got a sample of this with my order and honestly surprised by how much of a difference I noticed with just wearing it one day. I used it in the morning as my day time moisturizer and my makeup did not separate how it usually does obviously thatâ€™s not what this moisturizer claims to do but I definitely feel like it kept my skin from getting too oily and overall just made my skin look good. Will definitely be buying the full size on payday lol nan
