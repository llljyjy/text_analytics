I love this product so much, I have very sensitive skin with rosacea and thus am so careful to not use anything with drying alcohols, fragrant essential oils, perfumes etc. This product has no smell, is a viscous fluid and spreads really easily. It truly has a soothing, tightening effect, I love to use it morning and night and truly notice a difference in smoothness. You wonâ€™t see anything drastic but with long term use this serum feeds the skin with vitamins and peptides and keeps it healthy. If you find you have a damaged skin barrier, this is an easy reach and will help repair it and once repaired keep it strong. Highly recommend! smoothing and soothing
