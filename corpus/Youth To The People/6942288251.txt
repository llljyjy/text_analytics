Giving this 2 stars because I did enjoy the actual product. But the cap of my bottle broke off while I was on my birthday vacation. I brought this along as a new gift I had been given for my birthday. Unfortunately, Sephora said they couldnâ€™t exchange the bottle without me bringing it back to the store. Obviously since the cap was broken off I had no way to transport this back in a suitcase without the contents spilling everywhere. Pretty bummed because I was excited to test out the product since I love so many items from yttp. twist of cap very gently
