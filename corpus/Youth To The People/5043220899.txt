Having a freshly cleansed face is a great feeling. I’ve used a ton of different face washes (currently using Skyn Iceland) and none of them fully take off my foundation. This toner does the trick in taking away any makeup left behind. I love the slight tingly feeling I get when I apply it (because to me it feels like it’s working!) and I like the herbal smell. But what I really love is the smoothness of my skin and that it de-clogs my pores. My acne cleared up within a week of using this toner. It didn’t strip my skin or cause that tight feeling. It’s become a staple in my skincare routine. I used to use the Farmacy toner but switched over when I saw the results.It’s a pretty small bottle and I feel like I use it up pretty quickly. But definitely worth it! cleared my acne right up!
