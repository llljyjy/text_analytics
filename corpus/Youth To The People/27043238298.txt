I started using this product a few weeks ago and have already noticed some lightening of my hyperpigmentation. I had been looking for a retinol and this seems like a great choice. It was recommended to use it 1-2 times a week until my skin adjusted. No redness was caused, only results. I have found nearly all my YTTP products to work as described. I highly recommend this product. It works
