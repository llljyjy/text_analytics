This is not quite as good a formulation as drunk elephant protini, but it is not bad. I love that it is in glass rather than plastic. It gets the job done and it has not caused breakouts. It is not greasy at all. Overall I would repurchase, especially since the price and packaging is better than drunk elephant. nan
