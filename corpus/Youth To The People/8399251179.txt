I wanted to love this product so bad but truthfully it’s overrated. I don’t wear much makeup and it takes a lot of this product to properly remove it and even after I go in with a face wash I end up having to use another makeup remover. The product doesn’t really melt well and I always ended up with clumps of it in my hand making me feel like a lot of the product is wasted. The only reason I’ll give it 2 stars is because the packaging is pretty lol overpriced & overrated
