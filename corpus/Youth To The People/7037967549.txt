This seems to work pretty well.  I like that it doesn’t leave my face feeling all sticky like the Paula’s Choice one I usually use.  I took off a star because it’s expensive and because I don’t like the smell; to me it smells like a wound salve/ointment.  I’m about half way through the bottle and am undecided if I will buy it again or go back to PC. Good
