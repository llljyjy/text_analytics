I actually love this! I was skeptical because all the reviews are ( almost ) incentivized, so I didn’t know if I could trust it. But my skin seems to do well with cactus like ingredients, so I thought I’d give it a try. This stuff is great! My skin feels plump and moisturized, and it soaks in easily. Not oily at all. I haven’t noticed a smell either, so that’s a plus. For the record, I have rosacea with some pretty overheated flare ups, and I haven’t had an issues so far ( knock on wood, please not jinxing lol). I just use one pump at night and that’s it, I find I don’t really even need to use a moisturizer in the morning. amazing!
