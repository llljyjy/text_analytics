I have a sensitive oily acne prone skin. I know how weird my skin is but it is what it is. It’s really hard for me to look for a good skincare that really works and this cleanser just dry out my skin even after putting my lotion on. I also notice that i’m having more redness around my nose and  this big bumps in my chin probably because of irritation. I just want to try this because of how viral this product is but i guess it doesn’t work on my skin. For reference, I normally use the toleriane dermo cleanser from laroche posay. It’s clean your skin without irritating and drying it. Not for sensitive skin (period)
