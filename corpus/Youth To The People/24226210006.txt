I didn’t feel this product justified the price. I used it religiously every day until I ran out and didn’t notice the same results I’ve seen from other Vitamin C serums at the same price point. It also left my skin feeling tacky all day, and when worn under mineral based sunscreen it made the sunscreen slough off if I accidentally touched my face throughout the day. Better options out there
