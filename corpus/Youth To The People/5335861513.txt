I know this isn’t one of its advertised benefits… but I swear this stuff helped me combat my hormonal breakouts on top of my post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. My skin also feels bouncier my pores look smaller so I do feel it really helps support my collagen production. I want to stress that my hormonal breakouts range from mild to moderate and are not due to any underlying conditions. Something about vitamin C, especially this formula, has just REALLY helped me keep my skin clear. This was the only product I changed in my routine of a mild cleanser, AHA&BHA toner, hyaluronic acid&antioxidant essence, drunk elephant protini moisturizer, and a sleeping mask at night. does WONDERS for the clarity of my skin
