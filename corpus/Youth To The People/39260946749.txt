The bottle is not great. The pump shoots the serum out and ends up all over your hands instead of on finger tips. I love this serum though. My skin barrier has been so damaged and I incorporated this on my moisturizing nights to help and it has really made a difference! My skin is so much happier and healthier and hydrated and my redness is almost gone! nan
