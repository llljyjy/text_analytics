I was so excited for this product! I’ve watched many skincare “gurus“ recommend this cleanser. I choose it for its vegan/clean reputation, sleek appearance, and gel-based formula (ideal for us oily gals!). It just wasn’t worth the hype. I have very oily skin, but am prone to dryness and zits. I did experience some breakouts with this. For reference, I previously used Clinique “all about clean“ liquid facial soap oily skin formula. You can save roughly $17 on your cleanser! I am now using Clinque facial cleanser, and I find it suits my needs more. However, if you really prioritize a clean/vegan formula, this might be for you. Not Worth The Hype :(
