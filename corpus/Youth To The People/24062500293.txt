I was actually quite impressed by this cleaning balm. Out of all the cleansing balms I’ve tried this is the only one that doesn’t leave a film while also leaving no make-up on my skin afterwards. I really like how the texture melts so nicely as soon as you begin to rub it into dry skin and it does remove my eye makeup too. I also like the subtle fruity scent it has but mix that with a clay-like scent and that’s this scent for you. Still, this out performs all my other cleaning balms and even some cleansing oils. Plus this stuff is going to last me forever!!! Best cleansing balm I've tried
