I recieved this product from YTTP for my honest opinion. That being said I do really like the product. I only use at nighttime because I felt it made my skin way too dewy under my makeup for daytime. The consistency of the cream is thick but blends into the skin beautifully. It leaves my skin very hydrated and plump. I will purchase the full size when my trial size runs out. Great nighttime cream!
