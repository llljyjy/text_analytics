I have oily/combo skin and this left my skin feeling VERY clean, borderline dry. It takes off makeup well without irritating my eyes. The smell is very fresh and it foams well. A moisturizer is a must when using this product especially if you have normal to dry skin. I am on day 3 of using it day and night and have not had any negative reactions yet so it might just be my new go to cleanser. Super clean
