Really great for removing any spf/ makeup/ oil. I believe it does have fragrance but it never irritates my skincare and it’s a wash off so it really shouldn’t cause irritation. The amount that you get is very good for the price so I would 100% recommend unless your very sensitive to fragrance A good cleansing balm
