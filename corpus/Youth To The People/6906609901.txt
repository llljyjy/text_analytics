I do not recommend this product at all. When first opened, the consistency is fine, no problem...but over time, the texture changes dramatically into something unusable. It becomes so solid that you can’t pick up a small amount and are forced to scoop up a portion with your nail...and it will not spread onto the skin. I never encountered anything like that, and I’m shocked that this item is still being sold. It happened with both jars that I owned, so it isn’t a fluke. Waste of money. DO NOT BUY
