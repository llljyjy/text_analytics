this product comes in a thick glass bottle, which is strange for a everyday cleanser. I had the not so pleasant experience of this bottle breaking and shards of glass ending up all over my bathroom floor. Then customer service refusing to return or resend a new one after spending close to $1500 on purchases for the month. BEWARE
