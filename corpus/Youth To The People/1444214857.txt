I can’t speak to long term results yet, but after a few uses my skin feels tighter (in a good way!) and really smooth when I wake up. The consistency takes a little time to get used to, but it does soak into the skin well. I’m hesitant to spend this much not knowing long term results, but my experience with YTTP products makes me believe this product will be worth it. nan
