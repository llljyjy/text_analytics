It definitely worked and helped with minimizing my pores and some fine wrinkles on the sides of my eyes-- but as others have said, the yellow stain would definitely be an issue for some. Honestly, after 10 minutes I would just moisturize as usual, and the stain would go away. But I’m glad I didn’t try it out the first time before starting a work day or going out; the yellow on my skin definitely made my heart stop for a second. But it doesn’t last more than 10 minutes. The rest of the serum works great; it feels light weight, smells just nice and vaguely spa like, and luxurious feel. It fits well into my regimen, and I’ve used it every 3 days without any negative side effects. Great serum, but momentary yellow stains are real
