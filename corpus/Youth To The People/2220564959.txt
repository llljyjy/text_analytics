I used this moisturizer when my face was pretty sunburned and in need of a good moisturizer and surprisingly this REALLY helped!  I started using it day and night and then switched to just nights when the sunburn cleared and my skin felt great!  I’m just so shocked because I am very Irish lol so I was pretty red and normally I just dry out and peel and don’t get me wrong I peeled a little but not like I normally would have!!  I truly believe this helped greatly in that!  I want to say thank you to YTTP for the sample, which I received for free in exchange for my honest review.  I didn’t give 5 stars, I think 4 is just right. New fav!
