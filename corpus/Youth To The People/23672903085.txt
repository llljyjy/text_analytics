I have tried so many products on my skin and I get irritation with so many products. I have tried so many dermatologist recommended products and they all broke me out. This face cleanser is my holy grail! It makes my skin feel so clean, hydrated and glowing. No irritation at all. The price is a bit high, but at this point I will pay the price to have a product that works amazing on my skin. Clean, hydrated and glowing skin!!!!
