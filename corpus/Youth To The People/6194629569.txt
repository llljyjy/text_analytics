I have very sensitive,  dry skin.  When I first for it, I was a little unsure.  It has a very light smell  I can’t tell you whether I like it or nit.  But  the cream  itself, is amazing.  A little goes such a long way  especially for my dry parched skin. It reduces my fine lines and wrinkles and hydrates ny skin.  It’s def a keeper! Ah-ma-zing!
