This oil is so good and is beautiful under makeup. The only issue is the dropper. It completely broke. It seems to be a common issue from reading other reviews. You can fix it, but it’ll break again lol. It’s quite annoying. I probably won’t buy it again. I’m sure you can find another oil just as nice with a working dropper. Why sell broken bottles?
