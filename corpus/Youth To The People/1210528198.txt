This stuff is holy grail worthy! I’ve tried several under eye creams including Tatcha, Belif, and Clinique with meh results. I gave in and bought this on my last order and have been using it twice a day. All I can say is WOW. I have a large, deep wrinkle under my left eye from sleeping on my side/malar bag and this cream has helped diminished it more than anything has. My under eye area in general looks smoother, brighter, and more hydrated. A little goes a long way so it’s a great value too! I will be repurchasing this! WOW
