What’s growing in these bottles is the harmless colony called “Mother,“ “SCOBY,“ “zoo-biotic mat,“ etc.  It grows in unpasteurized apple cider, ACV, and kombucha.  I recognized its tangy smell when I opened my new bottle in February, so I decanted one ounce at a time into a smaller bottle, using that til empty, then refilling as needed.  The dwindling solution in the 4oz container stayed clear until mid-July, when I started using the last ounce-ish straight from YTP’s bottle.  Summer heat (and repeated exposure to air and the normal ambient yeast spores in it) spurred previously-imperceptible organisms to multiply and gel-- just like inside a half-full bottle of vinegar stored in a warm place.  If my container were still full, I’d strain out the kelpy-looking clots through sterilized cheesecloth or muslin, then keep using the product; but having so little left, it’s not worth my effort.Fermented food is good for our insides and skin, so I believe THIS PARTICULAR funky-looking liquid is safe-- it’s just no longer practical for me. (If used unstrained, the kelpy bits are visible on my skin til rinsed away)OTHERWISE-- it’s a good product that hasn’t caused any negative effects on my sensitive & acne-prone skin. OK Product (and here is why it "goes bad")
