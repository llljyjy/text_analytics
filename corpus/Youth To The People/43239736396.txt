I know this sounds silly but I can’t get over the colour of the serum. The yellow does not blend away, I can very obviously see it on my face which is not pale either. It can mark my bedding so you’d think to use it in daytime but I can’t due to the colouring. I really want to push through because it does feel hydrating and I’ve read so many good things but the colour unfortunately is off putting for me personally. I don’t want to worry about whether I look like I have jaundice. This might not be an issue on deep skin tones and maybe some people can make it work despite the colour. It’s just not for me, sadly Yellow colour is a no no
