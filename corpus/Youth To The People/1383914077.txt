I am writing this review after using this product for a few weeks. I can say by the second week I could see a slight improvement in the texture and noticed my skin tone appeared brighter/more even. I like that there is not a strong scent and it smells pleasant. The one thing I did not like was the tint of the product as it can get messy and transfer at first, but it did seem to absorb and the color fade after a bit. nan
