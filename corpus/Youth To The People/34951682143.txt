This is the only face wash i’ve had that prevents my skin from breaking out. I ran out a few days ago and the break outs have started, and i knew i needed to replenish! The smell is so fresh and clean and it just feels so nurturing on your skin. Can’t wait to try more youth to the people products. 10 out of 10 my skin loves! Happy skin happy me
