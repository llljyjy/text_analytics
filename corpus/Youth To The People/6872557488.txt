I bought this kit from a gift card I received. A little pricy for little bottles but does help with choosing what to get the big size of. I recently purchased a big bottle of the cleanser and the moisturizer. I still haven’t finished the serum, the oil of the exfoliating mask but I am still unsure if I’ll get the big product. I got a sample of the mask last time and wanted to try out more products from Youth To The People and I wasn’t disappointed by it. I LOVE THIS LITTLE KIT
