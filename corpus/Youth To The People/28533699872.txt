I was so excited to try this product for my dark spots and circles. I am about halfway through the bottle and have noticed lots of unusual breakouts in places that are not typical for me, and I think I’m naming this serum as the culprit as I have changed nothing else in my skin routine. It could be something else causing the breakouts, but for the price and quantity that you get I expected more. Ehhhh it’s alright
