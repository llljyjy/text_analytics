I love this oil! I got it as part of a youth to the people box, and now I had to buy the bigger version because I love it! My skin just loves this oil. I previously used the Rosehip oil from the Ordinary, and this is much lighter and less like olive oil. My skin is not oily in the morning either like with some other facial oils I have used. I would recommend this product wholeheartedly! Great Facial Oil!
