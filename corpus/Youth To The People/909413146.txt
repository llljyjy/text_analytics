love this mask- LOVE. I typically avoid or am weary of clay purifying masks because they are SO dry and stripping on my skin. But this stuff? Not drying at all. And there’s a bonus- it has BHA so its also gently exfoliating! I love me a multitasker. I have sensitive skin, with aging concerns (I’m 41 but dont look it), and normal-dry depending on the season. The kicker is to not over use or leave on for too long (duh). But my skin always feels soft and smooth right after use. I use it about 2 times a week! The best clay mask for sensitive/dry skin
