I tried a deluxe sample of this a while ago and really liked it. Got the full size during the spring sale and it’s way different! The ginger scent is SUPER strong, the texture doesn’t seem as nice as before, and my skin reacted negatively. Maybe they tweaked the formula? Unfortunately will be returning this one. nan
