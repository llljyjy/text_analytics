As Im approaching my mid-thirties, the need for hydration intensifies. This cream is my miracle worker, since using it my skin has never looked better. After a week of using, my pores are less noticeable, the skin is soft, hydrated, and plumper. My skin is so clear, I havent had to use foundation and have received many compliments. If youâ€™re looking for a good moisturizer and have dry sensitive skin like me, this is highly recommended. Miracle Product!
