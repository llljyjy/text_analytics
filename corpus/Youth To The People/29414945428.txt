Loved this cream! It is a thicker, creamier blend but applies smoothly and absorbs pretty quickly. Iâ€™ve tired one other polypeptide cream from a high end brand and liked this one waaay more. I typically use the YTTP adaptogen deep moisture cream in the fall/winter months and air-whip moisture cream in the spring/summer but this think could be a really nice year round cream! YTTP does it again!
