Not sure of the love for this product! I find I have to use a lot and it doesn’t glide easily which causes me to pull on my skin. The worst part - no matter how much I warm it up in my hands - there are always chunks! Not a fan. Will be going back to the Drunk elephant or maybe I’ll try the Clinique take the day off. A recent sample I got works better than this. DON’T BE FOOLED BY THE STAR RATING!
