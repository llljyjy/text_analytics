I tried the small bottle to see how my skin would like it and I have very sensitive skin. After trying it my skin felt so refreshed and clean. It did not irritate my skin at all and did not leave it dry after. I also like the feel of the glass bottle. I will definitely consider buying a larger one next time! Refreshing!
