I really like how smooth and hydrated this makes my face feel, and it isn’t heavy feeling at all. It absorbed fairly quickly but I could feel it soaking in and my skin plumping up after about 30 seconds, and the hydration lasted all night. I’m not sure if I experienced some purging with a few pores, but it cleared up in a couple days and my face looks great! I got this right before going on a multiple day offroad trip to the desert, so my skin was definitely thirsty when I got back and started trying this. This seems to pair especially well with the new retinal + niacinamide serum, they just work really well together vs nights with my usual nightly vitamin c and antioxidant serums when it comes to smoothness. I definitely think the Polypeptide-121 Future Cream will be a regular addition to my skincare routine. Plumping and hydrating
