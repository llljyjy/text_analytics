I was so excited to try this as I love youth to the people and I’ve been looking for a gentle exfoliant. Unfortunately I couldn’t even try the products since it came with stringy, clumpy gunk floating all around. Ive found many similar complaints online, and those who have reached out to yttp seem to get responses that this is normal and still alright to use. This to me seems shady to me and I refuse to put it on my face or exchange for another especially since I’ve heard people experience this weird “growth“ in the bottle even when it didn’t appear initially. Overall I was very let down and the fact that the brand is treating it as a non issue makes me question all their other products. Spoiled product
