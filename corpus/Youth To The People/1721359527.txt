I received a large sample of this in an order from Sephora, and I’m always on the lookout for a cleanser for my aging, dry skin, to help me balance with my moisturizers.  This one is very nice.  It helped remove the small amount of makeup I wear without leaving my skin feeling stripped, and it has a delightful fragrance while doing it.  I gladly ponied up the funds to get a full sized bottle when my sample was finished. Just what a sample should produce - a purchase!  LOL  I recommend it.  It’s a pleasant to use product - very simple. Wonderful stuff!
