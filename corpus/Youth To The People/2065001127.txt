Another product that YTTP did not disappoint on. This product did not cause any breakouts on my skin, and did seem to provide the hydration and firmness as stated. The only negative I would make mention of is the fact that I would use only one pump of this product as opposed to two. Too much of it seems to leave a slightly sticky feel, which I am not that fond of. Otherwise GREAT product as with all other YTTP products. nan
