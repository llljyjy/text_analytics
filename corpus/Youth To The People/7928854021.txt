I like the applicator, the ginger scent and how lightweight it is. However, it often feels sticky, has pilled my sunscreen, and not very hydrating. It irritated my sensitive skin at first so I slowly incorporated it a few times a week until I could tolerate each morning. I think itâ€™s overpriced. Overpriced
