Im being as honest as I can be, this is the only product I’ve ever used that broke me out. I’ve always had clear skin and I’ve never ever gotten a pimple before using this product. My skin is nowhere near sensitive. It has always been good, until after using this. This is the first product to give be pimples. I used it only twice maybe before it gave me the first pimple. Don’t buy. Would rather use terrible St Ives over this
