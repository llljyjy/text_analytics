I really wanted to love this product. It goes on super smooth, smells fresh, and sinks in quickly, but it’s not heavy enough for my combination & dehydrated skin. I like it for layering with a hydrating essence & sunscreen in daytime and with the essence & face oil at night, but if I don’t use anything else with it in the morning, my face will feel tight midday. Nice layering product that doesn’t break me out but probably better for summer or oily skin types IF you don’t layer with other products. I will definitely use it up since I layer with other hydrating products, but probably won’t repurchase since I like feeling super moisturized during the day. Better for Oily Skin or Layering
