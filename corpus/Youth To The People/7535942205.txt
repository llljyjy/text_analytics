If you have an uneven skin texture, this is for you. I’ve tried several AHAs and BHAs, and none of them have worked for me, not even the highly raved about ones such as the 2% BHA Paula’s choice solution. If anything, these were too harsh and made my skin even worse! I wanted this for a while and I finally got my hands on it. It smells absolutely amazing and so refreshing. It has the consistency of water and dries quickly into the skin. It doesn’t burn and don’t worry about the little floaties in it because that is normal (which I hope makes you happy considering you wouldn’t have to throw away a pricey product like this one). The large photo was taken two days after using the products. Originally I wanted to wait a while so that I had a before and after picture to show, but since it started acting so fast, I went ahead and snapped it extremely early. The little bumps on my face are shrinking yet my skin is having a healthy purge at the same time, something that I didn’t really see with previous products I’ve tried. Very gentle yet very effective. I normally have dry/dehydrated skin and I haven’t found this product to dry it out even more or cause any issues. goodbye uneven texture!
