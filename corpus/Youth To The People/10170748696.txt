I wanted to love it so bad. I wanted to like it because of how fresh and clean it smells and glides on to the skin. However, after using it for a whole month, Iâ€™ve experienced the worst breakouts of my life. It often left my face very dry, which is a problem I have never encountered with any cleanser before. Terrible breakouts :(
