This is the best, most nourishing and sensitive-skin friendly face mist out there. YTTP always knows what they’re doing when it comes to skincare products and this guy is no different. My *only* gripe is the high price; it’s hard to justify paying over $40 USD for a mist. However, this one is definitely worth the price, especially if you can manage to find it discounted at all. Overall, I highly recommend this and all of YTTP’s skincare products — I’ve tried most of their skincare and I can say with confidence that I trust the brand 100% with all my skincare needs. Sure, their products are pricey, but they sure are effective and have never steered me wrong! Best skincare mist
