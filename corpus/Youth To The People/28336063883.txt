Actually did a great job as far as making my skin look happy and healthy. Ended up being too light and didn’t go far enough for the price and that’s really the primary issue for me. I have combo skin and would typically use this in the mornings after a double cleanse while my face was still a bit damp. I just apply with hands. It has a light pleasant smell and goes on real smooth. 10-15 mins after my routine is done, I would find myself having to apply again to reach desired moisture level otherwise I’d end up with flakiness. Solid product if you have the budget. Hard work. Short hours.
