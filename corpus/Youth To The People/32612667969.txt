it’s my favorite cleanser that i’ve ever tried and will definitely repurchase in the future. it smells good, feels soft while applying, and makes my skin feel great (plus it doesn’t leave a sticky feeling on my skin like a lot of other cleansers i’ve tried). the only issue i have is that i don’t get a pump with the mini size so it’s a bit difficult to get out, but that is something that can be solved by buying the full size which i will in the future. absolutely love this cleanser!
