I love (most) of YTTP stuff and I have been looking for a serum to use as after cleansing so when k saw them launch this I had to try it. I have been using it every morning and night as the first step in my skincare routine (after cleansing) for two weeks and I 1000000% feel a huge difference in my skin. It is so soft and sometimes I get dry patches from retinol on my eyebrows and I have not had that issue since. It is expensive and itâ€™s not going to clear your acne but it will absolutely change the texture of your skin which was exactly what I was looking for. love love love
