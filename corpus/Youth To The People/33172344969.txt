I was really looking forward to trying this product out, I started to pump it out of the bottle but it was taking forever to come out. So I unscrewed the top just to take a look and the whole bottle was empty! I shined a flashlight in there and didn’t see any liquid but it does smell like there could’ve been some product inside? But unfortunately it’s empty lol I have ordered from YTTP many times before and have never had any issues so I’m pretty disappointed with this empty bottle. Received Empty Bottle :(
