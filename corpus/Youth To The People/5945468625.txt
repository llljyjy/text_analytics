this definitely improved the texture of my skin. my nose and chin have gone back to feeling really bumpy since i ran out of this cleanser and switched to another. i feel like i could entirely stop using toner and maybe even other products if i continue using this cleanser. still canâ€™t believe what a difference-maker it is. i have to knock off a star because of the price, though. shockingly good
