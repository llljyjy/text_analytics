i’ve only used this twice so far and i cant already see a huge difference in the clarity, brightness, and texture of my skin. i have dry, sensitive, acne prone skin and this does not sting or burn my existing / active breakouts, it also does not dry my face out, it’s super gentle but effective. i was hesitant when i read it was safe for daily use but it really is. i follow usually with a hydrating serum and a rich moisturizer and sometimes an oil and it’s bomb im obsessed just wow
