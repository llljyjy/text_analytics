The fragrance is amazing and it definitely feels like a luxury cleanser. I do think that it is more suited to oily skin types and isn’t the best choice for normal skin that leans slightly dry. That’s not the fault of the product, though, but I do wish that the description below didn’t imply that it’s for all skin types. It’s a great option for oily/combo skin that wants a very purifying cleanse, though! Not the best for normal to dry skin
