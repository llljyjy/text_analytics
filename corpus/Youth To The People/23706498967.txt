It was a pretty good hydrating serum and I do love anything YTTP! I used it in cold weather (Chicago) and it definitely helped keep my face moisturized. I’m not sure it’s as firming as I’d like it to be since I’m 43 and need something more repair/prevent-more-ish, but definitely worked well as a base layer for something a little more firming. Used day as a base and at night as a step after washing but before creams when you don’t feel like using a serum. Extra Moisturizing Layer
