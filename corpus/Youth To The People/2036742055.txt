Normally I love this cleanser, but the bottle I’ve only had for a couple of months has completely changed colour, is now creamy and smells terrible. There isn’t instructions on any specific storage requirements that I can find (unless I’m wrong?), and it just stays on a shelf high up in my shower. Love it when it doesn’t literally go bad, but won’t be buying again :( Went bad after only a couple months?
