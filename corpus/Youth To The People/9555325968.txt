This serum pills. I can’t wear it with ANYTHING … not even make up, not other serums, even moisturizers pill… it’s thick and sticky and I’m upset I threw away the box cause I REALLY want to return this! I wasted $54 on this serum. It’s GARBAGE! and I have tried many many many serums (you’re so much better off with any one of the other serums behind the bottle in my first picture). There is nothing good about triple peptide cactus serum, I don’t even like wearing it to bed, it’s gross. You’ve been warned. DON’T BELIEVE THE HYPE!!
