....Not In Practice The serum isn’t one of the strongest in the YTTP product family.  The pump on the product is faulty (I purchased in Jan ’22, so maybe it’s gotten better) - excess product shoots out. The product is hydrating but you can get that in a lot of serums. It says it plumps, I think that’s an overstatement. But the product does help provide moisture and bonus if you lock it in with a moisturizer after. It’s an okay product, maybe it does what it says on younger skin but I got to an empty on this and will not re-buy. A Product Good In Theory.....
