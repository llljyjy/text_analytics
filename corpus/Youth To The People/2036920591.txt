The key to keeping my oily skin happy is a good moisturizer (so that it doesn’t produce more oil) and a polypeptide moisturizer is one of my absolute favorites! The Derma E one is my go-to, but it’s definitely on the thicker, creamier side, so it can be a bit much for summer, and that’s why this one is so perfect! It’s so light, an almost whipped-gel sort of texture, but still manages to hydrate so deeply, keeping my skin way less oily than it used to be in the summer. I would definitely recommend it over the Drunk Elephant one, if you’re in the market for something that leaves your skin plump and happy! My mother has super dry skin and she loves it too, so YTTP really hit the nail on this one. Great for all skin types, especially oily!
