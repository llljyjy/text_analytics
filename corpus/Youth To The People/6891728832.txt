This has got to be one of the most beautiful, if not the most beautiful, formulations for a hydrating serum I’ve ever tried. It’s a lightweight gel that sits on the skin just long enough to provide a load of refreshing hydration but once it fully soaks into the skin, it leaves no stickiness or tackiness whatsoever. I can’t say I saw much of a plumping effect but the product did leave my skin feeling silky & comfortably hydrated afterwards (with that healthy, hydrated glow). Like many YTTP products, the biggest downside is its price. Regardless of how much I enjoyed this serum, I just can’t justify its price. I wish this product was more affordable!
