I love it! Definitely a mask I use in my skincare routine. I really do feel like it leaves my skin feeling fresh and ready for the week. It doesn’t leave my skin with a tight feeling. I normally use this on Sunday when I have my skincare Sunday. I feel like it’s helped control the oil and I love how it’s easy to apply! My skin really seems to react well with anything that has niacinamide. I have not broken out from using this product. I think it’s priced fairly well in comparison with all of the other YTTP products. Would definitely recommend! Staple product!
