Overhyped. Skin feels soft for a few hours after using but not long lasting. This product also causes me to breakout very bad every time I use it. The 4th ingredient is safflower seed oil. Bentonite clay mask gives me much better results and doesn’t cause breakouts. It’s also much cheaper. Overhyped
