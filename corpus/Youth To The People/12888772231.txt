I’ve been hunting for MONTHS to find a moisturizer that fit into my nighttime routine. I haven’t had a lot of luck with YTTP in the past but decided to give this a try. Lightweight texture - perfect for my oily friends. Smell is pleasant and not overbearing. I wish it was a little easier to spread but not a huge problem. It was perfect in the summer, now that it’s winter I have to layer sometimes but it never feels too heavy. Will definitely be repurchasing! I have rosacea and oily skin, its a must have! :)
