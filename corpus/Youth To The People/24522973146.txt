I love many of YTTP’s products ( the vitamin C serum, the cleansing balm, the air-whipped and adaptogen moisturizers are all solid products I use daily). So, I was excited to try their new Retinal. I like that it goes on easily and feels very hydrating (amazing for a retinoid). I’m now on nightly application and my skin hasn’t felt dry or sensitive once. However, unlike with other retinoids, this one has made me break out -- I have never had an issue with breakouts, not even during puberty. No biggie, though. I know it can happen with retinoids. What is a big deal is that this serum has stained my expensive pillowcases. I’m hoping it’ll come out in the wash. Stained my pillowcases.
