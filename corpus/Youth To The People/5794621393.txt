I gave this 3 stars because it isn’t a bad product but did not work for my skin type for whatever reason. After using it my skin felt very clean and nice, I enjoyed the smell but it made me break out. Not like an allergic reaction but in random pimples and I know sometimes your skin goes through a purge but I used the product for 2 weeks and my skin never cleared up. I have dry to normal skin and a product that works well for me is the cerave hydrating facial cleanser. I wanted to like this but it just didn’t work sadly. not for me but worth a try
