I have tried a few different retinoids over the years, and this is the only one that my skin doesn’t flake with. Since I’ve started using it, I’ve gotten so many compliments on my skin — the 5% Niacinamide helps my skin glow, and the mushroom complex is super calming, too. Can’t wait to use this one long term, but it’s already been super easy to incorporate into my routine. I really love adding YTTP’s Oasis Serum on top, then the Dream Mask before bed. nan
