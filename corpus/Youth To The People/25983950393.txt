I absolutely love this exfoliant. It has mandelic and salicylic acid and is perfect for my acne prone/slightly dry skin. It’s gentle yet effective and the nights I don’t use a retinoid I use a cotton pad to apply a think later to my face then add a moisturizer. A great product to have in your skincare routine. A must have!
