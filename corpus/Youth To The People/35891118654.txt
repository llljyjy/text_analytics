I’ve been a big retinol user for a long time but this is hands down my favorite product. Love that it leaves my skin feeling instantly smooth. After about a week it had lessened fine lines giving me a more youthful appearance without leaving me feeling dried out. You can also tell it’s an effective formula just by the yellow tint the product has--thats the retinal. Obsessed!
