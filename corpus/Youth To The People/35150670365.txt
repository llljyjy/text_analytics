I bought the mini size at checkout to try out and I loved it so much. I later returned to get the full size. It is the perfect pair with any night routine using high strength retinoids. During the winter I start my routine with a cleansing balm and skip gel cleanser and toner. I use the Missha time revolution essense, then wait 30 minutes to apply a mixture of Missha night repair probiotic ampoule, copper peptides, Benton snail bee and tretinoin. I follow that up with this sleeping mask and finish with marula oil from Trader Joe’s. My skin looks amazing in the morning and is blemish free. Some other sleeping masks I tried are too comedogenic and I did not have that problem with this mask.This is the only product I actually like that contains hyaluronic acid and I think that is because it’s one of the last steps and actually helps keep moisture in the skin instead of drawing it out from the skin.I also use it kinda like a primer in the morning, my morning routine is only essence and then I apply a thick amount of this, and I layer a mixture of an oil-based bronzer or highlighter and Supergoop ceramides and SPF oil on top. My skin is well hydrated throughout the day from that. I think this will help me avoid my typical summer skin dryness/distress too so I look forward to that. obsessed with this mask
