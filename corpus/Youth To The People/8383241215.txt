The best serum Iâ€™ve ever used!! I only see improvements in my skin!! My skin has definitely become brighter and my acne scars are getting better. I usually use this in the morning before makeup, I use it first on my skin, then moisturizer/eye cream, and sunscreen after, then i put on makeup. Never had a problem with the steps I use but make sure the serum is completely dry before moving on to your next step! I suck at sticking to a skin care routine but this gem has been the only consistency! (I have dry skin) Must Buy!
