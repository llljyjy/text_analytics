I wanted to love this....I was making the move to use more clean products and had been impressed with the sample box I purchased.  And I have extremely sensitive skin. However,  I started to experience excessive sweating from my face. I couldn’t figure it out at first. And found myself in several embarrassing situations where my face was excessively DRIPPING sweat. After some experiments of leaving out different parts of my routine, and/or only putting the product  on half of my face. I’ve discovered the moisturizer is the culprit. Within moments of putting it on, my face is sweating. And when I’m outside in the summer heat my face sweats way more than any other part of my body. (We’re talking the sweat is running down my face like I ran a marathon,  not walked from my car into a building.) nan
