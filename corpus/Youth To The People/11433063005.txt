I really enjoy the feel of this product. I’ve been using it for three months now, and I don’t really notice a huge different in my hyperpigmentation marks personally. I do enjoy using vitamin c along with sunscreen however, they’re a great team against environmental pollutants, and as I said the feel of this serum is A+ for me. I don’t think I’ll repurchase this because it is so extremely expensive, however. I don’t think it’s worth it, especially since it’s a derivative of vitamin C that doesn’t have a ton of research backing up it’s use. It does, however, keep magnificently and that’s what really drew me in. If you’re interested in getting a vitamin c that doesn’t expire as soon as you begin using it I would recommend it. Before buying this, try researching the various vitamin c derivatives and basic vitamin c and see which would suit you better personally. Good, But Not Great
