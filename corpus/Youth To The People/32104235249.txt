I love this serum. It’s a bit sticky so I recommend patting it in to your skin and letting it dry before moving on to the next steps of your routine. It’s helped me with this harsh winter so much and just hydrated and gets rid of all the dry patches on my face. I love using it at night and waking up to a nice refreshed face to work with. Definitely a great product to have if you live in a cold dry area. Winter Savior
