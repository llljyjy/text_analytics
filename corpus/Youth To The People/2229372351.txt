I’ve been using this for about three weeks now, every other day, half a pump, and layered with a hydrating serum. My dry-leaning skin has tolerated this product well. No irritation, but I have been using retinol for a while now so I can’t say if it’s this particular retinal that is helping with my skin. However, I did notice some lines around my eyes become less noticeable since I started applying this very carefully around my eye area. Again, no irritation and it seems to work so far so might be worth a try. nan
