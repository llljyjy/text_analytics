This Retinal-Niacinamide serum is wonderful. It is gentle and comfortable on the skin. It is easy to apply. Heads up it is yellow, but it doesnâ€™t stain the skin or anything. I am still working up to using it more frequently. I hope they make a duo pack with this and the Cactus Hyaluronic serum because they are made for each other! 10/10 would recommend. Love it so much!
