I haven’t been able to buy a full-sized container yet, but the 59 ML bottles hold me over for a solid month so I can pick up a small one once in a while. This cleanser is heavily concentrated, which is why it lasts so long for me. Just a dime size drop foams up enough to cover my whole face and using a face scrubby ensures product does it’s job. This cleanser does not leave my face feeling dry or tight, but not oily either (something some cleansers do) and sometimes I forget to add moisturizer after washing because it leaves my skin feeling THAT good. Non-Stripping, Non-Oily, & Concentrated.
