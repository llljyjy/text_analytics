In shock. I didnt expect this to work so good and fast. My skin cant tolerate retin a, my skin got so wrinkly and irritated from it that i steared away from retinoids completely! I have textured acne prone skin amd niacinamide always helps me with that so when I saw it had that plus retinal which is better i decided to take a leap of faith and buy it. Will continue to use it. Major downfall its too expensive! Awesome but pricey
