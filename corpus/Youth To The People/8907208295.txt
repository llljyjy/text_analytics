Fantastic new cream from YTTP! I’ve been using the air whip moisturizer for years and haven’t had a single complaint, and I’d say this new one has has the same lightness and deep moisturizing effect but takes it even a step further in the moisturizing side of things. It’s slightly thicker but doesn’t feel heavy at all, and doesn’t leave any oiliness on the face. My skin has definitely been looking and feeling more firm from using it, but it’s still comfortable enough for everyday use. Highly recommend this one over the air whip if you’re looking for more moisture and anti aging effects in an everyday moisturizer. Might be replacing my superfood air whip with this
