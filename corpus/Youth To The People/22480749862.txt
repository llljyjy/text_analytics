This product is ok. I’ve been using it for a month now and none of them are really wowing me. The enzyme mask is good and I would buy that one again on its own. The moisturizer is also solid. However, everything else is just not amazing or a must have. Perhaps they have a different impact in larger sizes than the set sizes. I have acne prone skin. I’m of Mediterranean background with olive skin and some slight aging. I’d recommend this for someone who isn’t acne prone but is looking for a consistent, solid routine and doesn’t have too many skin concerns. nan
