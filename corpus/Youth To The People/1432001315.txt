I love a good mechanical scrub.  My skin needs it.  Period.  Over the years I’ve found that most all scrubs are just too wimpy for me.  But this one is the exact opposite - it is gritty like sand.  I was fortunate that I didn’t wind up with microtears leading to red bumps, but I just wouldn’t chance it again in the future.  I like the idea of the diatomaceous Earth as the scrubber, but I think the formula would be better with either less of the scrubbers, or more of the base product so that the dermabrasion wasn’t so powerful.  Still, I’m not sure if that would even help.  You see, the particles are so fine that I feel like they just get at the surface of the skin instead of getting deeper down to clear out pores.  I apologize if I’m not explaining this right. Gritty like sand
