I really loved this product. First of all, it makes a good amount of foam which I like, plus leaves my face perfectly cleansed, without it feeling dry.Second, the smell is so-good! makes for a spa like experience. It is not too overpowering in my opinion, and it just makes me enjoy and crave the cleansing process. I will be purchasing again, and I recommend. Overall a great product
