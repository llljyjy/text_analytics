My favorite step of my skin care routine is cleansing, so I was really excited to try this. The complete top layer is so hard to scrape off, and when you apply it to the face, it almost requires force to spread. I use heavy duty eyeliner for my work shifts, and this doesn’t take it off completely. I’m left with eyelash glue and partial eyeliner removed. You do get a decent amount in this balm, buts it’s not worth the price or the hassle. I’ve tried cheaper ones that perform so much better than this. I paid this with my own money but will not be repurchasing this. least favorite balm
