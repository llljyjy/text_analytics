Any retinal product is just great, but this specific YTTP release has replaced some of my fancier retinal products and works just the same, if not better. Start out using it 1-2 times a week so you donâ€™t dry out your skin, but over time your skin will build up the tolerance. This has rid my face of a lot of my hormonal acne and tightens my skin, enhancing my glow when I pair it with the YTTP hydrating dream serum. Would highly recommend this product! nan
