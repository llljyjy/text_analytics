I have dry, sensitive skin, and my skin just loves this moisturizer. I’ve repurchased several times.  I’ve tried the biossance and skin barrier moisturizer’s from Sephora and I still prefer this one. This one doesn’t leave any greasy residue but still provides the hydration I need. Sometimes in the winter I’ll switch to YTTP mushroom moisturizer for a little more oomph, but for most of the year this is perfect. Favorite
