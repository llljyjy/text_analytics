Wow - this launched at the right time. The superfood air whip moisturizer wasn’t quite cutting it for my dry summer skin (it’s been my winter fave), and this is so rich but surprisingly leaves your skin supple and light - not at all greasy. I love the firmness around my cheekbones and eyes, and it’s not at all irritating, which is another reason I use almost exclusively YTTP. Quickly absorbs and keeps me hydrated even with light makeup over it. A spritz of adaptogen spray midday helps keep it locked in. My new go to for drier months!
