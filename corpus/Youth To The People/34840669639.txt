I live laugh love for this specific cleanser. I’ve been using this cleanser before it “got recognition” and it deserves every ounce of recognition. It always brightens my skin whenever I use it, I love the way it glides on my skin and does not irritate it either (my skin is very sensitive) Beautiful 5 stars KEEP IN MIND THOUGH:one of my biggest mistakes in the skin community is believing everyone has the same skin, please see if you have oily, combo, dry, normal and etc skin!! Know your skin to treat your skin properly :) I love this cleanser
