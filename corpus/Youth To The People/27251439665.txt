I have normal to dry skin and recently after using this product, it leaves my skin feeling a little dry and tight. I just use lotion after, then my skin feels fine. I have it 4 stars because it dries my skin out a little. It has a clean smell, not too strong. You don’t need to use a lot because it foams up some. I think overall it’s a great product.
