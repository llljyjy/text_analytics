Absolutely love this product. It leaves my skin feeling so clean but also not too dry. The ingredients are simple and make me feel good about what is going on my skin. I previously used very expensive cleansers because I I thought they would work better, but this affordable product has changed my view. Love the entire brand. Best Cleanser
