I got a small sample bottle of this product. First impressions, it was very sticky and had a bad smell to it. I do think it made my skin look brighter, but as I only had a small bottle I canâ€™t speak of any longer use benefits/results. I think there are better vitamin C serums on the market before trying this one. meh
