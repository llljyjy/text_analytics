I got this as a free sample from YTTP. I tried it out for a week of consistent use in my morning and evening routine to provide an initial review as I don’t think you can truly see benefits in this short of a time frame. It’s a nice moisturizer with a silky texture and rubs in pretty easily. I did find it sensitive around my under eye area, which is where you would want a cream that is supposed to help with reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. I also did not find it to be a very thick moisturizer; the first night I used it, I replaced the YTTP Adaptogen Deep moisturizer I usually use in my routine and found my skin to be pretty dry in the morning. I then layered it under my usual morning and evening moisturizers for the rest of the week. I will say I noticed a slight reduction in the appearance of baby lines that are forming on my forehead, but I think it’s just an immediate plumping effect as they are back to normal at night when I wash everything off. Overall, I personally won’t be buying this product and adding it to my routine as I think it would be a waste. To be clear, I’m a big fan of YTTP and use their cleanser, superfood air whip moisturizer, adaptogen deep moisturizer, vitamin c serum, and the dream sleep mask. I just don’t think at this price point that the moisturizer is worth it. You’re better off spending money on a retinol and using their thick adaptogen deep moisturizer. Immediate effects but overall not worth the cash
