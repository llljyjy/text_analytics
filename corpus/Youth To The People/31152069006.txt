Day 3 of Usage:Product has a mild spinach & kale scent (which are listed ingredients). The scent can be unpleasant but it’s very mild so it doesn’t bother me and feels fresh. Foams nicely once lathered. Effective with cleansing the skin and does help remove excess makeup. Skin doesn’t feel oily, dry or like there’s a residue after using. I have positive feedback and do recommend the product but nothing truly stands out about this product for me YET. It’s just another cleanser. I do prefer my Philosophy facial cleanser which is also cheaper. I will continue giving this a try though. nan
