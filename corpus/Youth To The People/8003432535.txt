I bought this probably a year ago - used it, liked it, and totally forgot about it! I have pretty dry skin, especially while the seasons start to change! I ran out of eye cream and was on the hunt for something and then I remember someone writing a review about how this is super similar to their eye cream (ingredients are similar)! So I started using this as an eye cream and it was amazing. I have now began using this as the final step in my skin care (on top of my moisturizer) - and let me tell you, this stuff has transformed my skin. It’s consistently plump, the texture is the best it’s ever been, and I have been getting compliments on how glowing my skin is!!!! I have been using this consistently night and day for about 3 weeks (not a ton of it, just as a thin final layer), and I cannot recommend this enough! You need this. Right now! You! Need! This!
