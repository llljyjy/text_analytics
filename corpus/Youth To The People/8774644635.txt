I wanted to become a four-step skin care gal, and here I am! I was looking for something to help with pesky stress breakouts, and this bad boy does the trick. I am admittedly a YTTP avid user, so my routine includes washing with Superfood moisturizer, then exfoliating with the Superfood Mandelic acid unity exfoliant, and adding the retinal, with the Superfood air-whip moisturizer to finish out. After several weeks of use, I have seen reduction in redness, visible smoothness to my skin (even with large pores and acne scars), and soothing of my acne breakout areas. This definitely belongs in my skincare routine! Essential new addition to my skincare routine
