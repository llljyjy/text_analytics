While this is an ok cleaning balm, it’s not worth the pain. I hate how hard it is to massage into the skin. It takes off some of my waterproof mascara the first time. If I would like it all to be removed I have to go in a 2nd time. It isn’t for sensitive eyes as this product goes in and burns ur eye even after using a cleanser. The only good thing is that it takes off face makeup well and emulsifies nicely. Overall not my favorite, you could find better for cheaper. pass for the love of your eyes
