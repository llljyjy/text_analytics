I love this exfoliant! I didn’t realize how much it was helping until I stopped using it for about a week and my skin was so visibly dull. I use it in the AM after cleansing and follow with a Glossier serum & moisturizer. I haven’t had any issues with the floating particles in the bottle that some others have noted but I do find myself going through the bottle quickly. I wish it was a bit bigger for this price point but it’s so effective that I never mind repurchasing! nan
