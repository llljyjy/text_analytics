Would give this cleansing balm 0 stars if possible. Which is sad because I love every other product from this brand. It didn’t break down well, stung my eyes, and left a film on my face making it very hard to take off. Will never buy again. If you like a balm texture I highly recommend green clean worst cleansing balm I’ve ever used
