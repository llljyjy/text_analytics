I purchased this cream because I’ve had great luck with this brand and was looking for skincare that will make an impact while I’m breastfeeding and avoiding retinol.  It has only been four days and I can already see a major improvement in my skin barrier!  It feels so soothing and has the maximum amount of moisture that I want on my combination skin with rosacea.  For reference, the superfood moisturizer is great for me year round, but the adaptogen one is a bit too heavy even in winter. I can already tell this will be a daily staple, maybe even totally replacing my love of the superfood moisturizer! I’m very impressed!
