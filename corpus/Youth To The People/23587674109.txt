Not a bad product but I prefer their other toner over this one. The benefit of this one over the other is it doesn’t leave a sticky film on your face. I also prefer the smell of the other one. This one has a very witch hazel/medicinal smell. I find my skin looks better the morning after the other toner. I don’t regret trying it but next time I’ll do the other one. nan
