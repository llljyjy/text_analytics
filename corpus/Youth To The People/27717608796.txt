I love this product. I will admit I love most of YTTP products I have tried and may be a little biased from that stance. I have very normal skin unless I mess up and abuse products making it have dry patches or sensitive short term and even then, this product going on so gently and like a dream not irritating me at all.  But this product is beautiful and soft and feels luxurious (to me). It drys down quickly and doesn’t leave my skin tacky for very long. My skin has never been so plump and hydrated after using for about a month, the closest I have ever come to glass like skin. I have certainly noticed a difference and I am super excited for this to be a staple in my minimalist regimen! I don’t usually rate things 5 stars to keep the review creditable (I personally don’t always believe 1 or 5 star reviews) but I believe this serum truely deserves it! I hope you choose to try it out! absolutely delightful
