This product just feels meh, I really want to like it but it just seems like it’s not doing anything... it’s so thin and runny that it just feels like putting water on your skin & I don’t notice any plumping or any type of effect like that. I think I just prefer thicker HA serums that feel like they’re filling/plumping more! I appreciate the ingredients but the texture just makes it feel like it’s doing nothing Feels like water, meh
