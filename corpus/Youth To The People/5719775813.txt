The feeling this gives my skin after each use - is amazing! One of the only cleansers that doesn’t leave my face feeling stripped of all oils while still noticeably clean and refreshed. I use the small, travel size and it lasts me forever! Due to the nature of the product, you only need a tiiiiny bit of the cleanser before introducing water and it becoming a workable lather. I know it’s easy to skip the directions, but it’s totally worth it to massage the product into your skin for the suggested time. Doesn’t break me out, doesn’t smell bad, and I LOVE YTTP for using glass! Clean, refreshing, and efficient!
