My skin is drier than the Sahara. I NEED more moisture in my skin. I have been using this since May or June- it’s now toward the end of July and I’m still not impressed. I use this along with a moisturizer AND an oil TWICE a day every single day and I still end up with dry patches throughout the day. I have changed moisturizers and changed oils while using this product and it’s still not worth it. I hate that I spent $54 on this. So not worth it!
