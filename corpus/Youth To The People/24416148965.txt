Personally I don’t really understand the hype. Definitely not worth the money. It lathers on like any cleanser should and there’s not much to see. It is a wash off so obviously it’s nothing special but for the price I expected at least a little sense of cleanness but I felt nothing. I would stick to something more affordable. After three weeks of using it I switched to using it as hand soap. It’s ok. not worth the price
