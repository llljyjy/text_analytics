Great chemical facial, I use it 1-2x weekly in my nighttime routine. I make sure on the nights I use it that I incorporate a moisturizing sheet mask into the routine -just to keep my sensitive and naturally dryer skin plump & happy for the morning time :) itâ€™s a great product, the Sephora employee suggested setting it for only 7-8 min (which I agree with, I accidentally had it on for 10 min and noticed a red halo around my face for an hour or two!). 4 stars just bc I thinks small wood or bamboo spatula would be great rather than using fingers! nan
