I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review and used this product 3 full weeks. This serum was the perfect amount of hydrating and a little went a long way. It also paired well with my current routine and did not feel heavy. I did feel a slight difference in the firming of my skin but feel it required more time for a more noticeable difference. Overall I was pleased with this product and would buy again. nan
