I received this travel size product for the cost of shipping in exchange for my review. I’ve been using this new power exfoliant during my nighttime skincare routine and loving the lightweight texture, it’s not sticky and my skin feels smooth and fresh! I noticed my complexion looked brighter too. I’m hoping to see my skin tone even out with continued use. I’m planning on using 1-2 times a week. I’m really liking the upgraded formula. No Tackiness!
