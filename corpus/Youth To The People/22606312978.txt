I used a travel size/sample of this YTP cleanser. Overall it is a nice product and a little goes a long way. I was nervous that as a gel it wouldn’t work well on dry skin.  It didn’t dry out my skin or make it feel stripped. I wasn’t sure about the scent at first (as someone else mentioned it does smell like a green tomato plant) but I ended up enjoying the smell. But I won’t purchase a full size. I just feel like there are other cleansers that just as good or better and more affordable. Decent cleanser
