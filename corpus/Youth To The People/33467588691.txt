I have purchased many Youth to the People products more than once. I tried, but I do not believe that if you have acneic skin, this will help. Get a facial instead as this is very course, can spread acneic bacteria around and through your skin, and isn’t for acne. Also, texture like this can damage your skin barrier. I didn’t see any improvements to my ingrown hairs on my face, discoloration or texture. I tried two bottles and nothing. nan
