Ah, I bought this because the sephora employee mentioned it was a cult fav & very popular. They mentioned that they personally use it & love it. & I have to say, I’ve had this for over a year now. I can’t use it every day because it really strips my skin & leaves it dry. I don’t find the smell to over powering though not an every day cleanser & disappointed as the price & reviews would of lead me to believe it would of been a better product. Better luck with the next cleanser. nan
