Smells like running through a field of fresh spring foliage under a bright, blue sky. A little goes a long way and it froths up nicely, but it’s a little on the thin side. I don’t wear much, if any, makeup on the regular so this does fine cleansing, but wouldn’t use it for makeup removal or any heavy lifting. Great as a daily morning cleanser. Fresh and clean!
