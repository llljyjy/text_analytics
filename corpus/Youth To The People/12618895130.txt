I use this every night and it helps me feel so so clean after a long day. The smell is nice, kinda earthy but not overwhelming. Doesn’t dry out my skin which is a MUST when it comes to cleansers as my skin is Sahara desert dry I kid you not. It can feel a bit stripping if you use it more than once a day so be careful. If you travel a lot I recommend the small ones to take with you. Fun tidbit also: I live in a place so cold your eyelashes freeze, and I forgot a bottle of this in my car for a few hours, so it obviously froze. Good news is the bottle didn’t break and it melted back to normal! Good to feel clean
