LOVE their other cleanser so I wanted to try this one too but it’s not for me. It “melted” fine but it left my skin feeling like an oil slick and I had to double cleanse with the normal one just to get it off. It says just keep rubbing with water and it should turn into a milk but this never happened. Just oil. I’m convinced it made me breakout as well Nope
