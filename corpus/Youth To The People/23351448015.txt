I got this product upon returning from a trip, where the only skincare item I had was my YTTP face wash. So my face was feeling a bit dry and worn out. After a few uses, I’m liking this new Future Cream a lot! It is heavier than the Air Whip moisturizer, but sometimes that’s exactly what my skin needs. I’m seeing more radiance and plumpness all around. Thanks for another great product! Another winner from YTTP
