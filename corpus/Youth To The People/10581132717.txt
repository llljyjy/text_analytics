I accidentally ordered this product when I was trying to buy something else by the same brand but i decided to keep it anyway, and let me tell you this stuff is phenomenal!! Any cleanser I’ve used is a little harsh on the eyes but this particular one is so gentle, smells amazing and gets ALL your makeup off - even the stubborn eyeliner and mascara. It doesn’t dry out my skin or cause any breakouts. I’ve only been using this stuff for about a week now (day and night) but my skin looks and feels AMAZING. I’m so happy I accidentally purchased this. You need maybe half a pump for your whole face and it’ll do wonders. Big bottle with a ton a product that will last you a very long time. I’m pleasantly surprised with this cleanser, it’ll be my new go to! I use about 2-3 other YTTP products and they always leave me very impressed. W.O.W.
