As I’ve approached my 30s, I’ve begun to change up my skincare to focus more on hydration and nourishing and protecting my skin barrier (as a way to target my skin’s overall health). I was so happy to see YTTP is producing a moisturizer I could test and compare to my current favorites (Dr. Jart+ and Skinfix). The very first pro I noticed about this cream is fragrance—as in the lack of fragrance. Sensitive skin folks around the world: rejoice! My skin has become more sensitive over the years and a lot irritates it, so fragrance free products are my go-to these days. Second thing I noticed was how thick yet light this cream felt. I don’t know how they accomplished this, but it feels so good on your skin! If I had to say a con it would be that I’ve noticed my skin can become a bit oily when I use this with just my toner. But it isn’t anything crazy, more like a dewy look, which doesn’t bother me too much. I do have oily skin so this might just be an issue for people with oily skin. What I’ve noticed helps reduce my skin becoming too dewy is using my YTTP vitamin C serum underneath this. Overall, I do like how this makes my skin feel and look, and I can’t wait to get my hands on the full size product! I’m impressed!
