I first tried this product out in their mini version test kit, used it for a month and fell in love!! My skin is very sensitive but this cleanser did not irritate it at all, it is so gentle and smells very fresh. I feel like it actually cleans my face which is an obvious perk!! I purchased the big size and will definitely be a loyal customer! SO GOOD!
