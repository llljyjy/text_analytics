I absolutely love this. It does everything it promises while being incredibly gentle and refreshing. I saw overall improvement of texture, redness, pores and bumps almost immediately. The best part is that the sebaceous filaments on my nose have never been this small before! I would assume it would be great for bacne as well. I canâ€™t say if it has reduced hyperpigmentation for me (itâ€™s been 3 weeks, apply 2-3x week) but literally everything else has improved so I anticipate it tackling the pigment soon. Overall, very happy and will happily pay the high price point again ðŸ‘€ Fantastic & worth it!
