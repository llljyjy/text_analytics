I tried this a few years ago and guess I’d just forgotten how incredible it was. Then I got another sample and kept thinking about how soft and hydrated my skin felt all day. So I went on and purchased the large size, thinking if it didn’t work for me in the long run I could gift it to my mom. Well, mom’s not touching this jar because I’m OBSESSED. My skin stays hydrated and supple all day long after applying this at night before bed. In the mornings my makeup applies so much better because there are no dry patches so liquid foundations & cream blushes just glide over my face. And I’m 47 years old where lines and creasing is a big concern! This is now a permanent part of my nighttime regimen. My only suggestion would be a small scoop or spatula to dip the product out with since the jar is tall and I hate sticking my fingers in there for sanitary reasons. Obviously I wash my hand’s beforehand but a little attached spatula (like on Tatcha products) would be incredible. I Totally Get the Hype!
