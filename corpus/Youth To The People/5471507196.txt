smells really good, this mini jar has lasted me a good amount of time but i feel like i have to apply lot to get an actual effect and feel hydrated so more is more with this product.  i use it on nights where i have worn a lot of makeup and feel like my skin needs the help and it always makes me feel like it never happened the next day. love this!
