Finally YTTP has released Retinal! This is my holy grail! Gentle, effective, worth the money and see results! At first the staining scared me but then when it went away I was like PHEW! Its been about 2 weeks since using it and I can’t get enough. No burning when close to eyes or sensitive areas, doesn’t dry out the skin. I pair it with the new oasis serum and then my adaptogen deep cream for night time and baby! My skin feels right tight and ready to roll! Just remember to wear your spf after using this as I forgot and it wasn’t the best idea! Thank you YTTP for gifting me this amazing product and letting me review it! magic in a bottle
