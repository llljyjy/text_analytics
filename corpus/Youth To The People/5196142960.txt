NO. This could only work (maybe?) for those with extremely dry skin not at all concerned with breakouts. I am on the opposite end of that spectrum with oily/combo skin and monthly breakouts. One of the “hydrating“ ingredients in this, squalane, tends to be problematic for me as it leaves a heavy film, similar to waxy glycerin. This is also evident in the JVN haircare line where is left a film on my scalp I had to scrape off. I am left with acne, no glow, and a waxy film that I have to exfoliate off with other products. Save your money. Would NOT recommend
