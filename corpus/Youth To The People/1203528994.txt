I really loved trying this product and felt that it could replace a couple of steps in my winter skin routine and make it more efficient! It made my skin feel plump and hydrated without feeling like I was applying a thick moisturizer. I tried layering after vitamin c serum, alone and underneath makeup with SPF and it never interacted weirdly with any other products. Great HA serum
