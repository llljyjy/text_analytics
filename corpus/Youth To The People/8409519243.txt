I should have known that this was not appropriate for normal/dry skin types. I’m usually skeptical of any product that claims to be “for all skin types“ since the requirements of someone with oily skin versus dry skin vary dramatically. Nevertheless, I picked this up after trying it out for a few days when I received a deluxe sample. Fast forward to a week of use- and I found myself waking up with my skin hurting and feeling so tight because the moisture in this is just not sufficient for someone with dry skin (for context, I used this with the farmacy HA plumping serum and a paula’s choice oil on top).If you have oily skin I think this would be a good choice because it is pretty mattifying and dries quickly, but it is truly not made for people who have normal/dry skin. I wish they’d be more specific in their description and not market this to people with dry skin. Not for dry skin!
