Okay, so both of the other YTTP face creams do not work for my dry skin, but this stuff right here, THIS STUFF RIGHT HERE! **Chef’s kiss** Finally YTTP gets it for the dry and sensitive skin types. It’s definitely a heavier creamy feel, but it soaks into the skin, and does not leave me greasy. I use it only at night and top it off with the Superberry Dream Mask. My only complaint is that it’s very expensive; I wish it were more affordable. Dry Skins Rejoice!
