I love the feeling of moisture it gives my face immediately as it comes in contact with my skin. It is definitely moisturizing and also offers a plumpness, as it advertises.  I’ve noticed my face has started to look more tight as I’ve been using this product. I typically use the basic Hyaluronic Acid from The Inky List, and this is step up, for sure. Price point a little high for my needs for something like this. But I will continue to use and see if I receive any other added benefits. So far enjoying it! Offers immediate moisture
