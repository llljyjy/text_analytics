Absolutely a great facial oil. It leaves my skin very hydrated, plump, and dewy. I apply it both at night and in the AM - I have dry skin so it absorbs easily into my skin after applying over my moisturizer. I also think it has helped a little with some redness I have, which I didnâ€™t expect.Highly recommend - versatile, delivers, would get a fifth star if it had vitamin C active ingredient in it. Leaves you dewy
