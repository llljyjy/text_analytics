So why I loved it… this mask gives you the most moisture. Your skin will feel so smooth and plump and firm. It truly gave me glass skin! So why do I hate it… 1 ingredient ISOPROPYL MYRISTATE. It has a grade 5 comedogenic rating (which means it is very likely to clog pores) and that it did. I couldn’t understand why I kept getting breakouts with new pimples forming everyday. Until I watched a video by Dr V on yt and she broke down the ingredients and it all made sense. 2 days after I stopped using it I finally woke up with no new pimples. If they take it out it will be the most awesome product ever. I’d buy it again in a heartbeat. Maybe if you don’t have acne prone skin it might work for you. It truly is super moisturizing First I loved it. Now I absolutely hate it
