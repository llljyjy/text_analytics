Meh.. I will finish it but overall, I was not happy with this product. I have dry skin and it did not moisturize it at all. My skin still feels very dry when I use this - there was absolutely no softness or relief I have felt like I have with other moisturizers. I would skip this. Did not work for my dry skin
