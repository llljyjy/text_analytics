I wish I would have read some of the reviews closer before buying. I was so upset with how my skin looked after use. It dried me out, and I am SUPER oily. It made my hyperpigmentation and acne look so much more pronounced and emphasized my texture. I’m glad this works for so many others, but this is a skip for me. There’s products that work much better for less! Made texture and acne look worse
