I chose this as a sample with an order I recently purchased and the amount given is good enough to see if you like it or not. Now, I don’t know about it’s claims to “remove makeup or prevent pore buildup”, this review is solely based on it being a regular cleanser. Based on that alone, I love everything about this cleanser except the the price which is unnecessarily high. It really does smell like green veggies and that scent doesn’t linger after rinsing. Although it’s a gel cleanser, it also reminds me of a cream cleanser in the way that it doesn’t heavily foam. It does become white and slightly foamy when lathered. I had it around my eye area but never felt any burning. It cleans really well without drying out the skin which has been refreshing for me since right before using this I was sampling the AC Collection foam cleanser by CosRx which often left me feeling on the dry side. I’ve been using this every AM/PM for almost a week now and I would honestly buy it if the price wasn’t so high. Hence, the reason why I takeaway a star. Steep Price for a Cleanser
