This is a holy grail on my skincare list. Some people dislike the fragrance but for my combo-sensitive skin it doesn’t trigger any irritation/redness/breakouts. It is thick but it’s not greasy. Yes use it at night!! It leaves my skin feeling soft, brighter, plumped. It’s pricey but to me it’s sooo worth it. This deserved a review! Try it out
