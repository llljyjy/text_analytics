I recieved this product to review from youth to the people and really liked the texture of this serum. I haven’t noticed a ton of change in my skin yet, but that is because it is a retinal that takes a little while to see a change. So far, I really like this serum, my only concern is the yellow color stays on your face and has the possiblility of staining, but I haven’t stained anything yet. nan
