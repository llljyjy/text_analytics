Honestly I recommend this, i take care of my skin.. i tried a lot of products, this is the best that i have ever tried that has retinol and its not harsh on my skin.The best peeling i get is when i use retinol products but usually i suffer while peeling.This product does the job and refreshes your look with almost zero side effectI literally wiped off an acne mark with in 3 uses. Always be carful though, dont get close to your eyesAnd is moisturizer is a must.U will see results in few uses Amazing product
