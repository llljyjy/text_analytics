You NEED this staple item in your skin care routine, I have never loved a product more then this one. The smell is heavenly, and not only has this product brightened my skin, texture has improved and hyperpigmentation reduced immensely! The price is steep, but completely worth it, havenâ€™t found another vitamin c that has replicated this one. Two pumps is more than enough to cover my whole face and neck, fair sized bottle for the product inside! Love at first sight
