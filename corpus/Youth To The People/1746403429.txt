I always end up repurchasing this. I get bored of it because of how long I’ve used it and buy new face wash brands but always end up coming back. It is gentle on the skin, even for my super sensitive skin. I don’t get red from this or break out. It cleans the popes and removes makeup but leaves the skin feeling soft and fresh. An amazing product you won’t need another face wash. My Holy Grail Wash
