Not the worst cleanser, I appreciate the glass packaging and makes it easy to refill/ reuse. I have already dry skin, and after using this with an oil cleansing balm, my skin is extremely dry after washing my face. For the cost of how expensive it is, I would say dry/ combo skin beware. not the best for dry skin
