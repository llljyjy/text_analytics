Absolutely love the cleanser itself however the pump is abysmal. It causes so much product to leak out. I’ve bought three of the regular size (237mL) cleansers and each time the pump is faulty. I only buy the refillable as its better for the environment. Customer service is no help as as soon as your 90 days are up they won’t do anything about faulty products. I don’t need a new cleanser it would just be nice to get replacement pumps especially when the cleanser is not cheap. Won’t be repurchasing sadly as it’s too expensive to have this much product going to waste. You can see in the picture i had to put paper towel under the cleanser as that much product is leaking and going to WASTE. Not only is it annoying but also an eyesore to look at and it is wasting paper towel. Good product, bad pump
