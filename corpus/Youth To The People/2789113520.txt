This snuck up on me. Transparently I didn’t find massive differences in my skin from using, just that it didn’t break me out. It’s pretty good at removing makeup, has a very nice smell and isn’t drying. The lather is lovely and the packaging is fairly sturdy (the lettering can come off over time which is a peeve of mine.) I originally bought the travel size and used it while going abroad. I was delightfully surprised at how much I enjoyed using it and how much my skin liked it. I’m a bit of a skincare junkie so once my trial size was finished up, I moved on to another brand. But then months later found myself missing this so I ordered the full size! Just finished the full size and will be restocking. infiltrated its way into my routine
