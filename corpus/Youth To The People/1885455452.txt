I like the formula, it does work better than other comparably priced peptide, firming serums. I’m 41 and I have combo skin in the warmer months but dry skin in the winter this is helping restore the glow. I took one star off bc I absolutely detest the pump, it is sticky so you can’t control how much comes out at all. They should have spent a few more cents to get a better pump. nan
