I’ve been using for about 3 months now, and I’m in love. It’s light and hydrating, also helps to give a more even and balanced skin tone. It has a fine mist, which is a plus. The only downside is the price, but overall it’s worth it. I started with the kit that contained a travel sized bottle and have been hooked since. So worth it!
