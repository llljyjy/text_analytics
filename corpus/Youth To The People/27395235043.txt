So far so good!!! I’ve been using this every other night and have not experienced any irritation. I’ve tried tretinoin and retinol, but this is my first retinal. The formula is nice, absorbs well and is not tacky feeling. The yellow color does take a little bit to go away. Love that it’s fragrance free and includes skin soothing ingredients too! nan
