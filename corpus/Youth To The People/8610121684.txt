While it does remove makeup and is quite moisturizing,  I find that this product is not a “flash-melting formula” as it states. Hard chunks don’t quite melt down on the skin and it feels like you’re losing product when those bits go flying into the sink (This stuff ain’t cheap!). Even rubbing the balm at the back of my hand first to melt down the chunks doesn’t really work - it takes way to long to melt down. It’s moisturizing but I don’t think I’ll be purchasing this product again. Chunky and doesn’t melt all the way down
