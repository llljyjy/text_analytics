Love YTTP, love the vegan formulas that perform as good (or better) than expensive department store brands or esthetician products. All the products are great, but not always for me. The adaptogen  cream is my go-to, luxurious and hydrating. It glides on silky and I feel it drenches my skin without being sticky. I was excited to try this one, thinking it would be good as a night cream over the retinal niacinamide serum, but I didn’t love it. This cream is thicker and denser and doesn’t smooth into the skin. It felt like it sat more on the surface versus the deep hydrating I was hoping for. I also tried it during the day but felt my foundation didn’t blend as nicely. I think this cream might be better for someone in their 30’s looking to build a good regimen for the future, maybe paired with the vitamin c+caffeine serum. I’ll stick with my routine of superfood cleanser + Mandelic acid toner + retinal niacinamide serum + super berry dream oil + adaptogen cream. I love that YTTP keeps innovating, and this is a solid product, just not for me. Good product, but not for me
