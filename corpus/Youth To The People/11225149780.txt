I have loved every single Youth to the People product I’ve tried and this is no exception! It’s my absolute favourite exfoliant and toner. I love 2-in-1 products because it saves me time in my skincare routine and this exfoliates and tones beautifully. My skin looks brighter, clearer, and more even after just a few days of use and feels so nice and refreshing on the skin when applied, too. Does not irritate or dry out my skin at all, either. I’ve never found an exfoliant or toner that’s as gentle and effective as this. It’s a must have. My favourite exfoliant/toner duo ever!
