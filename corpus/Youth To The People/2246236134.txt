I read multiple reviews before purchasing. I knew some sensitive skin people either love it or really hate this product, so tried it and hoped that it would work for my skin. I always double cleanse, so I used this product as removing makeup which did an ok job, then used my everyday cleanser. My face felt very dry even after 5 steps of moisturizing. I got a zit and redness the next morning (see the photo) and my zit was even bigger after 2 days. Unfortunately, it didnâ€™t work for me. I returned after one-time use. Not recommended for sensitive skin
