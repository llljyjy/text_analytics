This is heavenly and so worth the price tag. Itâ€™s slightly whipped and smells divine. I grabbed the small tester size and knew right away I needed the full size. I use it almost every night and it helps lock in moisture and leaves my skin silky smooth and plump. I love the feel and the smell! Perfect Nighttime Hydration
