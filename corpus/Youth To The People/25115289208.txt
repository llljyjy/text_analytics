I love YTTP and this product is no exception. The color is a little odd, but it fades out very fast. While this is a strong product I was using adapalene daily so switching over didn’t affect me or my skin too much. You can tell the ceramides are super hydrating as rather than drying my skin out it felt very nourished. Overall really liking the results after 3 days and I think I’m the long run this will stay in rotation. A Great Product - and great formulation!
