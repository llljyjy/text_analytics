very hydrating, didnâ€™t cause any breakouts with my combo skin, and it just feels so good when I apply it at night. I use this daily and my skin feels really healthy and hydrated. I initially tried the mini size first and after seeing how good it made my skin feel, bought the 59mL after it got restocked! just get it
