I’ve been trying various brand of vitamin C serum and this product works really well for me. I’m a long distance runner and I do a lot of outdoor activities, so this serum is my go-to product to fix the tan on my face very quickly. This is my 2nd bottle of the product because I like it so much, the product doesn’t smell, not sticky and absorbed quickly so I can apply my moisturizer in seconds. Another thing that I like about this product is that this is so much cheaper than my #1 vit c Serum by SkinCeut**** Works well and not expensive
