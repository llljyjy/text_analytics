Honestly I’d give it a 4.5 if I could, it’s such a nice gentle cleansing product that has helped clear up some of my forehead acne. However the acne on the more oily points of my face tend to stay put for a longer period but mostly due to mask-wearing. Price is a little exorbitant but my skin has been feeling so fresh and glowy! Not to mention it smells so clean and good Acne-prone skin!
