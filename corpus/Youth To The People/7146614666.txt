I really like the product itself. Purchased the mini/ travel size twice then on the third purchase it came almost empty. Thankfully customer service was great and refunded me my money. I would suggest purchasing in store so you can make sure it was full. I had seen other pictures and reviews saying it was half empty and then it happened to me. Love product but beware with online purchase
