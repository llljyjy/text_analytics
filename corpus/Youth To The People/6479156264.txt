Received this moisturizer as a sample with my last Sephora order.  This moisturizer has a fragrance, for me, it is kind of a light ’green’ scent, but at least it dissipates quickly.  This is a light moisturizer that absorbs quickly, it is nice, but for me, I would like something a little more heavy duty.  This is nice moisturizer, personally I like the YTP mushroom moisturizer better. Light, quickly absorbing moisturizer.
