I’ve been using this retinal about twice a week for 2-3 weeks and have noticed lightening of my dark spots. Previously I used a different retinol and was amazed at the results but it was too drying on my skin. I haven’t had any drying with the YTTP retinal product and my dark marks have gone away faster! My night routine is using the super berry cleansing balm and superfood cleanser, followed by the retinal (every other night or 2x/wk) and the hydrate and glow mask. In the mornings, I use the superfood cleanser, the unity exfoliant every other morning and the air whip moisturizer. I definitely recommend this product as well as other products with YTTP! My sensitive skin never has a bad reaction when using these products and they’re vegan !! When you put on the retinal, it does appear yellow on face/fingers but it goes away buy now!
