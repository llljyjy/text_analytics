I don’t fully understand what this product is hahaha but I’m always looking for ways to up my skin care game and was stoked to get a sample to try out. This stuff is the real deal though. I can tell that after using it for about 2 months my skin has significantly improved. It looks more hydrated and has that glow which I started seeing after like 3 weeks of using. definitely feels like my skin looks healthier and firmer! I’m in my mid 30s and have just started seeing some changes due to aging and this really made my skin feel and look better. Great part of my night routine!
