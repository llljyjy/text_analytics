I tried a sample of this retinal serum and was pleasantly surprised. It was super lightweight and gentle, yet very effective. I felt my skin was more plump and even after just the first use. I used the superberry dream mask over it at night and felt that was sufficient at hydrating my dry/combination skin. Love the lightweight feel of it
