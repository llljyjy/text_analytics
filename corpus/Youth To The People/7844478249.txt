I attempted to use this a multiple of times, and it made my skin feel SO sensitive. And my skin can handle exfoliators, it’s take the ordinary’s AHA/BHA mask just fine. I just love YTP, so I didn’t even bother looking at the ingredients list until my face started to feel bothersome after using. It’s really unfortunate to see brands continue to ignore their more sensitive skinned demographic with something as simple as not adding fragrance. What’s the point of adding fragrance and skin sensitizers to an already exfoliating product? Why add fragrance to an exfoliating product???
