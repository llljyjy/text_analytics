Okkkkayyy this actually really worked. I bought the cleanser and vitamin c duo from this brand 10 days ago and have noticed a huge difference in my PIH/PIE. I have type 2 Fitzpatrick skin type and my acne marks are quite red. After using this for 10 days every morning I have noticed a huge difference and you can barely see my pigmentation under a tinted sunscreen. Slays. I did purge but my acne scars are so much lighter!
