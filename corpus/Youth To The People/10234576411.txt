I really enjoyed using this retinal product. I found that my skin could easily tolerate using it 4 days in a row without irritation, but that may be because I have already been using retinals in my skin care routine. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that the niacinamide did not irritate my skin I have had issues with other niacinamide products. nan
