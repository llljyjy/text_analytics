I am obsessed with this face wash! My face has never felt so clean before, I’ve noticed I haven’t been as oily as I typically am and my face has a nice glow to it. I was worried about the slight fragrance it has to it but I wouldn’t worry if you have sensitive skin like me, I would’ve had a breakout now and it’s been a week since using it! I would highly recommend this to anyone with oily and acne prone/sensitive skin. BEST face wash for sensitive skin
