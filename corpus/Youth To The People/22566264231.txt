No brand does moisturizers like YTTP! I was so excited to see that they made a new cream, a lot of their products are staples in my routine. This new creamIs just lovely, it’s thicker than airwhip & lighter than the adaptogen cream. I think any skin type could use this. It’s very nourishing and hydrating but also lightweight and breathable. This cream helps with fine lines & wrinkles, firms skin & supports the skin barrier. Everything you want in a great moisturizer. For beautiful skin  NOW & even better skin in the FUTURE! YTTP does it again!
