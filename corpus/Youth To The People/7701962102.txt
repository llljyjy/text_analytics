Unfortunately this moisturizer leaves my skin feeling chalky and is not nearly hydrating enough for Canadian winter weather no matter how much product I use. It smells great and looks nice in the jar, so 2 stars from me. Iâ€™m disappointed as I was hoping to find a moisturizer with clean ingredients that I could stand behind. Especially disappointed in the price. Not moisturizing enough for the price
