I have oily-combination skin and acne and this cleanser is so gentle and leaves your skin feeling so refreshed and clean without drying it out. It is pricey but itâ€™s SO worth the money and is very long lasting, my acne improved and it keeps my oil in control. This is my fourth time buying this product and I really recommend at least trying the small size (even that will last you a while) PLEASE TRY THIS CLEANSER
