It’s a little early for any guarantees, but it seems YTTP has done it again! I’ve used it a total of 4x (going slow since I just healed my damaged skin barrier and am a little retinoid-shy) and started to notice improvement after the 3rd use. I used it only once the first week and my skin felt soft when I washed it off, but no noticeable change. Twice the second week and now on week 3- sensitive skin has remained calm, texture on my cheeks have evened out, and I feel like the parentheses around my mouth have softened. I plan to increase usage to every other day and will keep this in my routine since the formulation is so lovely. Will update if this goes south! YTTP over here starting a cult
