I’ve been using this moisturizer for over a year and I love it! I have oily skin and I don’t like thick moisturizers and this one is so light and soaks into my skin very quickly without making it feel sticky! Would highly recommend to anyone with oily skin who wants a light moisturizer that also leaves your skin feeling very hydrated at the same time! nan
