I like the scent of this cleansing oil and how easily it melts with water, however, I find that it doesn’t break down waterproof mascara that well and it beads up on itself. I also think that with the jar, it would’ve been nice to have a spatula to grab the balm that’s under the lip of the container. Not the best, not the worst
