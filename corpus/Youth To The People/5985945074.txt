Got this as a sample with a previous purchase. After using it for a few days, I haven’t noticed anything different than my other moisturizers. I have combination/normal skin with no major concerns and live in a very humid environment. I wouldn’t say it either helped nor made anything worse. For those with dry or sensitive skin, this would probably be a good option. Just Okay
