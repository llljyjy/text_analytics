I have very dry skin especially during the winter. I use this twice a day so I ran out fairly quickly. Hope they come out with a bigger size and maybe a refillable bottle with out the top. I feel like I’m feeding my skin healthy juice lol. It’s helped me stayed moisturized this whole winter. Need to see the effects during the summer though. went back for seconds
