This is my perfect moisturizer for mornings! I use Biossance omega repair for nights, but it’s a little thick for me for mornings under makeup. I tried Biossance’s probiotic and didn’t like it (it pilled) and Farmacy discontinued my favorite lightweight moisturizer, so this is my new go-to. It smells nice (like green juice? I don’t know, but I like it) and it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. Absorbs quickly. I’m a huge fan! great for daytime
