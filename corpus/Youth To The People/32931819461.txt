GAVE ME ACNE!!! Before I started using this cleanser I had clear skin and minimal breakouts, I would only have 1-2 pimples a week (I’m still a teenager so it’s normal) and as soon as I started using this my skin BROKE OUT so bad, I had tons of pimples on my chin, jaw, and cheeks. I started using a new cleanser and all of those pimples have gone away. If your skin is sensitive to scent DO NOT BUY THIS, if you have tougher skin that’s not sensitive it may work but I would not recommend as it broke my friend out with sensitive skin too!!! nan
