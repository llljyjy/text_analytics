Really nice retinol serum, too early to see long term results but fit well with current routine. I’ve been using retinol for a while & didn’t have any reaction to using it. One pump was enough for my face using the dot method, and it sat nicely under moisturizer. Reminded me of the drunk elephant one (though the color could be part of that. All in all, good simple retinol serum, as I already use retinol regularly I haven’t noticed any real changes but it’s a good one. So far so good
