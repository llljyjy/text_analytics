If you have dry skin like me, skip this. It’s not moisturizing enough for me, so I can really only use this in the morning under sunscreen, and only in the spring/summer as it’s not hydrating enough for winter at all- even in California! For the price I was expecting a richer, more hydrating cream, especially since it’s labeled the “deep moisture cream.” This was more like a light moisture cream in my opinion. If you have oily skin this might work. It has a lovely texture, but it just isn’t hydrating enough for my skin type. NOT FOR DRY SKIN
