Sadly, I don’t have a picture of mine because I’ve used it all. But when i tell you this is a miracle product (at least for me), I mean it. I had pimples on both sides of my face last january, weirdly enough mirrored due to who knows what and for a solid 6 months at least they never left/ turned into strange spots in different sections on my face. AS SOON as I used this moisturizer, they disappeared within a week. I’m not kidding, if it helped me, it could help you... ALL I’M SAYING IS GIVE THE TRIAL VERSION A SHOT AT LEAST. Thanks for reading if ya did. This is a Miracle to me
