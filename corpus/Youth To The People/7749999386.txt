I like this cleansing balm. It melts easily and does not strip the skin. I wish it did a slightly better job at removing eye makeup but I do go in with my 2nd cleanser which takes care of the job. Overall great and I recommend it. I also love that it’s a glass jar - it’s so important for the plant! good cleansing balm
