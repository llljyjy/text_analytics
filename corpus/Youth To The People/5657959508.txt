I just purchased this product yesterday. I used it once and I could feel the difference in my skin. This is not like any other cleanser I’ve used. My philosophy is if I try something and it make a difference with one use, it’s worth it because the end results will be amazing. I don’t believe them when they say, “if your face breaks out give it two weeks for the product to work!“ (that’s just my opinion) I want to also mention that the amount of product is worth the cost. The cleanser is so rich that you won’t have to use much to get a lather. I was amazed! It will last you for a while. I consider this love and first wash, and I will stick by this wash as long as it’s available and nothing changes. It had me at Hello! If you care for your skin like I do, try it! That’s one area I’m not frugal in. On top of all the good things I’ve mentioned, it’s vegan! WOW! Was not what I expected!
