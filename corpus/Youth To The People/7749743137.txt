I use this in the morning since it gives you that thicker moisturizer feel without physically being thick. I have really dry skin so this works for me without breaking me out. I know others recommend this for the night but it’s not good enough for that use. It doesn’t give you the deep moisture you need from a night cream. I defiantly would recommend but it’s not life changing? nan
