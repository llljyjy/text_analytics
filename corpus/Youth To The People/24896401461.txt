I have sensitive skin that reacts to a lot of face washes. Until now, I have only been able to use cerave. I tried this on a whim and absolutely love it! It does not strip my combination skin, and itâ€™s super refreshing to use in the morning. I have noticed that my skin looks glowy and I have fewer breakouts. nan
