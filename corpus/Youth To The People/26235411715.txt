Perfect for oily skin, but slightly stripping for dry skin. I have acne-prone skin that gets dry in the winter. I wanted to hate this but love how it keeps the pimples away. However, it definitely dries my face out when I use it daily at night. Great product, suitable for my sensitive skin, but probably better for oily skin. Also, I have lots of skin allergies, especially with fragrance, but this one didnâ€™t cause any reactions. Best for Oily Skin
