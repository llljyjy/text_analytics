I LOVE how this product works for the most part. It’s not drying and it’s the same if not better than the drunk elephant retinol. However, I do not like how it is really yellow and can leave marks on my tshirts (it washes out though). It also is still yellow in the morning when I wash my face, yellow is still coming off. Other than that I will be repurchasing ! nan
