Nice serum but YTTP recommends this be used separately from their aha/bha exfoliants which I have come to use daily. I could still layer with their new retinal serum but don’t feel like for my skin that the benefits warrant the additional step in my routine. For that reason I wouldn’t repurchase this particular serum right now but for sure continue to use other products in their line up Nice but didn’t fit my routine
