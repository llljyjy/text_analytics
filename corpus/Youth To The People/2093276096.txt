I have purchased this product twice in hopes that the waxy issue was just a one time thing. I havenâ€™t seen a huge improvement in my under eyes but definitely helped with dryness. However, it is not worth it. Once the product turns waxy it will not absorb into the skin & just continues to spread around into clumps. I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing a second time!
