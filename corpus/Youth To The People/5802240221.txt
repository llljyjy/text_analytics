I have problematic skin for sure - my skin fluctuates between oily on hot, humid days and dry on cool, dry days. (Florida weather can be unpredictable) My skin is also acne prone and gets congested easily - it’s hard for me to love a product. All that said though - this serum feels like it really balances my skin despite whatever day it’s having. My skin feels moisturized yet not sticky, the serum is light and doesn’t feel heavy or thick on my skin, and I feel like my skin is having an easier time adapting to the weather around me. This serum is something I’ll keep in my routine during the winter and through the summer - it’s a great year round fix. I highly recommend this for anyone who feels like their skin is too oily to moisturize - my skin feels much more balanced, hydrated, and rarely gets oily. I received this as a free sample - but my review is honest. I will definitely be buying the full size when this runs out. Love it
