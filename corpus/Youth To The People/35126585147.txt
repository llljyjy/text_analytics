A little goes a long way. It directs you to apply to 1-2 pumps to damp skin, and I’ve found I have to use less of this than typical serums to get the same effect (usually 1 pump is more than enough for me, and with other serums that suggest 2-4 pumps I tend to lean toward 3-4 pumps). My favorite way to use it is as part of my evening routine, followed by the YTTP superberry dream mask…but I think I’d also love it as part of my morning routine as My skin feels more “awake” after this serum. My skin feels plumped—bouncy and refreshed, cleansed but not tight. nan
