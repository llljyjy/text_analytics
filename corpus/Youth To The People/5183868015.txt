Was wildly disappointed with this cleanser! Given that cleanser is literally money going down the drain, I didnâ€™t have any outlandish expectations, but this felt the way a highly surfactant SLS-containing bar soap might feel.  It made my face feel squeaky-clean and not in a good way.  And I have quite healthy, normal, balanced skin.  I also used a tiny bit because it does foam well.  There are a dozen other cleansers (foaming ones included) at half the price that do not strip the skin of its natural oils. The glass bottle and green color are eco-friendly and look beautiful in the bathroom, but the cleanser is in no way worth the price. nan
