Got a 15 ml sample with another order. It might last me about 15 face washes, so comparing product to price it’s darn expensive. That said, it’s a gel face wash that lathers up nicely. It has a “grass juice” smell to it, and having had grass juice before the smell makes me nauseous; don’t think I could be cleansing with this everyday. The after feel is nice; it’s got a matte, clean feel without overly drying. Decent face wash, I don’t think I’ll see benefits face wise from a face wash, so for the price point I don’t think I would be purchasing this cleanser. Why so darn expensive …
