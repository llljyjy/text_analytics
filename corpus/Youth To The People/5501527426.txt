I didn’t have too much hope for this, I was sure it was over hyped. I truly thought I wasn’t going to like it but I have been enjoying it for the couple weeks I’ve had it. I have very sensitive acne prone dry skin with dermatitis(chin) and eczema flare ups. So far it seems this is actually improving my skin. I use this as my second, and morning cleanser. It smells nice and gets a decent lather. It is non drying and I have had no reactions to it, and I would know the morning after first use if I would. I’m also prone to CC’s and everything has been going great in the respect as well. It leaves my skin clean but soft and bright. I got the mini to try on a whim and I plan to purchase the full size when it’s gone; I like it that much. If you have an allergy to any of these ingredients I would of course avoid it. I mostly use Asian exclusive skincare and have yet to find a cleanser I truly like that’s not in that category until now. Very excited and the full size has a pump!! Could not be more excited about this product and it makes me want to give more of this line a try. Surprising Great
