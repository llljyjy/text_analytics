I wanted to love this product but it was a bit too oily for my skin. It just kind of sat on top of my skin and didnâ€™t sink in for a while. I do have sensitive skin and oily products can sometimes give me a reaction. I used this for a week and started developing little bumps under my skin on my jawline. Bummed I had to return it. nan
