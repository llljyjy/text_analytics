ive bought this cleanser 3 times and love it, but its not anything special. its pretty basic and I feel like is good for any skin type and I love it but its super hyped and I feel like any other cleanser could do the same I personally just love that its a glass container so its way better for the environment than plastic!!! Pretty good
