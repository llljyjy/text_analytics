This cleanser is amazing for combination/oily skin.  After I use it, my skin looks amazing and is ready for my make up.  It my favorite cleanser to use in the morning.  In the winter, sometimes it can leave my skin feeling slightly dry, but never tight.  The results are completely worth the price.  However, the pump will sometimes leak.  Once a week I have to unscrew it and let the excess product drip back into the bottle, otherwise it just leaks out the top. Great cleanser for oily/combination skin
