This moisturizer smells kind of weird and didn’t do anything spectacular for my skin. In fact, it feels kind of heavy and unpleasant to me. I knocked an extra star off, given that it’s pretty pricey and there are much better moisturizers out there (the Glow Recipe Plum Plump is a favorite). I sadly couldn’t get myself to finish up the jar before it expired, because I kept gravitating towards other products I own. Nothing Special
