I don’t recommend, this made me break out like crazy. Now I have to purchase other products to counter the blackheads the oil in this kit created. I don’t like that they don’t explain what each item does to what type of skin. There isn’t a concise description for each item. I really don’t like it. it’s going to be a no for me dog.
