I would give this product no stars if I could. It is extremely harsh and drying and NOT GOOD for sensitive skin at all! It made me break out for months and because of the reviews, I never thought it was the cleanser but as soon as I took it out of my routine, my skin cleared up completely. It irritates your eyes and your skin so the point where it starts flaking. Nothing that smells like detergent and burns your eyes to the point of watering can be good for you skin. Stick to CeraVe. This expensive product caused me to break out and left me with hyperpigmentation afterwards. DO NOT RECOMMEND. IRRITATING AND DRYING
