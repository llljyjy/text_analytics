I recieved the travel size and have used it about 5 times now waiting a few days between each use.  I have been using the sandwich method and have not experienced any dryness. It layers great after the cactus peptide hydrating serum. I can already see results with my skin texture and tone. I already purchased the full size and canâ€™t wait to keep seeing results. Love it. My first retinal product
