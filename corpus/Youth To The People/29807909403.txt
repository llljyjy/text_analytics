Most of these reviews are incentivized, but i can honestly say this serum is not worth the price tag at all. It’s nice and moisturizing with the hyaluronic acid plumping the skin, however, the moisture does not last. I have tried different serums that are significantly cheaper and i saw better results than using this product. Good molecule has really great peptide and HA serums. Don’t waste your money on overpriced products. overpriced and not worth it
