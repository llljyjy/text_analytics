The best acid toner I’ve ever tried. Does it’s job to smooth keratin buildup and all types of pimples without being heavy, greasy, or drying. Feels weightless and comfortable, doesn’t sting and hasn’t made me breakout more. This is the best I’ve found. Something like the ordinary, wish-trend mandelic all stung and gave more sensitivity. This does not. Love lightweight and gentle ❤️
