I really wanted to like this but it breaks up, flakes off since it’s more of a dryer texture. It doesn’t remove eye makeup as easily as some other cleansing balms I have tried. I prefer the Glow Recipe Papaya balm over this. It’ll get the job done but you have to work harder, use more product and it takes longer to wash off. It's okay...
