As a POC with PIH (IFYKYK), I was desperate and decided to try this product. Yes... it is very expensive, but I do believe itâ€™s worth it. This applies beautifully and makes my skin feel so silky. It plays well with all my other serums + sunscreen, you only need one drop for your whole face. I have seen an overall evening of my skin tone, and my dark spots are actually fading. I attached my progress photos to help others see realistic results - this is after one month of consistent use. Not perfect, but I can tell a big difference. I will definitely be repurchasing this.
