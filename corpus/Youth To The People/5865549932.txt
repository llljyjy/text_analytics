A bit pricey but worth spending the money! Super light scent and finish, perfect for sensitive skin like mine. This serum has an instant and noticeably visible firming effect, and after using daily for two weeks I’ve noticed firmer skin and an overall even skin tone. My skin now has a natural glow I’ve never been able to achieve with other products. All of that to say: THIS STUFF WORKS!! Totally worth it
