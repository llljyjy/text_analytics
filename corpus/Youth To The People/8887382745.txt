I’ve used the cream in the past and really liked it, and had been wanting to try the serum very badly, but hesitant to spend 54 dollars for the full size without knowing if I liked it. So I was wicked excited to see this set pop up. I took a couple stars off because 1) the cream came dried up and more than half empty. I talked to Sephora and they are sending me a new set, which is amazing and thank you Sephora! But clearly YTP has a quality control issue because I’ve seen this mentioned in other reviews on the full size product. 2) The serum is super sticky and takes awhile to sink into my skin, even if I try to use a very minimal amount. I was trying to find a cheaper replacement for Estee Lauder and sadly this is not it. It is hydrating though, just not quite the same level as I was looking for. OK trial kit
