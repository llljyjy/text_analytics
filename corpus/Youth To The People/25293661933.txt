It’s worth it!!!! My first ever serum as I didn’t know what to do with my skin. I went in TikTok ask some questions and it was recommended I got it and paired with the indeed lab microbiome essence, peach & lily matcha pudding moisturizer and the black girl sunscreen spf 30…. omg this is it, not to mention very moisturizing as someone with very dry skin I recommend…. I just purchased my second bottle and also a travel size one…. Love it!!! ITS WORTH IT!!!!
