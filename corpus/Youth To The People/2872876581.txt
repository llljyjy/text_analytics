I used this product only about 3 times before noticing a significant difference! It made some areas on my face less red and helped some breakouts I was experiencing. I donâ€™t have acne prone skin, so was confused as to why I was breaking out, and this serum calmed it right down and made my skin glow too! Make sure to moisturize as well! Works quickly! Use with moisturizer :)
