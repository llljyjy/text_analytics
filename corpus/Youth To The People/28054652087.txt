i dont love splurging on skincare. i think that there are good drugstore options that work similarly, but this product kind of changed my mind. i needed something to give me a nice glow, and keep my skin hydrated and happy overnight. the sephora sales rep recommended this and i waited until i had a return to buy it.the first night i used it i saw a nice glow but it just melted into my skin.i have been using it for a week, and when i wake up my skin is glowy and clearer.pros:- smells nice- little goes a long way- great for hydration- can be paired with any actives - satisfying to put on - 2 oz of product vs only 1ozcons- EXPENSIVE- scented ( not sure if it is a synthetic but i am very sensitive to fragrance and this has been okay)- no amount of vitamin c is listed, so it is hard to tell how much when pairing with other products- mine did not come with a scooper but if you care about dipping your fingers in you wont like thatangry that i love this so much, but i can see this being my first luxury skincare item i finish and repurchase! angry that i love it
