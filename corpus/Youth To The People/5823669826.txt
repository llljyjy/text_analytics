Having combination/oily skin and texture, I wish I could exfoliate more than 2-3 times per week but I know that would leave my skin exposed so I gave this a shot by using it once a day in place of toner. My face feels so even, clear, and my pores seem smaller. This is definitely a new staple for me! nan
