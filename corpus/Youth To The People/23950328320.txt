I wanted this product to work. I love the other products I’ve tried from Youth to the People but this one leaves my face really really dry. There’s nothing special about the smell, or the texture so I couldn’t rate it on any of those things either. I’ve tried layering the product, but unless I just put oil on my face after using this, I’m just left with dry irritated skin. #sigh Unfortunately, this is not the one for me
