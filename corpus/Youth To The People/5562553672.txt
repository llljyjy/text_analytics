I’m not sure I can give a full review only using the product for a few weeks now. I am able to use it every 2-3 nights without irritation. I don’t think it’s doing as much for me as other products that address fine lines and texture. I think this is great for beginners, but if you’re looking for something that packs more punch (and are seasoned to these types of ingredients), you may want to look further. Also I did feel like I needed a second serum alongside my moisturizer to get the level of hydration my skin needs. nan
