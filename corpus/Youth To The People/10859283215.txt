I don’t use vitamin c serums often (not for skin brightening at least), but I do like to use them for a good antioxidant boost with my spf. As someone who doesn’t love vitamin c serums, this is probably the best vitamin c serum I’ve used so far! It doesn’t sting and doesn’t leave my skin feeling weird like other ones I’ve used. Would probably be five stars, only four purely bc of the price, I wish it wasn’t so expensive. my favorite vitamin c!
