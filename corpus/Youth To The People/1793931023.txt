I like this cleanser it doesn’t smells that bad plus it leaves my face clean and very smooth. I being use it for 10 day now. I don’t like the idea that it doesn’t have a pump. Plus is glass so I don’t think I can take it with me to travel. I think it would break. I don’t know why they didn’t add a pump like the big size bottle. I got the travel size. That is why I took off one star off. I have combination skin so it doesn’t make me break out. Watch is great. I would recommend to my friend. Cleanser
