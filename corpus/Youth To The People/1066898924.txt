I’m 46 years old and needed something more moisturizing to use on my neck area.  I bought the smaller version of this to try and I’m back for the larger version.  This stuff is amazing!  It’s thick, rich, and smells wonderful.  I have very sensitive skin and this hasn’t caused any issues.  I use this twice a day - in the morning and before bed.  My neck looks wonderful and is moisturized ALL day! Use On My Neck
