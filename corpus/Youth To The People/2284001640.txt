I want to LOVE this product and 5 star it, but it’s just not quite as hydrating as I would like for a nighttime mask! However, it is so smooth, smells delicious, and leaves skin feeling very soft! I started using in the winter when my skin is at its detest and also had to layer an oil or serum to really feel hydrated which is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5! I’ll update if this changes during the humid Georgia summer! Great Product!
