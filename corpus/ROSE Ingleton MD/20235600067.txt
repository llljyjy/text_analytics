For the past 20 years I have struggled with dark circles under my eyes,  I have tried so many products and nothing works.  For my moisturizer I have used La Mer for the past 30 years.  About a year ago I made the switch to the Rose MD Signature Moisturizer and the Complexion Brightening Booster as a recommendation from Dr Ingleton.  Best decision I ever made,  the dark circles have faded and are almost all gone,  I once again feel confident to leave my house without make.  The moisturizer is amazing and I get so many complements that I look much younger than I am. No more dark circles
