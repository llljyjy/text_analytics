So usually I am extremely hesitant trying any gel formulated cleanser, as I have dry sensitive eczema-prone skin. I usually aim for creamy/ non-foamy cleansers. However, this one took me completely by surprise. I have been using it for about a month now either once a day or twice a day if I wore facial makeup, and it has not dried my skin, no eczema flare-ups, etc. I think because of the Hyaluronic acid and other moisturizing ingredients mixed in, ensures that will not happen. I love that it is Black-Caribbean Owned, and I literally use several of her products. So my skin doesn’t get “used to it“ I use this in the spring/summer months along with the Dermalogica daily exfoliant, Rose’s blemish booster serum and moisturizer, and then I use the La Roche Posay Lipikar in the Fall/Winter Months. I am so happy that I have incorporated this into my skin ritual. Please give it a go :) Her products are very unique with Jamaican SuperFruit Blend. It is worth the coin :) and she’s a dermatologist... she know’s what she is talking about. It will have you glowing and cleansed. Amazing for Dry Skin! Terrific Year-Round Cleanser
