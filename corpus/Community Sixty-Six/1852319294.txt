My initial reaction when applying this night cream to my face was how thick the consistency is. I felt that it penetrated my skin very well and was staying in place. I have oily, redness prone, aging skin that can be sensitive to certain products. This product gave me no negative reaction. I have used it for a few nights now and 1st noticed how soft my skin feels. It feels overall balanced with less T zone oil. This product line gives you a lot for your money! I plan to continue using this night cream to see more results. *I received this product free of charge in exchange for my honest opinion. Thick!
