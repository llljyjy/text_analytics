I received this moisturizer for free from Influenster in return for my honest opinion. To start out, the packaging of this moisturizer -and all of the products from this brand- is so nice. It feels nice and it looks sleek and sophisticated, but not in a way that seems old-fashioned. This moisturizer has a nice unscented skincare smell (which I personally love) and felt really smooth when I applied it. It didnâ€™t leave my skin feeling sticky or oily either, just really nice and moisturized. I really would recommend this moisturizer. I LOVE this moisturizer
