I received this product in exchange for an honest review.I received 4 different products in this range. To start there are a lot of questionable things with this range. This product line tries to make it seem like all their products are safe and great to use together or on a regular or even daily basis. Which is NOT the case. Before using this brand I highly recommend looking into their ingredients and getting recommendations on combined use. Because community sixty-six does not provide good instructions or product combination use information.This moisturizer is a bit hit or miss. In the summer most of my face is normal, but my nose and forehead can get a bit oily. In general this moisturizer was okay. It was light and left my skin feeling okay, not overly oily on my nose and forehead so it seems okay for after shower use. The only issues were similar to other products in their line. The stuff I mentioned in the above paragraph and that this moisturizer and the entire line has a smell to it. It’s not great, but not the worst I’ve had a product smell. It doesn’t last long after applying so it wasn’t a big issue. But I know others can be more sensitive to smells. The other thing to note about this product is like other ones in the line is that it is very thick and a little goes a long way. You will probably need a decent amount less than you think you will.The other issue is again an issue with the entire line. All the packaging is basically identical. If two products are the same bottle and size it will take you a second to easily identify which you are grabbing. That could be altered a bit.  The only major issue with the line is that on all of their products there is more information on the box you will normally recycle about the product, use and warnings than on the bottle itself. That stuff should really be on the bottle as well. Okay moisturizer for normal skin
