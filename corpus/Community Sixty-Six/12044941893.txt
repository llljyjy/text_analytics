I am absolutely in love with this eye cream. I had almost given up on finding an eye cream that actually done what it was supposed to.do. I applied before bedtime and actually seen results the very next day. My eyes weren’t puffy and weren’t near as dark. I loved the lightweight feel and a little goes a long way. There was no overpowering smell or stickiness. I sleep with an eye mask also and it didn’t wear off. I also decided to.use it of the morning under my makeup and my eyes looked so much brighter. I’m very pleased with this product and will be purchasing in the future. A must try eye cream.
