Great night time moisturizer! As soon as I dispensed some on the back of my hand, I was sure I wouldn’t like it. It seemed too thin to give my skin the hydration it needs overnight but I was totally wrong! Not only was it the perfect amount of hydration but also texture/weight. My skin didn’t feel suffocated, didn’t stick to the pillow, and I woke up this morning with none of the usual dry patches or irritation. Sooooldd!! The real one!!
