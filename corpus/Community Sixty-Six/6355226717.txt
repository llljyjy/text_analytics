when I found out I was pregnant, I had to give up a lot of my skin care products. I was recommended lactic acid as a safe option and I was using the one by the ordinary for a few months. I then recently received this product to try in exchange for my honest review. I love that it had all the skin care products that I was layering compiled into one product. I donâ€™t mind the texture at all but I do like to layer a thick cream over top. I will be re-purchasing. WOW!
