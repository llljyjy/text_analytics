I received this product for free from Influenster and Community Sixty-Six for my honest opinion. The Hydrating Oil-Free Gel Moisturizer is bomb so far. Feels great applying it and seems to keep my skin hydrated throughout the day without it feeling heavy or greasy. A little bit goes a long way with this stuff too! My skin seems a bit smoother each day and my pores have been looking less angry. It has a light consistency for being so hydrating. No strong scent so people sensitive to that shouldn’t have an issue. I haven’t even looked at my old moisturizers since I started using this! My new favorite moisturizer!
