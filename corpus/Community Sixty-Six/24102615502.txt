I received this product in exchange for my honest review. This product is probably one of the better products from Community Sixty Six. It is good for summer as it is very lightweight, but it doesn’t do much else. I have sensitive skin and it was okay for my skin. The price point also isn’t bad, but I will stick with my previous moisturizer for repurchase. Lightweight moisturizer
