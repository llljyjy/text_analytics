I used this for a little over a week and found it to be too hydrating for my preference. The gel is not too thick, it has no smell to it, and goes on smoothly. My skin naturally is on the oily side and this just made my skin super hydrated, almost looked oilier after a few hours of applying it. I went back to my other moisturizer for now and will give it another try in the winter when my skin is needing more hydration. If your looking for a lighter but hydrating moisturizer, give this a try! Extra Hydrating
