I received this as a free sample from Influenster, but these are my own honest opinions.I was excited for this fragrance-free cleanser as the summer heat, sun, and saltwater have done a number on my skin.  I have to say, Iâ€™m pleasantly surprised!  Due to the healthy acids, dead skin is removed naturally making my face smoother and brighter.  The downside is that the acids are in the stronger side so I would not recommend this for daily use.  It stings a little while washing but it quickly subsided after rinsing with no lingering redness. Great but not for daily use
