I’ve been using this for a few nights and I wake up with my skin feeling less oily but also hydrated. You only need to use a pea amount and it is enough to cover my entire face and neck. It’s a gel like lotion consistency and doesn’t really have a scent. It stays a little sticky on your skin so it doesn’t absorb much but it doesn’t feel uncomfortable. It makes me skin very smooth and doesn’t break out my acne prone skin. nan
