I use this as the second step in a double cleanse. I love it! It gets everything off that’s leftover from the first cleanse. My skin feels nice and clean. Not tight or dry. Also, I love how this cleanser does actually foam up a bit despite being a cream cleanser. It’s got a really nice texture. I will be ordering this again. Love this cleanser!
