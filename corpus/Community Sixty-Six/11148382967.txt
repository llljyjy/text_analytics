A nice, cool feeling gel moisturizer that definitely was great for humid summer nights . I usually use a thick cream moisturizer at night but in summer that is a bit much and this is a good replacement for that time. Can also use in the morning, but I slightly prefer a moisturizer w extra SPF in the AM. Otherwise loved the clean ingredients. Refreshing
