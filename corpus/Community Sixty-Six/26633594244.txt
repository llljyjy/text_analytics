I love this moisturizer. I have very oily skin, so I’m very careful with how heavy my moisturizer is, otherwise I’ll break out. Gel moisturizers are my favorite. They’re not greasy, lightweight and soak into your skin superfast. This one is no exception. I’d use it as summertime when your skin doesn’t dry out as bad as in cold weather(i live in humid climate). Not much scent either. Very happy with it. Light
