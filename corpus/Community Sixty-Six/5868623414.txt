I tried Community Sixty Sixs Hydrating Oil-Free Gel Moisturizer from Influencer in exchange for an honest review. I have normal to dry middle age skin and although it says gel it has more of a cream consistency. It wasn’t super moisturizing but did the job without that stick gel formula I’m not a fan of. It sank in well and didn’t interfere with makeup application. No real noticeable scent so wld be good for those sensitive to smells. Overall I would recommend for a good basic moisturizer that doesn’t break the bank and isn’t heavy at all. Hydrating Oil-Free Gel Moisturizer
