This formula is super hydrating, but that’s really all it feels like it gives me. My skin feels luxe and nice for about 3 minutes, then goes back to feeling the exact same as it had before I applied. If you’re looking for just hydration with a clean formula, i’d say this is just an okay option. My routine moisturizer is the Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream, and i prefer that one. Just okay
