I purchased this product with my own money. It def does what it says, it controlled the oil on my face (I’m not overly oily I’d say I fall somewhere between normal/oily) and it made my skin look incredibly smooth and all my makeup laid beautifully over it HOWEVER there are a few things that I didn’t like too much. The consistency is like a waxy balm, not sticky by any means after it dries down but it’s similar to Bobbi Brown Face Base in terms of texture except it dries much much faster and felt slightly less emollient. It was semi hard for me to rub in bc it dries faster than I was moving I guess. The first time I tried it over the jlo serum and I HATED how this felt, I could FEEL it on my face for like half an hour, I almost scrubbed it off but eventually that feeling subsided. The next time I tried it I used it without a serum underneath and I didn’t feel it at all and again my face looked incredibly smooth. By the end of the day my skin almost had a dry appearance to it actually, so it def kept oils at bay. I did have a bump on my forehead after the second day and this was the only new product I was trying so I am returning it. The product had almost no scent but when I sniffed closely for review purposes I guess it could be described as a barely noticeable dry earthy scent, which I didn’t smell at all once it was on my face. I commend the company for making products that seemingly don’t have silicones and also keeping the costs reasonable, which is encouraging me to try a different moisturizer from the brand since this one in particular didn’t work for me. If you have oily skin or maybe some pores/texture you want to smooth out without using a silicone heavy product def give this a shot. hello smooth skin!
