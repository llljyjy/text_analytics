I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I really wanted to like this product because it has a good price and size but I didn’t. It’s a good make up remover but just way to thick and hard to remove that not even my eyes skin was able to tolerate. and I felt it left a grease film orb my face hard to remove even when I ríanse it off many times. Thick and hard to remove
