I received these products for free from Influenster and brand(s) in exchange for my honest review. I have oily, non-sensitive skin. This gel moisturizer applies smoothly, helps to soothe the initial redness and burning from the gel cleanser, and leaves my skin feeling amazing (aka not oily or sticky like some moisturizers). I use this gel moisturizer in the mornings with the gel cleanser. My only con so far is the application amount. As with the resurfacing night cream I usually find myself needing 2 times the recommended amount (a pea sized amount) in order to not rub my face and neck uncomfortably. The scent is good and packaging is easy to handle. Doesnâ€™t leave my skin oily or sticky
