I absolutely love this moisturizer. Itâ€™s a thicker formula but not greasy. It absorbed pretty quickly into my skin. My skin is combination with very oily parts and dry spots as well. I would use one pump and it was more than enough. The packaging is great there is zero smell which I thought I would prefer,but in all honestly I think I like a little scent added. nan
