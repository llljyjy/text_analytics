This is the first melting balm I have used and I will say it does work well at removing makeup. It doesn’t irritate your eyes and even melts mascara away. Also, a little goes a long way. However, I don’t like the smell. It sort of smells like plastic. I’ve used this product for five days now and every time I open the bottle a ton of liquid comes out (like ketchup if you don’t shake the bottle) so I’m not totally sure what that’s about either. But, all in all it does do the job. nan
