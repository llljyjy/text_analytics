This isn’t bad but it’s definitely for someone with dry skin. This would probably be great for the winter months. It’s gel consistency is lightweight and absorbs well. I thought it was a little sticky even when I used a small amount. I’m not sold on this but I will try it out again this winter. Ehhh okay
