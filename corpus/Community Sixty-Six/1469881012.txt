Pros: very hydrating, removes makeup easily, a little goes a very long way (pea size is plenty). This would be great for winter when skin is very dry. Con: this stuff is thick. Definitely for dry skin. Overall, I liked this product but probably would use it in the winter. Itâ€™s pretty thick and leaves a noticeable layer of moisturizer behind. It would work best as part of a double cleansing routine. nan
