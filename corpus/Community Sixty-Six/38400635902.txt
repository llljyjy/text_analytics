I tried it for the first time and it didn’t work out for me very well. It irritated my face right away and I looked into the ingredients and saw it had citric acid which I assume is an ingredient that may have caused my chemical reaction. My face became very red as well as my neck. It was my fault for not doing a patch tests at first. Glycolic acid and citric acid as well as salicylic acid are very high up on the list and I think that’s what may have contributed to my skin reaction since they may be high in concentration percentage. Otherwise I’m pretty bummed out it didn’t work out for me so I had to return it. nan
