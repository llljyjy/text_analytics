The packaging is nice, the message is great, I love the no scent added. The consistency is nice, it absorbs well. However it’s not very moisturizing. I woke up with dry patches, which I don’t usually have. It’s just ok. Works well under makeup. Overall, I prefer my other moisturizers much more to this one. nan
