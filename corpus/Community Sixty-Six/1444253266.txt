This night cream does the job.  There isnâ€™t anything particularly remarkable about it.  It is very thick and does an ok job hydrating.  I feel like my skin looks a little worse than when using my normal skincare routine.  It did not improve my texture and seems to exacerbate my redness. Nothing remarkable
