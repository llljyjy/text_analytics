I’m not sure if this product works, I cannot deal with the smell. This product smells like moldy clothes left in the washing machine for days. I cannot tolerate smelling it on my hands or skin to apply it. I thought I received a bad batch until I read the review as. It’s intolerable period. Hard pass. I can’t get passed the smell….
