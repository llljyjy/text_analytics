It was fine, I’m honestly not super blown away by any of this brands products and wouldn’t re-purchase them. It didn’t irritate my skin, but it did ramp up oiliness which is a bummer, I didn’t see any skin benefits, a little goes a long way, the packaging feels clunky and like it might shatter or crack if you drop it wrong. Nothing special about this product out of the multiple (and cheaper) hyaluronic and niacinamide moisturizer’s/ serums on the market. Just ok
