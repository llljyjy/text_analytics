I honestly could careless about this moisturizer. I didn’t really feel like it did anything for me, yes it made me feel a little bit extra oily but not in a moisturized way. I use it at night just because it’s thicker than my morning moisturizer and also the smell is kinda annoying. I don’t really care much for how products smell but this whole line smells like Elmer’s glue, this moisturizer however is extra glue smelly. I’ll prob just use up the bottle and definitely would not repurchase. . I received this product for review purposes. Straight up Elmer’s glue
