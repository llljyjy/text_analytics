Had the best smell out of all the products tested. My skin is very acne prone and oily, so this moisturizer combined with the night resurfacing cream worked really well for me. My skin felt softer in the morning after using this product at night. I liked how lightweight it felt for a moisturizer, and it absorbed well on my skin. Nice and lightweight feel, good for oily skin
