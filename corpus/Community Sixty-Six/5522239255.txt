This product is a balm so it makes pushing it out of a tube very difficult but not impossible. I would say that is the only complaint I have about it.It applies very nicely and relives makeup nicely. I prefer to use an oil or shae butter to remove make up so I had just recently moved to an oil cleanser (great for make up but I don’t like for normal cleansing). With this product it’s great for removing make up/cleansing and I can use it specifically for that and my normal cleanser. Melts the Waterproof Eyebrow right off!
