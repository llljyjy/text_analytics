The Community Sixty Six Hydrating Gel Moisturizer does its job amazingly. It moisturizes well, isn’t sticky, goes on smoothly, and my face isn’t oily after a few hours. The only thing that would make this better is if it had some kind of SPF! This moisturizer is really good if you have any type of skin! My oily face approves! I love it!
