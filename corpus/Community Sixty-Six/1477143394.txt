definitely putting this into my rotation. there is no off putting smell which is nice. the texture is amazing and does not change when it goes on skin. its easily spread and my skin soaks it up. i have normal skin, but have rosecea that flares occasionally. most lotions tend to sit on my skin. this one melts right into my skin and i can feel the moisture all day. definitely my new fav
