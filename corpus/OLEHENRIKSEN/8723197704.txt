Received this product as a free sample. I am obsessed with this under eye cream! I have dark under eye circles, some new fine lines (ughhh turning 30), and dryness under my eyes. I also have super sensitive skin that reacts to everything. I think because this is fragrance free that helped a lot. It also is vegan!! I have noticed improvements in my dark under eye circles and dryness. I haven’t yet seen much change in the wrinkles but i have only been using it for a few weeks. I think this may be the best vit C eye cream I’ve tried! Definitely recommend! Fragrance free AND vegan!
