Gifted by Ole Henriksen I received the Dewtopia 5% Acid Firming Night Creme.I love putting this on at bedtime and waking up with hydrated and glowing skin.  It smells like lemon pound cake and looks like cake batter.  I rub it onto my face and neck before going to bed.  It absorbs well and feels great on my skin.  It is hydrating, exfoliates, and makes my skin soft, smooth and gives it a glowing appearance.  It claims to reduce fine lines and I am hopeful with continued use to see mine diminish.  Key ingredients include glycolic and lactic acids, edelweiss stem cells and shea butter. nan
