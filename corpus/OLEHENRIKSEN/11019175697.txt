I have combination skin type but the skin around my eyes are very dry. I think this eye cream works fine for me. I use it in summer and I don’t feel the texture is too heavy. I use it twice a day, in the morning and night. It’s not helpful for your wrinkles but definitely bright your eye skin which you don’t look too tired after use. nan
