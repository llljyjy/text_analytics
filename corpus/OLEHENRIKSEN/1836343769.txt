I think this may be my new go to moisturizer! To start of with, the packaging is awesome. I like the bottle it comes in . For the product , it’s more on the thick side. I always enjoyed creams that are a little thicker than watery. Just feels better and more expensive lol. I have combo skin. I haven’t been using it for a long time frame but it definitely makes my skin feelHydrated also given that I have combo skin my face gets oily ish on the t zone area . By now I’ve come to realize that it will always do that eventually no matter what I use . Lastly I must say that I enjoy the smell as well. My top
