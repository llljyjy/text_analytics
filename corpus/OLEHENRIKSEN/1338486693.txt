This cream doesn’t do anything beyond dry out the skin. Since it’s acid based, if can’t get used nightly and the bakuchiol is useless. I’ve given it the better part of a year but to no avail. I’ve tired it on its own and also followed by a moisturizing cream but still unimpressive. Finally, it doesn’t absorb well into the skin so it feels really gross. And if has a weird, strong smell. Going to throw it away at this point. Feels gross and does nothing
