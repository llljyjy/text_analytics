I do really enjoy this product. It has a pleasant smell and texture. I don’t know if I just haven’t been using it long enough or what, but I don’t think it makes that much of a noticeable difference in my under eye area. I will continue to use it though because I do like the brand. I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange of an honest review. Pretty good!
