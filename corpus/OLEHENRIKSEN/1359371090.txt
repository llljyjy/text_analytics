I got this as a free sample and just gave it a try the other night. Yowza! It banished my dry, uneven skin and brought back the glow I thought I’d finally lost to age. I’m 59, a rehead with sensitive skin and spotty, fading freckles. Dewtopia smoothed and refreshed and brightened as soon as I put it on, with lasting effects throughout the following day. My husband was an instant fan the next morning. He thought I’d just gotten a good night’s sleep, LOL! I immediately ordered a full bottle. Transformative!
