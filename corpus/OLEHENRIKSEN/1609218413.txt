The texture of this product is PERFECT! It is so light and non-sticky, I can put it on quickly in the morning, add SPF, and my foundation, without feeling like I have a million layers of crap on my face. It smells a little like that powdered orange candy of my youth, but the smell dissipates quickly. So far, it plays nice with my makeup and doesnâ€™t pill. Looking forward to seeing more results. nan
