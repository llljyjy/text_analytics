I received this product complementary from Ole Henriksen and really enjoyed it! I have combination skin with slight dullness and noticed that this essence helped give me a glow that is lit from within. The formula is very lightweight, as well as very easy to apply and quick to absorb! Initial application feels super hydrating and I had no problems with pilling when layering skincare products together. I would definitely purchase it again and recommend this essence to friends and family alike! Iâ€™m extremely impressed and love how radiant the Vitamin C has made my skin look. Not to mention, the citrus scent is absolutely amazing and I have not experienced many breakouts since trying out this product. I love it! Amazing!
