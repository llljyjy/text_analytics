I got this as a sample for a previous purchase. The bottle was tiny so I was surprised how long it lasted. The smell is very citrus-y and fresh. I use this by mixing one pump with a small dot of moisturizer and spreading it all over my face in the morning after showering. My skin is very uneven and even in my 30’s I’m still prone to breakouts. When I use this product, my skin is clearer. A few days in a row of using it and my blemishes are gone. Now I’m considering splurging for the big bottle! Clearer Skin
