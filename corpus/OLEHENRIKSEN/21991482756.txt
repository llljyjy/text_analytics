I got 2 of these as the walnut scrub was unfortunately discontinued I was informed this was similar how ever it’s nothing like the walnut scrub. I could use the walnut scrub every 2-3 days with no skin irritation. This stuff I have tried once a week, once every 2 weeks and every time I am left with a rash on my chin! I should add I don’t generally have sensitive skin. The smell of it stinks, do not like this product at all, wishing I didn’t get two of them! Steer clear!
