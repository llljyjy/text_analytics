I love this product.  It is my only high end skin product right now.  I am on a tight budget, so I use mostly drugstore skincare.  I am glad I chose this one because it does one of the most important things which is to deep clean and exfoliate my face.  My face looks ten times better.  It is smooth.  There is less little break outs.  I just use it once or twice a week.  I was told how young I look the other day.  The person said I look 10 years younger.  Please keep selling this product.  Every time I find an exfoliator that I like, they discontinue it.  Also, I do this in the shower so that I can completely wash off the granules.  That is the easiest way. nan
