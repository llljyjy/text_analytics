Absolutely love this brand so much.I’ve tried multiple Vitamin C products, and this one has been my favorite. This booster is very perfect for my skin because I’m using Olehenriksen serum also.It’s very light and refresh, easy to apply and absorb into skin and smell is great, too.I used it for morning and night routine, and I saw a difference after 5 days, I noticed I was receiving a lot of compliments on how clear my skin was looking and the dark marks were fading aslo. Can’t wait to try more Olehenriksen’s products. nan
