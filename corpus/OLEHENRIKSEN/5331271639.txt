No. Just no. It stinks. It doesn’t moisturize well but makes me greasy at the same time. I miss the hydrator and I REALLY miss the mattifying cream. They re-released it on their website last year and I bought 5. I’m out now so I tried this since the others are no longer available and it’s a no-go. No. Bring back the old.
