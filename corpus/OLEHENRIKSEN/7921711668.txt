I’ve been using this moisturizer for almost a full jar now and I love it! I think the collagen aspect, where it keeps the skin firm and supple, is working really nicely! And it’s doing it better than moisturizers that are twice the price! Although, if it weren’t for my Saint Jane Beauty Serum (just a little goes a long way) doing some of the moisturizing work, I don’t think that this would be enough moisture for me. But I do use both St Jane and Ole Strength Trainer twice a day. And the routine is working out great :) Yay for Ole!
