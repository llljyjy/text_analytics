I have waited for a while now (about 3 weeks) to see any results. I was nervous at first when I heard a lot of people got irritated by this eye cream. Luckily I didn’t experience that, I wasn’t irritated at all so that’s one good thing.Another good thing about it is the texture, it’s creamy and glides on smoothly like butter, and blends in well, leaving no white cast behind.It’s moisturizing for sure, at the end of the day my under eyes still look nice and healthy.However, for 3 weeks I haven’t seen major effect on brightening my dark circles, perhaps I just need to go to bed earlier? Decent eye cream
