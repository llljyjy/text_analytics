I was super excited about this moisturizer as Ole Henriksen makes nice skincare products and this one seemed really intriguing. I like the texture of the product, which is a little firmer/thicker than most moisturizers, and I liked that the smell was fresh and nice but subtle and not overpowering. I have oily skin but live in a dry climate so I need really effective moisturizers to keep my skin hydrated but not shiny. However my skin is very sensitive and that’s where I ran into trouble. When I apply this moisturizer my face immediately turns red and stays that way for several hours. So, I could only use it at night, as the redness was gone by the morning and then maybe my skin did look a little more even. But there are other moisturizers out there that don’t give my skin that kind of reaction, so I won’t keep using this one. Nice product but not for my sensitive skin
