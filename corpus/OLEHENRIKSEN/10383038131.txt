Eye creams. Admittedly in my skincare routine, this tends to be a product I’m not good at keeping up with. This mainly is due to the majority of creams causing my sensitive eyes to tear up and then comes the rubbing of said eyes, which makes it all the worse. I need to do better in this department through experimenting more, regardless of my poor experiences. Eye cream is super important to help the appearance of your eyes, I don’t need to tell you this. You already know. So needless to say, I was excited to see I was chosen to test this product out in exchange for my honest thoughts! Let’s start with the facts here - this retails currently for $40-$42, depending on retailer. This eye cream promises to brighten instantly whilst smoothing texture and promoting elasticity while reducing the look of fine lines and wrinkles. As an added bonus, it also states to improve the wear of your makeup and help prevent creasing. Due to my prior experiences with eye creams, I was very careful and cautious with each application. I didn’t experience any eye sensitivity, which is instantly a win for me. Product is scent free and very thick and creamy in consistency - a little goes a long way! I’ve been using this product for about two weeks, so while my rating is high, I didn’t want to rate a full five stars or lower than four, due to my initial opinion of results. It takes longer than two weeks to really start to see the benefits from eye creams. With that being said, during the two weeks I have been applying consistently on a nightly basis - the appearance of my dark circles has diminished quite a bit. My eye area has brightened. My eye bags also aren’t as evident. I’m excited to continually wear this cream to see further results. Hopefully the cream lives up to the rest of its promises, as my eyes could use such benefits!
