This has actually become my go-to cleanser! For reference I have combo skin and my core issues are hyperpigmentation and texture. I usually switch around depending on my skin, makeup and the season between Paula’s Choice, this, and Grown Alchemist. I love all them but this one leaves my face glowing, buffs away the dead skin, and gives me more defined/less textured skin. Also you only need a small small amount of product, like the 60mL has lasted me for months and I’m still not halfway through it. nan
