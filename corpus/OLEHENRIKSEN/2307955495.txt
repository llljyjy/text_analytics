Hydration is a must for my mature skin and this essence is a perfect newbie for warmer months. As heat increases in my area and it gets super humid heavy moisturizers don’t feel good on the skin. This essence is super light, soaks in super quick and gives me a perfect skin finish for makeup and spf. It’s non sticky and plumping. First thing I noticed after using it for a few times is how solid my skin color is. All the redness around my mouth and nose was gone. Skin felt velvety soft and comfortable. Awesome addition to my skincare routine for day and night, it’s milky texture is soothing and gentle. Comfortable skin
