I tried this serum after much, much research (shoutout to my fellow skincare science enthusiasts!) The formulation is great and I did get decent results from it. I know a good vitamin c product can be hard to find but this is a good one. I even repurchased it for my mom. The smell is very fresh, however, for such a good product I would love to see it reformulated without the fragrance. I know fragrance can be fine for a lot of people but for those of us with sensitive skin, it would be lovely to have the option of fragrance free. Would love a fragrance-free version of this!
