This is a great brand and a great product, although it’s not a perfect fit for my specific skincare needs. I was really surprised to see that there was some pigment to this eye cream, and I was happy that it blended in to my pale skin tone with ease! It also moisturized my under eyes very well and acted as a great base for my makeup. The one con is that it didn’t prevent the skin by and around the inner corner of my eye from drying and flaking throughout the day; it’s hard to find creams that moisten such a dry area for me. Other than that, this was a pretty good product! Almost Perfect
