I’m in the midst of a bitterly cold, climactic winter. There have been more snow days on record than I can ever recall. Of course I’m prepared in every manner from apparel to emergency supplies. However, I also realize that I must adapt not only my lifestyle, but my skincare routine to parallel the climate around me. Ole Henriksen Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer has been a God-send. It’s an unwaveringly thick but incredibly smooth cream. I’ve been using twice daily with my regular skin-care routine. The only difference is that instead of using my standard, thinner moisturizer after serum, I use this. This Ole Henriksen Cream feels clean and doesn’t leave a sticky or oily residue. For me, the thing that sets it apart is the protection barrier it seems to create, protecting my skin from negative atmosphere and elements. Not once has my skin been dry, chapped or red while wearing this Ole Henriksen. I have also noticed the appearance of my skin looks smooth and more supple than it had prior. With regular exfoliation, it has evened the tone of my skin out. In my experience, Ole Henriksen Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer has been a standout among skincare. I would absolutely purchase this in the future. I also like to use it on the back of my hands, but because of the higher price point I try to refrain from doing it often. It’s a great moisturizer that seems to protect and even improve the look of my skin. Smooth, Supple Skin
