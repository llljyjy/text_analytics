I have medium dark circle under my eyes, so when I received this from Influenster and OLEHENRIKSEN, I was really excited to test it out. However, the result is not like I expected. The cream is absorbed quickly and easily. The smell of it is quite nice and not too strong. I feel the under eyes area is hydrated after using the cream but thatâ€™s it. It does not have brightening affect on me, so I am quite disappointed. nan
