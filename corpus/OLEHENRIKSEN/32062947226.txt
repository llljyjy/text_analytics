The new essence form Ole Henriksen has been such a joy to use. It feels like a toner but it definitely gives you the benefits of a serum. Iâ€™ve been working hard to fade away my post acne marks and this toner has been another essential product to expedite brightening up my stubborn red spots.  This was gifted by Ole Henrikesen. Great for brightening dull skin.
