I am POC so I always struggle with dark spots & hyperpigmentation. Vitamin c is my top ingredient to brighten dark spots & even skin tone. I find this Ole essence delightful to use on the skin. It has many hydrating & brightening ingredients to help even my skin tone. My skin looks glowing & hydrated after only one use. Iâ€™m impressed with this new product! I like it! Worth a try!
