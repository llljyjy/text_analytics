I’ve been using this crème nightly for about a week and I’ve seen such a difference already in how smooth and hydrated my skin is (these have been my main skin concerns recently!). My skin instantly feels more hydrated and it has such a light and creamy texture that absorbs so nicely into my skin. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone with these skin concerns Beautiful night crème
