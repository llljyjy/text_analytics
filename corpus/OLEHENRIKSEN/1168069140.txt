I have been loving this moisturizer for my dry skin, which is made worse by the Arizona desert climate. It’s thick but not heavy and is very moisturizing with a matte finish. It also smells pretty wonderful. It’s rich with peptides that strengthen the skin barrier and is gentle enough that it doesn’t sting when my skin is irritated. All in all, I recommend trying it! Feels great, smells even better!
