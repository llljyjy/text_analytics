Okay, so, if you’ve ever been subscribed to boxycharm, you know that every other month you can shop their overstock for like huge discounts, and I was browsing what they had to offer, and this was available for about $10 - and I knew this was a good brand, so I went to sephora’s site to check out the reviews. Obviously, after seeing such good reviews, I said what the heck, for such a good price I’ll get it and try it. Ended up trying it a couple hours ago and oh my LORD, I’m big on exfoliating as part of my skincare routine and yet I’ve never had anything like this. I’ve used the Ordinary’s peeling solution every once in a while for the past year or so whenever I feel like I need extra exfoliation or I’m breaking out, and I think this one is honestly superior. It didn’t leave me feeling excessively dry, my skin wasn’t red at all afterwards, and it was just super easy to use. I used to use Sunday Riley’s Good Genes before I determined that it was too expensive to keep using every night and repurchasing, and honestly, the results I saw immediately upon washing this mask off were similar to those I saw after weeks of using the Good Genes treatment nightly - meaning this is obviously a LOT more financially attainable, given the fact that this mask is meant to be used once or twice a week. Seriously, SO glad I decided to take a chance on this - I looked in the mirror after rinsing it off, and thought OMG, I look so healthy, I need to write a review!! People need to know about this!! YOOOO I DIDN’T THINK IT’D BE THIS GOOD
