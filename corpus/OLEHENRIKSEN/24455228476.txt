Loved this product!!! It is so smooth and really does an excellent job at refreshing the under eye.Perfect for an early morning routine.  I have combination skin and didn’t notice any irritation after use. I loved that it didn’t leave my face feeling oily or heavy, it lays on the skin ever so gently leaving no trace. I received this as a free sample for an honest review. I will definitely buy again! Perfect addition to your morning routine!
