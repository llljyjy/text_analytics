I honestly haven’t noticed a decrease in under eye puffiness and darkness, but!  I do love the feel of putting this lotion under my eyes. My concealer seems to apply smoother. I don’t know that I’d purchase this in the future, but I certainly haven’t minded adding it to my beauty regimen. I received this product at no charge in return for an honest review. Not bad!
