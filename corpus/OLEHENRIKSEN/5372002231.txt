Okay, so this Banana Bright + Eye Crème by Olehenriksen had me intrigued from the very beginning. It comes in a tiny 15ml jar that fits in the palm of your hand in this cute orange glass jar. Don’t be fooled by its size, this thing is weighty and justly so. I personally have issues with hyperpigmentation and after four babies some darkening under my eyes. While I didn’t notice any drastic changes in color, I have noticed skin improvement in my eye area. This eye crème goes on smooth as silk! (Make sure to apply it with your ring finger for a gentle application as the jar suggests.)   Under my eyes are visibly plumper giving me a more refreshed look weather I use it with concealer or not. I will definitely keep using this product as part of my self care routine. nan
