The texture is beautiful - creamy and rich, making it perfect for the upcoming winter months. It’s the perfect skincare routine night cap - it deeply hydrated my skin, making it feel so soft and plump, with a youthful glow in the morning. I also love that it’s a firming cream, at 40 it’s become super important for me to implement more cream textured moisturizers into my routine, especially products that work and firm up my skin! Love this cream. Beautiful night cream
