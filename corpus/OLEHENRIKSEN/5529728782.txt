The Ole Henriksen Banana Bright + Eye Cream was a really great addition to my skin care routine. I used it both morning and night. The packaging said that it’s a good base for makeup and I did feel it helped brighten up my under eye area. My dark circles did end up diminishing but not as much as I would hope they would have. It did help my under eye area appear a bit more smooth. The cream is thick and easy to apply. It takes a minute to really absorb into the skin. Overall, I’m really happy with this product. I’ve purchased this before and will continue to purchase. Great for everyday use!
