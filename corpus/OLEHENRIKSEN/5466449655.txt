This serum is very nice and smells great for those mornings where you don’t wanna get out of bed. I’ve used it for about 3-4 years and honestly, I have not noticed any difference in my skin at all. I have a few acne scars but otherwise, pretty smooth skin. So, maybe I didn’t have many problems to fix in the first place. I’ve decided that it’s time to try a new face serum that has more benefits at this time. 3-4 years, no change in skin
