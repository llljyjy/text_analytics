Hydrating formula, my skin usually reacts to creams but no reactions so far. It doesnâ€™t seem to brighten the area much long term but definitely makes the dark circles a bit less visible. Would definitely need extra coverage if you have dark circles. I have combination skin and o use this for my day and night time skincare routine . Would definitely recommend for general well being, also compared to biossance this is quite competitive. nan
