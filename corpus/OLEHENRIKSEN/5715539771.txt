This is a great eye cream option if youâ€™re looking for hydration and brightening. I have very dark circles and textured dry under eyes. This cream is a very smooth, light texture that sinks into the skin beautifully. It was not heavy or overly scented and my makeup applied great on top. I definitely noticed my under eyes looking brighter after application too! Great Eye Cream
