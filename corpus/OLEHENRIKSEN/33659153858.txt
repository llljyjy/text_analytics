I enjoy using essences for their hydrating and plumping capabilities and for allowing the remainder of my skincare to better absorb. I like this essence a lot. I am using this during nighttime and so far I can feel an immediate hydration boost. I can not say my serum and moisturizer are absorbing better for sure, but it seems like they are, as my skin is starting to remain hydrated all through the night, something that doesnâ€™t happen a lot. The thinner milky consistency is what I expect for shaking a few drops out and patting into my face. I like the cooling sensation when I apply. Overall I am liking this product tons and recommend it. nan
