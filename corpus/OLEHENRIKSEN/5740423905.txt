I have really been enjoying this eye cream. I have normal to combination skin and dark circles under my eyes. I have minor crows feet as well. The eye cream has very rich texture and the color helps to alleviate some of the darkness under my eyes. I love Vitamin-C rich skincare, as it really seems to help with dark spots and evening out my skin tone. I have used this for a month and have not noticed any difference in fine lines, but I like to use it in the morning under my makeup to help with color correction. Over all I like it, but I’m not sure if I would repurchase it after it’s empty. I do really appreciate that it has a clean formula. Great for under makeup!
