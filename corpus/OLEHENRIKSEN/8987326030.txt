I cannot rave more about this product. I saw results within 3 days. My skin was going through a phase where the texture wasn’t smooth and I have some dark spots as well. I’ve been using this product for a little over a week and my skin feels smooth and it looks like some of the dark spots are fading. It also leaves my face with a nice glow and looks hydrated, best part is it doesn’t leave it greasy. I also purchased the night serum as well. Best product out there
