So I’ve been pretty scared to use anything with vitamin c because I use a retinol every night and apparently the two aren’t supposed to be combined. However I got over my fear and started using this in my morning routine and my skin is loving it. I use a really hydrating moisturizer for winter and it’s always been great but I have some pretty stubborn dry areas and this essence has helped with them so much. I’m very pleasantly surprised. The scent is so refreshing and this gives my skin such a nice glow Will be repurchasing
