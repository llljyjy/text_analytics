I’ve been really loving the texture of this moisturizer! It makes my skin feel (and look) so supple with continued use and it also smells incredible. With continued use, it’s definitely kept my skin moisturized in this cold New England winter! I apply it on top of a hydrating serum to really double down on that benefits. I would definitely suggest this to any skin type - I’ve got pretty sensitive skin and it never burns or irritates. Definitely an Ole Henriksen product that I’d repurchase! hydration station!
