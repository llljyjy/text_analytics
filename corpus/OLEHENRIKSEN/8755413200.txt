I love this Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence!  I use it AM and PM. I shake into palms 3-4 times and then gently pat my face and neck. Then I apply serum and moisturizer. The essence instantly doubles hydration, brightens and preps skin for the rest of my routine. It absorbs quickly and has a lightweight texture. Love this essence
