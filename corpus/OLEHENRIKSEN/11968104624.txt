I really liked this moisturizer. I’m surviving winter in Chicago so I need a very rich moisturizer typically to keep my face moisturized throughout the day. I think that it’s more of a daytime moisturizer than a nighttime one for me. I think it makes the skin feel plump and dewy. I would probably repurchase on my own as a fall/winter daytime moisturizer. It doesn’t feel heavy or greasy which  is so nice. Moisturizing But Not Too Thick
