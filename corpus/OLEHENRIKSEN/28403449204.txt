OLEHENRIKSEN gifted me this essence in exchange for my honest review.This is a lightweight essence that absorbs quickly. It has many great ingredients, the main ones being, Vitamin C, Niacinamide, Hyaluronic acid, and orange peel extract. I use it in the morning and evening after face wash and toner. It definitely has been a good addition to my routine since I tend to only use vitamin c serum in the morning only so with this I can get some of the vitamin c in the night as well. Although, packaging is not a make or break for me, I do want to say this essence looks beautiful and the packaging is recyclable. It is recommended for all skin types. It is also vegan, gluten-free and cruelty-free. Beautiful inside out
