I noticed a difference within 2 weeks of using this essence. My skin appeared visibly brighter, more glowing, and had a more supple texture after using it. It absorbs really nicely into your skin, and sits well underneath other skin care products and make up. A little goes a long way with this one. The scent is delicious and not overpowering. It fades once on your skin. Highly recommend trying this one! Worth a try for brighter skin!
