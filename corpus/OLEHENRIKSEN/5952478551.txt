I love this cream so much. I’ve tried the previous version of this cream but the new formulation doesn’t even come close to the old one (in a good way). The previous version didn’t work for me, it was oxidizing and left a sticky feeling on my eyes. Not this one though. It’s extremely fast absorbing, yet nourishing and really brightening. I am a sleep deprived mama and can tell you that it really helps with this darkness under eyes from the lack of sleep. I received this product for free from Influenster and Ole Henriksen in exchange for my honest review but after I finish it, I am going to repurchase with my own money. Fast absorbing and brightening
