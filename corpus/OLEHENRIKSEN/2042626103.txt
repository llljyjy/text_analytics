I have dry skin with occasional redness and acne flare ups. I use benzaclin (clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide) and tretinoin .05% at night, which contributes to the dryness. Normally Algenist is my go to moisturizer, but I left it at the office accidentally and have been trying out my sample of this for the last three days. I use it as a morning moisturizer after washing my face and have been pleasantly surprised. It melts into my face, does not cause acne flare ups, and has a light, pleasant, fruity smell. I don’t know if I’m convinced to switch permanently, but I’m definitely considering it. I do not wear a lot of makeup and never wear foundation, so I can’t speak to how well it would work with that. nan
