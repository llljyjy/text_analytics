This is a great eye cream! First off, I love the texture/consistency - it’s a nice thicker cream, but does sink in really well so even though it’s on the thicker side, you don’t have to rub it in harshly to get it absorb like some thicker eye creams. I personally do not like watery eye creams so was thrilled with the texture of this. Secondly, it really does give your under eyes an instantly brighter look. It has almost a dewy iridescent look when you put it on.  I’ve only been using it for about 2 weeks now so unfortunately can’t speak to the long term effects, but I can confidently say it does give your eyes a brighter look upon application! It makes my face look so much fresher when I don’t want to put on makeup. Speaking of makeup, the only downside for me was that if you use only a powder on your face, the powder seems to stick to the eye cream (even though I do throughly let it dry) so you definitely need to put a light layer of foundation or tinted moisturizer on vs. just powder! Instantly brightens for a fresher look!
