Consistency is key. I found more results using this daily then trying to “apply as needed” when I had lack of sleep. The consistency is smooth and light. I recommend keeping in the fridge to aid in under eye baggage. Mild smell and a little lasts a long time. Worked excellently on fine eye lines! Highly recommend for crows feet!
