I was super excited to try this moisturizer, as I am a big fan of the brand. It’s thick, so a little goes a long way. It smells citrusy and clean. I really like using it, however I haven’t noticed any changes with my skin. I received this as a free promotional product. I’m not sure if I would repurchase. Decent staple
