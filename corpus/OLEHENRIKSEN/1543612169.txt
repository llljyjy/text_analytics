First of all, I’m SUPER picky when it comes to facial moisturizers. They are normally too thick, too thin, too much fragrance, break me out, or don’t actually moisturize? This one is a game changer. It’s the PERFECT consistency! Not too thin, but thick enough that my skin loves it! It doesn’t just sit there either, it actually absorbs. The scent is very mild but pleasant. Has a citrus smell that I love! Doesn’t break me out or cause any reactions to my sensitive skin and overall has left my face feeling smoother, more hydrated, and radiant. I also love the jar. It’s a glass jar that is functional and so pretty to look at on my vanity. I can’t wait to continue using this to see more long term results and I can confidently say I’ll be re-purchasing. AMAZING!
