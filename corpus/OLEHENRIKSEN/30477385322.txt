Okay, so first of all, this essence smells AMAZING. It smells like Orange creamsicle, and I’m obsessed. I know it’s called an “essence,” but I use it as a toner, and as a dry-skinned gal living through Midwestern winters, I love creamy toners. Using this as one of the first steps in my skincare routine, right after cleansing, has been a lovely addition. I have noticed increased hydration and moisture retention since beginning using this. Smells SO GOOD
