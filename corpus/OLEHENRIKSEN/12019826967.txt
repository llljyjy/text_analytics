This barrier booster orange ferment Essence is amazing! It contains Orange Peel extract, vitamin C and iron stem cells. The smell itself is amazing! It’s super easy to use you just passed it on to your clean face and neck. You can use it in the morning and the night. Put it on before the rest of your skin care routine. It makes my skin not only smell great but look and feel radiant. I’ve definitely gotten some compliments! Love it!
