The first time I used this I didn’t like it because I used too much which made it pill up and made my face worse. Then my friend told me about The certain acids that my face needs to get rid of my dark blemishes and this had everything. So I decided to give it a try one last time and I’m super glad I did! This time I used A tiny bit enough for my entire face but kept it a very thin layer. And I mean super thin just enough to make your face sticky. When I woke up the next morning I couldn’t believe the results and I’m very glad I didn’t get rid of it! My entire face is brighter even my darkest dark spots were light that I was dreading!!!!! So keep this in mind when using the product. A little goes a long way and it’s better to be on the safe side then putting too much. Because when I started using this product I put too much because I thought I could use a extra boost. That’s not how it works. Don’t do it LOL debating on using this on my arms because I don’t want to use up the entire product too quickly. Might just use as spot treatment on arms as well. magic!
