As a fan of Ole Henriksen. I love everything of Vitamin C.Smell is good and easy to absorb in my face. I tried 6 days ago and Iâ€™m seeing a lot of difference for my skin. Alway feel smoother, I noticed my skin was overall brighter and more radiant and as though my moisturizer was sinking in better as well. I used this product before I apply moisturizer and serum. Love it so much. nan
