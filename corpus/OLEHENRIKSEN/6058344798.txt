This!!! New holy grail! I didn’t expect much from this cream, but boy, I was wrong. It exfoliates my skin without drying it out. I literally wake up in the morning with baby soft clear skin that is radiant and hydrated. I still wouldn’t use it every night, maybe every other night but I’m really really impressed. It’s a thick yellow cream that easily spreads and gets absorbed quickly without leaving my skin greasy. Definitely going to last a while, too! Perfect in every way
