I’m not one to usually spend much on my cleansers, so I was skeptical of this one. I use my holy grail Cerave foaming wash cleanser at night, because it does remove makeup better. However, I use this one in the morning and absolutely love it! It leaves my skin feeling super soft and moisturized! It smells amazing, however if you’re sensitive to fragrance, this might not be for you. Overall, I give this cleanser a 10/10! Worth the Hype!
