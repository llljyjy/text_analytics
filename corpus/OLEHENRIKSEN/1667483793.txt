I originally got this in a subscription box and am glad I did as I probably wouldn’t have paid full price for what I thought was just another clay mask.  Would I repurchase? Absolutely.  The tube has lasted me for so long and is my favourite mask to use.  My skin is very sensitive to chemicals and acne prone causing it to break out after most masks.  This is gentle enough that it causes no reactions except my pores disappearing! (Okay, maybe they don’t literally disappear, but boy do they shrink significantly after use!) I love the minty tingle-just don’t get it in your eyes! Plus, let’s be honest, the colour is super fun and insta worthy.  Overall, a real win for my skin. nan
