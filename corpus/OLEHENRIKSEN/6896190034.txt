This moisturizer has a mild fruity scent which reminds me of starburst. The texture of the product reminds me of cocoa butter but way more lighter and comfortable on the skin. I have dry skin and usually apply a thick layer before bed. I wake up with smoother skin. Itâ€™s like I have primer on. I am really loving it. I do reapply during the day when my skin feels tight but other than that it seems to be doing a good job at hydrating my skin. I am happy that it has clean ingredients. The pretty packaging is a plus . Smooth skin
