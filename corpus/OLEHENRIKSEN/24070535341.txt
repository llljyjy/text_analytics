I absolutely loved this eye cream. It’s not thick and blends really easily under my eyes. I have dry sensitive under eyes and this is pretty hydrating. I’ve used this for over a month and it has made my skin super soft and bright. I think the color of this definitely makes it kinda like a brightener, it’s a very light banana-y color. Under my eyes I have some blue veins kinda peaking out and I know yellow ish shades counteracts blue tones so it has helped me a lot. This has the tiniest tiniest bit of shimmer so if you don’t like that then maybe you won’t like this. nan
