Wow! Even my oily skin loves it! I’m picky and have used many brands. Also worked at Sephora in the past and had an opportunity to try many products, but I could not stick to anything specific. I love how this moisturizer sets in skin and hydrates. Texture feel great while applying. Skin feels clean, but moisturized. I use acids for my acne and usually it’s hard to balance between dehydrated oily skin and super dry flaky skin, especially in the winter, so when I got this peptide moisturizer I was super exited to try and ended up using it everyday, day and night! I hope my jar will last me for some time because this stuff is great. defiantly a YES AND YES
