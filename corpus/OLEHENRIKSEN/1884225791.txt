I received a sample from Influenster  in exchange for my honest review.I’m torn on this eye creme. On one hand I think the thick texture felt substantial and spread nicely. It is moisturizing, so maybe it will be beneficial in the long run for concerns like fine lines and crows feet. My biggest concern now is tired eyes causing dark circles. While the product does seem to have a reflective quality, it didn’t seem to make my dark circles diminish or make the area look more “awake”. I also was excited when I read it’s great as a primer, however, I felt the opposite and it made my concealer in the area move all over the place. On the fence
