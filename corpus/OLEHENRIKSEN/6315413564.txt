This is a good moisturizer. I think this would work well for all skin types. Maybe use alittle less if you are oily and alittle more if dry. It sinks into the skin and does leave you greasy. I have sensitive combinations skin that is very picky about which ingredients are in products. This did not break me out more make my skin irritated. I can’t speak about long term results yet has I haven’t finished the product yet. O recieved this complimentary from influenster. I always leave honest reviews and let other know of there is anything that I dislike about a product. I like this product and recommend it to  others. Great Moisturizer
