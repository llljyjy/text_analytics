I recieved this complimentary from olehenriksen.  This is such a delicious cream that really melts so nicely into my skin despite it being a bit thick. I love how the texture kind of looks like pudding but is thicker then it. I love applying this cream as I feel it really helps firm my face but not too much that it feels too firm. Instead I still have some bounce to my skin and can definitely enjoy the suppleness it still has. I also love how dewy this cream makes my skin and how it really lasts throughout the night. Overall it is a beauty for sure. Dewy and nourished
