Love, love, love this cleanser. It has a kind of creamy texture that I initially found a little tricky to lather - what works best for me is to massage it directly onto my face, rather than try to work up a lather in my hands first - but it always leaves my skin feeling super soft, clean, and well-nourished. I also really love the scent, which is fresh and invigorating and citrus-forward, especially in the mornings, though I recognize it might not be for everyone. This is now my go-to everyday cleanser. Iâ€™m so glad I tried it. nan
