I received this complimentary from OLE Henriksen. This night cream has helped me see great results. My fine lines are going away, and I have only been using this for a couple of weeks. I use this on my heck and face area at night. It is very hydrating, and the texture is incredible. It smells so good. I really like how it transforms my skin tone. I am a big fan and when I am done with this jar I will purchase more. If I could only pick one product in the world, then it would be this Firming Night Cream. Transforming!
