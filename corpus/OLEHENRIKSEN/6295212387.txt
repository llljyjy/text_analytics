I received this product complimentary from Ole Henriksen. I love products that prep my skin for the day, especially Vitamin C ones! Using a cotton ball I apply about a nickel size amount of product to my face and neck after cleansing. Happily the product feels very refreshing to my face. Hydration is one of my main problems and I love that it instantly hydrated my skin as well as strengthens my moister barrier for the day. I also use to help the redness on my skin! Definitely recommend. Barrier Life!
