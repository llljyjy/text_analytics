I had been having issues with the skin around my eyes. Something I had never experienced before. I have combination skin and sometimes it can be very dry. I was looking for a good eye cream that would help with that. When I wear eye makeup and use makeup wipes to clean it off, I find that the skins around my eyes stings and gets really irritated. I have been using this cream for a few days now and when I have cleaned my eye makeup off I do not get that irritation! Iâ€™m so happy and my eyes look brighter! I definitely recommend! Exactly what I needed!
