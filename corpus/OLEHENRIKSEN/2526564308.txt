I absolutely love this mask! I probably use it too often but it works so well! I’ve recently gotten into using PHAs as opposed to harsher exfoliants. This mask is everything and more! It’s no IPL but I’ve seen a reduction in my post acne marks, fine lines, and textural irregularities. Plus, it imparts a nice post-facial glow! I probably use it too often, but my skin doesn’t seem to mind. It’s been a few months of using it and I’ll definitely repurchase when I run out! The one downside: the packaging. Don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the airtight pump bottle; however, I wish that I could see how much I have left in the bottle so that I know when to reorder.Overall, 5/5 stars! Love this mask and I’ll definitely continue to purchase it. In love!!
