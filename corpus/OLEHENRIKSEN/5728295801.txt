I haven’t tried many products that are considered an essence so was excited to add this to my skincare routine. I already love the Ole Hendrickson Banana Bright Eye Cream so had high hopes for this. I’ve been using it both at night and in the morning right after I cleanse. It feels super hydrating and light and I top it off with my moisturizer. The brightening effect isn’t as noticeable as it is with their banana eye cream but still pretty good! nan
