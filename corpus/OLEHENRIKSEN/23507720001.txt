Overall, I really liked this eye cream; its texture was absorbing yet moisturizing. I don’t have any crow’s feet but I didn’t notice lightening my dark circles. I took a star away because after a few days of using it I had a reaction with my moisturizer - at least I think it was with my moisturizer and it was only 1x. Overall a good eye cream. Lightens under eyes!
