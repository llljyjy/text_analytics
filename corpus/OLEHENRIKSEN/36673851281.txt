This Lemonade Smoothing Scrub has GOT to be one of my favorite purchases in a long time!!! It smells like a lemon creamsicle, which I LOVE! I usually use it twice a week and LOVE the way my face feels after! It feels like a sugar scrub and does not leave my face feeling tight, which other scrubs have done in the past. This is a great purchase! So happy I found it!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!
