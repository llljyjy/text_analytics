This essence has been the perfect way to start my day by applying and inhaling its amazing citrus scent everyday. It just wakes me up. It has a light and milky texture, gets easily absorbed into my skin, and leaves no irritation or stickiness. My skin feels refreshed and hydrated every time I apply it. I love adding this to my skincare routine. It has been a blessing for my mornings, helps strenthen my skin barrier, and brightens my face. It helps prep my face for other skincare and makeup. What a great vitamin c addition to add a layer of protection and brings a glow to my face. Wakes me up and brightens my skin
