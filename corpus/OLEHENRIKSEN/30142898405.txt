I was a little skeptical when I received this because I deal with acne and it has always been a disaster any time Iâ€™ve tried a facial moisturizer. However, this feels mora like a serum when applied to my skin than a lotion really and I think that makes all the difference. I really like this product and my skin seems to do too which is all I need! nan
