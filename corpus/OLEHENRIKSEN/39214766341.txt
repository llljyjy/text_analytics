This eye cream is great. I love that  it is unscented, rich, and creamy. You would think because it’s thick it would take time to absorb. I was pleasantly surprised that it absorbs into the skin quickly, without leaving behind any oily residue. I have had eye creams give me those little white pimple like things if they’re too heavy, or scented and this does not do that. It actually surprisingly does help with consistent use to brighten dark circle. LOVED IT
