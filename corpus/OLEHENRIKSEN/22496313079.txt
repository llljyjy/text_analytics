This is a potent 20% acid night serum that smoothes skin texture, firms, improves elasticity and targets the look of dark spots, pores, fine lines and wrinkles.  Since my skin is sensitive I only used it couple time a week using the sandwich method.  Iâ€™m excited to see those dark spot lighten, help my full skin too. The ingredients are impressive 10% AHA, Aloe Juice, and Nordic Birch Sap. Holy grail!
