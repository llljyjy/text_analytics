This is amazing!!!!! My new fav moisturizer!!!! I have really dry skin, and my only saving grace was Tatcha Dewy Skin … but after doing some research, stumbled upon Strength Trainer Peptide, and my life has changed!I’m really sensitive to new products, and I was worried I’d break out or my skin would freak out … but it’s so good, I feel like it cleared it up even more! I use it both evening and night.I even tried it under makeup to see how it lasts … and it didn’t move, crease or make my makeup slippery, it’s wonderfulDefinitely my new favorite. Give it a try! Amazing!!!!!!!
