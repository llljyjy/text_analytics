I recently received a decent size of Ole Henriksen banana bright eye cream from INFLUENSTER and I am in LIKE with it! I GENERALLY love this brand. They possess and put out products that are effective and easily affordable. The cream brightens and hydrates, it aids in anti aging.  This cream is thick, creamy and easy to apply.  I’ve been using it on my under eye area every night for about a couple of weeks now and I believe I’m seeing and feeling a difference. My eyes are brighter and is much more hydrated. I enjoy l the scent, as well, to compare the cream, it smells of caramel and banana candy. I have started using the eye cream the last couple days under my eyes  and my entire face, underneath my makeup as a moisturizer. The product itself retails around approximately $40 for 0.5oz which seems a tad expensive, BUT you ONLY need a very small amount under each eye.  With that intact, the cream will last you a long while. Bananalicious brightness
