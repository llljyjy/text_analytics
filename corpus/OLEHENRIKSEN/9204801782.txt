I got a recommendation online from one of the online assistants for this product based on my skin needs, and I have to say that Iâ€™m incredibly thankful for this product. I was looking for a more affordable toner that could help with my oiliness and hyperpigmentation, and I can already see a difference after 4 days of use! Definitely worth it if you have really oily skin and sweat a lot. nan
