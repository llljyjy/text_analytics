At first I was a tad worried it wouldn’t smell nice because of the word “fermented,“ but the scent actually reminds me of orange lip smackers. I put a drop on each cheek, forehead, and chin and glide it on with warmed rose quartz. It absorbs very nicely into the skin, leaving it feeling hydrated and plump. I even notice some tightening of the pores. I would recommend to anyone in search of a new serum! Lovely smelling serum!
