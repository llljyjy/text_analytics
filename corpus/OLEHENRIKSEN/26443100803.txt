I gave this stuff a long chance and it just never worked for me no matter the different ways I tried to use it. It smelt like oranges which is nice but I typically donâ€™t love fragrance in my skincare. When I would use this on my face I would notice that the product just would never really absorb into my skin and it would almost get gummy and fall off my face in chunks. Would not recommend and will not purchase again. Not Awesome...
