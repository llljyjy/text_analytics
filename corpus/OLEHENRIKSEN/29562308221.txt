So far I am loving this Vitamin C essence! Currently I am experiencing dehydrated, dull-looking skin and this product is refreshing to use. It has a milky consistency, but it absorbs quickly. Immediately, my skin feels hydrated and soft. Not to mention it leaves behind a beautiful, radiant glow! Beautiful glow
