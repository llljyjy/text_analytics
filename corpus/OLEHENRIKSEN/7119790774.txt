The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle was a very strong smell of an off citrus, I was going to put it back in the box and return it just on the smell because I am very picky , but I gave it a try so happy I did, one of the best toners I have used left my face glowing so soft and hydrated no oils I cannot stop looking in the mirror after one use. very strong citrusy smell
