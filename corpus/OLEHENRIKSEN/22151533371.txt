I usually only purchase very light, water cream moisturizers so when I received this product, I was a little worried it would be too thick for my skin. However, I was incredibly impressed! The texture is a little thicker but it still has the gel-like feeling to it. Itâ€™s not by any means a thick cream which I love! Would definitely recommend this moisturizer to sensitive, combination and oily skins!! Surprisingly amazing!!
