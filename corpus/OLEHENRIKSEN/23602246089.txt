The Powerful Vitamin C Essence is a  2~in~1 Watery Toner/Serum thatâ€™s made with distilled active parts of a orange-fermented orange peel extract, orange stem cells. I really do recommend this hydrating Essence. Packed with Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid & Niacinamide, smells just like oranges, illuminates and brightens My complexion, reduces the look of fine lines, strengthens the skins barrier, leaves My skin with an ultra-supple, healthy glow and plays along wonderfully with other skincare products. I love that the Essence is housed in the ombre orange glass bottle! I Highly Recommend. Highly Recommend
