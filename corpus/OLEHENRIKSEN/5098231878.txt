This product is everything my dry skin needs in the winter! Ultra hydrating gel like cream that melts right into your skin. The consistency is quite thick, so a little goes a long way. It has a nice scent that isn’t too overpowering and doesn’t linger, it reminds me of a Starburst candy. Another winner from Ole Henriksen! Mega Hydration
