I was gifted the Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence by Ole Henriksen. I have combination skin and my skin can look dull at some time. The essence is easy to apply and doesnâ€™t cause breakouts. My skin feels hydrated and visibly brighter after using it.  The essence comes in a large and nice-looking glass bottle. I am also impressed by its fresh scent. nan
