Ole Henriksen does it again! If you’re a fan of this line, this is another must try. Dewtopia is a great evening cream that gives immediately softer and smoother skin. The texture, to me, is a cross between a lightweight balm and cream making it a great option for dehydrated skin. If you’re oily, I think this is lightweight and moisturizing enough, and if you’re dry I think you’ll definitely enjoy how smoothing this is, especially when used over time. Dry skin friends may need a light layer of something more occlusive over top, but it’s really beautiful on its own too.As for firming, I can’t say it’s a miracle worker just yet as it’s too soon, BUT I am noticing improvements in my overall skin texture and suppleness which is huge. I’m a fan! A Must Try for Ole Henriksen Fans
