This is definitely a new favorite moisturizer for me. For reference, I have extremely dry skin, and this does amazing.  I haven’t been using it for the full 8 weeks yet, but I have used it every day for about a month and a half. This doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy at all and it sits under makeup wonderfully. It only takes about a dime size amount to cover my face and neck.  This is an extremely thick moisturizer, but it sinks into the skin so well. There is a subtle cutrus smell that I absolutely love. I will definitely be adding this to my buy again list. If you have dry skin, I highly recommend this product! New favorite!
