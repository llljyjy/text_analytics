Ole Henriksen gifted me their Dewtopia 5% Acid Firming Night Creme. It is creamy, as expected, and a medium thickness. It works in well and feels hydrating. It has AHAs so I make sure to use sunscreen daily, though I do that normally anyway. After additional usage it does seem to help firm. I like using it on targeted areas, like my neck. nan
