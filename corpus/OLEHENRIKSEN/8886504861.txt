This product was gifted by Ole Henriksen for free in exchange for my honest review. I myself is a fan of ferment essence such as SKII and Tatcha the essence. So this new launched product is a must try for me. Itâ€™s white milk like liquid and has a little bit orange scent. It can be absorbed very quickly. I have added it to my daily routine. worth a try
