This product was OK. I didn’t notice a difference in my dark spots. I’m dark-skinned black girl with hyperpigmentation. I used this product everyday in the morning and at night.  An employee recommended it to me but it didn’t really do much for me. i used the entire bottle before writing this review. Meh.
