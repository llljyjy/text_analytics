I’ve been wanting to add a essence to my morning routine for some time and this was a fun one to add! First off- it smells just like orange soda! It’s a milky type of consistency and definitely over did it first go around. It’s easy to pat into your face and gives a nice boost of hydration. I really like how it also focuses on protection from free radicals as well. My makeup is easy to apply on top of it after I use a moisturizer! Orangey burst of hydration
