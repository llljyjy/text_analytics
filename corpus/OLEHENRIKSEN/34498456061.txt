Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence from Ole Henriksen Itâ€™s a vitamin c essence with distilled orange. Has light weight texture and quickly absorbs into the skin. It contains the goodness of hyaluronic acid and Niacinamide which helps to hydrate the skin. Brightens the skin and gives an instant illuminating look. I am loving this essence. I have tried many Vitamin C from other brands which are cream or serum based. This one is an essence kind of toner and I always love essence. nan
