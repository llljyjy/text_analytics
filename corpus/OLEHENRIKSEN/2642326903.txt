I received this product complimentary of Ole Henriksen. Can I just begin with how luxurious and beautiful the packaging is? You get a ombre bright orange glass bottle that dispenses so easily. I am someone with sensitive acne prone combo skin and this product worked well into my routine. The essence did a great job with helping my dull skin feel brighter and dewier. It worked well with my routine of toner, essence, moisturizer before bed and in the morning. I highly recommend it for the vitamin C and brightness benefits. Beautiful and brightening
