I have a combination skin type that is on the dryer side. I have used this twice at night after I cleansed and dried my face. The formula is so smooth and luxurious. I apply this lightly all over my face and, make a note, a little goes a long way. The cream is on the oily and thicker side, however, it absorbs so nicely!  I have noticed such a difference in my skin while using this cream. With the AHAâ€™s in the product, I have noticed my skin overall looks smoother with a smoother texture and  fine lines diminishing. My skin feels so hydrated!  I love waking up with my skin feeling so soft and nourished. It sets the tone for the day! I am enthusiastic about continuing to use this to see ongoing results! I genuinely recommend it to anyone looking to up your skincare regimen! This product is well worth the investment and highly recommend you try it. You will not be disappointed!
