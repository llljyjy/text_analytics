I read all of the reviews. My skin likes Ole products so I thought I’d give this a try. This is pricey and keep in mind you are only getting 30 ml BUT  this serum is worth every friggen penny! My skin was going through a rough patch where I was breaking out and I could feel the bumps underneath my skin. Skin looked dull. Within a few days of using this,  this transformed my skin. I use only at night. I apply this serum and then I apply my moisturizer. The scent is very pleasant . Serum goes on easy and it soaks into my skin perfectly. After using it for three days I actually ordered another bottle. Brilliant product! Trust me….Don’t buy 1 bottle, buy 2!
