I received this product from Influenster for an honest review. I was pleasantly surprised at the effectiveness of this eye cream. The texture was thick enough that it felt like it was working, but wasnâ€™t greasy. I was able to apply concealer without it caking by the end of the day. My eyes feel hydrated and bright after about a month of use. Love!
