I’m really in love with this essence. It’s perfect in every ways. This is a really soothing and gentle vitamin c option that helps to brighten up my skin and leave me looking super refreshed. I love to put on in the morning to give my skin extra glow with the Vitamin C and hydration. I’ve always been a fan of Ole Heriksen so I was dying to try this! nan
