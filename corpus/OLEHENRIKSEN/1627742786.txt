I really liked this moisturizer! I have dry skin so the thick formula was totally fine for me at night, but might not be liked by those with skin on the oily side. The moisturizer really melted into my skin, and I loved the scent! It’s fruity and reminds me of something from my childhood but I just can’t put my finger on it! I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. nan
