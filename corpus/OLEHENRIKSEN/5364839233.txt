Havenâ€™t used this long enough to be able to tell if the long term effects work. However, it does instantly brighten the under eye and feels very nice when applied. It is thick but not sticky and my under eyes feel very moisturized. I have sensitive eyes and skin and did not have any adverse reactions. nan
