I received a free sample from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. After hearing about the original formula causing skin irritation I was curious to try the new & improved version of this eye cream, which for me, caused absolutely no tingling or irritation whatsoever. I love this cream so much that I use it as part of my day and nighttime routine. But despite the original complaints, I must say this product has made a complete 180 and given the majority of the reviews, people are loving it. It’s reformulated into a more effective, gentler, fragrance-free iteration that has met all of my expectations in an eye cream. First off, I’m impressed with the yellow-tinted effect of the banana powder (banana is not an ingredient) that’s infused in it. I’ve learned that this ingredient is what brings a luminous attraction under my eyes. It’s supposed to be a light color-corrector on dull skin which I’ve already noticed (after 10 days of use) has brought an evener skin tone.Lastly, the vitamin C ingredient is what really seals the deal on my 5 star rating. As a strong antioxidant that promotes collagen production, it’s upgraded my dark circles/discoloration to being hardly noticeable and will get even better with continued use. Vitamin C CAN cause skin irritation in some individuals and if it doesn’t go away after a few uses then it’s recommended to discontinue use.The texture is rich and creamy which has given me the hydration my under-eye skin needs and the luminous brightness (which decreased discoloration) I was not expecting.  I’m so glad this sample was given to me because I doubt I would have found it otherwise. Effective Formula
