This OLEHENRIKSEN essence quite watery it’s easy to spread across larger areas like your neck and collar bones too.The product has a light scent, very fresh smelling. I have sensitive skin, but nothing in this product breaks me out at all. I use it after cleansing, as the first of two toners and I gently pat it onto my face and neck. Immediately feels hydrating and gives a slight glow. Great to use as a part of a glowy skin routine. I add it to my OLEHENRIKSEN gamme. I’m in Love
