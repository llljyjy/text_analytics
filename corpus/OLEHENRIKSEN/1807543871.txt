I really wanted to love this moisturizer but unfortunately, it is not for me. It feels great; it’s lightweight but moisturizing and soaks in nicely, however, it does not sit under my makeup nicely. It pills up and I figured out why: thought very low on the list, this product contains silicone and my skin is VERY sensitive to silicones. They almost always make my makeup pill up. So back to my DE protini moisturizer for me. I’ve used that for years and just wanted to try something new but alas, I should have known not to mess with my tried and true. “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.“ Not for me, has silicones
