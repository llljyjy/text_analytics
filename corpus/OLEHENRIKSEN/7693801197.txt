I’ve used this product for about 2-3 weeks and it has given my face a glowy and moisturized look that my dry patches and some hyperpigmentation has gone away and lightened up. This has a strong orange smell - but I really like it. This plays well with my other skincare products and is a lot better than the Tatcha essence which I thought did nothing to my skin even after having used it up. I always look forward to applying this everyday because of the smell and because I know that it treats my skin’s dryness and dark spots. zesty, fresh smell and helps with dark spots
