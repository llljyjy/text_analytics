I received this product for free to review! I love it. I haven’t had a peptide moisterizer in a while and this one is so nice. It’s smooth and creamy and feels cooling on your face. It’s not too heavy so it’ll be perfect for all seasons. It also wears nicely under makeup. Would love to purchase in the future. Great!
