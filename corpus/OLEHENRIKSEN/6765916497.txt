The first impression for this Banana Bright eye crème is the small size jar with the orange color. It’s small enough for you to bring it to everywhere so you can use it. And the color help you don’t loose it. This crème has the smooth texture and light, really good to use during summer. Also in the ingredients have collagen and vitamin C which are really help to reducing the look of fine lines and wrinkles. I took one star off because it makes my eyes watery after each use. I have the black eyes issue, after few weeks to use, it dose helps to reduce the color. Smoothe texture eye crème
