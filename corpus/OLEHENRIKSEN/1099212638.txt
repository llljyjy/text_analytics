I received complimentary from Ole Henriksen This is a Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence boost of Vitamin C! It is milky texture essence! I tried two methods, one is to pour it directly on my hand and then pat on the face. The other method is to pour it on a cotton pad and rub it on the face!  I like this kind of method better my face feels more clean! It absorbed quickly! Not greasy! I also pour this toner into the compressed mask paper and put it on my face for 5 minutes! It doesnâ€™t feel any  irritation! Very gentle! So comforting and soothing! I can feel my skin is more hydrating, brighting and glowing! I follow the instructions, I appiled it after cleanser and toner before serum and moisturizer!  it can be using in the morning and night time routines, At the morning time routine must follow with sunscreen product at the last step! My skin has a bit of acne marks. I look forward to keep using it to reduce more of my acne marks! Great Vitamin C essence
