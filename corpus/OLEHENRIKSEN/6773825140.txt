This is by far my favorite scrub. Iâ€™ve been struggling with really bad dry skin this winter and I knew I needed to add an exfoliant in. This stuff has been great. I also switched up my daily moisturizer too and the combo has worked wonders. The lemon scrub leaves your face feeling fresh and smooth. Not harsh at all. Love this!!
