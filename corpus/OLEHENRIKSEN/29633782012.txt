I received the Dewtopia 5% Acid Firming Night Cream from Ole Henriksen to review. This treatment utilizes both Glycolic & Lactic Acid (AHAâ€™s) to loosen and lift dead skin cells overnight, revealing more even toned, smooth skin by morning. Over time, it also helps to minimize hyperpigmentation, fine lines, & wrinkles. Edelweiss Stem Cell also helps with firming.  Shea Butter, rich in both Essential Fatty Acids & vitamins, acts as an emollient to lock in hydration & nourishment. This night cream is excellent when used alongside the rest of my skin cycling routine. Admittedly, I think this might be a bit too strong for me to use nightly, but someone with skin more accustomed to higher percentages or frequency of AHA would likely not be bothered by it. Absolutely recommending Dewtopia for gorgeously glowy, smooth, & soft skin! Perfect for skin-cycling!
