I tried this daily cleanser from Olehenriksen for the first time ever recently, the mini size has lasted me 2 months to my surprise and I use it once a day. What I like about it is the scent, its invigorating. Itâ€™s non stripping and washes away excess dirt, makeup, and surface oils on the skin. I bought it because I needed a face wash with an awakening scent and this was good for that. I recommend. nan
