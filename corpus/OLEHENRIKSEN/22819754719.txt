First I want to disclose that I did receive this product for free from Influenster for my honest review. When applying this the first thing you notice is that it is VERY hydrating. My under eyes look and feel hydrated since using this product. I also noticed how much my under eyes appeared brighter immediately after applying. This also works amazing under your concealer. I have only been using this for about 21 days so as far as fine lines Iâ€™ve noticed a slight improvement I did not have dark bags under my eyes to begin with to notice any type of improvement in that area. Immediately brightens the eye area
