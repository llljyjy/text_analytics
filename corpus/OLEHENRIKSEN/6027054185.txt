I received this product complimentary from Ole Henriksen in exchange for my honest review, and I think this is a great night cream. I enjoy using it once or twice a week, when I want an acid to aid in firming, smoothing, and reducing fine lines/wrinkles. I think what sets this cream apart from other acid products I’ve tried is that it’s hydrating enough to not irritate my extremely dry skin. It’s so easy to go overboard with acids, and this product is the perfect way to incorporate AHAs in my routine! Perfect way to incorporate AHAs for Dry Skin!
