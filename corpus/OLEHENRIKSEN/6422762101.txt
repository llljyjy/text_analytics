I absolutely love this essence! It’s a very nice and convenient way for me to add hydration to my skin, while also adding the benefits of vitamin c and fermented ingredients. I use it after washing my face and before applying any serums and it is not sticky or tacky and blends very well with the rest of my routine. Let me say that overall my skin is in fairly good condition but somewhat lacks glow and I feel it may be dull, but on the days I use this essence I feel that my skin is very nourished and supple. I use it twice a day and can tell that while I feel hydrated my skin isn’t oily which is a huge plus for me! I’d definitely recommend this to any of my friends and would repurchase in the future myself when I run out. My new holy grail!
