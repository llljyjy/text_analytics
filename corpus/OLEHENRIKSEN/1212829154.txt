I had never tried Ole Henriksen products before, but I am sold! This cream has been a lifesaver this winter, it has kept my skin moisturized and feeling healthy. If you’ve ever tried Saturday Skin’s Glacier Water cream & wished it was thicker, this will be the perfect product for you - it even has the same refreshing, almost minty tingle when applied. It doesn’t feel greasy at all either - just an overall wonderful product! Refreshing & Moisturizing
