Best product for a glass skin on woman over 40. I am 42. I only use l ascorbic acid as vitamin C in AM so I am not using this product to get my skin vitamin C. Though, if you put make up on and want anything close to a glass skin (or even without make up), omg this product does the job. It gives a glass skin not looking greasy at all and not feeling greasy. Your skin won’t be sticky at all. It also makes me look 10 years younger. Routine: I clean my skin in am with 2 steps korean way + little gentle chemical exfoliant, then I use t.m….s vitamin C 20%, then korean broad spf, then this wonderful serum from Ole Henriksen and then I add a light moisturizer on top. Not too much. I then apply Tatcha primer on my fine lines and pores (minimal as possible), then a cushion korean make up with spf or Nars radiant foundation. If you want even a more dewy look, use Tatcha dewy skin cream as moisturizer instead (a little-no need much or will be greasy), but not mandatory. You will look many years younger if you remain light and natural with your make up… please never discontinue this product!!!  P.S: this product is not good for people sensitive to fragrance as there is fragrance. nan
