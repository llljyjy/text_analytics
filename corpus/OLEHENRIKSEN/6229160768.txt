Barrier Booster Ferment Essence from Ole Henriksen is a Vitamin C essence that brightens, hydrates, and protects the skin against pollution and free radicals.Used as the first step after cleansing, apply a few drops into your hands and gently pat on the skin. This essence has a water consistency that is lightweight and absorbs quickly. There’s a sweet orange fragrance that dissipates quickly. The packaging is a frosted glass bottle with a plastic lid. I’ve been using this for a week, so it’s not enough time to see significant changes. It plays well with the other essences layered on, and I look forward to seeing if this brightens my skin over time. Brightening Essence
