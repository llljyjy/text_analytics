My Ole Henriksen Strength Trainer Moisturizer couldn’t have came at a better time. During the winter my skin gets so dry. This winter is the worst! For some reason every morning I wake up with a flaky nose. I desperately needed something to help me with this problem. The Ole Henrisken Strength Trainer Moisturizer really helped! If I put it on before bed and in the morning I no longer have a flaky nose. It really gives my skin the moisture that I need. It’s also light weight with a nice smell. It doesn’t make my skin feel oily at all. It gives my skin a nice smooth feel that makes it very easy to add to my every day skin care routine. I think the packaging is ok... I do always have on nails so it is a bit hard for me sometimes but that’s for the ladies with nails to keep in mind. It is a bit on the pricey side for a moisturizer, but like I say if you can afford it try it! Life saver
