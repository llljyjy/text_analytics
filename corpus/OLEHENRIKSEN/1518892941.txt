I received this product to sample and review. I tried it out for a few days to give my honest feedback. The cream smells good and is very subtle. It applies smoothly and feels silky. It makes my skin feel moisturized and supple. I can see a difference over the past couple days that my skin elasticity has improved and it looks moisturized. Itâ€™s not over shiny and it goes well underneath my makeup. I do like the ingredients in this and enjoy that it has vegan peptides and collagen. I can honestly say I would buy this product and implement in my daily skin routine. I highly recommend! I am a fan!
