I love this essence! Iâ€™ve never used one before and now I love adding one in my skincare routine! I use this product after my toner and it feels so amazing! The scent is slightly orangey but super refreshing and makes my skin feel nice and balanced and ready for the rest of my skincare. I then apply my serums and moisturizers and I feel it helps to apply them evenly and stay feeling hydrated! Amazing Essence!
