It’s soo nice! It’s something in between a serum and a tonic, very lightweight but gives my skin some moisture. They are advising to use it after the toner and before the moisturiser but on some days I just use this essence alone and it feels good. Oh and I love the smell! It smells like fresh orange juice! Loved it so much
