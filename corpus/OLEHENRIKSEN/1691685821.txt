I did not care for this product at all. The texture was really tacky and I saw no results. I’ve had really bad experiences with vitamin C serums and I was hoping that this would be the product that changed my mind, but now I’m convinced they’re not for me. I’m going to focus on exfoliating. Not worth the hype
