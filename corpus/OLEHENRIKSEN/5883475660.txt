I really enjoy using this in my daytime skincare routine. It smells like a delicious orange and gives my skin that much needed vitamin c glow. It is the perfect skin prep before the rest of my routine. I noticed that my skin looked clearer and brighter and also felt softer after about a week of using this.  This essence basically checks all the boxes of what I want in an essence and I highly recommend. Highly Recommend
