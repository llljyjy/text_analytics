I received this cream complimentary from Ole Henriksen.  This Ole Henriksen cream is a powerful, visibly retexturizing night cream to intensely hydrate, smooth, visibly even skin tone, and reduce the look of fine lines, wrinkles, and dark spots. It moisturizes really well ans helps reduce dullness adding brightness to my face.  It also has aha which gently exfoliates my skin with 5% acid but.  Not sure about the firming effect, though maybe it will take longer to notice.  I have been using it for 30 weeks. Great night cream
