I received this product complimentary for my honest review. I started using this eye créeme on mid July and it’s September and I still have product left.The consistency is this thick-ish cream that spreads like butter. It has no scent A+ for that. You under eyes will thank you for adding this to your routine. Im a mom of 4, I need products to help me with my tired looking face.Well, this cream did that, it instantly make my tired under eye look brighter and not only that it preps my under eye beautifully for concealer. It plays so well with concealer that you can mix your concealer with it for an even brighter look. See picture attached. This will be a staple step in my day and night routine. Thank you OleHenriksen, Influenster and Sephora. Just Buy It!
