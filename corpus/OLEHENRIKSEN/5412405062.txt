something about this moisturizer just doesnt sit right with me... i think its the light citrus smell, which actually smells quite pleasant. the issue i have is that I generally associate citrus/acidic with drying out. i have dry/dehydrayed skin and this is a lightweight lotion... something i imagine would suit an oily skinned consumer better. it doesnt seem to target fine lines or wrinkles but i continued to use it daily for a few weeks. my skin might be stronger? i honestly cant tell. not ideal for dry skin
