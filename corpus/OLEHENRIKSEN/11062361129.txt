I have been using this moisturizer for a few weeks now so I can give a very honest review. I have to say to me it’s not extremely hydrating for my dry skin and I desperately need hydration especially during the winter. However, it does moisture my skin just not to my liking. It gives a shine in the beginning but it fades. After I’m done with this bottle I will go back to using my Tatche Dewy because that gives MOISTURE and HYDRATION that I need. nan
