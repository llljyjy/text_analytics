This moisturizer is a must have in your skin care!! I love the texture of it, feels very light on the skin. It also has several great benefits to your skin. I have oily skin and it still worked great for me. I love the fact that it has hyaluronic acid, itâ€™s vegan, contains peptides and amino acids. It definitely had my skin looking great, that I had to tell my mom to test it out as well! Definitely repurchasing this! A must!
