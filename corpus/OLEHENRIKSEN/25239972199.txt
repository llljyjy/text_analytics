I received this product complimentary from Ole Henriksen in exchange for my honest review.I have been testing this face cream for about two weeks now. I have dry, sensitive skin and am a regular skincare user. My typical routine includes an AHA acid (I usually use mandelic acid and this product contains lactic and glycolic acids) that I alternate with retinol use in my nighttime routine. While testing this product, I discontinued my other acid treatment, retinol, and night cream. I was initially a little hesitant to replace 2 products (acid and night cream) with one, especially because I like my face creams to be eye-safe and I wasn’t sure about acid in the eye area.This cream was such a pleasant surprise! This is my first Ole Henriksen product and I was immediately impressed with how good it smells. On application, I did get a little bit of stinging that disappeared after about 30 seconds. I found it to be gentle enough to use in the eye area. After the first night, my skin was noticeably smoother! I have had a lot of dry patches recently as the seasons change, so it was jarring to wake up and feel smooth and hydrated skin.  I’m so impressed with this product and I’m excited to continue using it in the future. Worth the hype
