Ole Henriksen gifted me their new Dewtopia 5% Acid Firming Night Creme.. and oh my gawshh, I love love love it! The beautiful pastel banana color, and the rich silky consistency is so luxurious & nice! My makes my face feel so incredibly nourished & hydrated, and I wake up to noticeably glowier, more radiant skin. It performs great with the other products in my collection, and is full of amazing ingredients! I would absolutely recommend this product! That dewy, radiant glow!!
