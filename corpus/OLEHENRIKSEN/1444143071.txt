[Gifted] This is my first product from the brand and I am really enjoying it so far! The packaging is so pretty and the product is easy to incorporate into my routine. It smells very citrusy and leaves my skin with a slightly cooling feel (I’m not sure if that’s normal but that’s how I’ve felt when I used it). I can’t wait to see the long term effects of using the product! nan
