It has milky consistency and absorbs instantly in my skin..It hydrates my skin without leaving any sticky residue..It has definitely reduced dark spots marks on my face..It works perfectly well with my moisturizer..Overall I am impressed with the amazing hydration that it provides to my skin..and oh my god it smells amazing... nan
