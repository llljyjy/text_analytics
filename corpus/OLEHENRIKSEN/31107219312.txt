I am completely obsessed with this essence! It smells amazing. This is now my favorite step in my skincare routine am and pm. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin dealin feeling soft and refreshed without any stickiness left behind like some vitamin c products. This is also hydrating and I love that it helps to protect my skin. I shared this with my mom and she is now obsessed too. Smells amazing
