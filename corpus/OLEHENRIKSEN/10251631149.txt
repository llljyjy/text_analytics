This is a great nigh-time moisturizer. After applying my actives, my final step is this. There is no weird scent and the texture is soft and glides on the skin without effort. You do have to dig at it very lightly in order to get the product. I have been using it for about a month and I do appreciate the moisturizing effects and my skin texture is looking less bumpy and fine lines are less visible. Will definitely buy again, unless the brand comes up with something else more amazing lol. nan
