My skin is very dehydrated but still gets oily in the t zone, but after using this essence my skin feels softer and more hydrated. I really like how lightweight this essence feels, it doesn’t make me more oily just provides the hydration I need. I like that it has fermented orange peel extract, orange stem cells and vitamin c as well as niacinamide and hyaluronic acid. The only complaint I have is I wish it didn’t contain Parfum/Fragrance*, Citral, Limonene, and Linalool. They all can cause irritation if you have sensitive skin and limonene can cause allergic contact dermatitis and counts as a frequent skin sensitizer. I would rather the product not have a scent rather than risking my skin to be sensitized or irritated. If that’s not a concern for you then definitely give this essence a try. Good essence
