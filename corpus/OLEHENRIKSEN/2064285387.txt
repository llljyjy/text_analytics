This is the first time for me to try any Ole Henriksen product. I don’t usually use eye cream due to severe sensitivity. I surprisingly didn’t have a reaction. The product itself is very nice. It goes on smoothly and immediately brightens the eyes. It’s a great product to use prior to makeup and I feel it helps my makeup last longer. I will be using this product in the future! Very brightening
