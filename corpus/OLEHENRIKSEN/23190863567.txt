The Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence is absolutely amazing.  The packaging is phenomenal as it is glasslike and preserves the product brilliantly.  I love the detailed clear instructions of how to use the product as it is easy to read and understandable.    The essence smells amazing with its unique orange fresh scent as it enlivens the skin after it being cleansed and dry.  Application of product is easy and extremely beneficial for the skin as it contains ingredients that enhance the skin before application of other products.  This formula is amazing and my skin loves and thirsts for it.  I highly recommend and love the product overall. Beautiful Performance and Packaging!
