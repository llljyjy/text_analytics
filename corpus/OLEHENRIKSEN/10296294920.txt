This is the first olehenriksen product I’ve tried. First impressions was it felt a tad bit to heavy on my skin, and left a sticky feeling on my face. My skin is on the more oily side so I didn’t really have high hopes after trying this out. Not the best essence I’ve tried, but it’s not the worst either. Meh
