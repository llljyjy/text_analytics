if you’re thinking all of these reviews could be bs - please just rely on this one. I was in Sephora and was getting a lot of irritation around my nose and mouth lines, and asked a worker what I should use or what is causing it, and she explained it could be a lack of vitamin C, which I have never had in my skincare, and i’ve been having this irritation for YEARS. She showed me a few items and one of them was this product, so i grabbed it in the gift box, with the eye cream and serum and all of them are my favorite, but this C-Rush Creme beats it all. I instantly noticed a difference, and it is so so moisturizing it’s unbelievable. It keeps me nice and glowy but also dries very evenly so its not giving me that oily look at all, and I wear it day and night. If you are looking for a new moisturizer to just try at least, you need to pick this up. Im not kidding. My irritation will still come and go, but this only happens when IM NOT WEARING THIS, or I need to apply more and if I don’t use my BHA. grab this product. Just reach the bottom of it, and purchasing it again until anything that beats it. PLS  JUST TRY IT.
