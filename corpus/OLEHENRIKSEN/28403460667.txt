This cream was amazing! I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. As soon as I opened the jar it had a very light fragrance which I greatly appreciate it. The cream is thick and a little bit goes a long way. It kept my skin moisturized all day long and I feel like it got rid of the little fine lines on my forehead that I was just starting to develop. My friends noticed and thought I actually had some Botox done. I told them that it was the cream. This has been the best moisturizer I have ever used. I did not change anything else in my skin care routine while using it. I went out and bought another one from Sephora because I really loved it that much. Every time I put it on it smells like citrus which I really love in the morning. I recommend anyone that wants to improve the texture and the feel of the skin on their face to go and purchase this cream. This is part of my skin care routine for now on. Best Moisturizer Ever!
