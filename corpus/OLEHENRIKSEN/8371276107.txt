I loved it.  Excellent hydration.  It does NOT leave you a heavy face.  Smells good.  Grape or fresh.  It does not cause breakouts.  It leaves a nice glow on your face.  Works great with my sunscreen.  It’s a lightweight daily moisturizer.  I don’t think it’s ideal for the evening.  I highly recommend it.  Super good packaging.  I get it from influenster for an honest review. Excelent
