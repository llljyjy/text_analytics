Ole Henriksen recently gifted me this Dewtopia night cream. This night cream contains lactic acid and glycolic acid, which exfoliate the skin and make it less textured; these ingredients reduce the size of pores and fine lines. I have used it every second night for the past ten days. I wake up to smoother and glowing skin every time I use it.  I like the smell of the cream and the luxurious texture. It applies smoothly and absorbs pretty quickly. It does give a little tingly sensation at the beginning but does not cause any irritation or redness. I will keep using it to see long-term results. Great night cream with actives
