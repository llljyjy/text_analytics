This is a thicker cream, perfect for night time since it contains exfoliating ingredients! I love using AHAs and the 5% concentration in this cream is perfect for everyday use. I don’t love that it contains citrus essential oils, I didn’t personally have any irritation but I don’t think they’re great to paid with potentially irritating AHA ingredients, so just wanted to flag for anyone with sensitive skin! Very gentle for everyday but contains citrus oils
