This product was really nice. It was thin yet provided a lot of moisture. I felt like it was instantly brightening but I can tell over time it is going to help. I didn’t have any issues with irritation or breaking out. No burning or dryness either. The smell is a fresh citrus so if you’re sensitive to fragrances you may not like this. Ole always has stunning packaging as well - this is a nice sturdy glass bottle! Loved it Lovely essence
