This is nice and hydrating. I love that it now has no fragrance.  It’s intended for use under makeup- on that count, it’s not great. Initially, it seems to make concealer go on smoothly, but then the makeup starts breaking down quickly. I think the oils in this product are the reason it breaks down concealer. It’s nice and temporarily brightening on its own and it’s something I can use before bed, too. It’s non-irritating compared to other vitamin C products. Overall, a great eye cream. I received this from Influenster. Great eye cream- just not under makeup.
