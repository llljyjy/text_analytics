AMAZING! I’m a mom of four and now in my early 40’s. I’ve tried sooo many different products and spent a lot on money for items that didn’t work. This product is a lifesaver! After just 1-2 uses I got compliments of how my skin looked so clean and was glowing. I have fine lines, age spots now and over dullness. This is my new go to. Only advice is to work your way up to frequent applications. I got so excited I started using everyday and at first it was a little too strong. I’m not complaining, but it’s a watch out of you are planning to use daily right away. Smells amazing not sticky and works miracles overnight. Worth every penny and then some! Miracle In A Bottle!
