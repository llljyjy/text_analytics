This cream feels quite gentle on the eyes but has a nice brightening effect! The color is slightly yellow/orange, to brighten a bit upon application. As with most skin care products, the real results will come through after using it for a few days.The only thing to note is this does have vitamin c so if you have sensitive skin Iâ€™d recommend a patch test as usual beforehand.The brand gave me this cream in exchange for an honest review. Great brightening cream!
