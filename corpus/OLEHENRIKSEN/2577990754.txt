I was thrilled to receive this under eye brightening creme for the constant dark circles under my eyes and it did not disappoint! I don’t wear much makeup on a daily basis and it made such a difference brightening up my face. I did try it under makeup too and it went under with no problems but I felt like it didn’t appear as brightening under makeup. I will definitely continue to use this in my morning routine! I received this product for free for an honest a review. nan
