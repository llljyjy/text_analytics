I really love this moisturizer! I have combination skin and don’t find that it makes me too oily. It doesn’t clog my pores or make me break out either. It is a thicker cream moisturizer but it almost feels kind of jelly like, the texture is so strange but satisfying at the same time. It makes my skin feel really nice. I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. New fave moisturizer!
