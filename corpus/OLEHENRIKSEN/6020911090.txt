I’m struggling to like this as much as I liked the Night Transformation gel that has apparently been disconinued and replaced with this. I find this to be sticky with an unpleasent smell and it doesn’t do nearly as much good for my skin as it’s predecessor. The Night Tranformation gel was my HG and I had hoped to use it forever, but now I’ll need to search for something new. This unfortunately doesn’t cut it. I’m glad everyone else likes it. But I do not and I won’t be buying it again. Not Nearly As Good as It's Predecessor
