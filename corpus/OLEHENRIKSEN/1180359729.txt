I have combination skin with my under eyes typically being being dry and dark circles. This cream automatically gives me hydration that I need so that my concealer applies smoothly. Also very helpful when I don’t feel wearing any makeup and helps brighten my under eyes. I was never really an eye cream type of person but it’s not a staple in my daily routine that I can’t live without. Thank you Ole Henriksen for this awesome Banana Bright Eye crème. Love it!!
