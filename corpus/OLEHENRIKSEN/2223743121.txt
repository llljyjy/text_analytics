Yes, this is definitely a night cream. It’s thick, and you can definitely feel it on your skin after you applied it. It’s not like you massage it in and it just absorbs fast, it’s almost oily feeling. If you like heavy night creams this is it. On my dry skin I can just use tuny amount otherwise it feels heavy. Truly a night cream
