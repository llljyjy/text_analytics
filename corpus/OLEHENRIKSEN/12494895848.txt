I bought this as part of a gift set last Christmas and have only been using this in earnest this past three months. I can confidently say it’s a staple of my morning routine. I use it after splash of toner or Fresh kombucha essence, and I love how this product makes my skin plump and glow from within. I also love that the vitamin C acts as double protection against the sun under my sunscreen! Because I have dry skin, I’ve been using Ole’s matching VitC gel crème over top, and find this a perfect base for my makeup. It has never pilled for me. I am not sure I understand the very negative ratings, but perhaps it’s skin type? For ref - I’m Asian, early 40’s, with dry skin that’s prone to breakout. This product is perfect. In fact, I’m writing this because I came on to buy another bottle, and wanted to share my experience given the other negative reviews. I’m not paid for this! My AM routine staple
