I really love this eye cream. It does so well at night and in the daytime under makeup. I have pretty dark circles but this little magic in a jar does so well at brightening all around the eye. My eyes are sensitive and I had no issues with this at all. It also helps me use less concealer which is awesome. I tried the Summer Friday cream and this is better. Itâ€™s much creamier and better at brightening. Hydrating and Brightening
