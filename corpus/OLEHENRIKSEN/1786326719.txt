I’ve never really used eye creams regularly before, but after receiving this item, I am hooked! I’ve found that whenever I did try eye creams, I would develop milia here and there, but this product hasn’t given me any issues. With skin care products like these, prevention is always key so I’m glad I’m starting sooner than later! It absorbs nicely and smells great when I’m applying. I haven’t used it long enough to see a huge noticeable difference, but it leaves my under eye looking/feeling great so I’ll definitely keep using it and will probably even repurchase!
