iâ€™m always eager to try products that has vitamin c because i get hyperpigmentation from acne scars. first off, i love how moisturized and rehydrated my skin feels after using this product. the product itself is lightweight and absorbs relatively quickly. ole henriksen has become one of my favorite skincare brands!! nan
