(Complimentary from Influenster in exchange for honest review) I have been using this product for about 2 weeks. I love it! It smells really good and is so thick! It really feels like a lotion for your face but not in the greasy way. It really moisturizes and has made my face so much better. Look at my before and after. I also have very sensitive skin and lots of allergies and this didnâ€™t bother me it soothed my face and took care of dry skin fast. Miracle in A bottle
