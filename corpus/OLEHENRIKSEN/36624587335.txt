This product saved my skin. . I’ve been struggling with acne for YEARS. I have very acne-prone skin. I get a new pimple almost every day and it seemed like there was never a time I didn’t have a pimple on my face. Acne leaves super dark blemishes/scars on my face. I do believe my acne is partly genetic - another reason may be stress from college and not getting enough sleep. I’ve tried all different types of moisturizers and cleansers. nan
