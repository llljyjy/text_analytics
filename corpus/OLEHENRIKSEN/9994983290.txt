I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now and I really love it. It feels so soft, creamy, and does not feel heavy at all. The color of the crème even blurs some of my dark discoloration. I have dark circles and fine lines and I truly have noticed a difference in the appearance of both. I have very dry under eyes and this keeps them moisturized all day! I will definitely be purchasing this product when I run out. Also, a little bit goes a long way. This crème does not have a scent either. Love ❤️
