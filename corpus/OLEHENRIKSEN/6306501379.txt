I’ll admit that when I first received this product, I was scared. Not because of the brand or anything, but because I’ve finally found a routine that was working for me and to add something new to it just to test it out wasn’t a task I was wanting to jump for joy for. However, after giving it a try, I can honestly say that it’s not bad. It adds the perfect amount of moisture to my skin. It doesn’t make it feel too oily or anything. That’s just me though, someone with oily skin may feel differently. I have a combination skin type. nan
