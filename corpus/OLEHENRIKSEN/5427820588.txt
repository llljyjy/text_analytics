I received this product for free from Influenster and OLEHENRIKSEN  in exchange for my honest review.I’ve been testing the Banana Bright+ Vitamin C Eye Crème for a few weeks now and have some thoughts. It’s a nice medium thick cream but absorbs quickly and does not interfere with SPF or makeup. I have personally found that I like this best as my morning eye cream. I like something thicker and more hydrating at night. Some people may like it for both. I never tried the original formulation of this eye cream but like it pretty well. I can’t say I’ve seen noticeable differences but it works as well as most eye creams for me. Nice enough…
