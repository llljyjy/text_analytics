I love the texture. It’s smooth but not too thick. It seems to be working but I can’t tell a huge difference (it’s only been a couple weeks). I would definitely purchase again though. I’ve used a vitamin c cream in the past that gave me a rash so I thought my skin didn’t like vitamin C but this product has been fine. Great!
