I’m not sure what it is about this product but my skin has never felt this soft! I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. The texture is very unique: it’s a thick, custard like water gel. It smells very light, zesty/citrusy. It goes on very silky and absorbs pretty quickly. I love that it does not leave a greasy or tacky residue behind. You’re just left with super moisturized, radiant, soft and supple skin! Even though it’s texture is thick, it spreads easily and quickly melts into the skin. I highly recommend this product! amazing!!
