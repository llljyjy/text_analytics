I have noticed such a difference in my skin’s radiance and texture since purchasing this scrub. My skin is sensitive, dry, and acne-prone, but this wash doesn’t irritate it at all, and my skin definitely seems clearer with fewer breakouts. The exfoliants aren’t too harsh, and my face feels super soft after I use it (about twice a week). Will definitely repurchase once I run out! Love it!
