I love this Moisturizer. I recieved this complimentary to test out on my dry skin. I live in Ohio where the air is cold, but most of all dry. Our winters always take a toll on my skin. This Moisturizer is thick but not greasy at all. My skin soaks it in and feels so plush and plump afterwards. I have been using it day and night for almost a month and I’m in love. I’m also almost out. I will be repurchasing because my skin has felt “normal“ instead of dry since I started using it. Come summer, however, I will probably only use it at night because it is so thick and hydrating. I recommend this for my fellow dry skin gals. She thiccc... but not greasy!
