Love this brand but feel lukewarm about this product! I’m in general pretty sus about eye creams — this one feels hydrating and layers well, but doesn’t feel particularly brightening. Lovely consistency. The vitamin C is a great addition though and sets the eye cream apart from others on the market. Would buy again! nan
