I got 2 free samples of dewtopia with my sephora orders to try out. Im used to using acids so it didnt even sting/tingle at all. Smelled awesome like lemon pie filling. Unfortunately it also felt like putting lemon pie filling on ur face and leaving it there. It’s so sticky. Never dries. Both times i tried this i washed face first and didn’t put anything on skin after applying dewtopia and it still never dried. My face was sticking to my pillow all night long cuz of this goop(and no it wasn’t cuz of temp i keep room temp at 68 at night). I didn’t notice any real difference after using this product twice. I wouldn’t recommend dewtopia. If u want to use it anyways i strongly suggest putting it on early evening and only leaving it on for few hours then washing it off before bed. nan
