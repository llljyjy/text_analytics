As a busy momma my main skincare concerns are my fine lines and wrinkles! The struggle is real! I have combination skin and I have been using this cream in my nighttime routine. So far so good! I love the creamy texture and even though it is thick it still feels lightweight! I can tell immediately that my skin is more hydrated and overall looks healthier. With a natural glow! I definitely plan on continuing to use it and see what results can be after using it longer! I do enjoy using this cream and would recommend it! nan
