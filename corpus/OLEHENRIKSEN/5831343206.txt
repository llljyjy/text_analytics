This moisturizer has been a godsend for my dry, sensitive winter skin. It is packed with amazing ingredients like Mango Seed Butter, Niacinamide, Eight Amino Acids, Three Ceramides, Eight Peptides, and more to strengthenand fortify the skin barrier. The texture is thick and nourishing, while still spreading easily across the skin.A little goes a long way, genuinely a pea size amount is all I need for my face and neck. It doesn’t 100% fully absorb into my skin, but I love the finish it leaves as it makes my skin feel so protected and comforted. The product claims to have a Balm to Gel texture and I mostly agree with that; the texture definitely transforms from a balm into a spreadable gel, it just isn’t as lightweight as a gel moisturizer. This product also as a fresh, lemony citrus scent that I like. While this is a tad expensive, since a little goes such a long way and it has so many great ingredients I do feel the price is justified. To stress how little product you need to use; I have been using this for over a month, both day and night for my dry skin during the winter, and am not even half way through the jar which is just wild for Mr. Additionally while I can use it both day and night, I could potentially see combo/oily skin finding it too heavy for the day time under spf. This product makes my skin feel incredible, has a lovely texture, and helps reinforce my skin barriers health and I highly recommend it! A new holy grail has entered the chat
