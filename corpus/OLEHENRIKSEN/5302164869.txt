The new Ole Henriksen Dewtopia 5% Acid Firming Night Crème has stolen my heart as my new favorite nightly skincare product. The texture is a thick crème consistency and it smell’s absolutely amazing. I use this crème 3-4 nights a week and each morning I wake up with glowy, vibrant skin! I have visibly seen a difference in the hydration my skin wakes up with as well as it’s plump and no fine lines show! I’m so excited to see further improvements with consistent use! nan
