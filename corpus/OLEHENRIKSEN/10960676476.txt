I liked that it was absorbed quickly and it felt good on my skin and also the under eye are looked brighter for few minutes but that sensation didn’t last.  I took a picture before (botton one) and another almost 4 weeks after and I don’t see any difference,  in fact my under eyes look darker and the small lines look the same. I don't see any difference after 4 weeks using it
