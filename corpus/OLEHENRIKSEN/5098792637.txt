Ole Henriksen makes some solid moisturizing products! They truly have creams down to a science, and this one is no exception. I’ve been using it for about two weeks. I like to use moisturizers for a while to get a sense of the product. Obviously I haven’t noticed any major changes. I’ve noticed that my skin does immediately look hydrated and feel plumped, but I’ll need some long term usage to notice changes like fine lines. It has a nice citrus scent which I find pleasant! Overall, it absorbs well looks great on the skin and I’ve not had any bad reactions or irritation. nan
