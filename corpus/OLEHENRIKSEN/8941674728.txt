I love Vitamin C and this one in an essence form is amazing! I use this on freshly cleansed skin in the morning and it gives me a radiant glowy look immediately after absorbing. It does not feel sticky after and it layers well with other products on top.It does not irritate my skin or my dry spots.I have dry skin and often have a damaged skin barrier since some products it, so I love how gentle this is and how I can count on it the days that I need not harsh products that help me repair the skin barrier.I highly recommend this product and since it has become a staple in my skincare routine I would repurchase in the future. Great essence for the AM
