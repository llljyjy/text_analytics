I received this Ole Henriksen eye creme complimentary in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been wanting to try the original version for a while now and was planning on it after my current eye cream ran out, so I was really excited to test out the new and improved formula. As a full time, stay at home mother of four young kids, I’m always tired. I always have super dark circles under my eyes. The eye cream itself feels light, not at all sticky or heavy. The new formula is fragrance-free now so there is no smell to the product which I appreciate and look for in skincare products. It feels nice on the skin and does appear to help fade dark circles. I don’t normally wear concealer or foundation in the summer unless I’m going out at night so I like to keep my skin very hydrated and this has already become a staple in my routine. Lastly, the vitamin C ingredient is what really seals the deal on my 5 star rating. As a strong antioxidant that promotes collagen production, it’s lessened my dark circles/ discoloration to being hardly noticeable and will get even better with continued use. My under eyes are glowing, my dark circles are significantly reduced, all while hydrating my skin. I will definitely be purchasing this product when it runs out. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an effective eye cream! New & improved formula
