This product did help brighten my under eyes and was pretty quick acting with that. I liked the texture of it. It went on smooth and didn’t feel very heavy on. Also, didn’t burn my eyes like some products seem to do.  However, I have sensitive skin and got some red dots/bumps under my eyes by the next day. I still have them days later. nan
