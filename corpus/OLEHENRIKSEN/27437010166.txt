I received barrier booster orange ferment essence. This smells just like oranges. It looks like it is creamy but it is liquid like water. It goes on clear even though it looks cloudy. It feels very nice on my skin. I love the nice glow after application and I love the scent on my skin. This has vitamin c which is amazing on my skin! Absorbs beautifully into my skin and very fast drying. I love that this does not need a cotton pad to be applied. Just dab it onto your balm and apply to your face. I use this morning and before bed. This has helped the fine lines on my face. I incorporate it Into my skin care routine and love love love it! I will continue to use! Absolutely amazing product. Light and glowing
