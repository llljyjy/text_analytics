This new Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer is literally gold for the winter!!  My skin gets dry at times and even though I have combination skin this moisturizer has done wonders for my face! This moisturizer has a thicker consistency but it absorbs into the skin perfectly. It doesnâ€™t leave you greasy at all. It leaves my skin looking radiant and flawless! I really like this moisturizer and I love the fact that there is barely any scent to it. My skin tends to be very sensitive but has had zero reactions! Love this and 100% recommend! Best moisturizer!
