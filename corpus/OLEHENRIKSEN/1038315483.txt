As far as the “new formula” goes, I also  have the original formula and have used that as well and I didn’t notice  much, if any, difference. As far as the product in general, I have to say I am not the biggest fan. I have very oily skin and find the consistency a little bit too thick. I didn’t notice any kind of “brightening” at all, and I was actually very excited about that claim because I love anything brightening for my eyes. I don’t think there is anything necessarily wrong with this product, I just don’t’ LOVE it and tend to reach for other products first. I still have most of the jar of the original formula and haven’t reached for this jar much either. If I eventually do use the entire jar, I highly doubt I will repurchase. nan
