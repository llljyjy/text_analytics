This is a very hydrating, lightweight, night cream that deeply moisturizes skin. It leaves my skin super soft and plump without being too greasy or sticky. Since it contains potent ingredients like 5% AHAs, Edelweiss stem cells and red algae, & shea butter to help minimize dark spots, fine lines and wrinkles, while keeping skin hydrated all night! Use this only at night because of itâ€™s ingredients, it does make your skin sensitive (ALWAYS wear SPF in the morning). The texture is kind of balm/cream like , it initially feels thick but a little goes a long way and once you spread it out it feels light weight and nourishing.  Overall, this moisturizer is a must for aging skin to get hydrated, firmer skin that also helps with minimizing age spots. A must have night cream for aging skin
