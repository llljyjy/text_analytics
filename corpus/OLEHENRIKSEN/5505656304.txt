I loved the smell and texture of this product compared to other vitamin c serums, but this product broke me out. I gave the serum the benefit of doubt, and went back to basics (cleanser, moisturizer, spf) for a few weeks. I tried using this again and it broke me out badly. I have sensitive skin which often reacts by turning red, however I donâ€™t typically break out from products. It took several weeks for me to get my skin under control and left me with some hyperpigmentation from the acne. Not for Acne Prone Skin
