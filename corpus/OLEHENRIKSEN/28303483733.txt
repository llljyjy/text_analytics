This is my first time trying Ole Henriksen skincare and I am in love! The texture is rich and creamy. My dry winter skin loves it and soaks it right in! I have since switched out my other night cream for this one, as this cream is more moisturizing! My skin feels so soft and plump the next morning! I am wanting to try more skincare from Ole Henriksen now!! Best night cream I have used!
