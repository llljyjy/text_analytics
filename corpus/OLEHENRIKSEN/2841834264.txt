Ole Henriksen gifted me this sample of Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Vitamin C Essence. This is a milky essence, slightly thicker than water. It’s sticky, and I allow some extra dry time before applying serum. This essence has a strong orange scent that has died down some with use, but is still a bit more than I’d prefer for my face. I do see a couple essential oil components that are known to be fragrant, if those concern you. The formula is really gentle. I don’t use C every day, as I start getting irritated and peely. I accidentally put this on an additional day getting ready in a rush, and fully expected my face would be on fire, but I had no reaction to it. It makes my skin feel amazing. It really does provide a hydration boost, and my cheeks in particular feel more plump where I often feel a bit jowly. I also see a brightness boost in the center of my face, especially in my cheeks. I’m also seeing some lightening in the area surrounding my lips, where I struggle most with hyperpigmentation. I’m enjoying the results so far, and I’ll be keeping this essence in my routine for sure. The stickiness is a little inconvenient in a hurry, but letting it dry down is worth it; it leaves a nice finish and everything after it feels better than usual. If fragrance were an issue, I might try a smaller size first. Great hydration and brightening…
