First off I am a Night Shift worker with littles so I don’t always get the best sleep. This creme gave me some nice hydration which in turn helped the dark circles & bags under my eyes. It’s has a beautiful banana bright yellow hue to it. It also serves as a great base to some under eye concealer. I have been using it alone then just using my foundation. I am so pleased with this product. Also the vitamin C is a plus! Great addition to your skin/makeup routine!
