I am probably not the target market for this product. I am 41 and my skin is a true combination. It bothers me that the market thinks that oily skin vanishes once you hit 30. The breakouts might but sometimes you want a product that will address oily skin without drying it out. I can’t do oily skin products for 20yr olds but I can do this one. It does not dry my skin out. It balances it perfectly. It is hydrated just enough that when I put my Supergoop Sunscreen and Vit C serum on top that I am comfortable all day. I have a glow but it looks like a glow and not an oil slick. It makes it so I do not have to powder. That makes me look younger. This could be used on it’s own. I have done that too and I still find I get enough moisture from it for daytime. At night I like to slather rich moisturizers over my retin A. As for pores. You cannot shrink them. That is not how science works. You can minimize their appearance. I am silicone averse (hate the feel of those clear primers). This addresses that. My skin feels comfortable and it does what it says. Does what it says
