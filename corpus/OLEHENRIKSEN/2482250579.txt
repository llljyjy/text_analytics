As a toner & essence lover, I was excited to try this new launch! My skin type is combination acne prone and it’s always dehydrated. Thus, I love anything hydrating. This essence is milky and it’s hydrating with a slight moisturizing component. It’s like a more lightweight Laneige Cream Skin! However, the scent is super strong. I hate artificial orange flavors and unfortunately, the scent for this lingers. I was unable to see any brightening benefits from this but I used it for roughly two weeks. I’ll be passing this along to a friend but if you like orange or citrus scents, this will be the essence for you! Super hydrating but very strong scent
