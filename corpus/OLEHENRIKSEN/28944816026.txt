I really like this Olehenriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence. I love how this smells. Like a orange grove. It absorbs well and helps bind moisture and strengthen skins barrier function. Made with distilled active parts of a orange-fermented orange peel extract, orange stem cells and vitamin C-to unlock the ingredients full potential. Packed with hyaluronic acid. Perfect to prep skin for your skincare routine. I would definitely recommend this product nan
