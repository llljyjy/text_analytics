I’m on my 3rd jar of this moisturizer. First purchased this due to the star ingredients 8 powerful Peptides, 3 types of Ceramides, Amino Acids, and Collagen to name a few. These are the building blocks and keys to maintaining healthy glowing skin. Majority of skincare brands make one moisturizer that focuses on the peptides or the ceramides. They rarely combine the two. Personally I seek out brands like Olehenriksen. My Skin is dry but I suffer from the occasional hormonal breakouts and this moisturizer never breaks me out. This has a very, very light scent. I wish it had zero in it but that’s my only con with this moisturizer if I’m being extra picky. Has a great gel like texture that melts into the skin effortlessly. This keep me moisturized while reinforcing my skin barrier. Excellent Anti Aging Moisturizer STAR ⭐️ INGREDIENTS
