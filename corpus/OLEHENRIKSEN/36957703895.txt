This eye cream is really good! It helped with my dry under eyes, it helps with the puffiness in the morning and I don’t know how but I think it slightly helped with my really dark circles. I think it neutralizes the darkness a little bit when I put it on. I also use it under my concealer as a moisturizer but I recommend waiting few minutes for the product to be absorbed otherwise it could mix with the concealer which doesn’t look really good. nan
