This is such a wonderful night cream. It has a light sweet lemon scent, that reminds me of walking into a fine bakery. It has a great texture it’s not too thick and it’s not too lightweight. I like that it has 5% AHA acid in it so that it can help with refining my skin and also improving of the texture and softness of it. So far I’m really enjoying this my skin looks really healthy and is very supple in the morning. A must have
