I received this product for free from Influenster and Olehenriksen for trying purposes. While some people may have allergic reaction to this cream, I actually had a really good experience! I sensed a little bit of tingling under my eyes, but that went away within a few minutes. It’s super hydrating and you’ll immediately see a difference under your eyes! Works great with makeup as well! It’s honestly a must-have! nan
