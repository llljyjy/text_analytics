I’ve really enjoyed using this Ole Henriksen dewtopia 5% AHA firming night crème. It’s thick yet lightweight and absorbs beautifully into my dry skin. I’ve noticed my skin looking more even, glowy, less flaky, and it’s even improved my “scowl lines“ a little bit (in a week and a half). It does have a bit of fragrance and it reminds me of lemon doughnuts, which dissipates quickly. It’s become one of my favorite night creams! nan
