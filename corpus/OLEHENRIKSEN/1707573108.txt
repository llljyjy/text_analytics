The positives first - this product has a lovely citrus smell and (intentional) orange color. It is a spreadable serum with a thicker gel/lotion consistency which is a nice contrast to the watery consistency that many Vitamin C products have. This makes for a very pleasant and pampering application. However, I will be returning the serum because after a week of use, I have determined that this product pills far too much to be usable. I used a different (watery) Vitamin C product before trying this serum. Like most people, I use Vitamin C in the morning, so a fully “done“ day would include Vitamin C, moisturizer, sunscreen, and potentially makeup on top. These layers were no problem in the before times. The pilling began as soon as I switched and no amount of adjustment could fix it. I tried reducing the amount of serum I was applying, giving the serum more time to absorb before applying moisturizer, and even had a day where I just applied the serum and nothing to follow to see how much of the pilling could be attributed to the serum itself. Yeah, you guessed it. It’s a shame, but no matter how effective the serum is (which I can’t speak to having only used it regularly for a week), I simply can’t use something that’s going to ruin my makeup everyday. Pills too much to be usable
