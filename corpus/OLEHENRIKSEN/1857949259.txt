I really like the hydration it provided under my eyes. I felt my skin looked brighter the longer I used it. I didn’t use it every day but on and off as part of my nightly skin routine. I don’t know how it would look under makeup. I liked the thickness of the crème and the scent was not too overpowering. For the price I do recommend it. nan
