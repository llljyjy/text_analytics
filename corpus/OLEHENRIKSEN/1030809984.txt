I got a deluxe sample of this product with one of my Sephora purchases. The smell is nice and citrusy without being overwhelming. In three days I noticed a difference in my skin -- brighter, smoother, and softer. Unfortunately, it made me breakout on my cheeks. I put this product away for a couple weeks and my skin cleared up. I tried the product again and broke out again in a couple days. Not great for acne prone skin.
