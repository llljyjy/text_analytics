The only reason I am giving it 4 and not 5 stars is the scent. While pleasant, it is a bit too strong for a face cream. That single issue aside, it is a rich, yet light, moisturizer. It leaves my skin with a healthy glow without making it greasy. My skin is on the dry side, and my chin is arid on a good day. After using it for a week, morning and night, as the moisturizing step of my routine. I see an improvement in my skinâ€™s texture and moisture level. A little goes a long way with this cream, so I think it is actually a bargain. Definitely  recommended. Great product!
