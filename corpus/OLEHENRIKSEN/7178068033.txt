This was gifted to me by Ole Henriksen in exchange for my honest opinion. So far I really love the citrus scent. Super nice to use in the morning to help wake up. I have large pores, uneven skin tone, dark spots and have combination skin with dry spots around my nose and chin.  I really like the subtle changes to my skin since starting this. I feel like my skin is more even in terms of moisture. My oily skin spots are less oily and my dry spots are smooth. So far I like this product and look forward to using it to see what else happens. So far so good
