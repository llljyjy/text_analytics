this review is for those who like a STRONG....nay....VERY STRONG exfoliater. Those who don’t - you’ll love this product and you can stop reading here. I purchased this as they discontinued the walnut scrub and was looking for a replacement. Figured since this came out around the time they discontinued the walnut one it would be just as strong. Unfortunately it isn’t. I know other reviews say this exfoliater is TOO strong which is partially why I tried it (“too strong“ for others = “just right“ for me), but compared to the walnut scrub this is very mild.I am part of what’s likely a small population that requires a truly STRONG exfoliater to keep my skin smooth and free of buildup in my pores. I require something with quite a bit of scrubbing power to clear off that bumpy dirty feeling. Maybe it’s because my pores are so large they’re visible from space? Not really sure. Regardless, if you are like me, this is not the product for you. not a strong enough exfoliater
