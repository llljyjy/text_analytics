Got the deluxe sample in one of the perks set. My skin type is not sensitive at all and have rarely had any allergic reactions but this serum made me break out on three separate tries!! My entire face and neck area feel like sandpaper for a few days after using this for once…not sure which ingredient is causing it but I’m definitely gonna avoid this one in the future. The Only Product That Broke Me Out!
