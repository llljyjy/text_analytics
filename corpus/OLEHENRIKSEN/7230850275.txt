So far, I’ve really enjoyed this scrub! In the beginning, I was a little concerned because it felt hot on my skin when I applied it, however, when I stuck with it and washed it off, it felt such a cool almost-minty refreshing feeling on my skin, and my skin felt sooooo smooth! I haven’t had any issues with peeling since I’ve started using this product! nan
