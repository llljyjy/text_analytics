I received Olehenriksen Barrier booster Orange Feement Essense  in exchange for my honest opinion,I can’t tell you, how exited I was to get my hands on this products , I’m currently using tretinoid and my skin is super dry and  in some need of extra love, it had been suggested to me to add some sort of vitamin c product onto my morning skin care regimen to help clear my acne scars better and help my sunscreen absorb nicer , I have very fair skin with a lot of premature lines due to all my acne treatments, these days , so I truly appreciate the milky texture of this essence .I gotta say the packaging is simple with a product that’ feels wonderful on the skin, it absorbs fast and leaves me feeling hydrated, I’ve only used it for a few weeks but I’m really looking forward to its constant use and to soon see results! Loving it so far!
