Iâ€™ve been looking for an essence to add to my skincare routine. I love all OleHenriksen products, but this one was special. I have combination skin, some parts are dry some oily - not everything works on me. But this essence was so perfect. Moisturizing spots that are dry, and giving my skin that healthy glow i always wanted.  I used it after washing my face. Used the essence. Then cream. And my makeup (foundation) went on the skin flawlessly. The orange smell is soo good, and refreshing. The design of the bottle is beautiful. Would definitely recommend this product! nan
