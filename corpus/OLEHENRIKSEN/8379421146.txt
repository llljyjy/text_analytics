I was so excited to try this, I have oily skin and open pores. Although this DID reduce my oil, it unfortunately made my skin flaky in some areas. Also tiny white bumps around my chin. I might try this one more time and give it another try, but I hope itâ€™s as good as these reviews say it is. Def spot test before use
