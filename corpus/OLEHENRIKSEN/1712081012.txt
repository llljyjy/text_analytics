I love the Vitamin C essence! The packaging is good quality (comes in an opaque glass bottle, which helps to preserve the product). The scent of the product is delicious - smells citrusy and like oranges. After applying the essence, my face feels so hydrated and soft! The product doesnâ€™t feel greasy or oily at all. Highly recommend! nan
