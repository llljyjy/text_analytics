Iâ€™m always looking for brighter skin that is easy to achieve. This essence is just that. Its got a beautiful citrus scent and is lightweight. I put it on right after my toner and before my eye cream and moisturizer. I mainly use it in the mornings because the scent wakes me up. I put a few drops into my palm and press it into my skin. I noticed my skin started looking brighter and more hydrated as I used it consecutively. I was gifted this product by Ole Henriksen nan
