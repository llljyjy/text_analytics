I received this product complimentary from Ole Henriksen in exchange for my honest feedback. I have oily-combination skin with uneven skin tone and large pores. I added this to my morning skincare routine - Cleanser, this essence  followed by serum and moisturizer. Essense contains ingredients in highly concentrated form thus helps targeting skin concerns that they are meant for very effectively. They also help better absorption of other serums/products. I could see the mattefying glow (not oily glow) on my face and loved how it made my skin soft, clean and even after each use .It did not cause any dryness or breakouts. It is said to defend against environmental stressor with orange ferment as active ingredient and definitely doing what is claims , my skin feels so refreshing after use. The product has watery consistency and small amount is enough work its charm. I would definitely purchase it again once this one is over and recommend it to everyone looking for clean nd fresh skin. Works wonders
