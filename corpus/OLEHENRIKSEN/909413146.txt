I want to give this five stars, I do. But I think it’s a little too intense for my sensitive skin? It does make my skin look AMAZING once the product settles down. But I have learned not to wear this around anyone that I don’t want to look red and splotchy in front of. Ideally, I wear it before bed. It does sting and has a cooling/burning sensation which can be a little irritating. But, again, once that settles down, it does make my skin look smooth the next morning. I will say I’ve never actually had a lasting negative reaction to it (breakouts, rash, flare ups, etc) Sensitive skin use with caution
