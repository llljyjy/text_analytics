I received this complimentary to try out. I love the smell of this product and it has a very luxurious feel. You only need a small amount to do the whole face. My skin is oily and I didn’t feel it made me more oily, it left my skin very hydrated. It wasn’t the best I have ever used but I would recommend it to those with combo or dry skin. Love this product!
