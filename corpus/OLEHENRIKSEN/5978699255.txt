Does it work? Yes.  But it requires patience and consistency.  You really need to use this product consistently to see results.  I’m almost through nature bottle and in my experience, you don’t notice any results for a while and then all of a sudden it seems like you just wake up and notice a difference.  One of those that sneaks up on you kind of products.  Use nightly, not during the day.  And don’t forget AHAs in these type of products can make your skin temporarily more sensitive during sun exposure which mean you could also see dark spots occur.  This means, just be sure to use a daily sunscreen. Otherwise, every time you use this product and don’t use sunscreen the days after, you’ve just waisted your time and money. Patience + Consistency
