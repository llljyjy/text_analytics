I received this complimentary from Ole Henriksen in return for my honest review! This product has fermented orange peel extract that helps nourish and refresh skin. It smells absolutely heavenly too! Also has orange stem cells that provide antioxidant protection and vitamin C that helps brighten and protect skin from pollution! I have dry dull skin and this helped hydrate and brighten my skin immediately! I use this after cleansing and toning. I use a few drops and pat into the skin then use serum and moisturizer after. My favorite part about this product is the smell and how refreshing it is. I would definitely purchase in the future and recommend to my friends! My new go to!
