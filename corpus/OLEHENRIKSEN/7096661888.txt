This product was gifted by Ole Henriksen. The essence/toner has a refreshing orange scent since itâ€™s formulated with fermented orange peel extract & vitamin C, and the milky and viscous consistency helps hydrate my combination skin and feel really good without feeling too heavy. I follow up with a lightweight moisturizer for the perfect day time routine. Would recommend this to those with dry/combo skin and are looking to incorporate vitamin C into their routine. nan
