I love the Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence. The light citrusy scent is invigorating pick me up every morning.  Absorbs quickly in my skin. Doesn’t irritate or dry out my skin. Leaves my skin looking brighter and hydrated. I’m very happy with this product and the citrusy skin boosting end results. Definitely the boost I need
