This product is lightweight and has a great scent of oranges when applied but is not long lasting. It absorbs quickly into the skin and leaves it feeling very smooth, not tacky. I apply my moisturizer over top, then my foundation. I have very sensitive skin and this product does not irritate it. I am giving it a 4 of 5 stars because of the price. It is expensive compared to other similar products. nan
