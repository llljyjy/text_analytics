Let me say that I am a huge fan of OleHenriksen products. Every time I try something new from them, they exceed my expectations. This is a thicker moisturizer that left my skin looking and feeling hydrated each time. Iâ€™ve been using this product for about a month now, and would definitely recommend this product as a day or night time moisturizer. The price point is fair and I feel like a little goes a long way. Will be purchasing again. As Good As Some Higher End Luxury Brands
