This product was gifted by Ole Henriksen. I have normal/combo skin that is blemish prone, has dullness and dark spots, texture and fine lines. I’ve been using this for a while now and have seen some great results. Immediately upon application my skin feels very hydrated and nourished. After using it for a bit I’ve noticed that my skin’s texture seems to have improved and I have less clogged pores between my eyebrows which was a problem area for me. I’ve noticed a brightness in my skin when I wake up and my complexion now looks well rested. It’s a very thick formula which makes it great for overnight use and it has worked well in conjunction with other products I use without causing any pilling. I’ve also worn this under makeup in a pinch and found it didn’t interfere with my makeup application at all. I love that it’s a gentle exfoliant that can keep my skin from developing any further trouble spots like I’ve dealt with in the past. The scent is noticeable, which I like, and it smells like a lemon meringue pie to me which I also really like. I would highly recommend this product. Gentle Exfoliation & Mega Hydration
