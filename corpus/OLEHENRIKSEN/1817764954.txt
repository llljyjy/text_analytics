I have a very oily skin and this cream does not make it oilier or cause breakouts.  I applied this at night and my skin feels very moisturized in the morning.  I does smells great (not a strong fragrance). The texture of the cream is rich and creamy. Iâ€™m 36 years old and I have not noticed a difference in my fine lines yet but differently my skin looks healthier. A must try!
