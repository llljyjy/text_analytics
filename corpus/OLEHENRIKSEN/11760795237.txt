I love this product. The smell is 10/10, lightweight, super absorbing, and really does wake your skin up. The packaging is also on point. At first, I was hesitant because the price point for a product like this is a bit high. After pacing in Sephora, I ended up giving it a try and I don’t regret it! It makes my skin glow and has brighten dark spots. I look forward to using this product everyday! I use to apply it AM and PM, but I now just do PM. If I see my skin looking really tired, I’ll apply it in the morning. I’m sure this will last me until the end of this year. Glowing!
