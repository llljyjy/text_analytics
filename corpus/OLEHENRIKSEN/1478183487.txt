While I do believe the brand’s claims are overstated, I did see skin improvements after 2 weeks of consistent AM/PM use. My benchmark for efficacy is that if a skincare-oriented product claims to deliver moisture & plump skin, it will effectively erase this micro wrinkle on my forehead. This halfway does, and so I won’t give it 5 stars where others have earned it. I also feel as though this is a heavier formula than described. But the price is right, and I may repurchase in the future. Strong Daily Contender
