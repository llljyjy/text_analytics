I received this product complimentary for testing. I am nearly 30 with slightly drier skin and always looking for something to keep my skin fresh and hydrated, and reduce small fine lines. I’ve been using this for a few days now as a morning essence before my serums and moisturizer and love it. It smells citrus, but less artificial and more like you just squeezed a real orange - so nice. The essence is not sticky or heavy on the skin and it works well under my other products. I do feel like it creates a slightly more plump and uniform tone to my skin, and it’s just a nice product to use waking up between that and the scent! I follow with another vitamin C serum and moisturizer + sunscreen. The bottle is huge but I do think I would repurchase again since I’ve been enjoying it and think it’d be good for summer months especially! Really lovely essence
