I wasn’t sure if I liked this upon the first couple applications mainly because it’s so sticky. Well I finally started rubbing/massaging my skin after maybe 5 minutes of applying and the amount of dead skin and stuff pilling off was crazy. Once I did that, it was no longer sticky, and my skin was visibly smoother (felt smoother as well). It was so crazy. I put moisturizer on and my skin feels amazing! Not sure if this is how it’s supposed to work, but it worked for me and got rid of the stickiness. I need this to be my holy grail
