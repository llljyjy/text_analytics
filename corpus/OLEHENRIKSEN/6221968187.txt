Another incredible find from Ole Henrickson. I was turned onto this brand by a girlfriend and was so excited to try this. I’m doing my best to combat any fine lines and really get hydration back into my skin. I really enjoy this night cream because it is incredibly hydrating and thickkkkk (which I love) but sinks in quickly, so when I forget to do my skincare early in the evening, I don’t wipe it all away on my pillow! The scent is light and I can tell a difference after only a few uses with the texture of my skin. Definitely purchasing this for my friends for gifts!Excited to continue using this products to experience their full results! Incredibly hydrating.
