LOVE all of Olehenriksen products so I was so excited when I found out I was getting this! the smell is so clean and the texture is great - it’s thick enough to make you feel like you properly moisturized your face but it’s also lightweight and doesn’t make you feel greasy or too heavy. I used this in the morning and at night and feel like my face now looks more brighter and softer. Definitely recommend! nan
