I have oily skin with large pores and this has helped! However, after a week of daily use, I noticed I had a couple of breakouts. This being the only new product in my routine I knew it was it. I stopped using it right away and breakouts stopped. I use it 2-3 a week and can notice a difference for the day without breakouts. nan
