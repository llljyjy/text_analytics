I have been enjoying incorporating this product into my normal skincare routine. It has a milky consistency that is easy to apply and absorbs well. It makes my skin feel hydrated and gives it a subtle glow. It has a nice citrus scent that is refreshing. I think I need to use it more to see any long term benefits but so far I am really enjoying it! nan
