My skin’s been feeling pretty dull, but this essence has been able to bring some life back into my skin! I love the creamy texture, very hydrating and glowy. It has a type of vitamin c, ethyl ascorbic acid, and Niacinamide, so great to start the day off. But above all, I’m a huge fan of the light kind of orange creamsicle scent! I would recommend! Nice, light and milky essence. Smells phenomenal!
