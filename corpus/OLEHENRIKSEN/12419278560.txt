This vitamin C essence hydrates, brightens, and defends skin against pollution and free radicals. I like that it has the quick-absorbing, lightweight texture of a toner and the powerful benefits of a serum. Ingredients include fermented orange peel extract that nourishes, conditions and refreshes the skin. Hyaluronic acid and niacinamide help to drench skin in moisture and illuminate the look of fine lines and wrinkles, while also strengthening the skin barrier, for an ultra-supple, healthy-looking glow. And the smell of essence is amazing. Highly recommend it to anyone who wants instant hydration and brighter skin. Hydrates, brightens, and defends skin.
