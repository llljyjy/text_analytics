I have hyperpigmentation and acne scars so I am always on the hunt for new vitamin c serums since it helps in fading dark spots. It also helps brighten your skin so I was very excited to try this vitamin c essence. I love how it feels like a toner but actually acts as a serum. The product is lightweight and sinks in beautifully into my skin. Immediately, I noticed how it hydrated and plumpled my skin. I canâ€™t wait to incorporate this into my morning skincare routine. nan
