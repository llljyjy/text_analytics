I received this product complimentary from Ole Henriksen in exchange for my honest review. Comes with a ton of product in the bottle and is very hydrating. Has a light orange scent and super easy to incorporate into your skincare routine. I add right before serum to lock in the moisture that this product provides. Has hyaluronic acid and niacinimide. My skin feels much brighter and hydrated. brighter hydration
