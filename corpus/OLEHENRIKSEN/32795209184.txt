Iâ€™m a 27 year old with sensitive, dry skin and dark circles, looking for an eye cream to help brighten the under eye and hydrate to prevent wrinkles. This eye cream is thicker and a pale yellow-cream color and is fragrance free. The best thing about this product, is that it easily absorbs into the skin and hydrates the under eye (which is perfect to use as a base for concealer as it did prevent creasing). I noticed my under eye area was slightly brighter, but it did not combat the darkness quite as much as I had hoped after a month of use. However, given that the product has quality ingredients and hydrates and smooths nicely, I would recommend this product. The price initially appeared a bit steep, but a little goes a long way. One jar could easily last 6 months. Definitely worth a try in my opinion. Very Hydrating Eye Cream
