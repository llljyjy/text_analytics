I love using Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence because of its wonderful ingredients. This light weight milky Essence has a strong sunburst case of orange and citrusy fragrance. I love the glass bottle that this product comes in which will keep it well preserved way longer and eco-friendly. Orange bliss
