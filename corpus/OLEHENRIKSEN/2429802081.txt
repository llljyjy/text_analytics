Received the Ole Henriksen barrier booster orange ferment essence from Ole Henriksen for my honest opinion. I loved the container it came in glass the packaging was so beautiful.  As we get older we lose a lot of our skin brightness and this cream is amazing at helping this barrier booster orange ferment essence I really love the smell as well a great citrus that isnâ€™t extremely strong.  It absorbs so well when you pat from your face to your neck.  The bottle is beautiful two tone shade of orange. Great skin brightness
