Iâ€™ve been using and loving this Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence! It has nice smell and texture, and definitely makes my skin looks glowier and feels more hydrated; it absorbs quickly, and also makes me feel refreshed. I always love and have faith in Vitamin C products, and glad that I found another great essence! nan
