Ole Henriksen gifted me this essence for reviewing purposes, and it does not disappoint. I use this milky essence mornings and evenings after a mist and before serums and lotions. It takes a second to absorb but plays nicely with the other products in my routine.I feel that my skin is more hydrated and overall more even looking since using this essence. It features some great ingredients such as Hyaluronic Acid, Niacinamide, Lactobacillus Ferment as well as lots of different fruit extracts rich in antioxidants. It also claims to smooth fine lines but I havenâ€™t been losing it long enough to notice results in that area.One thing to note is that it does have a very strong (natural) citrus scent. Personally I am a citrus lover, so I find it quite invigorating but I could see that it would be too much for others.Overall I have to say that this one is a keeper for me (which has not been the case with all Ole Henriksen products). hydrating & skin tone evening Orange deliciousness
