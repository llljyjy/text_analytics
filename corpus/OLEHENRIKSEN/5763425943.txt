Extremely disappointed in this cream, especially after all the rave reviews. It completely dried out my under-eyes - my skin under the eyes is now extremely creased and tight, I can feel it every time I smile or even speak. I hope I can recover from using the product asap without getting unnecessary wrinkles. Definitely not worth the money at all! Very disappointed
