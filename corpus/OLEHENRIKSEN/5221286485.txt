I received free sample!! Unfortunately I gave it try for a week and I started to break out, it is a very smooth and heavy moisturizer, hard to grab from the jar because is very thick, packaging is beautiful very luxurious but not for me unfortunately, I have combo skin, I think this can work very well for very dry skin and Mature skin! unfortunately not for me
