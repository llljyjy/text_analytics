Iâ€™ve been enjoying the Ole Henriksen Truth Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Vitamin C Essence as part of my daily skincare routine. I use this in the morning right after washing my face and before my SPF. The essence makes my skin glowing and feel more awake with the vitamin C. Highly recommend adding an essence to your skincare routine! Add this to your routine
