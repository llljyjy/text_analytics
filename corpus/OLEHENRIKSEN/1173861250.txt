Great formula, but not moisturizing enough. It is more of a gel crème. At night I need to use an oil over it or sleep mask, and after using it in the morning my face feels tight and dry halfway through the day. But I live in a dry climate! So it may work better for those who live with more humidity in the air….or oily skin. pretty good
