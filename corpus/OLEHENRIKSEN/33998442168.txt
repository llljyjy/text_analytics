What drew me to this toner is that it has both BHA (the salicylic acid) and AHAs, so it’s full-strength for unclogging pores & combatting oil. Descriptions also mentions a matte finish, which I find to be true. I still always have one pimple coming to a head or another (just crazy, oily, acne-prone skin over here that derms & prescriptions can’t even fix), but I think the addition of this toner to my routine (day & night, next step after cleansing) has helped the redheads to get over themselves and return to a nice complexion much faster than when I didn’t use a toner at all. A valuable step in my face routine
