Complimentary from Ole Henriksen but all opinions are my own This night cream has been so fun and easy to use, that it’s quite hard not to fall in love with it. It’s very nourishing, hydrating, and is easily absorbed. I really like that I wake up with a beautiful glow in the morning and with plump skin, and how dewy my skin looks during the day as well, it’s a winner in my opinion. A must have in my routine!
