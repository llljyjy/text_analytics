I received it complimentary from Ole HenricksonI am liking the thick glass packaging. I has feels lightweight on application and has a light scent. I have been using it in my morning routine to refresh my skin and it does help my dull skin look better. It has nice mix of antioxidants and I hope it will help me with environmental stress reduction in a long run.  It feels somewhat hydrating and more suitable for oily combo skin types Nice !
