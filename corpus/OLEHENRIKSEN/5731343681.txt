So I really enjoyed this eye banana cream. I tried it without any makeup on the times that I tested it. I thought it made my under eyes brighter and hid my dark circles. However, when I took the final picture for the review it didn’t look different at all and I didn’t use flash. So I now I’m torn because I’m not sure it actually does what it claimed. I still need to try it under makeup, I think they would definitely compliment each other. I’m 50/50
