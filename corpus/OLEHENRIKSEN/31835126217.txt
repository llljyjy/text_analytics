I received this product complimentary from Ole Henriksen. I was skeptical at first of the fermented part but it actually smells really nice, making me feel like a giant orange. I use it after toner and before moisturizer. Love the texture and how it keeps the skin hydrated overnight. Highly recommend. nan
