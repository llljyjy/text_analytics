Okay I want to start with what I liked about this product, I like the smell and I like how it feels when I apply it. However, this made me breakout in many little white heads all over my face and I normally don’t have reactions like this to products. My skin is not sensitive and I have not been using another product when I’ve used this. I’m sad that I’ll have to return this but I prefer the Dr Jart so much more than this. I’m surprised it has so many good reviews, I wish it would have worked for me as well but it did the exact opposite and caused me more issues. nan
