Absolutely loved this moisturizer from the first time I used it. I love the texture. It’s a lightweight whipped texture. It didn’t irritate my sensitive skin and it just laid very nice over the skin without feeling heavy. The only thing I wish was different is that it was fragrance free. Other than that I love this moisturizer so much! nan
