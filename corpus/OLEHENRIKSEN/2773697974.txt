This moisturizer is such a nice texture! I expected something a bit thinner, but it’s really thick. I will say, if you’ve recently picked at your skin or have an open blemishes, this will sting slightly. It does a nice job of making my skin smooth and reducing texture the next day. I can’t speak to the long-term benefits but I’m excited to continue using this. Nice and smoothing!
