I’ve used the entire bottle in my skincare routine . This is a nice moisturizer to apply before makeup so it looks natural and put together. It softens the skin for sure , but definitely does not help brighten any part of your skin. Just moisturizes. I won’t buy it again because I like to use a product for what it says it does nan
