Disclaimer: I do not know if this works. I don’t know if bakuchiol really works like retinol and i havent tested it in a way that would allow me to assess. But I use this and love it and have repurchased it. Why? Because I love the way it makes my skin look when it’s on, and it doesn’t flare my rosacea. As such I treat it almost like a cosmetic that I’m hoping is good for my skin, but maybe it is. What can I say, I love it and the splurge is worth it to me. I’ll continue to repurchase. Whether it's a cosmetic or skincare, I love it
