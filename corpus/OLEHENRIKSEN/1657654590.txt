Love this for morning and night. I feel like it really added dewiness to my skin and also it looked brighter and more even. It goes on really smoothly and is ok to layer makeup over.  I have very sensitive, dry skin and this was an easy add to my routine that didnâ€™t disturb my skin. also the clean ingredients are a huge plus for me and it works! smooth nd glowy
