I have dry skin, and I wear makeup 2-3 days per week. I alternate between using this (to provide additional cleaning on the days that I wear makeup, or to serve as Step Two on when I double-cleanse) and using Clinique cleaning balm (to provide a basic wash, on the days when I’m foundation-free and I’m only single-cleansing). I totally recommend this product -- it cleanses skin without stripping and it has a great orange scent. The only reason that I alternate is because I try not to use cleansers (as a general rule) on days when a balm will suffice. Great for dry skin, or for Step 2 double-cleansing
