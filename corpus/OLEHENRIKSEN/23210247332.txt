I love this! Not many eye creams wow me! I usually put them on and nothing is brightening, or anything spectacular but this one so far has lived up to its claims! The before and after pics in the description are accurate! It has some type of smell in the jar, very light but you can’t smell it when applying or I can’t anyway! Leaves my under eyes super hydrated and bright without being heavy or greasy! Soaks into the skin super nice! Love!
