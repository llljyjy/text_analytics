I really like this toner, and I do recommend. It did exactly what I expected. I have oily/acne prone skin, with acne scars. This toner is non drying, it evened my skin tone, smoothed out my lines, and gave me an overall clean, fresh, bright skin tone. This is my choice for a nightly skin toner. A must-have in your nightly skincare routine!
