I came into Sephora desperate for a product to nourish my dry skin. Due to hormones and maybe a really hash winter my skin had a compromised barrier and nothing seemed to work. A Sephora worker showed me this and it made my skin feel so soft when I sampled on my hand and that softness lasted. I got the full size and the dryness eased up in a week or so. The jar lasted me two months and I just re-ordered. Really enjoy this a lot and it does make my skin look overall so much healthier. A new staple for my dry skin. Saved my dry, damaged skin barrier
