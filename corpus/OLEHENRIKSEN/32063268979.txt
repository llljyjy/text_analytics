I have combination skin and I live in California. This product is great for me. When you put it on your face, especially in the morning, you will smell the citrus that woke me up freshly. It also made my skin remains a balance condition and moisturized. In California, it’s very dry, so this product made my skin more hydrated, which is what I need so bad, because skins dry mean wrinkles…and I definitely don’t want wrinkles. I use it twice a day. Morning before sunscreen and make up, at night after shower and as the first step of my skin maintenance. Overall, I gave this product 9/10, and I would highly make a purchase it as a toner and would recommend it to my friends. Fresh smell and make skin hydrated
