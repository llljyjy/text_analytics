I normally don’t write reviews, but this completely transformed my skin! I worked in cosmetics for over a decade, changed careers, and then had my baby. During pregnancy you’re not allowed to use just about any skincare and my skin became terrible. After pregnancy, my hormones didn’t regulate properly, leaving my skin to remain a disaster. With a new business and baby, I couldn’t keep up what I needed. Then I found this! One step and after two weeks my skin is almost flawless! I ended up using it pretty much from my chest up to lighten dark spots and help clear my skin and WOW nan
