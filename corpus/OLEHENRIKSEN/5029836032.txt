I’ve been using this product for a couple weeks now, and I am enjoying it! It definitely brightens up the under eye area when you don’t have on any makeup, giving off a soft glow without looking too shiny and doesn’t affect my makeup application either. I like that the ingredients are clean - as someone that has sensitive skin I am always cautious when trying new products but this one gave no adverse reactions. Can’t say I noticed a difference with fine lines yet as it’s only been a couple weeks but will definitely continue using this in my skin care line up. Gives a soft glow
