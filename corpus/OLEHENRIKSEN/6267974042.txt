I’ve only been using this essence for 3 days.  I love it.   It has a really nice milky consistency.  It applies onto the skin super silky and  makes my skin feel hydrated. My skin just drinks it up. I have some stubborn scarring I’ve been trying to get rid of and I really hope this helps with that.  Also, it has a really yummy orange scent. I’m surprised I like it since I’m not really into citrus scents. I love it!
