I have combination, acne prone and sensitive skin. This has a lightweight and watery texture. This has a orange scent and it smells nice. This essence makes my skin feel hydrated and plump. This helps with my hyperpigmentation and it didnâ€™t irritate my skin. I got this for free in exchange for my honest review. nan
