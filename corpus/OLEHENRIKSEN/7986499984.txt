Loved this moisturizer. It is quite thick in texture, but not too heavy to wear in the daytime for my combo skin.  I also love slathering it on at night.  It has a nice, citrusy scent that isnâ€™t overpowering.  It sinks into the skin fairly quickly and leaves the skin looking hydrated, supple, and glass-like.  It also works well under makeup in my experience.  When using it for about a month, I saw a big improvement in hydration, firmness, and smoother texture.  I would definitely recommend trying this moisturizer out. nan
