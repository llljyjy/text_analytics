I received this product complementary from Olehenriksen in exchange for my honest review.I have actually never tried an essence before but I am completely obsessed with following K-Beauty so Iâ€™ve definitely wanted to. This particular essences is a brand new product  packed with vitamin C, hyaluronic acid and niacinamide! I love how hydrating it makes my skin feel and how fast it absorbs into the skin. It has a nice scent as well. I also really like the packaging and how big the bottle is! I would highly recommend this product to my family and friends. Vitamin C Essence
