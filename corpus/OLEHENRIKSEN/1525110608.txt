I’ve incorporated this essence into my skincare routine for the past 5-6 days. For reference my skin is oily and normally responds well to vitamin c products so no sensitivities here.The milky-like texture is enjoyable to apply and it smells like oranges. I do notice some added hydration so far which is important in my routine since my oily skin dehydrates easily. I’m also using this essence for the antioxidant protection against free radicals/pollution which can contribute to aging skin. I’m happy to see added ingredients like hyaluronic acid, niacinamide + peptides in this formula too. I do however need to use this longer to comment on the brightening effects, I notice a slight glow in my skin but too soon to tell after only a few days. Hydrating essence
