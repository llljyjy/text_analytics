I’m not really an essence person normally I like to keep my skincare routine very basic, but come summer I enjoy self tanning which, a lot of people don’t know is still damaging the skin! So I like to get some extra vitamin c in and this one is great! I enjoy the smell and my skin definitely appears brighter already! It’s lightweight and full of the antioxidants necessary in my routine. I’m excited continue using this all summer! Brightens!
