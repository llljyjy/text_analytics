I was gifted by Ole Henriksen the Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence.  This product is amazing.  I love fresh citrus boost  you get once you open the bottle.  The vitamin C and  citrus wakes up your skin and gets you prepared for the day or night.  My skin felt awake,  hydrated and brightened.  The Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence is a super light essence that absorbs into your skin and does not leave an oily residue.  I will be recommending this to all my friends. Vitamin C
