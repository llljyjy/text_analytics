I was sent this complimentary from Ole Henriksen. I haven’t been using it long enough to see results yet, but it smells amazing like fresh oranges and has a milky consistency. It absorbs quickly into my skin with no sticky or tacky feeling. So far, it’s leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth. I’m excited to see the full results in the next 6-8 weeks! Smells Amazing!!
