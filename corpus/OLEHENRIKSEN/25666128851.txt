Wanted to love this but the texture is just all wrong for me. I use the Ole Henriksen Pore cleanser and LOVE it. The Henriksen moisturizer that used to come in the Pore kit was so much better. So much smoother, went on the skin and actually soaked in; this stuff is so thick it just sits on top of my skin and makes it feel sticky and slightly greasy. Can’t layer with any other products because everything else just beads up on top of it. Just not right for me and I wish they would sell the old moisturizer that came in the kit as a stand-alone. Overall it’s a good brand and I would recommend the brand itself just not this product. Not As Good As the Old Moisturizer
