This is a thick moisturizer, but it’s not greasy. Absorbs well into skin so it’s great for AM and PM use. It definitely minimized wrinkles and pores for me while keeping my skin super hydrated. Im a skincare junky and I’ve tried almost every skincare brand that Sephora has to offer and this has been my favorite moisturizer so far. It has a very mild fragrance also which I like for my skincare products. A million times yes!!
