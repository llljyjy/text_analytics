Not very impressed with this product.  Read high reviews about it but it was less than stellar.  Was very sticky and the smell was overpowering.  Did not smooth on like other face serums I have used.  Dried almost immediately as soon as it touched the skin.  Did not feel like it was worth the money spent. Not a high review.
