The consistency is great - not too lightweight or too heavy. I have combination skin and this is a perfect night cream for me - I think it will work well for most skin types. With 5% acid, it doesnâ€™t feel irritating at all on my healthy skin. Of course, I sometimes get small patches of dry or irritated skin (not from this), but apply this cream on already irritated areas will sting. Overall with consistent use, I do find my skin appear more glowy and smoother! It does contain a pretty noticeable scent though. Great night cream with AHA
