I’ve tried a lot of different oil control products, including the highly raved Cerave. But it never helped keep me matte for more than an hour or two. I tried the small bottle of olehenriksen cleanser and my skin stays wonderfully matte throughout the day! I pair it with the ordinary oil control moisturizer and it’s a great combo for oily skin!
