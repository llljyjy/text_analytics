I was so excited to receive this product, and the claims sounded perfect for my skin. when I applied this though I noticed red bumps that turned into little white heads. to correct this I stopped using the product and put on rosehip seed oil and cbd moisturizer. it definitely was the product because I tried it two more times and had the same issue. Not for sensitive skin
