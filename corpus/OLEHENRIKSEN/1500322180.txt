One week update: I included this with my night time skin care routine and I apply it right before I do my retinol and night cream. Ot has a really light milky texture and absorbs fast within a minute and def a little amount goes a long way. It has lightened some sun spots for me and I wake up with fresh and bright skin. My skin texture feels really smooth and I don’t feel as dry or flakey anymore. Can’t wait to see how my skin feels with two weeks use. Perfect addition to my night time routine
