I started using this moisturizer both day and night about a week ago. I usually opt for a thicker moisturizer in the winter, and although this feels pretty light, it definitely does the job. A little goes a long way. Goes on well and absorbs nicely into the skin. Keeps my skin looking bright despite the cold, winter air here in New England. nan
