I really love this mask. Upon first use, I wasn’t so sure. For some reason I am very picky about masks and I expect them to do what they say within the time limits they promise. I applied it on a morning and rinsed off like i was told and then applied my makeup and went about my day. When evening time came and I washed my makeup off is when I noticed a difference. My face actually looked smooth and had a glow to it. As I have continued to use this mask, my face has only improved more and more. It is definitely a staple when it comes to my skincare routine now. I’m so happy I found this and encourage others to juat give it a try and hang in there for a little bit to watch the changes happen. You will fall in love just like I did. Love at first sight!
