I have been loving this eye cream ! I absolutely LOVE and am a sucker for any skincare product  with Vitamin-C! I’ve been using this for the past 2 weeks and have seen a very nice improvement in brightness as well as minimizing the look of my fine lines ! The texture is very creamy ,not too thick but not too thin either . The color of it is yellow,which I love and think and it goes great with the name “Banana Bright”! I love the frosted glass packaging, it feels and looks luxurious! My under eyes instantly feel more awakened . The skin around my eyes feels and looks more youthful and bouncy to the touch . I love the glow I get from this product! Overall ,this eye cream has definitely impressed me. I will be purchasing once I run out and I absolutely recommend it to everyone! Beautiful glow
