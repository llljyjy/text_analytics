“I received this product for free fromInfluenster and brand(s) in exchange for myhonest review.“ To be honest I actually really like this cream! My eyes currently have some darkness from all the chemo and radiation I’ve been undergoing for breast cancer and this has really brightened the area and it doesn’t leave me feeling tight or greasy. I’ve tried it a few time and it really helps when I’m looking tired as well. I totally recommend this product and I would deff purchase in the future once I run out of it❤️❤️ A new routine staple
