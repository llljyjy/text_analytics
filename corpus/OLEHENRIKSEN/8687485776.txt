Ole Henriksenâ€™s Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence is more than slightly amazing. I have acne scars that I have tried to fade in the past, but also having sensitive skin, I have been wary of many Vitamin C products. The Orange Essence is the most gentle brightening I have ever used, and not once did I worry about irritation or reactivity. Between that, brighting effects, and clarifying my skin while making sure my moisture barrier is intact, I am absolutely floored by this product. The only thing I will say that is not super positive is that there is a very strong orange/citrus smell to this product which may turn some folks off, but I think it dissipates pretty quickly.*Received product complimentary from Ole Henriksen in exchange for my honest opinion.* Perfect Vit C for Sensitive Skin
