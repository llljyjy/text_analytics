Ive only been using this for 2 nights and 1 day so far and i am in love. Have already noticed improved texture, brightness, and even tone. My skin is looking HEALTHY!  Definitely an impulse buy because it was on sale. For 40 bucks, you still get an absurd amount of product that should last you about 6 months to a year and its packed with amazing skincare ingredients at the top of the list. Currently and will continue to use it by mixing a lightweight moisturizer and then applying. Even just by itself youâ€™re good to go. Reviving!
