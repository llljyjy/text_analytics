I was gifted by Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence. I absolutely love this product. The bottle is large and made of glass. The dispenser makes it easy to shake 3-4 drops into your palm to apply. The scent is refreshing with a light orange scent. I apply this at night into my cleansed skin and in the morning. You can feel and see immediately how soft and blurred your skin is. My skin feels silky smooth and hydrated. It absorbs instantly into your skin without any residue. It’s like a mix between a toner and serum. I’ve never used a product like this before but I’m really happy with the results so far. I will definitely be purchasing this once I run out. In love with this product
