This is my on the go product ( always buy an extra one in case they discontinue it) I have oily and sensitive skin due to which I really dont prefer using scrubs on my face. The tube is soft and easy to squeeze but it feels sturdy. This is a great one to keep in your shower because unlike a jar, water canâ€™t get inside the packaging. Recommended to use for overnight formula
