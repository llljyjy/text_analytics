Ole Henriksen gifted me this product to test, honest opinions are my own.Ole Henriksen has been a pioneer in the skincare space with tried and true Vitamin C products including one of my faves, Truth Serum. Their latest Vitamin C packed offering in the Truth line is an anti-oxidant rich Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Vitamin C Essence. The Essence is a toner + serum hybrid, use this step after you cleanse your face to prep for the rest of your skincare routine and zhuzh up the skin with concentrated Vitamin C. Texture wise, you will feel a bit more viscosity to it than a traditional toner.4-5 shakes/drops into my hand or on a thin cotton face sheet is more than enough to provide coverage for my face. At $44 for the bottle, it’s an incredible value for this 2-in-1 product of a toner and serum. I personally use it only for my morning routine because I prefer Vitamin C for daytime and Retinol for nighttime but that is just me. You can definitely use this for am/pm.Key ingredients include fermented orange peel extract to nourish skinorange stem cells to provide anti-oxidant protectionVitamin C to brighten & protect against pollutionJust the Essence alone creates a bouncy, supple feel to my face and gives me a healthy, radiant glow! I definitely feel it’s a great product to revive my 40+ yo skin and help with my hyperpigmentation + sun spots.Cons:If you are sensitive to fragrance or prefer fragrance free products, be forewarned this Essence literally smells like orange in a bottle.Definitely not for those with sensitive skin or broken skin as it is a Vitamin C packed product so it may irritate your skin. I patch tested on the back of my hand that happened to have a small scabbed over cut - it stung a little bit.Would def recommend if you want to cut out a step (toner) and incorporate a super effective brightening & hydrating Vitamin C packed product to start your morning skincare routine! My kind of orange glow!
