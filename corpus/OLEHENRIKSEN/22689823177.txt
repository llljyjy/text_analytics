when I pay top dollar for skin care I expect thought and effort to be put into packaging but they certainly didn’t care. just purchased and no product is coming out. The pump is terrible and it’s cheap plastic. can’t even give a reievew on how it works. Will be returning and looking elsewhere for Vitamin C serum. Cheap Packaging
