I’m really trying to tackle my PIH now that I’ve minimize my acne flares. I use a directed and gradually got up to an every night routine. I follow up with SR Good Genes Lactic Acid and my skin has tolerated both well. I’m slowly seeing my overall complexion brighten and that’s good for me so I will continue to use. Just remember to apply your SPF in the daytime So far so good!
