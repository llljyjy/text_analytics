I am currently pregnant and having a little more than usual skin discoloration on my face as well as some pregnancy acne. I’ve been looking for a good Vitamin C product that won’t irritate my skin and that’s easy to apply because this Mama has no time for a 30-minute skincare routine morning and night. This product is gold. The best Vitamin C product (essence) I’ve ever used and I will definitely continue to incorporate into my routine. Brighter complexion overall, less visible pores and almost no acne! Glowy skin in a bottle. Just loving the results. Formulated with Orange Stem Cells for boosted antioxidants is probably my favorite ingredient in the essence. Will definitely be purchasing in the future! Amazing Product
