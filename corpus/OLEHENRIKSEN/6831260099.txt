This is my genuine, honest opinion despite being sent the product for free in exchange for my honest review. This eye cream works surprisingly fast. Within just a few days I noticed the dark circles under my eyes pretty much vanish, and they looked brighter and more awake! As someone with a very questionable sleeping schedule, this has very quickly become one of my daily staples. I love that the new formula doesn’t have the gross scent that the previous formula had, and in my opinion this one works way better. I used to use the Kiehl’s Vitamin C eye serum, and that took weeks of use for me to notice a difference. The Ole Henriksen works much faster and is also WAY more hydrating under the eyes! The lack of hydration from the Kiehl’s is what made me switch between the Kiehl’s vitamim c serum and the Kiehl’s avocado eye cream, but with the Ole Henriksen one I no longer feel the need to do that, as it brightens and is very hydrating! I highly recommend this product to anyone. My new favorite brightening eye cream!
