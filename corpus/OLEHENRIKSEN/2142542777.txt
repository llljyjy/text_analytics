Dark spots, enlarged pores, and fine lines are all relatively common skin occurrences as we age — and I know we all would love to address these concerns instead of living with them. One of the biggest struggles I know many women face is the hyperpigmentation and making dark spots fade seems to be harder than getting rid of the acne that caused them in the first place.  I was gifted the DEWTOPIA 5% Acid firming night crème by Ole Henriksen – and this  powerful retexturizing night cream, with 5% AHAs and edelweiss stem cell, that  will deeply hydrate your skin while you sleep as well will  retexturizes which will allow it to  even your skin tone and visibly reduces fine lines, wrinkles and dark spots. now, that’s a dream come true! what I love is that you can  wake up to a clearer, more radiant complexion. I do have to somewhat admit that at first I was a bit intimidated by its intensive formula since I have more of a sensitive skin but after using this for about 3 weeks (not ever night but 3 nights a week) I am turned and think it has the perfect formula o balance and nourish your skin. Have you tried? Great
