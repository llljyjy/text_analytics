This gave me acne at first and then completely dried out my skin. My neck and cheeks have been so dry and flaky! I didn’t want to believe it was this moisturizer but I switched back to my usual Fresh moisturizer and my skin is no longer dry/flaky. Like others reviewers noted it smells nice and goes on smoothly … my skin just didn’t want anything to do with it. wanted to love this …
