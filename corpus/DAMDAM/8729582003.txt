I love this face oil! The description was compelling enough to give it a try, especially the part where it doesnâ€™t let makeup clog your pores. The oil smells amazing, if I had to guess it smells like jasmine. The feel of the product on the skin is very smooth, soft and luxurious. I used 5 drops and it was perfect amount. Love the way my skin feels with this oil! nan
