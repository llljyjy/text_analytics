I am a big fan of facial oils and was excited to try this brand out. The oil sinks so easily into the skin without leaving the face feeling suffocated. It also leaves the skin hydrated while looking plump and slightly glowy. Impressed by this oil! There is a slight herbal/ floral scent but not too strong. Def will like to explore more from this brand. nan
