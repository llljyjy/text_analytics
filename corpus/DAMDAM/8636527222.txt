I purchased this as I wanted an oil to double cleanse after wearing makeup. This product just wasn’t right for me. It caused my eyes to sting every time I used it and didn’t really do a great job at removing makeup. Recently picked up a much cheaper oil cleanser that does a way better job at removing eye makeup and doesn’t burn. This wasn’t worth the price for me. Would Not Repurchase
