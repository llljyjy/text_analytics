I’ve enjoyed using the DAMDAM Silk Rice Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil. It’s a light, gentle and effective make-up remover. It works for all skin types. It feels light on my skin, there is an oiliness but not a thick oiliness that remains. It washes off easily. I was looking for something light that took my make-up off and one that didn’t leave a thick residue. This is just that. I like the light scent and I like that it works well for taking my make-up off and is gentle. It doesn’t bother my eyes either. It’s a hydrating and moisturizing product that doesn’t leave my skin dry, or oily for that matter, and takes my make-up off. I like the pump top. I’ve tried other products by this brand and they are quality skincare products. I use this product at night to take my make-up off. I could use it I the morning too as it feels very moisturizing and gentle. I just like it’s make-up removing properties so its more of something I use at night. My skin felt supple and moisturized after use. I think it maintained and didn’t strip the moisture barrier. Wonderful! Highly recommend!
