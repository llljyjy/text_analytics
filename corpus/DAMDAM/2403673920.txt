This product is AMAZING when it comes to getting my makeup off- even my waterproof mascara! It feels gentle on the skin and is thick enough to get my whole face with 2 pumps. I will say that it does leave my eyes a bit cloudy and can sting when you get it in your eye, but I am still very happy with this product. (This product also has no fragrance which I appreciate). My new first step!
