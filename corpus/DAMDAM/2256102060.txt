I love this cleansing oil. I will start off and say I don’t wear much makeup. Just mascara and eyebrow gel, so I’m not sure how it would work on a full face if makeup, but it works well with what I wear! I like the consistency of it. Not too oily and doesn’t dry my skin out. Great first cleanser to a double cleanse! nan
