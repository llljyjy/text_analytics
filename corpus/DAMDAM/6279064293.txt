I love that this lotion is unscented, it’s rich but not too heavy! I do normally like a more watery and light texture but It’s wonderful for  moisturizing and restoration. I love that this brand is clean and vegan. This product is alcohol free and full of antioxidants that help enrich and nourish my skin. I notice my skin feels less dry and itchy in problem areas (I have combination skin). This is a wonderful moisturizer for summer time when my skin often gets too much sun (I know I know I should be wearing more spf, sometimes I forget though). I tend to only put over problem dry areas because it is so rich and I use a lighter moisturizer in my more oily areas. Overall, great moisturizer! Pretty good!
