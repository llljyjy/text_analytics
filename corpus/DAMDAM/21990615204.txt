I love using this oil cleanser to double cleanse. It’s gentle and doesn’t dry out my already dry skin. Washes off easily and makes my skin feel moist whilst also feeling clean at the same time. Fragrance free which is a must. Sometimes if I don’t have makeup or sunscreen on I use just this on it’s own as a cleanser. A must
