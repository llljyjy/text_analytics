This moisturizer has no smell. Recently, a lot of “non-fragranced” items have been rolling out under the guise of “clean” but still have a smell which will often trigger a migraine. The texture of this moisturizer has body but is virtually weightless on the skin so I love using it in the morning when I know I’ll be using additional products like sunscreen and cosmetics. My skin is dry/sensitive and this adds a perfect amount of moisture and balance. I will probably repurchase!!! Amazing
