Really great oil that leaves your skin incredibly hydrated and soft after use. I use it as part of my nightly double cleansing routine and follow it up with a 2% BHA toner to help with my skin congestion. Really great quality and NO FRAGRANCE which I love. Definitely a new permanent staple in my night routine. GREAT for acne-prone skin
