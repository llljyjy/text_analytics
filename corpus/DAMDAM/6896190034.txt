The Dam Dam rice drops balancing oil serum is my favorite skin care product currently.  I apply it after cleansing my face and it hydrates my skin so well without making it greasy. I tried skipping my usual serums and moisturizer to see how this product performed and I must say I am very impressed. I have dry skin and this serum oil managed to keep my skin moisturized all day. It also paired well with my makeup. It has a faint botanical smell. All in all I am in love . Love it
