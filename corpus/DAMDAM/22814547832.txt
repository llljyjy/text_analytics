My skin drinks this moisturizer up! It’s such a nice soft texture, and it’s lightweight enough to not feel heavy during the day. I love that I can use this both day and night and my skin feels moisturized. I also love that it’s fragrance free! It hasn’t irritated my skin at all! It doesn’t give a super luminous finish, which I don’t mind at all, it’s more of a satin-ish finish. But it still makes my skin look and feel so nice on my no makeup days :) nan
