I feel a bit sheepish writing this but you should know this is a sticky moisturizer that leaves a tacky finish - I partly blame myself for not connecting the dots since this is called “Mochi Mochi” - an inherently sticky treat. Not recommended for oily skin and my combo skin wasn’t a huge fan. I think it certainly has potential but I wasn’t able to use it enough to truly get a strong opinion since it’s next to impossible to layer with other products. Viscosity wise this is a medium weight moisturizer - would recommend for nighttime routine. Mild inoffensive smell and comes with a cutesy tiny spatula. Container is a hardy matte plastic so could be repurposed. Good for normal and dry skin
