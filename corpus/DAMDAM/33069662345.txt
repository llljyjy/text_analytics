I personally have never used rice drop face oils before, until I used this product. I can now not live without it! I put this on before my moisturizer for my night time routine. I love how it hydrates my face without leaving that oily residue feeling. My face immediately started glowing after applying a tiny amount (little drops) onto my face. This product is great to use as a part of my morning routine as well if I want to have a glowy no makeup day. I am extremely obsessed with this product, everyone needs to try it! A serum I cannot live without
