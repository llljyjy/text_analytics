This is my first product I have tried from the brand. I always loved Japanese skincare so I have a high hope about this one. The texture is so amazing, it is thin but silky at the same time. It rinses off well and leaves my skin hydrated. It also fragrance free and didn’t sting my eyes like many other cleansing oils. I’d definitely recommend this as a first cleanser if you have a sensitive skin. Lightweight and silky
