DAMDAM gifted me this product to test, honest opinions are my own.DAMDAM Nomad’s Cream Purifying Exfoliating Cleanser ($38/5.29oz) is a non-foaming gentle cream like cleanser with a plant based natural exfoliant made of Japanese Konnyaku - aka the same ingredient in Shirataki noodles and  the chewy bits in lychee jelly cups.This cleanser leaves my 40+yo combo skin feeling clean on days where I feel like I need the extra oil control and a gentle scrub to slough off everyday buildup from sunscreen or makeup. You don’t need a ton of product for an effective cleanse with this creamy cleanser. A small squeeze is enough to cover the face & neck. Because it is so gentle, I recommend removing makeup with an oil based cleanser first.Key Ingredients:Konnyaku - a Japanese root that gently dissolves to exfoliate + purify skin and boost elasticityTea Tree Oil - reduces break outs & calms irritated skinPhytic Acid - an AHA derived  from Japanese Rice to shrink pores, even skin tone and improve elasticityPros:Gentle yet effective, hydrating exfoliating cleanseControls oil without dryingFragrance FreeCons:If you need your face wash to lather or foam up in order for your face to feel clean, this one is not for youDoes contain Orange Peel Oil as a natural scentDoes contain Coconut Oil if you are adverse or allergic to coconut productsWould absolutely recommend if you’ve got combo or oily skin, looking for a gentle clarifying type face cleanser with exfoliating power Gentle Clarifying Scrub Type Cream Cleanser
