I first tried this due to a sample received in my Sephora order. I was impressed. I wanted to order right away, but then I saw the price. OUCH. Had to convince my self that it was worth it. So I waited until I finished my current cleanser and finally built up the courage to buy it. I still love it. The good thing is I feel it will last a long time as I use a small amount daily. I like the way my skin feels after I use it. Feels moisturized, energized, smooth and clean. Great product...but expensive.
