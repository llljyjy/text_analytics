This cream is an amazing treat for my skin!! I really love that it does not have a heavy fragrance to it which my sensitive skin is really thankful for! It is a thick and nourishing cream that really helped soothe my skin. A little does go a long way and it is super moisturizing! If you had dryer skin you will really enjoy this! Leaves you with a beautiful healthy glow and paired well under my makeup! Think this will be perfect for winter days!! Amazing for dry skin!
