First of all I want to talk about to texture, it’s like a super super thick oil that feels really heavy at first and then works into the skin eventually. I have love hate feelings for it for that reason. It felt like I needed a lot to be able to work it into my face and my neck without dragging the product and in turn dragging my skin. I used it as an overnight oil instead of my moisturizer because it’s so thick, and I didn’t have any problems with dryness in the morning which was pleasantly surprising. It acted like an overnight mask basically. It made my skin very radiant and supple the next day, but has not don’t anything for my redness in the last 2 weeks I’ve used it. If you have generally even skin that is just dry, you would probably like this a lot. If you are acne prone you might find this way too heavy. I have oily skin but need moisture at night, so this did the trick! There’s no scent in my opinion either which is great for sensitive skin. Overall I haven’t seen many drastic changes, but it hasn’t hurt to use either. Again, I think if you have drier skin this might be better for you. Just fine
