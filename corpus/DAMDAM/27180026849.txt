This oil absorbs well and looks very dewy but natural.  My skin has felt much more hydrated and less sensitive since using this rice face oil. Very happy to continue using and see if my complexion improves. So far I wear it during the daytime under makeup and it hasnâ€™t made me look more oily. Great face oil
