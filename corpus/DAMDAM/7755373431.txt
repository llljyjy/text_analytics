I love that it comes with a spatula to scoop out the product so I donâ€™t have to use my hands.  I have combination skin, and this moisturizer does a great job of hydrating dry patches and alleviating flakes and roughness while at the same time not feeling too heavy or pore-clogging on areas that are more oily.
