I have been searching for a new oil cleanser and this is a great one! I love that its not overly greasy, you do need 1-2 pumps of the product but I love that it does not feel stripping and leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated. I love that it is gentle and fragrance-free, too! New Favorite Cleansing Oil!
