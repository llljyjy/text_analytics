I have had amazing results with rice water so I thought I would give this rice oil a try. It feels amazing on my skin and is a good oil to use for gua sha. I have really upped my skin care routing recently and I liked how this product activates other products used after it. Excited to see how my skin improves while using this product. Leaves skin feeling hydrated!
