This product feels so weightless on my skin. It visibly made my skin look more hydrated and luminous so itâ€™s a perfect product to put on before packing on make up. I start out with my hyaluronic serum, vit c, this and a lightweight sunscreen and wait a few minutes before putting on foundation. Definitely worth it! Makes the foundation look so dewy!
