I wasn’t sure how an oil based cleanser would work but I am so impressed. This formula feels nice and reguvenating on your face. It doesn’t dry out your skin like a lot of other make up removers I have tried. After using this product for a few days my face felt fresher and smoother. I use it every night to remove my make up and finish by rinsing off my face with water! I have not tried to remove mascara with it yet but this cleansing oil removed make up well! nan
