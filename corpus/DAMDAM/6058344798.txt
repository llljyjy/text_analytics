I’ve been really enjoying using this oil. It’s so nourishing! The texture is very lightweight and runny, and you only need so little of the product. I use it at night and only sometimes in the morning. It takes a while for the oil to fully absorb, so unless you’re going for a glass skin look, you may want to save this product for nighttime use. I sometimes add it to one of my creams, and it also works wonders. It has a nice sort of neutral smell, not overly scented at all. I really love that this oil makes my skin less oily, as ironic as it sounds. My skin looks healthy and feels so soft! Highly recommend! nan
