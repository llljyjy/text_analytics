This balm cleanser is great.  It’s not abrasive enough to be an exfoliator but excellent as a cleanser.  Many balms still dry out my skin despite the oils but this balm doesn’t strip my skin nor make it feel tight and uncomfortable.  I enjoy it so much that I actually bought the full size at regular price instead of waiting for the semi-annual sale and that in itself says a lot. Excellent Balm Cleanser
