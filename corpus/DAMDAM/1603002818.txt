This is nice. No scent really, but I can see what others mean by it being tacky. That isn’t to say it doesn’t absorb well but it does leave the skin feeling like fresh mochi after it’s applied. I didn’t mind since I only used this at night before bed. Personally, not sure if I might be allergic to something in this because I used it in conjunction with the cream cleanser and I have been itching all over. Rather than wait to see which is the culprit I might just have to return both. nan
