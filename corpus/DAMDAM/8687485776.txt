So I simultaneously love and hate this product. Bad news first, the packaging is deeply annoying. While I think it’s lovely that a little spatula is included, it is uncomfortably positioned on the inner lid. The inner lid itself is awkwardly set so that a mild mess is made almost every time I open the container. Additionally, the formula itself looks great from the outset, but it initially feels heavy and absorption into your skin takes longer than expected.The good: Oh my god, my skin has been more glowy and clearer with the mochi mochi than it has with countless other moisturizers! Even though working the product into you skin is a bit of work, my skin felt delightfully hydrated all day, but didn’t feel weighed down at all in the 90 degree heat. Lastly, the scent is very delicate and I have not felt any irritation or sensitivity using this product twice a day.If you can get over a few annoyances, I think the Mochi Mochi Luminous Plumping Moisturizer is completely worth it.*Gifted* nan
