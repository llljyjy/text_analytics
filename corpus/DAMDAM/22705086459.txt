I like the dam dam Facial oil a lot however it is very expensive on the other hand it did not make me break out like  most facial oil, it feels very silky and luxurious. I mixed it into my moisturizer and it was very light weight on my skin unlike most facial oils The fragrance was a little herbal but faded quickly A very good lightweight facial oil
