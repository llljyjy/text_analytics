This moisturizer is amazing on my dry sensitive skin. I have tried sooo many moisturizers for my dry skin but they all had their flaws, this one has none (expect maybe the high price lol)! I love the way it left my skin soft and moisturized without any greasy-ness. That’s how you know the product actually absorbed into the skin. I have a very dry forehead and it breaks out easily if I use products that are too oily or products it just doesn’t like, this product hasn’t made me break out once and I have used it twice a day for a week! I personally don’t think it’s too heavy but I also have very dry skin so it’s perfect for me! I used to get out of the shower and have so much dead skin on my forehead I had to exfoliate off, but I did not have any since I used this product. I never give 5 stars but this product is a life saver!! I try not to use too much because of the price, but if u got the money and  dry skin, BUY THIS NOW!! Best moisturizer ever!!!!!
