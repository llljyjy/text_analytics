I most enjoy adding a few drops of this oil to my moisturizer each evening after cleansing and serums. Although there is no added scent the oil does have a natural earthy smell. It applies smoothly and leaves my skin glowy. In the morning my skin is hydrated and soft.  My one complaint is that the dropper doesnâ€™t hold the oil very well it just drips out without squeezing or applying any pressure to the dropper. nan
