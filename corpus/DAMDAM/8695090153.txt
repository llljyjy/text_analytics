I wanted more out of it. Used it twice since I got it & both times my skin didn’t feel hydrated enough within 10 minutes of applying. I actually developed a little cluster of milia on my forehead overnight after I used this, so I’m unsure if that was specifically the moisturizer or maybe the way it interacted with something in my routine? For the price I don’t think I would rebuy for my dry skin as it didn’t feel hydrating enough overall & the forehead milia isn’t fun. Gifted in exchange for honest review!
