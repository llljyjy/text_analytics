I love this face oil, first of all I loved its presentation, it is simple but very pretty and simple, the dropper is thick and I like that I can obtain all the product I want at once.  My facial skin is dry and I apply this oil three times a week after all my routine at night before bed and I liked it a lot, my face wakes up super hydrated the next day, I highly recommend it Loved this
