I love a skin balancing oil for my combination skin. This Dam Dam is a Rice drops Vegan face oil that did give me a natural glow and no clogging my pores. I would apply just two or three drops and it works! It has no fragrance and great for sensitive skin!  I would recommend this to all skin types. Amazing Balancing Rice Drops
