Absolutely love this mighty cleanser. It is a must have for me for the nighttime makeup removal. First step cleanser that do effective and feels so good on the skin. It requires minimal rubbing to wash off mascara and eyeliner, melts foundation right the way. Pleasant surprise afterwards as this oil cleanser does not leave an oily greasy residue at all. My skin looks and feels entirely clean. Also I need only one pump for entire face so this bottle will last a long time. Highly recommended! One of the best oil cleansers
