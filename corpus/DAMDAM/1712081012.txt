This product was gifted by Dam Dam in exchange for my honest review.This is made from a Japanese root crop, Konnyaku, a type of taro-like vegetable. It’s rich in ceramides which help preserve moisture in the skin. The cleanser is very gentle. It’s a cream cleanser so it feels like you’re massaging in a lotion while cleansing. I love this cleanser because it makes my face feel soft and moisturized. Even after rinsing, there is no stripped or dry feeling. My sensitive skin did not experience any irritations. I don’t notice any visible differences in my face but I can feel that my face is more hydrated. Note that if you prefer foaming cleansers, this may not be for you. It’s a cream cleanser so it does not foam up.  After rinsing, there is still a feeling of lotion on the face. I’ve used other cream and milk cleansers before and this is typical. I actually like cream cleansers, especially in the winter because it doesn’t dry your skin. I already have the Dam Dam hydrating essence water and the Dam Dam Mochi Mochi luminous moisturizer so this was a great addition for a complete Dam Dam routine!  With the Dam Dam products, I use the cleanser, followed by the essence water and then finish off with the moisturizer. Cream cleanser feels hydrating
