I absolutely love how rice water makes skin feel softer and look healthier and what I like about the rice drops oil is that, unlike rice water, it stays on your face so it can have a longer lasting effect. I like how moisturized it makes my skin feel and look after washing it off. The oil doesnâ€™t feel too heavy at all. feels very nice
