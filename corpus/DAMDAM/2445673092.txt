I’ve met few moisturizers over the years that I didn’t like, but I just can’t quite put my finger on how I feel about this one. I could put it on bone dry skin and it doesn’t feel like it absorbs, let alone when I put it on after the rest of my skincare routine. It feels too heavy for daytime but it’s not that thick of a cream. When I put it on at night, even the tiniest amount, I feel like I have to rub it in forever for it to not appear white on my skin. It just kind of feels tacky. I’m disappointed because I’ve been curious about this brand but this moisturizer just didn’t work for my skin or make my face feel more hydrated after a week using it. Not for me, but might be for you! nan
