Love this product! I find it hard to find a good exfoliating cleanser that isnâ€™t too too rough but still gets rid of dry skin. The granules are so soft it gently dissolves into skin! Leaving my skin moist and smooth to the touch. I definitely recommend if you have sensitive skin! Perfect for sensitive skin
