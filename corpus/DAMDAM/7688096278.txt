I was excited for the opportunity to try out these Rive Drops by DamDam as I’ve been working with their facial wash for a few months. I’ve been loving the brand and was very happy with these Drops as well. They are easy to incorporate into your skincare routine. I add mine right after washing, usually applying after any toners. They are lightweight and add a super boost of hydration, quickly diminishing my fine lines. I only needed about five drops to cover my entire face and neck. Definitely keeping these in stock. Thanks DAMDAM! super hydrating drops
