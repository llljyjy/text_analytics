I tried this product and I enjoyed it, i love how it has minimal ingredients and is a thin fluid oil consistency! It doesn’t lather up like others do but does remove most of my makeup, it did not remove my mascara as best as others I’ve tried! I used this as my first cleanse at night for my double cleanse night routine! This claims you can use it for a morning cleanse too and I think I would enjoy it because it does leave the skin feeling hydrated and supple! This to me didn’t really have any type of scent. Pretty good
