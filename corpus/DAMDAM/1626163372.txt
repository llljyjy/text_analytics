Okay, so I honestly didn’t know what to expect with this oil, but WOW. I use this with my Gua Sha tool, and it helps it glide effortlessly on my skin! Not to mention my skin is properly hydrated and I don’t end up looking oily later in the day. It’s a win all around! Definitely something I would repurchase. My only hesitation is that I already spend $$$ on skincare, and this isn’t cheap—so if you need something hydrating and balancing this is it! nan
