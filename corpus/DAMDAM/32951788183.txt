So far, I have really been enjoying this cream for my dry skin. It’s on the thick and heavier side, so I already prefer it to many other creams. I will say I only use this at night during the summer because it is a little too much for the day. However, I expect to use this day and night when fall/winter arrive. I wouldn’t say this cream is miraculous in any sense, but I have noticed that when I use this cream, my skin does not flake as much as it would with a different product. Overall, I’d recommend trying out this cream. nan
