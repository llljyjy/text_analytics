This is a really nice cream cleanser, especially for those with sensitive skin. Itâ€™s extremely gentle and leaves my skin both feeling soft and looking if brighter after use. For me it works best as a first cleanse, or second cleanse with a washcloth to ensure you can remove all product properly. Would definitely recommend. Very, very gentle
