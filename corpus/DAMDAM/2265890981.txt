I ENJOY USING THIS CLEANSING OIL FOR DAYS WHEN I WEAR MAKEUP AND THE DAYS WHEN I FEEL AS THOUGH MY SKIN IS DRYER THAN USUAL. AFTER USE, MY FACE FEELS CLEAN, BUT NOT STRIPPED. MY SKIN REACTED WELL AND THERE IS NO FRAGRANCE, SO THERE WAS NO FEAR OF SKIN IRRITATION. THE PRODUCT WAS NOT VERY THICK AND EASY TO WORK IN TO THE SKIN. nan
