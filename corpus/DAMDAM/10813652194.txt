Gifted from DAMDAM. This cleanser is super moisturizing and non drying! I have been circulating between a few different cleansers this winter to find what works best for me without drying out my skin and this has been a great swap to the Perfect Whip. After cleansing, my skin feels plump and not at all tight. I do feel that as this price point it is a more luxury skincare product, which deters me from giving it 5 stars. Overall a great product! nan
