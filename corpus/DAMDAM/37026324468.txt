My skin doesn’t take weather changes very well so this product caught my attention and I’m glad i decided to try it out! The drops applied smoothly on my skin, I apply it at night and leave it overnight so it can work it’s magic. The dry spots i had are now gone and it makes my makeup application so much smoother. You can even add this to your makeup routine and have a flawless finish. Love it!
