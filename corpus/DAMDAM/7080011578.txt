Overall this product is great! I’m not usually one to use oils on my face, but I find myself reaching for this one during my skincare routine. It makes my skin feel smooth and moisturized, without feeling heavy like most oils do. The only complaint I have is I wish the applicator was different. The oil seems to skin to the sides of the dropper & it’s easy to drip if you aren’t careful. nan
