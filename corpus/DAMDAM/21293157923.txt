I received this DAMDAM Mochi Mochi Luminous Plumping Moisturizer complimentary for my review. This moisturizer is a very nice creamy texture. I like that it has its own applicator, so you donâ€™t have to put your fingers in it. It goes on light and moisturizes my face well. The only con is it does take a while to absorb, and my face did feel a little greasy and tacky afterwards.  I think I would use this only a night due to the after feeling. Nice Moisturizer but oily
