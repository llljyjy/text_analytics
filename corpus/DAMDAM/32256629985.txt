This is a great product for couples who share products. It doesnâ€™t really have a smell. I was iffy at first about it but once I really started rubbing the product into my skin I noticed the tiny beads that were exfoliating. After rinsing, this product left my face feeling extremely soft as if I had just used a moisturizer. I was genuinely shocked at how good the product is because of the packaging. I received this product complimentary Exfoliation and moisturizer all in one
