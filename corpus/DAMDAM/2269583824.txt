I have combination skin, but my skin has been especially dry lately. I decided to try this product in hopes that it could bring life back into my dull, flakey skin. After trying this product I’m impressed, most facial oils absorb too quickly into my skin and do not provide long-term moisture. This product intrigued me because it both absorbs nicely into my skin and continues to provide long-term moisture throughout the day or night (depending whether I use it in the AM or PM). I apply this product after cleansing my skin while my skin is still damp, and I love how moisturized it makes my skin feel! Another huge plus is this product’s ingredients are Clean At Sephora!
