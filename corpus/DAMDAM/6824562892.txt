I have no idea how this product has so many 5 star reviews! It feels like you are slathering creamy coconut oil on your face. Even after washing it off, it feels like you have a heavy coating on your skin. It is such a gross feeling! It does not feel like it cleans, and it definitely does not exfoliate. Maybe if you are older than 50, live in the desert and have horribly dry skin, I could see how you might like this. It works great as an in-shower moisturizer or expensive shave cream. I threw out the manufacturer’s box, or I’d be returning this. Back to Tatcha I go! nan
