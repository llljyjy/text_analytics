I have combo skin and sometimes, my forehead gets SUPER DRY and FLAKY. I had a flare up of this recently so I was excited to try DAMDAM Rice Drops Vegan Face Oil. I absolutely love this lightweight oil. It is effortlessly absorbed into my skin. Iâ€™ve been using it night and day to help with my dry patches. Does not make my skin feel too oily. I also love the scent. It is a very grassy smell, which some may not enjoy, but I did. Definitely recommend. My face looks plump and glowy in the mornings! Combo skin love
