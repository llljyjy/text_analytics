This has fit seamlessly well into my makeup routine. I prefer a dewy look so I added a few drops into my BB cream/foundation and it blended onto my skin texture amazingly! I typically have dry/oily combo skin and this product helped keep my yucky shine away for the day. For skincare, Iâ€™ll dab some on in the morning and it helps my skin feel tight and fresh with no sticky nasty feeling. nan
