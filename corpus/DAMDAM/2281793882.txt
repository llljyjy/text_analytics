This is beautiful product, but the name is a little misleading. Just by reading the name of this product, I was expecting something with a luminous finish, but it gives a rather “matte, satin finish”, like it says its in its description. Lesson learned, read the description first. With that being said, I would say that this product makes a great moisturizer for someone with combination skin because I feel well-moisturized, but it doesn’t feel too heavy. It also creates the best canvas for makeup because my skin feels balanced and I know it won’t interrupt others being layered on top. The texture is nice and light, so it’s mainly used as my morning moisturizer. If I use this at night, I’d use it with an oil. nan
