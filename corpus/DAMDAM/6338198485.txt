This product is so beautiful and elegant. The texture feels comfortable but hydrating - it really makes me think “water cream” in that it is definitely creamy, but doesn’t feel thick or suffocating in any way. It just feels like my skin is being enveloped in hydration. It has a beautiful finish that isn’t too shiny when it dries, and it really is a fantastic moisturizer step right before skincare. I love this product more than I expected, and I definitely recommend it! nan
