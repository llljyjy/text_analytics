This cleansing oil has no scent and I really like that. The oil itself is on the thinner side, but a little goes a long way. It removes makeup well without drying the skin out. It is easy to wash off and it doesnâ€™t leave any residue on the skin. I am impressed with this cleansing oil and I want to try other products from this brand Works great
