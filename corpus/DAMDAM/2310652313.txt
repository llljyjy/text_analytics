Let me start by saying, I LOVE this product. While small, it packs a punch - I noticed an improvement in my skin immediately. I love the different instructions they advise on the packaging and tried them all out. Adding this while your skin is still a bit wet from cleansing lets the product really absorb. Mixing it into your favorite face lotion helps you glow. And wearing it as a mask at night makes you wake up with beautifully moisturized skin. This product looks great on its own or is an excellent base for makeup. The controlled dropper allows you to dispose the perfect amount,  and my skin felt refreshed right away. Highly recommend!
