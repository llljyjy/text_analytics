I am really happy to have discovered DamDam Rice Face oil drops. I have incorporated them into my skin routine, and have seen a difference since the first time trying them. The oil is very lightweight, and it did not clog my pores. The first few times I was using the drops directly into clean skin, but after a few uses, I decided to try out mixing them with my moisturizer as the box suggested and I love that. My skin feels soft and hydrated. It has helped a lot with my dry skin. nan
