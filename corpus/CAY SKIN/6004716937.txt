I received this product complimentary from Cay skin. This product goes on smoothly and blends into my skin really well. It does have a strong smell that lasts on the skin for a while. Aside from that, it does not leave a cast on the skin and I would suggest it for people with darker skin tones. Doesn't Leave a White Cast on Skin
