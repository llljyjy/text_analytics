This tinted SPF looks and sits really great on my skin! No white cast, and my skin looks dewy but not at all greasy after applying. It also seems to act as a skin perfecting formula too because I feel like it minimized my pores and has a little bit of a glow to it that makes my skin look like a natural but better version of itself. Plus itâ€™s great that it is SPF 45. Really really liked this one and will be restocking when I run out!Gifted by Cay Skin Lightweight and amazing tinted SPF!
