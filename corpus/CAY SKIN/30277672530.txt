I received this spf as a gift complimentary from Cay Skin. When I first applied this spf I didn’t understand what they meant by pearlescent. It wasn’t until I looked at my hand that I understood! It really is like the shimmer of a pearl! When I put it on I was worried that it was actually tinted and I hadn’t seen it, but it wasn’t! It all sunk into my skin, it wasn’t tacky, and was overall extremely pleasant. The smell of sunscreen was barely there. No white cast - amazing! nan
