Big fan of this spf. The pearly finish gives just enough glow without being too much. Also does not leave a white cast at all! I usually use Japanese spf because American ones are so heavy and white. I will now be switching to this! I love that it has niacinamide - it helps lighten my dark spots. I was gifted by cay skin and will be repurchasing Gorgeous glow and protection
