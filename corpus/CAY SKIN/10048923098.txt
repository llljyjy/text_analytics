I’ve only had mine for a few days now, so I cant report on the packaging like the reviews below. But this is basically Summer Fridays vanilla lip butter, but smaller, cheaper and with spf. Like I can’t tell the difference in scent and formula, they feel the same, last the same on my lips and most definitely smell the same. If you dont want to spend the money on SF, this is your best bet on experiencing what it’s like. It’s hydrating, makes my lips feel soft and I personally couldn’t taste the spf, I couldn’t taste anything really. So far so good
