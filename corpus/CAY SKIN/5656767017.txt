This product was sent complimentary from Cay Skin. Of the two face products I’ve tried from the brand, this is by far my favorite. This lotion has a subtle tint that blends in easily with my skin tone without giving that purple cast of death. It’s lightweight and doesn’t make my skin feel greasy or sticky. Overall, a nice hydrating moisturizer with spf! Lightweight Spf Moisturizer
