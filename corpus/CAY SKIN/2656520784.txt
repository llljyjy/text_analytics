I used up the one that came in the Sephora Sun Safety set. Overall I like the mousse texture. The sunscreen smell is not overpowering and it does rub in nicely. I wear moisturizer underneath and do not wear base makeup - and I had no issues with pilling.This is quite glowy though so if you are very oily I would probably skip this one. Additionally, if you are very fair, this may look way too bronze. I found that if I am in a sunny place and I need to reapply, the color sort of adds up over time and you end up looking extremely tan/bronzed, which would not be a good look if you are very fairâ€”you will probably end up looking orange. But this is a good option for medium skin tones. super dewy
