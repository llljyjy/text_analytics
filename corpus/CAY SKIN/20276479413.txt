I got a little sample of this product and honestly didnâ€™t have high hopes for it. BUT it actually looks pretty good on my skin, it s not heavy or oily. The texture is very light and it s very easy to spread just a few drops (which is enough) all over my face. Plus it has a very subtle tinting tone that perfectly blends in with my skin color. Good product
