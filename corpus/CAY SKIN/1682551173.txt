This sunscreen is going to be my go-to for the summer! It’s tinted (but not in a way that makes you look orange!) to apply perfectly on any skin tone...even my super pale skin! It gives off the most beautiful glow that gives me a nice, natural looking shimmer. I love that I didn’t have to rub and rub for ages to work the sunscreen into my skin. Since it’s tinted, I don’t have to worry about whitecast! It’s also incredibly nourishing and my skin didn’t feel sticky after application. It felt like applying a nice lotion or cocoa butter and reaping the benefits of its hydration. I love that it’s reef safe and will be bringing it on my cruise next week. Glowing!
