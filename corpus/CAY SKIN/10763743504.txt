This is really such a beautiful body lotion. I really love how it had sunscreen as I needed something like this. This makes.me truly happy to have and I feel this will be a staple.  Not to mention I highly enjoy how it has that familiar and nostalgic sunscreen scent but in a more smoother way.  Applying this I saw my skin feel well protected and felt more hydrated and with radiance. I enjoy this along with the creamy texture. Wonderful and protected
