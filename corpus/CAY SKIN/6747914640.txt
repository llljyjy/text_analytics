I have no idea why Winnie Harlow  and her team “developed” this product because it brings nothing new, and actually something very low-quality to existing sunscreen lip balm options. The sunscreen itself is composed of chemical sunscreens Avobenzone, Octisalate (sp?), Homosalate, etc. that are known skin allergens. And then it’s packed with cheap perfume agents and mediocre ingredients with a little bit of Green-Washing. For the price, very little of this mediocre product is offered. The “island glow” is a little bit of mica and tanner. Honestly, I can buy products of equal or better quality and performance at my local drugstore for a 3rd of the price and BOGO. If you like the look of this product I suggest you just shop drugstore sunscreen. Alternatively, you could look at stuff on this site by The Ordinary or The Inkey List if you’re looking for specific benefits and great formulas.I’m disappointed, and I have no idea why this brand would choose to lead their launch with a product that is sopoorly formulated and mediocre. Basically Drugstore Product at High-End Price
