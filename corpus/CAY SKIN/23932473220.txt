I have been using Cay Skin Isle Glow Face Moisturizer with SPF 45 for my outdoor skincare needs. First of all, I love that it has ingredients like sea moss and Niacinamide for additional skin benefits. Upon applying, there wasnâ€™t the typical SPF scent and no white cast was left behind. Instead, there is a lovely pearlized effect that flattered my skin. It absorbed pretty quickly into my skin and provided sufficient sun protection. Would recommend! nan
