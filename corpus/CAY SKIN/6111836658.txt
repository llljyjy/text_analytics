This was gifted by Cay Skin. I typically stay away from sunscreens that brand themselves as “dewy“ or “glowy“ because I tend to get oily in my t-zone throughout the day and these kinds of products will spread that shine everywhere, but I didn’t notice that effect with this sunscreen. I really like this for no-makeup days! Dewy but not oily
