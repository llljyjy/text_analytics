I received this complimentary from Cay Skin in exchange for a review; these are my honest thoughts.PROS:- high SPF rating- lovely sheer glowy finish that can be used under makeup or as a natural liquid highlighter on top of makeupCONS:- for some reason, this formula continually separates -- no matter how much I shake up the bottle or stir it with the pump, I can’t seem to mix the formula together, so I’m left pumping out a mix of a clear oily base and globs of the glowy pigment. if the formula could stay cohesive, I would actually be inclined to use it more; as it stands, I don’t find myself wanting to fuss with mixing it together every time I use it- be aware that the formula does contain some actual micro-glitter particles! pretty/a bit sparkly, but separates
