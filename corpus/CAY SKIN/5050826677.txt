Cay Skin Isle Lip Balm with SPF 30 comes with a thick, but not tacky consistency. The flavor is mildly sweet, like brown sugar. Because I am enjoying this product, I am constantly reaching for another application, as needed. Compared to other SPF balms I have used, this has no chemical aftertaste. I am really enjoying this product and am looking forward to trying the other products from Cay Skin. A great way to keep my lips safe from the sun
