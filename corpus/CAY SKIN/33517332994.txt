This glow SPF lotion is the best I’ve tried. It’s like the most lightweight foundation/highlighter with SPF - one and only product my skin will need in the summer. It blends well, doesn’t make my skin white and weird like a regular sunscreen would, it’s lightweight and absorbs well. My skin looks nice and there’s a light shimmer I love. I would really recommend this product. It was gifted by Cay Skin. Best SPF highlighter for summer
