Was super excited about this product after being gifted by Cay Skin. It doesn’t have too much of fragrance, but a little bit of an old cardboard smell. The consistency is a bit strange… almost foamy? But then it applies super nicely and blends into the skin very easily. Love the glow and can always use more SPF! nan
