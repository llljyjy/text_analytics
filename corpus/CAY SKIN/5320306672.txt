New favorite Face SPF. I was a fan of Super Goop, I liked it because it doesnâ€™t leave my skin shiny, but it is very siliconey and it feels like it just sits on your skin, and to put makeup on top of it, it smears right off. Isle Glow absorbs right away and it is amazing under makeup, I did receive this product complimentary from Cay Skin for review purposes. I am so so happy I found this. nan
