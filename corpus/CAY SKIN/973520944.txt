I usually use Super Goop Glow Screen and when I received this sample I really like it much better.  It has higher SPF and feels much less sticky on my face.  It also does not sting when I sweat like the Glow Screen.  I ordered the full size.  Itâ€™s great for summer with a very slight tint which works well under my 1 shade darker summer foundation. Lightweight and nice under makeup
