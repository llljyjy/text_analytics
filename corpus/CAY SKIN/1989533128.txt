First off, I love the luxe packaging and that it comes with a pump. It’s the prettiest sunscreen bottle I own! I like how it doesn’t leave a white cast but rather a nice glow to the skin. The Spf 45 is a great amount. My skin felt hydrated and doesn’t make me feel dry like some other sunscreens do. The scent is neutral and so faint, which is great since I prefer to smell like my perfume. Just wish it came in bigger sizes! nan
