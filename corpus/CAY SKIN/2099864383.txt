I really like this balm, it is comfortable on the lips so I have no qualms surrounding it’s quality. However, the applicator tip becomes unusable. I don’t understand why Cay hasn’t updated this yet when it is clear from customer feedback that there is a packaging issue. This worked fine at first but lo and behold, about halfway through the tube, the applicator becomes dysfunctional. It is clear so you can see that there is still product trying to push through, but the dispense hole has somehow collapsed into itself and is clogged. You have to push hard to the point that a chunk of balm spurts out. So it’s either toss it and waste money, or fight with the tube everytime you want to use it. I won’t purchase this again until the packaging issue is fixed. Great Balm, Terrible Functionality
