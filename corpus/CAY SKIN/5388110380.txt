This might be the glowiest a spf has left my face, so if your not into that shiny dewy look this is probably not for you. Very light weight texture and no white cast which was the big thing for me because I can not stand putting on spf that fees heavy and tacky and leaves me looking like a ghost. Gifted by Cay Skin. Amazing glow
