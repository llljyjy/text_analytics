My first impressions of Cay Skin’s packaging was minimal, modern but classy. The product comes in a beautiful neutral brown pump bottle. Cay Skin’s Isle Glow Face Lotion SPF 45 had a gorgeous application on the skin, it felt like lotion and sunscreen mixed but didn’t have a white cast or feel like heavy sunscreen. I have dry & sensitive skin so I would wear this as a base for sun exposure days under makeup. I got this gifted by Cay Skin but I would use this product weekly. Sunkissed and dewy skin
