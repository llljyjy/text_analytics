The face lotion comes in a really nice size I feel like you get a pretty decent amount for the bottle. It has a pump applicator which I like, the smell is fine I wouldn’t say it’s super beachy it’s more mildly fragrant. I was pleasantly surprised that the sunscreen itself is a nude color i think thats really nice especially if you’re someone who struggles to find a good sunscreen without a white cast. It’s pretty lightweight dries down relatively quickly I don’t feel sticky. Pretty glow, I can’t wait to see how this performs in the sun.gifted by Cay Skin Glowing SPF Skin Prep!
