I like this lip balm. I even ordered 2 more after I lost my first tube. I enjoy the smell, how it feels and looks on my lips. Itâ€™s glossy, no white cast of course, because it has a chemical sunscreen formula. Most lip balms with spf either have a low spf or have a sticky peeling texture. So for now this one is a winner for me. A winner in sunscreen lip balms for me
