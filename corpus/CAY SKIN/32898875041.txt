Gives my skin a very pretty sun kissed glow! I struggle finding spf that doesn’t make me break out but this is non comedogenic and has niacinamide in it! I like to use this one on area where I want extra “glow” and use the Cay mineral spf 55 on the rest of my face. This was gifted by Cay skin but when it runs out i will definitely be buying more! Reef safe, non comedogenic, and vegan!
