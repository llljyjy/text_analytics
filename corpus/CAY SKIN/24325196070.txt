My mom got this and it’s the worst product EVER. One star is too much but it’s the lowest I could go. This comes out already separated, my mom is a light/medium combo skin and it just moved around on her face, it wouldn’t go in. It turned her face orange and then it pilled all over her face. It was greasy and generally yucky. None of her foundations worked on top of it, it just separated and pilled.  If you have really DRY skin, you might like it but if you have OILY/COMBO skin, I would run away from this product. I don’t get how this has a 96% success rate with people. Greasy and wouldn't go into skin
