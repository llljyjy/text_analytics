I’ve always been curious to try out a self tanner/bronzer so this was perfect for me. I tried out this new Isle Glow Body Lotion and I love that it has a high SPF of 45! It blends pretty well and doesn’t have any scent. It’s kind of a thick texture so it’s hard to apply evenly and you have to rub it out though. I’d say the effect works well but I was cautious and used a little bit at first to try it! nan
