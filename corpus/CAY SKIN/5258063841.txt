This product was gifted to me my by cay skin. This is an interesting texture. It almost looks a little.. chunky? At first but it blends out to a nice golden/champagne glow. The texture of this is slightly greasier than the cay skin mineral SPF so if youâ€™re oily you might not like this. Since this is pearlescent I like to apply this to the high points of my face. I think it might be too much for all over the face. At least for my preferences. My pump came broken but they are kindly replacing it! Interesting texture but I like it.
