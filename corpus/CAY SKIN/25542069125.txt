I love that this SPF doesn’t leave any white cast! It’s tinted but blends well into any skin tone and essentially disappears, leaving a beautiful subtle glow. The smell is nice too (typical sunscreen smell) and love the pump packaging! My only qualm is the color of the packaging, wish it was another but that’s no biggie!! Gifted by Cay Skin for my honest review. nan
