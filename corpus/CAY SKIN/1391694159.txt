Maybe I’m just super sensitive but this tastes like chemical SPF to me and I wanted to put that out there since most reviewers don’t seem to taste it. It seems that the vanilla sugar is only in the fragrance as I can’t detect any other flavor even though it’s in the description. It’s not as strong as other SPF lip products I’ve tried and I don’t notice it as much after about 10 minutes but it’s definitely there to me. I don’t find the texture to be thick like others. I would say it’s middle of the road - not as thin and slippery as pure Vaseline but not as thick and balmy as the Saie lip balm. Maybe close to the Eucerin lip SPF in texture. I appreciate any company that’s offering SPF lip products but I won’t likely repurchase this one unless they fix the taste. My current favorite lip SPF that doesn’t have a chemical taste and is moisturizing is Revlon SPF 20 in the coconut flavor. For reference, I often taste weird chemical flavors in lip products that others don’t seem to notice. For example, the newer L’Oréal lipgloss balms and sticks have a slight chemical flavor and tingle on my lips. Sort of like when I accidentally spray fragrance too near my mouth. If you’re not sensitive like this you may not notice in this product so it could be great for many. Tastes like chemical SPF to me :-(
