Ugh. This is my first negative review ever on Sephora. I just don’t understand this product. It looks like it should be a tinted moisturizer, but on your face there’s nothing more than a sheer sparkle. I also don’t have sensitive skin, but within seconds of applying, I get a burning/itching feeling. It’s got to be from some strong chemical ingredients as the product on my fingers removed some of the print on the bottle. (Paint remover?!) Hoping to return irritated my skin, chemicals took the print off
