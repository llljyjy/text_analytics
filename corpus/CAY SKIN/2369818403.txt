First off, the packaging is SO CUTE. I love that it has Niacinamide in it. It has a great texture and doesn’t feel heavy on your skin at all. I that a super subtle glow to it which will be so perfect for the summer. There is a slight tint to it but I don’t feel that it really does any coverage. It blends out evenly and doesn’t leave an icky white pigment which is great. The only thing I don’t love is the scent, but it isn’t really noticeable once soaked in.*gifted by Cay Skin nan
