I received these products complimentary from Cay Skin. liked the fact that the Universal Mineral Face Lotion SPF 55 was a yellow tint, and I was expecting that to mean it would leave less of a white cast on the skin. I was mistaken, and unfortunately, the cast is quite noticeable. It did begin to lessen, and eventually disappear after about an hour. TBH, I would use this more as a sunscreen vs a face lotion. The Isle Glow Face Lotion SPF 45 has a beautiful glitter, and I will most likely use this on days I wear makeup, because the white cast and the glitter is too much for me, with nothing else on top. nan
