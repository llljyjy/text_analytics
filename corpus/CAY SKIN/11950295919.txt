Love how this lotion really leaves a nice glow to my skin! It’s a great consistency for a lotion that has SPF in it- not sticky or too oily like others I’ve tried in the past. Would definitely use just as a base with no makeup for a natural glowy look! I was gifted by Cay Skin but this is an honest review! Love the glow
