Iâ€™ve only noticed a reaction to two products in my life. First was an Olehenriksen serum, second is this sunscreen. I noticed small bumps all over my face after the two times I used this and decided to give it another go. Again, my entire face is covered in tiny bumps and feels a sting when I use skincare products afterwards. I immediately tossed the product in the trash. Break me out every single time
