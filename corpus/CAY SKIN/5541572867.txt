Lip mask that actually works! I been using alot of products on the market but nothing seems to work. Was going to give up on lip masks and just use lip blams but once I tried this I could really feel this product working on my lips. Been using it for the last month and it goes with me everywhere. Its nice to know this is made with good ingredients such as aloe stem and sea moss. The packaging is super cool and sleek. Will have to grab some for my friends for the holidays - canâ€™t have my friends experience dry lips! Say goodbye to dry lips!
