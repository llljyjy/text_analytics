I never thought I’d be writing a review for an SPF lip balm, but here I am.  This product is absolute perfection and what I’ve spent years looking for!  It doesn’t taste or smell of sunscreen, applies and wears smoothly (not at all waxy feeling), and is as hydrating as a lip mask.  I plan to purchase this as long as it is available! Lip SPF I've been searching for!
