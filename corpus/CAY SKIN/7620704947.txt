I used points to purchase the trial size of this product and loved it. My skin had a nice glow and it gave me a no makeup look when going to the beach. By day 3 of wearing it I decided I would get the full size. I have combination skin and put on Sephora’s hylauronic moisturizer some days and some days did not and it didn’t make a difference I was never dried out by it. I’m dark skin and gave some to my medium skinned friend and we both had a nice natural glow. I read a couple other reviews and I think you trade the white cast of SPF for a slight shimmer with this product. I am always looking for a SPF that doesn’t look like I’ve just slathered mayonnaise all over myself and this made me look good and protected me. A good point to remember that SPF is temporary and you must reapply- SPF 45 means you are only protected for 45 mins so as far as reapplying went I was never super shiny or greasy. Pack it for the beach
