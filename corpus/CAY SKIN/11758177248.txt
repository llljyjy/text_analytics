I love this sunscreen! It is leaves a very beautiful glow but not too much so I have been wearing it on it’s own on my no makeup days. It is not as shiny as the one from supergoop and it’s darker so I think it is great for all skin tones and screen types. We needed this and this new brand has finally delivered it. Gifted by Cay Skin but all opinions are my own. Natural glow friendly with dark skin tones
