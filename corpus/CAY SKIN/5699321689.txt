I was sent this Isle Glow Face Lotion SPF 45 complimentary from Cay Skin in exchange for my honest review. This lightly luminous SPF has a pearlescent tint that blends in well and imparts a beautiful glow to my skin. The lotion is free of synthetic and has a very pleasant light scent. It contains sea moss, niacinamide, hydrating nectar and panthenol which keeps my skin feeling soothed, moisturized and nourished. This SPF works well with makeup or over skincare for a clean, fresh-faced look. nan
