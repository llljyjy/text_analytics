I got a sample of this and it tastes like sunscreen. The scent and is overpowering and I had to take it off my lips immediately after applying. Iâ€™m not usually sensitive to that kind of stuff, but this one really bothered me. The product applied nicely and felt comfortable on my lips, but that smell is too much for me. nan
