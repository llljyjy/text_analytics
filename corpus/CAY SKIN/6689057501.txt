The sunscreen is absolutely fantastic! It blends beautifully, leaves a healthy glow. My skin is very sensitive, and happy to find out that the Isle Glow Face Moisturizer with SPF 45 and Niacinamide doesnâ€™t irritate my skin. The product was gifted by Cay Skin, however, I will definitely buy it in the future! What a product!!!
