Excuse the messy hair, haha but I was only wearing eyeliner and this beauty. I was gifted by Cay Skin and was very pleasantly surprised at how well this applies. It is smooth and I’ve worked it several ways already. It looks great on bare skin to give you that glow but also is wonderful under makeup. I’ve tried many different sunscreens, and I am so excited about this one for this summer and even year-round. I’m going to purchase one for my sister! nan
