This product is awesome! The packaging is super cute. 45 SPF is great for a face sunscreen.  I appreciate that the smell isnâ€™t too overwhelming as someone with sensitive skin (sometimes fragrance can be irritating). This was gifted to me but is something I will continue to use all summer long! nan
