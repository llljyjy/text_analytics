I got this because I love lip balms& glosses, and I was interested in the brand, and wow I’m so glad I picked this up! After ordering, I saw a pretty bad review of the other products from the brand, so I was nervous about getting this, but im so glad I went through with it. I love the packaging of this product, and the formula is more of a balm/gloss hybrid instead of just a balm (which is a positive for me) but by far my favorite thing about this, is the packaging! The applicator is rubber, and has a curve that is perfect for using on the lips. The rubber tip feels nice because it’s not a hard plastic, it’s comfortable to put on, and because it’s rubber it’s so easy to spread the product everywhere without an applicator eating up some of the product. All in all, I’d recommend the lip balm, but I’d check out Cassandra Bankson on YouTube for the other products. Great formula, awesome packaging!
