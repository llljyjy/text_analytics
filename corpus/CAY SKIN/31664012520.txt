Some people said it’s sticky, but I disagree! Not sticky at all to be honest and it smells more like vanilla than sunscreen (vanillin is I think the 9th ingredient in this lip balm). It leaves a glossy finish and I got it because my current spf lip balm melted in my car. 4/5 stars because there’s nothing that made this product significantly stand out :) smells more like vanilla than sunscreen
