Cay Skin Glow body lotion is a summer must have. SPF is an essential part of my skincare routine and Iâ€™m glad that this glow body lotion is lightweight and has the pearlescent finish. It makes my skin smooth, soft and glowing. It also applies seamlessly without having to worry about white cast. This lotion is vegan, gluten-free, cruelty-free, and comes in recyclable packaging which is a huge plus. Overall, I love using it and will definitely part of my skin care regimen. Love the glow!
