I am always excited to try new sunscreens out as this is my absolute everyday routine - I never leave a house without it. I really like this lotion, it’s super lightweight and I like the. texture of it, absorbs pretty quickly and wears nicely under my make up which is a must for me. Overall, I’m very happy with this product and would love to try something else from this brand. Amazing everyday SPF
