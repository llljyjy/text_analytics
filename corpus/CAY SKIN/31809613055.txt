Gifted by cay skin All three products have an incredible, sweet aroma and texture.  They also contain sunscreen of 30, 45 and 55. I loved the isle lip balm, it also smells like vanilla and its texture is not sticky at the end, it feels quite moisturizing.  I loved broad spectrum sunscreen, it has an oil-like texture and gives you a very nice glow on your face.  Finally, the universal mineral face lotion feels very light on the skin and is much lighter than a cream. I loved it. nan
