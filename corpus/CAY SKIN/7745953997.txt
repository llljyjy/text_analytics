I had never heard of this brand so I was curious to try it. I liked it a lot (you will know why I don’t give it more stars below)PROS:- Slightly tinted: it looks so beautiful on the skin. But it doesn’t provide any coverage.- It has a pearly iridescent glow: it leaves the skin looking so glowy, but not greasy.- Good ingredients, including antioxidants and niacinamide.- Clean at Sephora - Chemical sunscreen: doesn’t leave a white cast but may be irritating to some (not to me, but I don’t apply it around my eyes just in case)- Good spf level (45)- It got absorbed quite well, even applying liberally as it should. It left a glowy finish that May be too much for oily skin.- It worked perfectly under my makeup, helping to show a glow from within. Even used by itself looks beautiful.CONS- It has a slight scent. It smells good in my opinion but, as some people are sensitive to essential oils, they should make the products without them. - It is not transfer free, so if you touch your face, you will see the product on your fingers and it can transfer to your clothes.- It has bergamot oil that can be a photosensitizer and that’s why I give just three stars. I have melasma and I don’t want it to get even worse because of an unnecessary ingredient on the list. Cay Skin, please remove that ingredient, because the sunscreen is gorgeous!
