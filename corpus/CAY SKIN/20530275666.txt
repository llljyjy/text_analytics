Isle Glow Face Lotion is a very hydrating SPF lotion, it leaves no white cast and makes my skin glow within. I put it on top of my moisturizer then follow up with make up and I’m loving the glow effect. Mineral based is what I usually prefer as it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. I received this product complimentary from Cay Skin and would definitely recommend it Hydrating and beautiful glow
