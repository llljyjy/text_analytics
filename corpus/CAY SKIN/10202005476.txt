I bought the Sephora sun kit and this came in my bag. I was so excited to try a new sunscreen that promises a glowy finish. Unfortunately not only did it not give me a glow, it also broke me out badly.  I will never put this on my skin again, not worth the horrible breakout. Buy only if you enjoy breakouts.
