I received this product complimentary from Cay Skin. I was so excited to try this brand for the first time. Being a sunscreen snob, I couldn’t wait to get my hands on this Isle Glow Face Lotion. Let me tell you I’m in love with this spf lotion!!! It’s absolutely amazing. The texture is creamy and quickly absorbs into my skin. It blends into my skin beautifully and doesn’t feel greasy at all. It leaves my face with a sun kissed glow and makes my skin look radiant and healthy. It gives me the protection my skin needs everyday from uv rays and blue light, and makes my skin look and feel incredible. Plus it’s super hydrating. It’s perfect for my no makeup days. This one will definitely be in my collection from now on. Love the glow!!!
