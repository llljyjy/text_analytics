This is for the people who like a little glow!! It gives such a natural bronze look to the skin that was actually translucent enough to work for my pale skin but still gave a bronzed look. It has a slight sunscreen smell but I don’t mind it. The lightweight lotion blended in really nice and gave no white caste which I’m always about! It’s been perfect for a little illuminating boost under foundation! Glow!
