Complimentary from  Isle Glow. This is the first time I am trying  out this brand, and I am very impressed. I’m enjoying this sunscreen very much. It has 45 spf protection, which is really high. It doesn’t leave a white cast on my face, which is one of the most important benefits of this product. It doesn’t clash with my makeup. It gives my face a nice healthy glow that I love so much. This product doesn’t have any scent, which is perfect. I prefer  using products that don’t have any scent.  The consistency is smooth and easy to apply. I glide on like butter, but absorption is so fast.  I love how it doesn’t dry out my skin. It literally nicely applies nicely.  After application, you get hydrated soft skin that is  adequately protected from the sun.  It’s a great product.  I will repurchase for the summer. Lovely
