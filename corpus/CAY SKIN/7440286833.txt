I really like this product! It’s super light weight and feels great on my skin. It gives me the most natural glow throughout the day and has and it has no white-cast. My only problem is that I think I received a botched product because the oil is separating even though the product is new. Not sure if this is happened with everyone, but I attached a picture. It’s not really a big deal, it just means that i have to properly mix the product before putting it on my face. Also, for anyone wondering what the difference is between the two lotions, I think this one is more light weight and has a dewy finish, whereas the other one has more of a thick sunscreen feel and doesn’t leave as much of a dewy look. Overall, I would definitely recommend! nan
