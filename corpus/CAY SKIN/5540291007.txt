Finding a good SPF lotion that doesn’t break me out or have a terrible white cast is a little hard, but FINALLY there’s one on the market that doesn’t do any of that and does everything it needs to do! The glow from this lotion is incredible- it makes you actually glow and not look like a full on glazed donut. It’s so hydrating and provides great protection all day. It’s become my new go-to daily moisturizer and SPF! Complimentary from Cay Skin. Love This SPF!
