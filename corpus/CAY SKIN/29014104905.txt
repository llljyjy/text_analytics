I needed a chapstick with SPF in it and the sephora person led me to this, it was one of the only ones with SPF in the store, which is important to protect your lips from the sun. I have hyperpigmentation on my bottom lip so protecting it from the sun is important. iâ€™ve been using it for a few days now and i love it! i also have eczema which has negatively affected my bottom lip, it has flare ups and burns, has irritation, and peels randomly and sometimes it can happen based on the product I use. BUT NOT THIS TIME! I have not dealt with any of that ! its a gloss when you put it on but when the gloss disappears my lips still feel moisturized. I have also NOT dealt with any white residue from the spf, and im brown skin (like kelly rowland). worth the purchase
