I’ll start by saying it’s not a bad balm/gloss BUT it is an average lip product. It falls flat for me because of the smell/ taste. I get the brand is island oriented, but it smells like tropical spf, that alone makes me so nauseous. If I lick my lips or eat/drink with it on, I immediately feel gross. I was looking to try a new lip product specifically for the SPF factor but this won’t be it. No Thanks
