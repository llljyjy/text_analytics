PROS: Lightweight, Luminosity lasts all day, doesn’t make my face greasy (I naturally have oily skin), blends well onto my skin, my makeup looks great on top (some separation around my nose which is my t-zone). Cons: Does pillOverall, I REALLY like this product! I was in love with the MILK MAKEUP LUMINOUS BLUR STIC, and this product gives me that luminous glow with the added benefits of moisture and SPF 45. I love the packaging as well; it’s minimalistic and chic at the same time IMO. The pilling occurred after I directly applied the ILIA C Beyond Triple Serum SPF40. You need to let the CAY Sunscreen settle for a few minutes before directly applying your makeup or other products. Stipple and bounce your product on top-instead of rubbing motions. I use this product as the last step to my daytime skincare regimen. As for the clumps-I warm up one full pump between my fingers and then press onto my skin, then I’ll smooth it out. The Sephora representative was hating and trying to steer me away from purchasing this, but boy am I glad I didn’t listen to him and the reviews. Not every product will work for everyone! I'm Glowing, It's a YES for me...
