Gifted by Cay skin. I’m pleasantly surprised by the lack of oiliness or greasiness from this product given that it has SPF. I have combination normal oily skin and I felt like it was lightweight. It was about our five or six where I noticed a little extra oiliness but that’s to be expected with my skin type. The glow is very nice I liked how it looked under my foundation. I think the niacinamide is an added bonus. Super solid product but it is a little pricey for the 1.5oz you’re getting. nan
