I love the product. Smells great and its not too strong a sweet smell. It’s not as runny as the Kopari and not as thick/balmy as the Jack Black. I like that it has spf to protect my lips and the formula hasn’t burned my lips at all when I use it after my lips get chapped to the point of constant peeling from going a day without anything on. I wish packaging was cuter but whatever, the product itself is great. Unique lip-hugging applicator tip
