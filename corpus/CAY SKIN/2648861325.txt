I received the Isle Glow Face Lotion SPF 45 complimentary from Cay Skin. This is a chemical sunscreen that has a peachy tint and leaves a dewy finish. Despite my skin having a yellow undertone, the color blends seamlessly and effortlessly. My personal preference is to go with a natural finish sunscreen, so I do have to set it with a powder. But overall, itâ€™s a pretty good sunscreen if you like one with a glowy finish. I will be using it more during the summer. Great glowy sunscreen!
