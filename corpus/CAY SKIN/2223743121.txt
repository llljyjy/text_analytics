Ok, I’m really liking this tinted sunscreen. It’s very easy to apply and it blends flawlessly into my skin I’m light to light-medium complexion and it looks like my skin but more even toned and glowy. The glow is very natural no shiny particles all over my face just gentle glow. The consistency is kinda water cream, as soon as you start massaging it into your skin it just sinks in. Also it has very very light kinda citrusy scent but really very faint, almost undetectable. Overall great product!! Natural glow, easy to apply
