It’s like the “Lays potato chips” of lip product. I just got it and 2/3 of it was air. Had to squeeze out SO much air to get product out to try it. It smells great, but tastes like chemical (I kinda was expecting that with an spf, tho). The applicator is actually very nice which is why I gave it two stars. Only going to use it when I’m out tanning or In the sun, so hopefully it lasts me the money I dropped on it. I’m just salty that it was only 1/3 of the way full. But it’s really soft and isn’t sticky at all. And I like the glossy but spf sentiment we got going on here. 2/3 air 1/3 actual product.
