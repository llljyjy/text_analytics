I went to a theme park the other day and I thought why not try this product out on my legs - can you say, GORGEOUS!! I absolutely love the glow this gave me without the chunky glitter. I do wish it spread a bit easier, it took a few pumps to cover one leg as the product didn’t spread easily.  Other then that it’s lightweight and stunning, so excited to use on my chest and shoulders this summer! Wish the texture was a bit smoother
