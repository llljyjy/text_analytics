Glow products can be tricky. Some of them make your face shine brighter than a disco ball, and for my already oily face it is a big no-no, but... This product creates such a beautiful glow! It adds to the natural glow of your skin and looks somewhat natural. Also, to my combo skin pals out there who are afraid that chemical SPF will make your break out - this one did not. It has a lighweight texture with a very subtle tint which I would assume will work for the most skin tones. Must have all-year around, but I can defintely see myself wearing this on the daily basis in spring and summer.  The product was gifted by Cay Skin in exchange for an honest review. nan
