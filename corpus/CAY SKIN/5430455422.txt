I was kindly gifted by Cay Skin, a few items from their SPF line. This one is by far my favorite. I have naturally dry and sensitive skin, and get very pale in the winter. I love the texture of this, and found that I could just wear it alone and be alive-looking or use it as a base under more makeup. It wears really well throughout the day and didnâ€™t make my skinny flaky or itchy. I even boasted about it on social media which is rare for me to do these days! WOW WOW WOW
