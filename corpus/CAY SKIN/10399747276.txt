I wish I could give this 100 stars.  I’m a total warm weather, water, sunshine girl.  However, if I’m in the sun for 5 mins without spf on my lips I get a fever blister.  I’ve tried every lip sunscreen on the planet and just accepted that there will always be that weird aftertaste and dryness - it is what it is.  Some are def better than others.  And then THIS!  I’m completely blown away.  Zero weird taste, zero drying… what magic is this?!  I’m buying 5 to make sure I have one everywhere.  Everywhere. voodoo
