I have been using it with different skincare layered underneath, and have not had the best results. For a product claiming to be aimed toward oily skin, it doesn’t set whatsoever. There are a lot of very fine fglitters in it which my skin found irritating and because it doesn’t set it slides and finds its way into my eyes, causing irritation. I would love this type of flow for the body and am interested in the body formula, but this is a no for me for the face. There are better sunscreens out there
