I liked the idea of it, I liked that the smell was not super potent like other sunscreens, however, regardless of how much I shake it to try to mix it, it separates so badly from the second I pump it out. Very separated and I try to blend it but have a hard time. I am not sure if I just got a bad batch, but it appears other people have the problem too? Disappointed
