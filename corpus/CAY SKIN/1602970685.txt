Amazing product, the “glow“ is just a neutral tint with liquid highlighter mixed in. It’s not large flecks of glitter or anything like that, it’s very inconspicuous and subtle. THE SMELL THOUGH. It smells like baby spit up. If you’ve ever been spit up on by a baby, you know exactly what I mean. I gag anytime I put it on and IMMEDIATELY douse myself in perfume. If you can stomach the smell then 10000% buy it. Maybe get a sample or try in store first! Amazing Subtle Glow, Baby Spit Up Smell
