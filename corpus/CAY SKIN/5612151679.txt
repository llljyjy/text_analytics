Just one pump on the back of my hand was enough for me to know it will be going back to the store! It contains visible tiny pieces of glitter all over it, under sunlight it looks like a night club of sparkles. Definitely not the glow I was expecting to achieve from this product. Also, it’s heavily fragranced. Sadly, it’s a pass. Glitter City!
