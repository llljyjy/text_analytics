I’ve used a ton of different spf lip balms over the years and this one is a delight to use. A lot of lip balms that contain spf have a slight white cast and/or taste terrible, but I put up with it because I need my lips protected from the sun anytime I venture outside. This lip balm has absolutely zero white cast, it truly looks like you’re put on a lip gloss, and it has no weird spf taste! Because it’s glossy, the staying power isn’t that long, but I don’t care because it’s that good. I’m still making my way through my first tube and already bought a second tube so I’m never without it! Lovely!
