Gifted by Foreo. So happy to have been gifted the Foreo Bear and including it in my daily skincare routine. I’ve never had a skin care microcurrent device before. I have a few problem areas that I’ve been going to town on! I love how easy it is while following along whichever treatment you choose. I also love that you can adjust the strength of current. The Foreo Bear is a nice sleek design and fits nicely in my hand. After each treatment my skin is glowing and plump. I can’t wait to see what my skin looks like months from now after consistently using. Price wise I do think it’s high, but with skincare I think it’s a nice investment. Would definitely suggest getting this if your able too! Very cool device
