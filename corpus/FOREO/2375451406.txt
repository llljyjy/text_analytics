I was super excited to try this out. I have the Nuface Trinity so I am not new to this kind of product. What I liked about this was that it’s sleek and easy to hold. There’s vibration as well as electro current. It works well with aloe but I haven’t tried their serum serum serum yet. The micro current gets very strong so I recommend starting with the lower intensities. I like that there are guided exercises from the app. However I didn’t like that the only way to start the massage is through the app. I would imagine it to work with AND without the app. You cannot configure settings or even start the vibration/ micro current without the app. Cool device with preloaded exercises for the face
