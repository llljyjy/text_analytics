I recently received the new BEAR microcurrent tool complimentary from FOREO. Now that I am in my mid 30s I care A LOT about my skin aging. I was so excited to give BEAR a try because it targets signs of aging, like wrinkles and fine lines. While I am religious about my skincare routine and I get Botox, I also want to incorporate other methods into my routine so that I can look my very best. This microcurrent tool is incredible - it visibly changes how my face looks. Almost immediately I notice my face looks lifted and youthful and has an overall glow. Itâ€™s super easy to use as well because the app that goes along with the BEAR includes routines you can follow. This is a nice addition to my anti-aging routine. Great for Mid-30s
