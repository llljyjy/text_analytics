I was a sceptic, and watched ton of YouTube videos about this device. Regardless of seeing negative feedback I gave this a try. I’m 38 and easily retain water, minor wrinkles but by mane issue is contour of my jawline and forehead. I did try this with and without Foreo serum, and I don’t think I’ll be purchasing the serum; but i was floored to see results pretty quickly. First, I didn’t awake up as puffy, second skin looked smoother, glowier. I could feel slight muscle contractions especially on my forehead when working the device. Massage and treatment for your face in one. I truly believe this thing works and will continue using it. I believe it does work for me!
