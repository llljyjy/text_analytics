I am actually enjoying this product more than I expected, honestly! I’ve never used a cleansing device before but this one is so cute in the pastel mint green color (not currently listed, but name is Pistachio) and feels really nice on the skin. It’s not too abrasive at all and it’s easy to rinse off after using with my gel cleanser every evening. I’ve been using it 60 seconds on a medium intensity setting each night and it’s helping me make sure I spend enough time washing my face plus feeling a little more fancy like a massage. It’s small enough to where you could easily put it in a purse or travel bag along with the cable without any issues, and the price point is just accessible enough where it could be a good gift. Enjoying using it
