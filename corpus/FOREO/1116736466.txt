I had a nuface device (which died a few months after the 1-year warranty expired). This is by far a better product. The product quality is just better. Simpler, smaller, easier to manipulate. Foreo also stands by its product for longer (warranty). It’s more powerful, with far more treatment options. The results are much better, and they happen quickly. I was using the other device for 15/20 minutes at a time to see results; this takes less than 5 minutes. You can use the app or just do your own thing. I’ve easily integrated it into my daily skincare. As long as I use enough conductive gel/serum, and set the intensity to what’s comfortable for me, it’s totally discomfort-free. The better microcurrent choice
