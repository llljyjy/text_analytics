Gifted by Foreo. I’ve been using it for the past few weeks, and it’s easy to use! The app is helpful with tutorials/treatments and other questions you may have. It’s my first time using a microcurrent device, and the sensation on my skin is tingly, haha.  While I haven’t seen any major results as of yet, I do enjoy using it. I hope with continued use, I’ll see big differences! nan
