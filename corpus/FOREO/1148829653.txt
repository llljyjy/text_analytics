*gifted by FOREO but it’s my honest review after trying it out :) This luxurious microcurrent device is supposed to help reduce the appearance of wrinkles, fine lines, sagging skin and overall sculpt the face for a lifted appearance. You have to sync the device with the FOREO For You app to access their guided facial toning routines (as well as adjust the BEAR device settings) and its very easy to follow along. FOREO recommends cleansing your skin first (use a gel or foam cleanser; NO OIL CLEANSER) and then using a water-based serum (hyaluronic serum) for the microcurrent to work and the device to glide on smoothly without any friction (we don’t want any tugging on the skin). Don’t forget to always glide the device using upwards motion for a lifted result. I like it to use it once a day for around 2mins and I definitely noticed it giving me such a tight, plump effect.,.like, my face overall looks like I get a facial everytime I use it! I’m sure with continuous use I will see better results in minimizing my fine wrinkles! This device is definitely a splurge but hey, we don’t mess with skincare in this house! Whatever works, we make it a holy grail! Love the facial massage results!
