I love facial tools and I own a couple. The pros: quick no peeping time, fits comfortably in hands, the strength can be adjusted and definitely can see results and easy/quick app setup.Cons: You can only use it with the app. So this is why I took off a star. But overall I really like it and is a very good investment. Great tool!
