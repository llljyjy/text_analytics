I tried this for a week and decided it wasn’t for me. Changing all settings via the app on my phone was a pain and inconvenient. The bristles were much shorter than I was expecting. It felt like more of a massage than a cleanse, and it didn’t feel like a deep clean. I liked that this was rechargeable without batteries, but overall I found a high-quality product at the same price point which is a much better user experience overall. nan
