I’ve been really loving my Luna 4 Cleansing and Massaging Brush. I love that it gives you different option modes to choose from, if you want gentle, deep or regular mode. My skin feels so refreshed, smoother and softer after using it. Now every evening I look forward to doing my night skincare routine because of how much I enjoy using this skincare tool. And definitely improved how my skincare products absorb to my skin. I absolute love it. It’s very relaxing too, feels like after a spa. And I loved how well it was packaged. My skin feels so clean and soft
