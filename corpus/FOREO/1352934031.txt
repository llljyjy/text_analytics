Foreo Bear is a device that uses microcurrent. I have used the Bear for the past week now and have noticed results on my skin. After each session my skin looks glowy and incredibly smooth and clear. The bear requires you to download an app in order to use the device. The app has a couple of treatments you can pick from but I’ve only tried and used the full gym treatment. After my 1st session with the Bear I broke out a little on my forehead. I read somewhere; some people may react to microcurrent for the first time. The small pimples on my forehead did disappear after a few days. I don’t have too many wrinkles and fine lines so I cannot comment about that but I would imagine over time it will improve.  Gifted by foreo in exchange for my honest opinion. Glowy skin
