I hardly ever use facial tools but was curious about this one. I’ve loved the foreo Luna but I wanted a tool that could sculpt my face so I tried this Bear. I loved how this felt like a massage at the same time as contouring my face. After using my face looked a little bit more lifted so can’t wait to see long term results! It’s a big tool so it’s a bit awkward to hold but maybe I’m better suited for the mini. nan
