I got the Pink one! It’s very easy to move along your face especially if you use the recommended serum prior on your face. I am so pleasantly surprised with how easy it is to use and how helpful and well designed the app it as well. At first I was so hesitant about this product because I didn’t know how to use it properly. The app makes it SO easy. You open the app, select your device, and then pick the treatment you want. The treatments are about 2 minutes and it recommends you use the serum before starting. I will say that is a tiny bit annoying because this device isn’t cheap to begin with, and the serum is $59. Make sure when you put the serum on, you don’t rub it in as the the device needs it to help glide along the skin. I love how quick this treatment is and I can do it without a mirror …aka while I watch tv. I’ve done it nearly every day for the last week now and love the results. My thin lips are a little more full, plump even but not like they were injected, my skin is glowy and my sagging cheeks are a little perkier. It takes collagen a long while to build, I can’t wait to see what happens after 3 months of regular use. It’s not going to be results like a facelift or anything like that but you will look much better. Gifted by FOREO nan
