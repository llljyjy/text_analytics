I have high expectations for the FOREO BEAR toning device. BEAR Device came with a 2ml Sample SERUM, USB Charger Cable, Quick Start Guide, Stand, and a cute Travel Pouch. I didnâ€™t like the serum because it left a sticky residue behind so I started using my regular HA serum that makes a good conductive gel. This device is super easy to use. You have to use it on clean and dry skin, after applying a conductive serum to your skin, distributing it evenly. The device has 5 intensity levels, which I noticed increases the microcurrent, but if used on the lowest level it can be sensed. I had many microcurrent facials in the past, and even with the lowest intensity, you could feel the skin being pulled and tingled so I hope this device will give me the results. The app is informative and after synchronization with the device, it provides great information and personalized treatments. Fun to use
