Gifted by Foreo. The Foreo Bear is a new experience for me. I love the pamper sesh that can actually give me results with continuing use. I started off low and just relax and contour my jaw and neck. The I go to under my cheek then over my cheek. It fits well in my hands and I like the use of it so far. I also wonder if this is okay to use in my legs and arms as well. I love the vibrant pink color too. Just wish wasnâ€™t as pricey for the serum to use with it. Love this design
