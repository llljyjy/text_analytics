I have never used a device like this for skincare so I was very excited to finally try this out. You have to set up an account and program the device through an app - very cool. The modes one can use are Regular, Gentle, and Deep Cleansing. I especially fell in love with the firming massage routines (the shiatsu and lymphatic drainage are my favorites). After a couple of weeks of using, I have noticed an improvement on my combination skin. My serums and makeup applies easier now. Amazed
