Was a little skeptical because it seemed most people got this for free from Influenster. The people complaining about the app aren’t wrong but you don’t need to use the app every time as I don’t. I used it to set my preferences and left it to the wind. Love the yellow as it is different and happy. I believe it def works best with a foaming cleanser perfect addition to routine
