This pro duct was gifted to me by FOREO. l have use this several times since I’ve received it and while I have yet to see any toning I definitely think my skin is glowing. I know that it will take many treatments to see real results. I am excited to use this because I’m trying to target fine lines oh my face and get more of a glow. I recently had a glow facial and it cost me $180 so I’m happy with the results I am seeing from a device that I can use continuously versus a one time treatment. I think the best part for me is I can improve the quality of my skin appearance at home in five minutes. I’ve enjoyed taking the five minutes to myself to use this and practice self-care. nan
