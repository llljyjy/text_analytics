I have been using this for about 2 weeks (today was session 11 over 13 day period) and I went ahead and did a side by side because I felt like I might be seeing some improvement!  OMG, I can’t believe it!  I see lift in my jowls which is my biggest concern and even my double chin is improving.  I am excited to see what 30 days looks like!  I used the serum that came with it, but have been using the ordinary hyaluronic serum instead for the rest of the time.  My skin is very dry (I am 42) and I use the tower 28 spray to keep it moist in between facial areas.  Photo on the left side is today.  No foundation or anything, I am just wearing cali ray mascara, hourglass eye pencil and tatcha silk sunscreen only.  The before picture on the right is right after my first session, nothing but serum on my skin and I am clearly prone to redness! ok…I’m impressed!!  Mini facelift in 2 weeks!
