So far I really like this toning device but I wish I could use it without first having to download the app.  Other than that I really like this! I am starting to experience some droopiness around my mouth and jawline and this has helped to firm it up. It’s not extremely noticeable but noticeable enough and I’ll take any kind of improvement! It doesn’t zap my skin like some others I’ve tried just make sure to generously apply the serum on your skin while using this. This was gifted by FOREO. Works well but wish I didn’t have to use an app
