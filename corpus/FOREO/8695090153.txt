(Gifted by Foreo) I already had the app to use with my Foreo UFO, & I love the guided facial routines! Takes the chances of user error down drastically because without it I wouldn’t know what I was doing.Microcurrent is great for lifting your skin which helps your skin look more plump & hydrated. It does take time however! Consistent use & patience are key if you want true results. This mini is great for the smaller areas of your face like around your mouth & eyes. Still good to use on the rest of your face but definitely want to try the original size for overall. So far very happy with it but I do acknowledge I need more time with it (months even) to truly see results! It’s an investment for down the line. Only time will tell!
