I have had my eye on this device for so long so I was thrilled to receive this complimentary from Foreo and to be able to finally use it! At first use it took a few seconds to get used to the microcurrent, it’s like tiny pricking feelings but more of a little surprise that painful at all. I love using the app to pick my facial workouts it makes it a lot easier to make sure that you’re using it properly and you know if you have it in the right position that it’s working because you can feel it! I asked felt immediately that my skin had just a little bit of tightness in the best way so I am super excited to continue using this! I’ve been waiting so long..
