[Gifted by FOREO] The FOREO Bear has been on my wishlist for so long! Well, most of the FOREO products are but I can never justify the spend so I was extremely excited to be gifted this product. I personally used this with my normal hydrating serum and it was a really enjoyable experience. I was a bit nervous at first that I would get shocked or something would feel unpleasant, but there was none of that at all. For whatever reason, I havenâ€™t been able to get my app to download the preset routines, but even just using it on its own was a lovely experience. My cheekbones definitely looked more prominent after use, and I hope to continue using this to see more results going forward! nan
