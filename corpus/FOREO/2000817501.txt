I’ve heard nothing but great things about foreo so it was time to try it out for myself! I love how accessible the price is, that was the first thing that caught my eye! I immediately thought of the people I could also gift this to, it makes such a thoughtful yet luxurious gift. This is one of those things that people typically don’t like to spend money on themselves for but as a gift it is perfect! You can control the intensity with 8 different pulsation options. I’ve been using the highest setting daily with my favorite facial was and my skin has never been softer, more radiant! I love that it’s travel friendly, I recently left for a road trip and this was so easy to just pop into my travel bag without it being too bulky like other facial cleansing brushes ect. Needless to say, I am obsessed! Forever obsessed
