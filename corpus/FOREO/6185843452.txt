I have been wanting to try out the Foreo line for soo long - I was super excited to get my hands on the Bear Mini! (complimentary from Foreo) First off.. how ADORABLE! It is the absolute perfect size for easy on the go access and to even throw in your travel bag. When using, it fits perfectly into all the contours of my face (especially in the hard to reach areas like above lip and chin). I’m still trying to get the hang of the app a little bit, but so far I am loving the app routines and how it shows you exactly everything you need to do step by step for the micro current facial routine! I love using the Bear Mini especially before my makeup routine to really carve out the contours of my face and start my base with a glowy smooth complexion! Definitely is a treat to use, and what I look forward to everyday, it’s like having a spa at home!! If you’re on the fence I would most definitely try it out - you won’t regret it!!! So much fun to use!!
