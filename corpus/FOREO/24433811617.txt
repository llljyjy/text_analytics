I recently was gifted by Foreo The FOREO BEAR aims to enhance your skincare routine.This device uses tiny electrical currents that gently stimulate the muscles in your face. This provides spa-level results in treatments you can easily do at home.The BEAR’s innovative Anti-Shock System uses ultra-smart sensors to scan and measure your skin’s resistance to electricity at a rate of 100x per second. It automatically adjusts to best suit your skin for an unwavering quality of treatment every time.Each treatment takes less than three minutes, which was short enough that it didn’t feel like an overwhelming addition to my nightly routine, but just long enough that it made me feel more relaxed before getting into bed. So far I am loving the Foreo Bear and I can’t wait to see how my skin transforms with longterm use. At home selfcare
