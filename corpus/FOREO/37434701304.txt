Since my other face brush brand went out of business I had to explore other options and Foreo did not disappoint! I love how customizable it is - there are three different cleansing modes and five different massage routines for you to chose from. My favorites are the regular cleansing mode and deep tissue massage. I can already tell I get a deeper clean than just using my hands and my skin feels clean but not stripped. I love how easy it is to clean and you donâ€™t have to buy replacement heads (which is the issue I had with my last brush). A must have!
