I received this device complimentary from Foreo for my review. I have only been using it for a couple weeks, so I this is more of a first impressions review than a long term benefits review… but so far I’m loving it! It’s well designed and east to use device. The app is really clear and I love the guided treatments. I honestly think I see lifting in my lip area after use!  I’m really excited to see the results after a couple months of regular use! My only criticism: the serum From Foreo is pretty expensive, so I might explore other options. But I will say that the Foreo serum does work well! I tried a simple hyaluronic acid serum and it wasn’t slippery enough to provide a smooth glide. Overall, a great device if you are looking for a home micro current treatment. Really cool!
