I am a huge fan of microcurrents and have been using this technology for years. My face usually gets puffy in the mornings and microcurrents make the swelling go away, and I immediately see the difference. I’ve read in the reviews below that you can’t use the device without the app, but you actually can. I think I had to register my device at first, but I never open the app anymore. You can change the setting, as well as start the device by pressing the button on it, and it turns off by itself when it’s time to switch the area. I feel like you also don’t need fancy Foreo serums that are supposed to be used with the device and are quite expensive. I just use aloe gel (no alcohol!) and everything works fine. The device comes with a charger, but the battery lasts for months, I use it quite often and almost never need to charge it. Gifted by FOREO. Does wonders to my puffiness
