I received this Foreo Luna 4 as a gift to review for my honest opinion. I love that this has different settings and it’s easy to use it just needs a little bit of face wash and it lathers it up really nice. It’s not too harsh on my skin and it is gentle enough without stripping my skin. I don’t know the benefits of washing with a device since I’ve always used my hands but it feels like it really gets into your skin and it’s an effective clean Easy and convenient
