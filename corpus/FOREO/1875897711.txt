I’ve been loyal to my Clarisonic since I was in college (almost 10 years now!) but the brush heads are expensive and the battery has started to lose charge. I grabbed the FOREO Luna when it was on sale and i have been extremely impressed! It feels really good on my skin and does a great job sudsing up my cleanser. It feels less irritating and abrasive than the brush heads on my Clarisonic. Charge lasts a long time and travels so easily. I love it! I’m a convert!
