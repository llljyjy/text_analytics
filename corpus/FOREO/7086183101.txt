Gifted by FOREO. Ok not going to lie I wasn’t expecting the little pulses at first. Some areas do feel like a pinch but it’s nothing unbearable. I love how you use this through the app so you know exactly what to do and how to use it. My skin also felt oddly smooth after using this but make sure to use a serum or something on your skin before using this!! I learned the hard way that it hurts a little more if you try doing this on dryer skin!! Great if you use it right
