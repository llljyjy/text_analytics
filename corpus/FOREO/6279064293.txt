I really enjoy this facial tool. It’s great for sensitive skin because of the multi settings available. There is gentle, regular, or deep cleansing options. These options are determined by the speed of t sonic pulsations. I love that this device can be used as both a cleanser and firming massage tool. There are 8 customizable massage routines available. I have autonomic dysfunction and often have tenderness around my facial bones. This massage gently helps with tenderness and relaxes me. It helps my serums and moisturizers absorb quickly into my skin and deeply, ensuring I’m getting the maximum benefits of each product.  I love each setting equally as they are good to customize for my skins specific needs that day. The silicone bristles are very soft and easy to clean. I absolutely love foreo products. I think it’s so cool how they hook up to a phone app and love how they are 100% water proof. I love foreo products. This didn’t disappoint!
