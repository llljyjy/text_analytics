i just returned the product because after trying to use it daily for 7 days, it kept shocking me at random. Even with loads of their gel/serum (which isn’t great because it’s a bit lumpy) and the intensity lowered all the way down, the massager would still shock me. When I could get through 2 minutes of the session, I’d see some definition around my cheekbones. I would’ve given it 2 stars, but when I went to return it in-store, the manager was so rude to me, I decided to return it myself via mail and opened my laptop to write my first ever review on here. People should be aware of how disappointing this product is based on how much hype there is around this product, its high price point, and the level of customer service Sephora is offering in their stores. it's quite shocking... in the worst possible way
