This is my first Foreo device and the pad feels really nice and soft. I used it for cleansing and it made my skin feel so clean and good. Compared with the older models, the Luna 4 also comes with gentle and deep cleansing modes. The massage options are cool too.However note that the device must be registered and you must have a Foreo account before registering it in the app. I was unable to receive any signup confirmation emails for over an hour when signing up. It so frustrating it makes me want to give it 1 star just for that experience alone.Overall a great product, just hope they will fix their tech and app issues. nan
