I received this FOREO Bear complimentary from FOREO. My experience with the FOREO bear has been unlike my experience with any other facial skin devices this far. The bear is something that everybody should try to use if they are looking for tighter, toned skin with less wrinkles. Using tiny shocks, your skin is woken up and revived without any of the pain. The system also uses T-Sonic pulsations which extend deeper into the pores, increasing blood circulation leading to brighter more beautiful skin.  It was really easy to set up the app and pairing was quick. From there, the app was really comprehensive with full walkthroughs on how to do treatments and care for your device. There are 3 treatments and each takes just a minute or two to download and then you follow the on screen guide or you are free to choose your own settings and start your own personal massage. While my treatments load I wash my face to be sure that it is completely clean. Be sure to use a good serum as this makes the device glide easier on the skin, maintaining better contact. I canâ€™t wait to see my results after I continue to use the bear. So far, I am pleased with how it has worked in just a week. My skin really does look a lot clearer and is noticeably tighter. This is a device that I will absolutely continue to use. A Must Have Toning Device
