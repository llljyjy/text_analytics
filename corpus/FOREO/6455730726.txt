I received this product complimentary from Foreo.it has beautiful and elegant design. There are 2 easy to use through the app or without the app where you have different intensity levels according to your skin preference. I started with low and gradually increase it to medium as my skin got used to it.I will continue using it as so far what i have noticed my skin is smoother, brighter, fine lines have been gradually fading away . Even though it is really expensive but it is like spa treatment at home and it cost more in salon for just 1 treatment. I think it is a good investment to take care of your skin. nan
