I have been using Foreo Bear for the last 6 months and I have a very small face. Even tho it is amazing for the chin, cheeks, and neck area. Bear Mini is amazing for the eyes and lips area. Being 30 years old and I always took care of my skin it was a good investment for my skin. Microcurrent devices tighten and smooth the muscles. Also having ready treatments at the app is a lifesaver. Usually, those are the ones I’m doing.  Now I took mini with Mini when I’m traveling. P.S These devices keep charging a very long time. Foreo Mini - New Travel Buddy
