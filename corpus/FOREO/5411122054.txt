I received this complimentary from FOREO and just started using it. I do like the design, however, I wish the balls would roll/move because it can pull on your skin IF you do not have enough serum applied. When you have enough serum applied, whichever kind you’d like (they sell their own, too), it works well! It’s easy to hold, easy to clean, and charges quickly. My main complaint is that you cannot use this without 1. downloading their app to even activate it and 2. you have to use their app to even turn it ON. That seems kinda crazy to me. So, someone without a smartphone cannot use this. I am excited to see how it helps fine lines over time with regular use. Not Accessible to All
