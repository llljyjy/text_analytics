This was my first experience using a microcurrent device and I’m in awe at how quickly it shows a brightening and lifting effect on the skin! I love how the FOREO Bear combines the microcurrent with a massaging feature, I feel like I’ve just had a facial after using the combined treatment. With this being my first time using a device like this, I found the apps guided routines to be especially helpful because it showed me exactly where to apply the Bear and what speed I should be moving it across the skin. I think it’s brilliant how the Bear shuts off when it loses contact with the skin, so I don’t have to worry about zapping myself. This is a beautifully designed and effective skincare instrument, I’ll definitely be continuing to use my FOREO Bear! My Bear was gifted by FOREO for the purpose of review. nan
