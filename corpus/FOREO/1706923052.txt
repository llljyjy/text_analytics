This is perfect for on the go and makes a great staple for your daily cleansing routine! I recently took a camping trip and packed this for my cleansing routine. It was easy to store it in a clean bag and I really loved being able to use it without using my probably-not-so-clean hands. It has various pulsing settings that worked like a charm to gently buff away makeup, skin care and SPF. I love how lightweight it is and easy to recharge. I love it! nan
