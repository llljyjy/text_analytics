Initially I really don’t gravitate to face tools because I’m pretty lazy lol but I love the way this feels! I haven’t exactly seen a difference but to be fair I’ve only been using it for a month. I do however like the technology and the fact that my skin looks so much better the morning after. Whatever it is I want to keep using it which is a nice motivator! Gifted by foreo in exchange for my honest opinion. Not bad !
