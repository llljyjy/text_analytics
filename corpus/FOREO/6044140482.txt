I love using a micro-current device in my routine, I find it very beneficial to lifting and firming the skin. The Foreo Bear glides so effortlessly across the skin and the design of the product makes it easy to grip and manoeuvre. There is an app that links with it, providing different routines. These are great for people new to the device, but having used other microcurrent devices before, I feel happier doing my own thing. I think this is a great device and I love the immediate lifting effect that it gives my face. nan
