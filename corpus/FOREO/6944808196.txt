okay so I’m 52 and I use a lot of skin care but there’s only so much you can do with aging so I was really hesitant to spend this kind of money on a facial device basically. I am so glad that I bought this. it is so much better than I expected.so yesterday I bought this device on Amazon that you run over your face and it is supposed to suck out anything that’s in your pores like blackheads and stuff that you can’t really see and I did that yesterday and my skin on my face was beat red obviously after using that device. even the next day it was still beat red in areas that I used it the most like around my nose.so about an hour ago I used the make my day mask with my new device here and my skin has literally never ever ever felt better. I just went and looked in the mirror and the redness is gone. seriously. after using one mask. I did the facial two times in a row with the same mask and the redness has gone away. I am in shock. on top of that my skin I didn’t know could feel this good. a huge noticeable difference after using it once.there is no device on the planet that’s going to make my skin younger again but this definitely is going to help my skin look the best that it can for my age. isn’t that all we want to do in general is make what we have the best that it can be? this does that and more. I am so thrilled that I feel like buying a backup because once this catches on I can’t imagine that it’s not going to sell out repeatedly. as soon as you try it you’ll know what I mean and this is something I now don’t ever want to live without. best facial device ever
