I bought this when it was less expensive but I will say it was worth it. I travel on a weekly basis and it began to feel like my PMD cleaner was too much. This lasts forever - like YEARS. It was easy to pack and cleaned extremely well. They tell you it  is not rechargeable. It doesnâ€™t brother me at all. I liked it for travel, not so much at home. Still worth it because it lasted years. nan
