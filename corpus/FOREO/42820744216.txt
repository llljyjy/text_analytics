I’m really into skincare and I’m always for investing in quality, but my skin wasn’t happy with the first skin cleansing device that I bought, but once I have tried Luna play plus 2 I was amazed. My skin felt smooth after only a couple of times using it and it is gentle enough to use often! Also - super handy and cute. So worth it! my new bestie
