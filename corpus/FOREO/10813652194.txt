Gifted by FOREO. I love how small and transportable this is! I have the Bear 2 which is already pretty compact, but it is super nice to have as I travel frequently. I especially enjoy how there are both guided and unguided facial workouts on the app. The only gripe I have about the product design is that it is not functional without access to the app. Otherwise a great microcurrent device! nan
