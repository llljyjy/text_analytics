I actually really like this lil thing! My skin is sensitive and very dry in the winter, but it isn’t too intense and doesn’t irritate my face. You do need to download an app to use it, which at first I thought was mildly annoying, but the customization options it provides ended up being pretty cool. You can choose how long it spends on each quadrant of your face (each cheek, forehead and chin). Best thing of all is that this doesn’t require a refill of any kind (buy once, cry once) and can be easily cleaned and stored. A single charge also lasts a long time. I’ve had it over a month and use it once daily, and I’m still on the same charge! Really like this, plus charge lasts a long time
