complimentary from FOREOthis is my very first microcurrent skin care device. In the beginning I expectedthat it will sting my skin depending on the level of microcurrent, however this device doesntgive that stinging sensation which is a plus. I enjoyedthat there is a guided video massage treatments in the foreo app. Its nice feature for beginners. I loved the sonic feature as well. My skin felt tonedafter using this microcurrent device. The feeling is like after a workout when musclesfeel a bit dense, but not itching or hurting. I will continue using this device from time to time until I develop a habit using it every day for better results. skin feel toned like after a workout
