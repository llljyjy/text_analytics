The IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream Hydrating Moisturizer may be my new go to cream in a jar. I love how may face feels after putting this on, it soaks into my skin right away making it feel soft and hydrated. When I use this at night itâ€™s made my skin feel great the next day, super hydrated (I have dry skin/combo skin), not oily or feeling like I put on heavy cream. I would highly recommend this to those who are looking for a holy grail cream! Also, it is great for sensitive skin which I have, and does not cause my skin to break out. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. Great overall hydrating face cream!
