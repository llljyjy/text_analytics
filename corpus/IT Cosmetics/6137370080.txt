This cleansing balm is the highlight of my night time skincare routine. This cleansing balm works wonders on my face. It is by far one of the best cleansing balms I ever used. Most cleansing balms that I’ve used in the past irritate and dry out my skin so much. The It Cosmetics makeup melting cleansing balm doesn’t do that at all. It actually hydrated my skin so much and makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. It’s incredible! I love how it melts away my makeup so quickly and easily. I love using this balm to remove my eye makeup and waterproof mascara. I have really sensitive eyes and this balm never irritates or stings my eyes at all. This cleansing balm is all I’ve been using since I got my hands on it. It’s really my all time favorite. I also love using this balm as a face mask. I apply it all over my face and leave it on for a few minutes and then I’ll just rinse it off. It leaves my skin feeling supremely hydrated, soft and refreshed. I’m also noticing that the more I use this cleansing balm the more brighter my skin seems to appear. I just love that this product is vegan, sulfate free, paraben free and doesn’t contain alcohol. Products that contain alcohol tend to make my skin dry and irritated. I love that this balm doesn’t contain that. I’m definitely purchasing this product as soon as I run out. I love it so much that I’m always raving and recommending it to all my friends. A Must Have
