This moisturizer has been my favorite for a while - I have very dry, sensitive skin so not only does this cream really moisturize and plump my skin, but it also feels incredibly soothing. It sinks in nicely, and I can tell more of a difference when I use this cream versus anything else Iâ€™ve ever tried. I even let my husband use it and he fell in love with it too. 10 out of 10! My fave!!
