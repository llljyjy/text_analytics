IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream is so popular for good reason- it works! I apply it before bed every night and wake up to plump, hydrated skin. The cream seems thick but you only need a little bit to cover your face and neck since it spreads like butter. The cream results in a very thin layer that absorbs pretty well. If you’re using serums, make sure the serum is absorbed before putting on the cream or else it’ll remain tacky. I love the light scent too! nan
