My skin looks and feels amazing after using this moisturizer for a few weeks! I have fine lines and combination skin and have struggled more so with dry skin over the summer. This moisturizer has helped in all of those areas. My skin feels so much more hydrated and looks it as well, my fine lines are also not as apparent. I love how thick this is, it is ways to scoop out and apply. It sinks into my skin and doesnâ€™t leave me feeling greasy. I love how glowy my skin has been lately!! nan
