I think I found my new favorite moisturizer! I loved everything about this face cream. The texture is thick and creamy, and absorbs very nice. It feels very moisturizing and hydrating on my skin, without any oily residue. I liked the fresh, almost spa-like scent, as it is light and refreshing. I love the anti-aging ingredients as well, which makes this a win win. I will definitely be purchasing this moisturizer again! Love this moisturizer!
