It’s got peptides for repair and firmness as well as a winning combination of ceramides designed to smooth, nourish and protect your complexion.What I particularly love, this cream is rich and deeply nourishing but not overwhelming to my oily skin. It’s an ideal option for all skin types, even if your skin is reactive. It sits wonderfully under makeup, but most of the time I just pair it with my face sunscreen. It smooths my skin enough that I don’t feel like I need a foundation over the top. Obsessed!
