I have actual real life, can see with the naked eye changes to skin after a month. I have been committed to another aging cream, but I have officially made the switch to Confidence in a Cream! After a month of use I see improvement! The laugh lines have faded tremendously! My skin is also acne prone and this did not add to that in any way! I also doesnâ€™t peel like some aging creams do!! love!!
