This moisturizer is thick so I think it’ll be great for winter or if you normally have dry skin. I haven’t used it long enough to know if wrinkles have diminished over time yet. I have sensitive skin and it didn’t irritate my skin. There’s a slight medicinal scent to it almost smells like ginseng to me but it doesn’t bother me. nan
