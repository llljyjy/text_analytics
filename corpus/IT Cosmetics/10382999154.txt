This product does, 100% live up to its name. You do begin to feel more confidence in your skin after using this product. First, the smell, I love it. Not overwhelming but there is a scent to it that I find pleasant. Second, this cream goes on a bit thicker but that is part of why I love it. The moisture it adds to my face is very much present all through the day. I live in the desert so moisture in my skin is a constant struggle. Add into that the summer in the desert and spending a lot of time in the swimming pool. My face sometimes screams for added moisture.This product does work very very well at a very affordable price point. Lives up to its name!
