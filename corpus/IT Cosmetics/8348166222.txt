I am a 68 yr old black woman with combination skin. I was wary of trying this product because most anti aging moisturizers clogged my pores and cause blemishes. Surprise! No clogged pores! My skin feels smooth, healthy and supple. I have a beautiful glow all day. The cream is not heavy and feels nice and smooth. Iâ€™ve already recommended it to friends. Great moisturizer
