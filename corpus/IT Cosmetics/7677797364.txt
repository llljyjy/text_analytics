After enjoying IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream for a week, I have noticed that my face looks smoother and more even in tone.  In addition, the dark spots on my face are not as noticeable, and I can feel my skin tightening. It seems as if I am wearing a protective shield throughout the day. I love the silky way the cream feels when I apply it to my face and its light, pleasant scent. Compared to other brands, this product is less greasy and does not make me perspire when I wear it. I feel that my skin stays softer even after washing it off. It did not take a lot to cover my face, so I think the cream would be a good value. For these reasons, I would buy this product and recommend it to my family and my friends. a protective shield for softer, smoother skin
