I tried this cream 2 times. I just couldn’t continue using it! It says that it absorbs quickly on the box, but.....I don’t feel that it did. To me it felt almost like putting lip balm on my face. I felt like my skin couldn’t breathe.  It was too thick. My face was sweating as soon as it was on. I could not continue to use it after trying 2 times. I can’t comment on its effectiveness because I was not able to try it long enough. The scent wasn’t pleasant either. I went back to my red jar... Way to thick for me!
