I’m 45 years old with combination skin and I have fine lines. Since the first day using Confidence in a Cream I noticed extra hydration and my skin was glowing like never before. We went to a family event and even they noticed how fresh and hydrated my skin looked. I have used it morning and night and every morning I wake up to a fresh and more firm skin. I also noticed how I don’t have to reapply my makeup every few hours since using this cream. I like the consistency of this cream as well, it’s mild and my skin absorbs it very quick, it doesn’t make my skin feel clogged. It also doesn’t have an overpowering scent, it’s just the right amount. When I apply Confidence in a Cream it gives me a silky texture and the hydration lasts all day long. I already recommended this cream to my friends and family! Silky texture.
