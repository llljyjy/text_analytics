This product lives up to its name. No makeup required when your skin is left feeling hydrated and your give off a dewy glow. That being said, it works very well under make up, leaving behind an even complexion without being cakey or falling into lines.  I feel my skin has improved with using it twice a day. The only con I have experienced is some eye irritation, which is less about the product and more about my personal sensitivity.  I had a small sample of this great product about a year ago, and was thrilled to receive a full sized sample to get to use it consistently. My skin is ever so grateful.  Confidence In a Cream blends in without an over saturated or greasy feeling, and is a perfect night time moisturizer.  Iâ€™m definitely buying another jar. Love your skin
