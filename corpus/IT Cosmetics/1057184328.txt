So I was initially hesitant to try this as I feel like some of IT Cosmetics products are sort of outdated.  Anyway I went for it because I wanted to try the new formulation and I’m THRILLED I did!  I’m 39, combination skin and hate to feel greasy or sticky from products.  This cream is none of that!  It absorbed so well and left my face feeling hydrated without that sticky feeling!  I’m actually switching out my previous moisturizer to this full time!! New Fave!
