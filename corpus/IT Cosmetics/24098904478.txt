This cream has actually improved my skin over the past few weeks. First impression was great, because of the dewy, glow it gave my skin. After using it during the day before makeup, and then again at night after cleansing my skin before bed. I  have noticed my pores have shrunk and around my eyes and my forehead have tighten slightly. Not a huge difference yet but definitely something. I also love the packaging and the scent because it is clean and very light. Awesome moisturizer! New holy grail!
