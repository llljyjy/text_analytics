As a moisturizer I think this is pretty good. I have combination skin, and after I shower (at night) it zaps all the moisture from my skin and my face is pretty dry. This does a great job of replenishing my skin. I will say though it is kinda heavy. It has the consistency of a body butter, so it’s thick. Which is great for the evening when my skin is dry, but daytime it would be too much. So if your skin is oily I wouldn’t recommend it. But if you have dry skin and you’re lacking moisture it’s pretty good. Has a mild scent/fragrance. Nothing overpowering. But it is there if you are sensitive to that. As far as it’s anti-aging ability and claims I didn’t notice any difference. So would I recommend it as a moisturizer for dry skin, yes. For anti-aging, no. Great for moisturizing but...
