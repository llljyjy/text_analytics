I am enjoying this moisturizer. It has a thick, rich consistency that is perfect on my combination (but mostly dry) skin. It goes on easily and instantly makes my skin feel plum and hydrated. It has a slight lemony scent to it, as most IT products do. It doesnâ€™t bother me and dissipates quickly. I feel like my skin looks more evened out when I use this.  I would recommend this. Great Texture, Hydrating
