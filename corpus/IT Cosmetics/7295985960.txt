One of the best moisturizers I’ve tried in a long time! It hydrated and smooths my skin, and since it absorbs quickly, it works great as a primer. I had zero pilling and my makeup stayed in place add day! Overall I’m very happy with this product and I’m confident I’ll see terrific results the more I use it. nan
