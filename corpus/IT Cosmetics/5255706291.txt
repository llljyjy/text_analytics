I absolutely love IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream. I have sensitive skin so I am very cautious when I first time tries it.  This cream is a little bit thick, so you really donâ€™t need much to apply to your face and neck.  This cream does have a light scent which I am ok with but it is not kind of appealing.  I have almost 50% of the jar and so far I am very happy with the result as I do see and feel my skin more soft and nourished. Love this cream!
