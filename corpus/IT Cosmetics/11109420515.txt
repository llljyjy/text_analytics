I’ve used IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream Hydrating Moisturizer in the past. This new version is “supercharged“ as it has “higher concentrations of niacinamide, squalane, and peptide-lipid complex.“ These are powerhouse ingredients that deliver the anti-aging results I am looking for, so I love that this cream has even more packed in it than before. The cream absorbs well, moisturizes, helps my fine lines and pores, and is an overall great product for skin. I received a free product in exchange for my honest review. nan
