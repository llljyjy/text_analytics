I am so happy with this cream. First use it felt cool and spa-like with a light herbal scent. I have been using it non-stop, day and night and love that it doesn’t make my face stick to my pillow or leave all kinds of gunk that pills up and makes a mess.  My skin does feel hydrated and I can’t swear to major changes yet but I feel like my skin is less red and irritated and some improvement to pores and signs of aging. I have been using it with the IT Confidence cleanser. I will likely buy because the price is so much more reasonable than other brands. Would highly recommend. nan
