If youâ€™re looking for a plumping and highly moisturizing cream, this is the one. It feels like a glass of water for my skin, my skin just drinks it up. Makeup applies smoothly on top, leaving no dry patches. At night, I apply, and still wake up with comfortable skin. It also applies and layers well with my serums, without feeling heavy. nan
