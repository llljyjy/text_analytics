This cream feels good on my skin, and it makes my skin feel soft and smooth.  I’d recommend this for anyone with dry/combo skin,  and an uneven bumpy feel.  Just a few dots on the face works wonders. After a while of usage,  you’ll notice smoother,  softer skin.  Highly recommended! I got this in a beauty box last year,  so I was excited to get a bigger bottle! I love this stuff! Great Cream,  Soft Skin!
