IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream goes on very smoothly and absorbs quickly. It’s not sticky or greasy. I have very dry and sensitive skin with uneven tone, and this cream has made a noticeable difference in the way my skin looks and feels. I put it on in the morning and the evening. Many other creams I’ve tried wear off after a few hours, but not Confidence in a Cream. The morning application lasts all day, and the evening application keeps my face hydrated all night. This product didn’t get rid of my wrinkles or dark spots, but I’ve only been using it for about a month. My skin looks refreshed when I wake up and that’s a great start to the day.I noticed small bumps on my forehead after about a week of using, but they went away after a few days. It may not have even been caused by the cream, it’s just something I noticed while using it.  I would definitely buy this product and I highly recommend it for anyone who has dry and/or sensitive skin. Great for dry and/or sensitive skiin
