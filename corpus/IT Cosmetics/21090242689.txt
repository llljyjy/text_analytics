Ok so the smell is not so pleasant but the effect that this cream has on your face it’s worth the smell!!. I have been literally seeing my face glow lately and I feel so confident every time I use it. It feels a little bit thick on my face but since it’s the first thing that I put on, after washing my face and then putting my tinted cream on,the heaviness disappears nan
