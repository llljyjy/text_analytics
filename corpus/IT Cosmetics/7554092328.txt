When I received this moisturizer for testing purposes, I was excited to see what long term use would do for my skin. I’m a few weeks in and I can say that this is definitely moisturizing. My skin feels super soft after using it.  I haven’t noticed and other anti-aging results as of yet There was little to no fragrance in the product.  It’s light weight and easily melts into the skin. Great under makeup, no weird pilling or texture. I definitely prefer a thicker cream at bedtime so this will stick around as a daytime moisturizer for me. Great value. nan
