This cleansing balm is awesome! It feels like butter on your face and very gentle. It’s lightly scented and just glides on. My makeup comes right off, especially my mascara. All I did was apply a lil amount, added water, used circular motions , removed makeup with a rag and washed it off.  I wiped twice and it came right off. This cleansing balm is awesome!

It doesn’t tingle or sting and very gentle on the eyes. It leaves my skin feeling so soft and nourished. Love it! Easily removes makeup/skin is hydrated
