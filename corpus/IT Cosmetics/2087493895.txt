I agree with a lot of the reviews saying the new formula is not good and sadly will not buy again. I’ve been using and loving this moisturizer for 5 years and the new formula smells and feels different. It makes my skin sting upon applying it and overall doesn’t do the trick like before. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.
