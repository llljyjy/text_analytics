I’ve just finished 2 weeks of using  IT’s Confidence in a Cream nightly and most mornings. I wouldn’t say it was miraculous, as it didn’t touch my deep wrinkles, but overall I am impressed with the results. The texture of my skin seems much smoother, especially the fine lines around my mouth and chin. IT also took down much of the puffiness and dark circles under my eyes. It has been comparable to Oily of Olay Regenerist Retinol cream but without the concern of sun exposure and discoloration.I will buy it again in the future along with the IT eye cream and will recommend IT Confidence Cream to my friends. Would give a 4.5 star review if possible Confident in Correction
