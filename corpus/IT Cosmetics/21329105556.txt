Bye bye makeup not for me. I received a full size complimentary sample in exchange for my honest opinion. The product isn’t terrible, it just seems like more work and I didn’t have time for it. I like a product that I can wipe on and wipe off. I am a busy and very tired, fashion forward working mom. I love makeup and fashion and need convenience and ease for my routine. The balm is very thick. It comes out melty and creamy but it’s just so thick and not really greasy but I just don’t like the texture on my skin and I need something to remove my eye make up more. It’s just not something I would use. Bye bye makeup not my thing
