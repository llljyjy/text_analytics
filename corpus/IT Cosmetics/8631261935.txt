It’s Confidence in a Cream is exactly just that.  It brings me confidence with the smooth beautiful skin it gives me.  It has improved the texture and quality of the skin on my face so much that my self esteem is boosted.  It’s light and highly absorbent.  Immediately penetrating the layers of my skin.  My face drinks this stuff up!  It feels so good going on as my last layer of skincare.   It has no heavy scent and leaves behind no clogged pores or acne.  I’ve been using it for several weeks now and notice no reactions on my sensitive skin.   I love it being from a brand I trust and the packaging is super cute. True Confidence
