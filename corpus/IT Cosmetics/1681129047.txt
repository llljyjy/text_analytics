I was sent a jar of the IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream to sample and review, and at first I wasnâ€™t sure I needed another type of moisturizing cream... Now I am SO glad I tried it! I have some dark spots and after just a couple weeks of use I have seen an improvement!  That is the number one thing that impressed me with this cream, but also the scent is delightful and not too strong. The weight of the cream on your skin is light, it absorbs nicely into the skin and feels hydrating and smooth. I use it primarily as a night cream, as I have another day cream I am using right now, but plan to use it morning and night when I run out of my current morning cream. Aging is always going to be one of my primary skin concerns, so anything that helps is welcome in my beauty regimen! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for hydration and correction. Excellent cream
