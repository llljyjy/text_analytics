I use my Confidence in a Cream moisturizer by It Cosmetics in the morning and at night and my skin loves this this stuff, You only need a little bit of this because it spreads really nice, itâ€™s not greasy, and it absorbs into your skin easily with leaving your skin shiny and oily. I recommend this and I will continue using this everyday. Keeps my skin hydrated!!
