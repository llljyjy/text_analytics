This moisturizer is so nice on the skin, I had already heard so many great reviews on this product unfortunately I had never tried it. I finally understand why this product is so great, it is extremely moisturizing. It has a scent to it but it did not cause acne on my sensitive skin. This is a product that is worth the money , I would highly recommend! This is definitely for dry skin, I noticed a difference in my skin immediately. Great Moisturizer
