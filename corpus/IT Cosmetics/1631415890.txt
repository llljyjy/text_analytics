This 3-1 bye bye makeup cleansing balm is magical it melts the makeup right off my face. I love that this product contains vitamin c, shea butter and rose hips oil it leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh. You can even use it as a face mask. Simply apply a scoop to a clean dry face and leave it on for 10 minutes then rinse. I found that after using this product for 3 days it made my skin look brighter. I suffer from dry fatigued skin so I definitely noticed a difference after using this product.I have added this 3-1 cleanser to my skin routine and am so happy with the results. Thank you bzzagent for allowing me to try and review this product. These are my honest thoughts and opinions. I highly recommend to family and friends. Melts the makeup right off
