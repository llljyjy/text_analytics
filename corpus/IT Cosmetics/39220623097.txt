Over all the cream is great, it’s consistency is a bit thicker than the typical brand I use but absorbed nicely. One thing it lacks is SPF protection for use during the day time use so for me, I used it more at night before bed and stuck to my usual daytime cream with SPF protection since I can reapply on days I’m out longer in the sun since I don’t wear makeup, only lip gloss and mascara! Cream of choice
