I was worried this cream/moisturizer wouldn’t be a good fit for me because I kept reading that it is mostly for dry/very dry skin and I have combination skin and I struggle with breakouts often. But I went ahead and gave it a shot because of all the amazing reviews! I am so glad that I did because I love it, it melted into my skin nicely and I could tell my skin looked more hydrated and plump and I haven’t experienced any breakouts since I started using it. I believe this is a great moisturizer with lots of amazing benefits! I love it!!!
