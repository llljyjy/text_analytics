This is my first time using this product. It’s a thick cream and goes on heavy once applied to the skin, but it absorbsquickly. After the application, my skin felt soft. So far, it hasn’t irritated my skin. I have a full beard so my cheeks and forehead stayed hydrated. I would recommend this product since it is within a reasonable price range. Soft & Smooth
