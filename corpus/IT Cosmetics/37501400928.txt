I am so glad I tried this cream! It has been one of the hottest summers on record here on the East Coast. I spend a lot of time outdoors and my skin (which is normally dry, anyway) has been even worse this year. But, I’ve been using Confidence in a Cream for a few weeks have seen a huge improvement in both appearance and texture.One of my biggest problems is fine lines (around my eyes, forehead and mouth). This cream has a sort of “plumping“ effect which has made them less noticeable. Nothing will take them away entirely, but they are definitely minimized.But the biggest change I’ve seen, by far, is in the texture and elasticity of my skin. It’s SO much softer and smoother. And, it just feels hydrated and healthier.I use the cream 2x per day, after washing my face, both morning and night. It’s a very thick, rich cream, so it does take a while to absorb. But, the results are worth the wait.I would definitely recommend this product and want another jar myself once this one is gone! Intense Moisture for Summer-Dry Skin
