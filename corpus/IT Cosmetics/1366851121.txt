I have used many different cleansing balms and none have impressed me as much as IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Makeup: 3-in-1 Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm! First of all, you get so much product in the tub. Most cleansing balms, at least ones I’ve used, give you 2-2.5oz at most. With IT Cosmetics, you get 4oz...double the amount! It has an extremely light, floral and citrusy scent. I normally am not a huge fan of scents in my skin care, however, this was so faint you really can’t tell it’s there unless you really get in there and smell the product. Like most balms, it starts out as a soft solid that melts into the most luxurious oil that dissolves all my makeup (even waterproof mascara) and sunscreen. You only need a very small amount to really get the job done. One thing that I would love to see is a small scoop included. I just so happened to have one from other skincare, but this is the only negative. This cleansing balm works great as the first step in a double cleanse. It also works exceptionally well as the only step in the cleansing process. It leaves my skin thoroughly cleansed, soft and supple. Unlike other balms I’ve used, it does not leave my skin with a greasy residue, just wonderfully moisturized. The coolest thing about this balm is that it is multi-purpose. You can use this as a cleansing balm, in your double cleanse. You can also add water and this becomes a rich, milky cleanser. Lastly, you can apply to clean skin  and leave on for 10 minutes as an amazing moisturizing mask. This balm is packed with good-for-you ingredients like vitamin C, rosehip oil, ceramides and shea butter, which work together to leave your skin healthy, hydrated and radiant. It also won’t clog pores. I had no issues with sensitivity or breakouts when using this. It doesn’t even burn my eyes or make them cloudy after using. Gentle enough for the most sensitive skin, I highly recommend this cleansing balm and will continue to repurchase. Melts all the Makeup!
