This is by far the best moisturizer I’ve tried. The buttery, creamy consistency feels great on my skin. It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.It has a light, pleasant fragrance that isn’t too strong. Since I started using it I can see and feel a definite difference in my skin.  My face is  softer and wonderfully moisturized. The fine lines around my eyes and mouth are much less obvious and I no longer have any rough, uneven patches on my skin. Wonderfully moisturizing!
