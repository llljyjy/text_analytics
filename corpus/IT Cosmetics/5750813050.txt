I’m really enjoying this moisturizer. It appears to be a new and improved version. The original version smelled better like lemon but it gave me little bumps on my skin so I stopped using it. This new version doesn’t smell as good but I haven’t experienced any bumps or breakouts and it’s super fast absorbing. My skin looks instantly plumped and moisturized. I love IT cosmetics and fully trust that the use quality ingredients. I would like it even better if this packaging was more sanitary with a pump. I don’t like sticking my fingers in moisturizer.  Otherwise I completely recommend this product. nan
