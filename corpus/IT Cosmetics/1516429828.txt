I love IT Cosmetics and use a bunch of their other products. This cleansing balm did great for my foundation and eyebrows but took a little bit of scrubbing on my mascara. I have sensitive eyes and it didn’t burn - so I’m very pleased about that. I liked how this cleansing balm didn’t sting and make my eyes blurry like a lot of other cleansing balls I’ve tried in the past have. I would repurchase this and recommend to friends and family. nan
