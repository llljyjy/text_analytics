I really loved the heavy fragrance from the It cosmetics I have combination skin used for the 12 days by bzzagent giving my honest opinion of the products suggested 12 dayâ€™s great for dry skin easily absorbed into the skin gave a soft glow made my skin softer and smoother. I would suggest using lightly a small amount can go a long way.  It seems to be great for dry skin adding that moisture and hydration you are lacking. Creamy
