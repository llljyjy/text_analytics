An amazing and innovative product.  At first, I was skeptical about this product.  How could something that is gentle enough for your face remove waterproof makeup, especially mascara.  But it worked.  And it worked well.  I liked having to use only one product to clean my entire face. When I first opened the container, I loved the fresh light fragrance.  But the product was thick and felt greasy when I dipped my fingers into it.  Donâ€™t let this turn you away.  Just try it.  It actually melts on your fingers and face and just eats away the makeup.  It removed every trace of makeup I had on and left my face clean and feeling smooth.  I even ran a wet cotton ball across my face to see if it really did remove everything.  The cotton ball came away clean.  I would definitely recommend this product. An amazing and innovative product
