I am really happy with the IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Cream Anti-Aging Hydrating Moisturizer.  It is thick & rich but not too heavy and it doesn’t leave my skin feeling oily.  When use this product in my night time routine and I wake up in the morning with my dry skin still feeling moisturized.    During the day, it wears under my makeup perfectly and keeps my skin from feeling dry after applying makeup.  This moisturizer is perfect for my skin type and doesn’t irritate me at all. Lovely Moisturizer
