I absolutely love love love this product!!  I was looking got a cleansing balm and this is perfection. The texture is smooth and immediately starts removing makeup, even stubborn mascara. I apply it on a dry face and wipe it off with a damp cloth. The scent is floral and pleasant, not over powering. It can also be used as a mask. Iâ€™m 100% going to continue buying this product. nan
