Key IngredientsVitamin CCeramide Rosehip oilShea butterThis cleanser is wonderful, a beautiful fresh rose scent hits the senses immediately. I also used a bit to much at first so remember a little does go very far. It is water soluble and has a bit of an oily feel but doesn’t leave it behind. I applied first on dry skin, massaged in and used water to wash away and once the water hits it turns it to an almost milky consistency. My biggest test was my waterproof mascara, it came off pretty easy. I did have to massage a bit but am very happy with the outcome. I didn’t experience any irritation anywhere or in my eyes. This retails for about $40 which is a bit pricey but you need minimal product to get thecjob done. Totally worth it! Gorgeous Cleanser
