I like how easy this product is to use and that it can be used in different ways. It did a great job of removing my makeup and even my waterproof mascara. Use it as balm to remove makeup and hydrate your skin for 24 hours. Or by adding some water you can have a milky cleanser that will brighten your face overtime. And you can even use it as a hydrating face mask if you leave it in for 10 minutes. I tried all of these different ways to use this product and was impressed with them all. I will be adding this to my beauty routine and I would recommend to my friends! Love it
