This cream feels great going on! It does have a bit of a medicine type smell at first, but it is less noticeable the more you use it! I don’t have a ton of fine lines or wrinkles, but after using this cream, I feel confident that I won’t get any lines or wrinkles anytime soon!y skin feels and looks smoother, and it definitely looks more even tone over all! I feel properly moisturized without feeling greasy, even hours later, I still feel like skin is healthy nan
