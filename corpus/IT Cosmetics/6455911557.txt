My skin is a combination of dry and oily and anti-aging creams that I had been using either dried my skin further or made it too oily. Confidence in a Cream is the first anti-aging product that Iâ€™ve found to leave my skin soft and dewy! This cream really works the way that I need it to. To say I love it would be an understatement! Velvety skin!
