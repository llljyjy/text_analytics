This product is my first IT Cosmetics item. I was looking for an oil cleanser/oil balm as I double cleanse twice a day. I came across this one and was intrigued as I loved the fact there was vitamin c and rose hip oil which is essential to good skin care.  To my surprise, this balm is so rich and hydrating that you only need a pea size, maybe slightly more but a little goes a long way. It leaves my skin soft, smooth and hydrated that I am pleased that it has more benefits than just cleansing. I do cleanse a 2nd time with a different product that is not oil based and my skin is still very smooth and hydrated after.  For context, I am 45 with acneic, oily maturing skin. The fragrance if any, is not very strong at all. In fact, its barely there. But if you are ultra-sensitive to smells, you may not want this for you. So hydrating it's worth getting!
