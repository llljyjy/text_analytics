Loved the packaging very good for gifting.at first day I had a tingling sensation on my cheeks was sad assuming that the moisture isnâ€™t for me but after 2 weeks saw my skin tone was even and specially my t zone was hydrated too I looked refreshed after all.loved the gel consistency absorbed pretty much fast but didnt work with my wrinkles maybe it takes times to see better results. Very good.
