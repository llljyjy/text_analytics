I was so excited to try this. It did not disappoint! I really like IT products. My skin seems to change each day of the week (or that’s what it feels like to me), so it’s hard to find something I can consistently use. This cream is very creamy and thick. A little goes a long way. But, I feel like this is the first time my skin has felt this hydrated and healthy in quite a while. I will absolutely recommend, and be purchasing. Great Product?!
