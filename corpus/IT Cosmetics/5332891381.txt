This cream left my face feeling soft and juicy.   I have super sensitive skin so I was really hoping it wouldn’t break me out or leave me with any white bumps which it didn’t so I’m super duper happy about that.   The scent is definitely noticeable right off the bat.    Can’t say it’s making me not wanna use the product but I usually go for stuff without a scent cause of how sensitive my skin is but so far so good.    I’ll continue using this. If u can get passed the smell then she’s a keeper!
