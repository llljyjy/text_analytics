As someone with oily skin this cream is a little thicker than what I typically use but it’s very lightweight to wear. It absorbs super fast and gives my skin all the moisture & nourishment it needs! Since switching to this cream my face looks and feels firmer/plumer and I haven’t had any breakouts!! Very nourishing
