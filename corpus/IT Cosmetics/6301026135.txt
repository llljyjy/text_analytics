I usually find that cleansing balms tend to feel the same for me, but this one was something different! It has a light but pleasant scent. Sort of citrusy. This was the first thing I noticed. It is completely solid but after a few seconds your fingers warm it up enough to dip a little out. When I say a little, that’s exactly what you need to remove a full face of makeup (I wear everything but lashes, and about a quarter sized amount breaks up the makeup so well). I noticed also that when I rinse my face, it doesn’t feel weird trying to remove it, and even after I cleanse with my face wash, my face still feels so hydrated. I know it’s because of the balm because I haven’t switched cleansers and noticed that my face felt so soft and moisturized. I have used this almost daily for a week or so and there’s still only a small chunk missing from this balm. It’s probably going to last for a good while, so it seems like it’d be completely worth it’s price ( I got to try it for free, but have definitely found something I really like and want to continue using unless something better comes along!) So Good!
