I am always wary of claims that say ’transforms signs of aging in two weeks’ because, come on, that’s too good to be true! I love IT! Cosmetics and wanted to try the new ultra hydrating moisturizer. I suffer from oilier t-zone but dry cheeks, chin, etc. I am started to get some small fine lines / smile lines and just overall thinner facial skin. After two weeks of everyday use my skin is now plumper and more hydrated than ever. I really do see a difference in the lines as well! I am excited to keep using this and see how my skin looks when the container is gone. Highly recommend! nan
