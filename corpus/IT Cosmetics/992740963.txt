This is a great moisturizer and this really Does provide moisture for 24 hours. itâ€™s not heavy or feels greasy and soothing and it feels great. I have incorporated this cream in my evening routine after removing make up. It also relieves that right feeling of dry skin. A must for dry skin needs!! A must for dry skin
