I have been using the IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream Anti Aging Armour for two weeks now twice a day, morning and night.  I love how soft it leaves my skin feeling.  It goes on smooth and sinks in effortlessly, without making my skin feeling greasy.  I use it on top of my usual serums. It isn’t too light weight and isn’t to heavy either.  For a little added moisture I would occasionally use my night cream over it, I wake up to smooth hydrated skin.  This moisturizer has a light scent, not too overpowering.  I will keep using and am excited to see continued improvement in hydration. Great hydration without a greasy feel
