It Confidence In a Cream is amazing. I was a little nervous trying it because of my sensitive skin, but after 2 weeks my skin felt softer and smoother. It caused very little breakouts. The cream smells good and has a great texture, a little bit goes along way, so itâ€™s great for the price. Totally worth It
