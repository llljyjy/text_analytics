I received the IT Confidence in a Cream Supercharged Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream w/ Anti-Aging Armour Super Concentrate (whew!) for free from BzzAgent. It contains ceramides, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, a peptide-lipid complex and squalene and promises to immerse your skin in moisture… and boy does it ever moisturize my skin! In fact, it moisturizes my skin better than any other moisturizer! The texture of the rich cream and how the formula sank into my skin and how it kept my skin moisturized for such a long time was such a great experience! It will reduce fine lines in your skin by plumping your skin with moisture… Kinda like rehydrating a raisin back into a grape lol most moisturizing moisturizer!
