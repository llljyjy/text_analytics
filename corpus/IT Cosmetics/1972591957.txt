We all get bombarded with buy this it works …I have found that in the past 2 weeks of using this cream a bit of an improvement. Due to Chemo it has left me with dry patches of skin on my face …Using this 2 x a day I have seen a noticeable change …I have dry, sensitive skin normally and  I have used other products in the morning and by the afternoon my skin showed signs of dryness. When I use this product in the morning it works all day and NO dry skin appears! It does burn slightly and that last for not even a minute reactionsto sensitive skin . A little goes a long ways too. You do not need to slather this on go get it to work.  Highly recommend this product! nan
