Mikayla from TikTok sold me and seriously I’m so glad she did. I’ve been SEARCHING for a good lightweight product that still provides some coverage for my DRY SKIN. I struggle with my makeup flaking but this product leaves my skin smooth, even, and while it’s not hydrating it definitely doesn’t dry the skin so with a good prep this turns out perfect. I can’t recommend this enough if you’ve been on the hunt. Dry Skin light coverage search is over.
