I was super happy to find out I was receiving this product to test because my aunt uses it daily and always RAVES about it. I used this product for two weeks during my nightly routine. First off, I love the clean, fresh fragrance it has. Secondly, a little goes a very long way, so you will get a lot of use from one jar. Now letâ€™s talk about my results - My skin looks and feels more youthful than before, plus it has helped diminish any dark spots and acne scars I had. I am very pleased and will buy more once this jar runs out. LOVE!
