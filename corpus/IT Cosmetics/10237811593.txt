I’ve been using this morning and night. It’s a thick cream but feels lightweight. My skin looks so good that some days I don’t wear foundation. I’ve tried a ton of creams, anywhere from high end to low end. This is one of my top creams to use. It wears great under makeup. It has brightens, my pores look smaller and fine lines disappearing. I would 100% recommend this product. Works
