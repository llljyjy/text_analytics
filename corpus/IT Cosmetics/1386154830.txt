This is a really good moisturizer. No scent, easy to apply, absorbs quickly, not greasy, leaves your face very well nourished and protected. I canâ€™t say it should be sold for $72, or that it is miraculous, but it does leave dry skin comfortable. As far as anti-aging, I would need to use it for quite a while to notice any changes in fine lines. Excellent Moisturizer
