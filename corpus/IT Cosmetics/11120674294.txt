This product provides a lot of moisture. This will last you a really long time even using it as suggested. Which is twice a day, morning and night. You literally need just a couple pee sized amounts to cover your whole face. A little is a lot. The reason for 4 stars is because it feels pretty thick. Almost like sunscreen or something similar in thickness. But it definitely receives dryness in my skin. So if you are looking for some much needed moisture, then this is definitely for you. nan
