This cream made my skin visibly plump/hydrated, decreasing the appearance of fine lines. The texture of this cream is not very thick and applies to the skin easily. A little bit goes a long way so this tub lasts a few months. Even though I prefer a pump/tube because of hygiene a tub is something I secretly like. It allows me to use the product completely without wasting any. love it
