I have tried many brands of moisturizing creams and IT Cosmetics Confidence in a cream is by far one of the best that I have tried. It not only keeps my skin looking and feeling itâ€™s best, but it sinks right into your skin and does not make it look or feel greasy. My skin tends to break out a lot and this cream did not make it break out at all. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a moisturing cream. IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Cream!
