I was very excited to try IT Cosmeticsâ€™ Confidence in a Cream and it did not disappoint!  The cream has a very pleasing fragrance. It went on my skin very easy and makes it feel super smooth and moisturized. The product went into my skin rather than sitting on top. I am looking forward to incorporating this cream into my daily routine. Would definitely recommend it. Best Cream!
