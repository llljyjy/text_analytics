I’m pretty picky about moisturizers, so I was skeptical when I received a free sample of IT Cosmetics Secret Sauce Anti-Aging Moisturizer.  I first tried it at night. It has a nice thick consistency, is not watery or chunky, and was easy to spread on my face. A little goes a long way. There was no overpowering or fake smell. It absorbed on my face quickly and was not greasy.  When I woke the next morning, my skin felt soft and dewy. I also tried this moisturizer during the day. Again, it was not greasy and absorbed completely, leaving my skin soft. I had no irritation or clogged pores like I sometimes get with other moisturizers. And I felt like my skin was protected and soft for hours after use. I spent a day outside in the cold wind at my daughter’s lacrosse tournament and this moisturizer soothed and hydrated my face completely. I highly recommend this moisturizer and I will be purchasing it when this jar is empty. New Favorite Moisturizer
