I’m in love with this moisturizer and I’m pretty certain it’s my new favorite. I didn’t even know about it until now, but wish I had sooner. It feels thick and luxurious, yet absorbs without any heaviness. It has a very light and natural scent. It seems to fill in and add suppleness to my skin between the fine lines. 35 and without makeup, this cream also feels like a mattifying primer which is an added bonus. I can see why it’s a beauty favorite and would totally purchase again. Great moisture for maturing skin
