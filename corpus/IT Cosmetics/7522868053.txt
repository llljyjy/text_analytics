I really enjoyed IT Confidence in a Cream!   It glides on the skin and absorbs quickly with no greasy feeling.  I like that itâ€™s not overly fragranced.  My skin does look and FEEL nicer after applying; I can tell that is does have a real benefit.  I would definitely purchase this cream again as a mainstay to my nighttime skincare routine! nan
