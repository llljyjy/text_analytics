I received It cosmetics confidence in a cream from BzzAgent to try out and give my honest opinion. I got lucky getting picked for this study because I love this face cream! I’ve been using this face cream every morning and night for 3 weeks now and love the improvements I’m seeing in my skin! This cream has a light citrus’s smell and is perfectly thick and creamy. A little goes a long way with this cream. It melts like butter into my skin and leaves me feeling totally moisturized all day. In just a short time using this product I’ve noticed my skin looking more supple and youthful and bright. It has also really helped with my fine lines. I can’t wait to continue using this cream and tell my family and friends how much I love It’s Confidence in a cream!! This is definitely my new go to daily face cream! Confidence booster
