I received this as a free sample and was thrilled with the product. I loved the richness of the moisturizer. A little goes a long way! I have dry skin and this was very quenching and it sunk into my skin like butter!! I have used Confidence in a Rosy Tone before and I also loved! I loved the smell, it reminded me of a fancy spa!    I would absolutely recommend this product! Spa Treatment in a box!
