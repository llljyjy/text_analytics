as soon as i put it on i could tell that my skin looked smoother and my pores looked smaller. unfortunately after wearing it for 6 hours or so i started breaking out pretty badly. i can always tell when it’s from a product i’m wearing because the acne comes on suddenly. i highly recommend this for people who do not have acne prone skin but do not recommend it for those who do. not great for acne prone skin
