Perfect, Perfect, Perfect! This is everything you want and need in a moisturizer. I have combo skin but more on the drier side and some acne - slightly sensitive. I have noticed after two weeks that my skin looks and feels healthy! My skin is even, plump and dewy fresh after using this. What I really love is that this minimizes the look of pores and lines. I believe it is helping the texture as well. The texture and consistency of this moisturizer is phenomenal, it doesn’t feel heavy, greasy or sticky. It is thick yet emollient? It melts into the skin and my face eats it up, it doesn’t sit on the skin in a bad way. It leaves behind the perfect amount of everything - clear & beautiful radiance. I have not tried this under a full blown face of makeup besides a light layer of concealer and it didn’t separate or peel. I loved the original Confidence in a Cream but this has truly blown me away! The ingredients are legitimate and they work! Plus it’s now Vegan and less plastic! This is so worth it! This needs to be in everyone’s bathroom. I will forever purchase this and hype it up. I can’t wait for the winter time to see how my skin takes it then. Follow me on IG & TT @apollyonyx_ for more beauty content & reviews! To be honest, you need it (;
