I love this formula! I found this at the most perfect time! Usually, I have combination skin with a more oily side but I’ve been developing fine lines from my scrub caps sucking the moisture from my forehead! Since finding this product I noticed that it keeps my forehead moisturized throughout my 12 hour shifts in sterile scrub caps and has reduced the fine lines due to plumping the skin with hydration. It doesn’t leave a sticky film on your face, which is a plus! The jar is huge and a little goes a long way so I can tell that it’s a great deal! It doesn’t have a very strong fragrance but it does have a nice light scent. I will be recommending this to friends, family and my supporters! Wrinkle remover
