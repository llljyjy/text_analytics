I have never used a cleansing balm before now. I know they say oil based cleansers are good for even oily skin, but I was always nervous it would make me break out. I am so glad I decided to give this a try! It removes all my makeup extremely well (sometimes I need a little something extra for my waterproof mascara, but that could just be me being too hesitant for how I apply the balm to my eyes) Itâ€™s also extremely easy to use, and has a faint but pleasant scent. I prefer it better without using water, but it does work well that way as well. nan
