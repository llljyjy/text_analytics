I love using cleansing balms and this one is great. The jar is very large which I appreciate so I know I can keep this for awhile. Itâ€™s lightly scented and was very pleasant. Upon putting it on my skin it melted beautifully and my makeup including eye makeup came right off. I loved this! Good cleansing balm. Melts makeup
