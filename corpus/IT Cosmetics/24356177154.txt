I was lucky to be able to try this cream and I really love it it has a very pretty light scent and is very light going on. I have been using it now a little over two weeks and I can notice a difference on my skin. My skin looks better and feels better define lines I have around my eyes are going away. The red lines I have on my face seem to be getting better and my face never feels dry. I have tried many creams and this one seems to work best for me. I will definitely keep buying this cream it is amazing. I don’t look like I’m going to be turning 60 next month Confidence in a cream anti-aging
