I’ve been using Confidence in a Cream Hydrating Moisturizer for just over two weeks as my first applied product both morning and night. Have to say, I’m very impressed. My skincare routine involves layering a bunch of serums and creams at night. In the morning, I apply the Confidence in a Cream first, then sunscreen, primer, and finally foundation. I experienced zero pilling when using this product and am able to apply my normal products over it with a good result. After two weeks, my skin looks visibly younger, fine lines are diminished, pores look less noticeable. Adding Confidence in a Cream has definitely improved my overall skin appearance. I am very happy with the results and will continue to make this step 1 of my skincare routine.  Some moisturizing products make my skin break out and, after two weeks of using this twice a day, I have experienced no blemishes or problems. I was very fortunate to receive a sample to try but my review is based on my actual experience and is an honest reflection of how my skin reacted to this product. Visible results in two weeks of use!
