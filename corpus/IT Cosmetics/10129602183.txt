It Cosmetics has some amazing skincare and this did not disappoint!! This product really works! I have fairly large pores and this has greatly reduced them. My texture has gotten a lot better. It’s been working wonders on my crows feet and wrinkles. I also have dry skin and this has long lasting hydration that soaks into the skin nicely. A product that claims to do a lot of things and actually DELIVERS! I’d highly recommend! nan
