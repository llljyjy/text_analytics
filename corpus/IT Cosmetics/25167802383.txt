Iâ€™ve been using this product for about two weeks now and I simply love it.The formula works amazing on my face, by melting my makeup off on the first try. I usually wear soft makeup but I like to use waterproof black mascara and eyeliner which is hard sometimes to come off, and this removes everything instantly. The best part is that it d it does not dry out my face. After I used it my skin feels clean and hydrated. I would totally recommend it to my family and friends. This makeup removal balm is a game chager
