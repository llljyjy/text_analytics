What I liked the very most about this cream was how quickly it was absorbed into my skin.  Sometimes, I feel as though I am wiping off excess cream when applying other creams, but this was not the case.  It was quickly absorbed into my skin and provided a refreshing hydrated look...love this cream!! Easily absorbs and hydrates!!
