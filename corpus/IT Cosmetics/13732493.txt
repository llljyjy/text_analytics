Itâ€™s concentrated cream has a nice feel and smell.  It glides on wonderfully and absorbs well.  I noticed the  skin on my face seem more pumper after a few days of use.  I did not notice that much change to my neck area though.  I am a bit older so it will take some more time.  I will keep on using the crean and see how much changes will happen with long term use.
