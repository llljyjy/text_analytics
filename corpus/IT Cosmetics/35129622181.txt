Pros: Smooth texture, works, scentless, & a little goes a long wayCons: Stings My cheeks have very visible pores, and this serum made them disappear in two weeks! I have skin that’s more on the sensitive side, so I had to build up to using it every other day because it irritated my skin too much. This product also burns/stings a bit initially, which is a bit concerning. However, it did its job and made my pores invisible, so i can’t complain. The bottle is on the bigger side and a few drops go a long way, so the price isn’t that bad. nan
