I absolutely love this cream! It is everything it claims to be and more.  I noticed a difference within a few days of trying it. My skin looked smother and more hydrated. I am over 50 and have tried so many moisturizers from expensive to inexpensive and most all of them have been disappointing. It has even helped reduce the signs of make up settling into lines and wrinkles. This is now my go to moisturizer. A must try!
