I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. Unfortunately I forgot to take before and after Photos. But I have been using this product for little over a week and I like it. It is very hydrating without being oily. It smoothly applies and sets in within seconds. I feel like it moisturizes my skin without being to thick. I have not noticed a difference in my skin, but itâ€™s not doing negative things, which is a plus. nan
