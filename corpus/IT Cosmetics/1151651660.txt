I wanted to love this but alas I did not. I prefer the original version. While it seemed to have the sane results overall the tacky feeling after applying it wouldn’t go away. I tried applying less and that didn’t work, still sticky. As the day wore on  my face became shiny and in need of toner and powder. The cream did plump up fine lines around my eyes and I did see some lightening of hyperpigmentation that I feel would diminish with continued use of the product. For me, I will continue to use this on my décolleté instead of my face. If you have dryer skin this is for you! Confidence in a cream?
