I have been using Confidence in a Cream every day for weeks and I have already seen a significant improvement in my skin’s texture and hydration level. I have stubborn combination skin that responds well to very few face creams, but this cream is like a magical potion that works wonders to even out my complexion and keep hydration locked in, without my face looking greasy. It doesn’t cause breakouts and only a little is needed for my entire face and neck. This is an overall masterpiece in my book, and I foresee myself buying many jars in the future. The Perfect Every Day Face Cream!
