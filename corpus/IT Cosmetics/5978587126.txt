This product really does what it claims.  Minimizes fine lines around my mouth and eyes.  Absorbs into my skin instead of laying on top of it and makes my skin silky and soft to the touch.  I couldnâ€™t ask for a better product that is reasonably priced.  Highly recommended.  The only thing that is annoying is that when I sweat and it runs in my eyes it really makes them burn. Favorite moisturizer!
