I want to start out with saying, I’m 23. I use anti-aging creams as it is better to start young. That being said, my boyfriend is 32. With just a couple of weeks of use, I can see his fine lines lighten a bit, his skin feels so much softer and he seems happier with his skin. He was so happy with it that, after I used it for two weeks I just let him have it to himself. He loves it. It’s thick, the way a cream should be. But it isn’t unpleasant or heavy on the skin. My only complaint is how strong the scent is. Seriously, that’s my only complaint. So if fragrance doesn’t bother you, pop off my friend. Get your cream. It Feels Good
