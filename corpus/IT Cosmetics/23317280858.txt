I think the packaging feels low-medium end, so it wouldn’t be a product that I would gift to someone or make me feel particularly luxe. The cream itself is surprisingly thick and has quite a bit of hold. It has a mild pleasant scent, but I don’t think it’s fragranced. I have regular to oily skin and felt this was a bit too much for my face. I also tend to layer skincare products and given the thickness it just didn’t seem like a great option for layering. I found it most beneficial as a neck cream where I’m not as prone to break outs but could still benefit from a tightening cream. Overall it’s something I’ll continue to use on my neck, but time will tell if it’s something I purchase in the future. Confidence in a Cream
