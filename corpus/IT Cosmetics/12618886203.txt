This face cream has the best texture I’ve ever tried, so buttery and nourishing. Really helps with flaky skin. Maybe it’s a but rich for hot weather but it’s going to be my first choice for winter! Dry skin people will be in love with this face cream! Also it never pills under my SPF(which is a problem with many moisturizers I’ve tried) Skin is Plump, nourished & healthy!
