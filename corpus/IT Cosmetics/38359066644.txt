I have nothing but great things to say about this product. I use it religiously. I put it on with my moisturizer in the morning and night. It gets rid of fine lines and helps smooth skin under my eyes. It is light and doesnâ€™t leave a residue. Highly recommend you add this to your beauty routine for baby smooth skin.
