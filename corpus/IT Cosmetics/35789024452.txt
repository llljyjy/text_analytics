I have been using this cream for the last 2 weeks and I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised.  My usual cream sells for $89, so not only is this a very effective option, it is also less expensive.  In our current economy, being able to save money on things that we need is a big win! This cream keeps my skin hydrated and is not greasy or heavy.  It makes my skin feel comfortable - my skin is so dry that I must use a moisturizer in the morning and night. It also has a very light scent which I appreciate! Overall I can say that this cream is as good or better than my current moisturizer and at a lower price point!  In fact, I like this cream so much I purchased their neck cream too!  I think this is a great product! I am so pleasantly surprised!
