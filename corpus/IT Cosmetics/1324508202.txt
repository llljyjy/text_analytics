This stuff is amazing! Not only does it smell great, but it works really well. I don’t need to use much, maybe just a dime size and it covers my whole face. It just melts in my face and I massage it in, which reminds me of a facial. It takes off my waterproof mascara without leaving much of a residue. It’s gentle on my skin and around my eyes. It leaves my skin soft and moist. This cleansing balm is equivalent to one of my holy grails. I would definitely get this as an alternative to what I already have. I’m going to enjoy taking off my makeup with this cleansing balm! Magic makeup remover
