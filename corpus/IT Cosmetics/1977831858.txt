This is a lovely cream at the right price!  Usually creams do not have enough moisture and just disappear on my dry skin.  This one has a great THICK consistency and you can actually feel it moisturizing and plumping your skin.  At the end of the day, I have a nice healthy glow.  Not an oily shine, a beautiful healthy glow!  It may be a bit much for some, but if you need heavy duty moisture at a reasonable price, this is a winner. Great Value!
