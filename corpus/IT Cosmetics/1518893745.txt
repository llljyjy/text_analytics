I received this from IT Cosmetics for my honest review. I liked how thick this moisturizer is, it’s a great nighttime cream. Because it’s so thick I don’t know that I would use this for daytime unless it was the winter. I think that I do wake up with my skin feeling plump and not dry. My biggest deterrent though is the smell. It is SO SO fragranced. For me that is a big turn off as I hate overly perfumed products. But besides that, I would recommend! moisturizing
