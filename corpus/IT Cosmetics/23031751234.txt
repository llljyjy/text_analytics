I truly love Confidence in a Cream by IT Costentics. I usually have the issue that gel based product don’t moisturizer enough but cream based products leave my skin oily. Not with this one though. I have slightly sensitive and combination style skin and this cream didn’t break me out or clog my pores. It has a thicker consistency that I’m not really used to since I usually use gel based products on my face. This didn’t take but two seconds to get all soaked up by my skin though, so no worries here.It left my skin moisturized and hydrated. It feels plump and looks healthier. It has a fairly strong scent which I kind of wish it didn’t have. But this just a small thing and I can deal with it. I would recommend this product to my friends and family. I would also purchase it again in the future. I received this product as a free sample in return for my honest review. Great moisturizer with a stronger scent
