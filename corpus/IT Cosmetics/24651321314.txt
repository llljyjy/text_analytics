What a treat. The IT Cosmetics Secret Sauce shouldn’t be a secret!  I love the consistency of it and I use it on my face and neck. NOT greasy.  NO film.  NO strong scent.  I can go right from applying the lotion to putting on makeup because it absorbs so quickly.  I just love it. I don’t usually treat myself to anything of this price, but it’s worth every penny.  Bye, drug store face lotion.  I can’t go back now. What a treat!  It's perfection.
