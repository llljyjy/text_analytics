I love this! Seriously, could not rave about it more. I love how this cream makes my skin feel, I love how it looks, how clear it is and hydrated. I use this once a day at night after washing my face and it is so creamy and feels so hydrating. I’ve used other creams that are advertised as a hyaluronic acid and even after sleeping all night, my face feels a little greasy in the morning. You don’t get that with this cream at all. I’ve used a lot of different products over the last few years from serums to creams and to be honest, I just love this so I stick with it. Since I like it so much, I believe it is just added incentive to keep using it and stay on my routine. I will definitely buy this product. I try and use a decent amount and not too much, it is a thick cream so it spreads really easily and a little can go a long way. I just love it and can’t say it enough. I’ve already recommended it to my sister and mother in law. FANTASTIC!!!!
