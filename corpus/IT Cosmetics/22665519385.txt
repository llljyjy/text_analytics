I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion. The IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream was not very much as great as i had hoped it to be. It didn’t leave my face feeling with such a glow as others have. My skin felt like it was still missing something. I did follow thru on how to apply. Im not going to lie i am not a fan of it due to lack of “Confidence“ in this cream. Didn't do much
