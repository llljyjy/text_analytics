This has become a key product in adjusting my skincare routine!  I have recently switched up my routine to start including Retinol.Many people know that Retinol can be harsh on the skin and may take time to build a tolerance to it. This has become a lifesaver in helping me implement retinol. As a new user, I was using highly concentrated retinol every night, since I didn’t notice any of the warning side effects, but by day four I noticed my skin hurt and became sensitive to the touch. I needed to find an anti aging product that would soothe my skin, that didn’t include retinol or a very minimal amount. So, I started to cycle my retinol nights, using this It Cosmetics moisturizer ontop of my rentinol, then without a retinol product, every other night.It has been a life saver in soothing my skin from harsh skincare products, but also delivering anti-aging benefits as well with Ceramides, Peptides, and Hyaluronic Acid.My skin literally feels plump under the surface, diminishing obvious lines and creating a more youthful look. I absolutely love this as my retinol partner.About my skin: I have combination skin, don’t suffer from acne (aside one pimple here or there, and don’t generally have strong reactions to products. Drawbacks: This product does have a small fragrance smell to it, almost like lavender. The only thing I would recommend changing is the added fragrance. Fragrance in skincare items can cause side effects like extra sensitivity, breakouts, and even counteract the soothing benefits. Let’s normalize no fragrance, even if it’s from “essential oils”!
