This balm has a lovely texture - it’s easy to scoop out and melts right on contact without dragging at my skin like some other balms I’ve tried. It emulsifies well with water and rinses off so cleanly that I often don’t feel the need for a second cleanse. It takesoff all makeup and skincare products, including tubing mascara and my face feels soft and hydrated after I rinse it off. Also, it doesn’t leave that weird filmin my eyes, as is often the case with cleansing balms. It can also be used as a wash off mask. It does have a fragrance,but it’s not overpowering. I would suspect this to be sensitizing to some people, but it doesn’t seem to bother my acne-prone skin. It’s on the pricier side, but it’s very rich and slippery, so a little goes a long way and should last you a long time. I would definitelyrepurchase! Effective and leaves my skin beautifully soft!
