I have a normal skin (outside of having sensitive/rosacea skin). I’ve been using this moisturizer at night, after all of my serums & I’m enjoying it. My skin is noticeably softer & brighter in the morning after wearing this overnight. I don’t wear it in the morning/daytime, it’s very heavy, too rich for my to wear under makeup. It’s a great nighttime moisturizer & it definitely keeps my skin from drying out with all the other products in my routine. Very moisturizing
