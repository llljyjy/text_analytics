There is so much to love about this cream. I had to leave one star off just because it does not contain sunscreen and I like to multitask! Other than that, it is so pleasant to use. It has a very light clean scent, it is creamy and rich but in no way greasy or heavy. It sinks right in and I can feel it moisturizing my skin immediately. I am spending a lot of time in the sun this summer and this has definitely been my go to moisturizer. It feels really good on my skin. I am really very happy with it and you should try it too! My NEW Go To!
