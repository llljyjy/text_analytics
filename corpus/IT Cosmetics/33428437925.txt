I love ItCosmetics skin care. I started using over 6 months ago and have had a major improvement in my skin health of my face. The cream lightens bur just a little tiny bit. It definitely decreased my under eye puffiness and I haven’t had dry skin around my eyes since. Doesn’t burn or irritate my eyes. Very soft to no scent which I love. It’s not very weighted down even though it moisturizes well. I’m pleased. Favorite Eye Cream
