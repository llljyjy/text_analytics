This moisturizer is a silky cream that absorbs nicely as long as you don’t use too much. It’s obviously better absorbed if you wait for your other products to absorb completely first. It’s not too heavy but for some it might be even better to use in the winter. It’s great for dry skin! It’s very moisturizing for sure. I love that there’s Niacinamide in it. Thats a huge plus for every skin type! When I wore it at night, I woke up with a glow to my face and my skin was really soft. After continued use, my pores started to look smaller, my one line between my brows seemed softer, my acne spots were fading, and I continued to have a nice glow to my face. I’m excited to see the results from even more continued use! I like this moisturizer, especially for the winter! Any skin type can benefit from this moisturizer, especially dry and combo. For oily skin type, this would be great to apply before bedtime so you can enjoy the benefits. Great Ingredients!!
