It cosmetics products are always successful. I like the packaging because the opening is wide enough to scoop even with ur fingers even if ur already towards the end. It does have some smell to it but the fragrance isn’t super strong nor is it granny smelling. It leaves skin soft supple and hydrated. But it is a little heavy so a little goes along way. Leaves me looking like I got enough sleep. But as far as the anti aging I don’t really see any difference. And it is a little expensive for the quality. Which is why I give it a 4. If its in ur price range tho its nice. nan
