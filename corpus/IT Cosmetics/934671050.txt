This is a great product! The cleanser was very creamy even though it doesn’t appear to be. When applied it just melted onto my skin easy to spread only took a very small amount and it took the makeup off so easily and left my skin so soft that I didn’t need to apply moisturizer when I was finished. I would recommend this. Makeup Gone
