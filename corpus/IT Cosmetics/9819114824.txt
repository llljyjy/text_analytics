I usually have a hard time getting all my makeup to come over. Wipes work well but I have to use a few of them to get all the makeup off especially mascara. You don’t need  a whole lot. It does feel oily on your skin so you’ll have to clease your face again with your normal facial cleanser. . The rose scent is very nice. My skin is very dry so this product seemed to really help to moisturize and is very gentle. it really does work!
