This confidence in a cream is superbly creamy and smooth, almost like a Greek yogurt consistency. The jar is a nice, heavy container that feels substantial to handle, very elegant packaging for sure. I use this cream nightly, and apply it after my serum. It applies smoothly and easily, gliding over the skin and is absorbed readily. I feel like my skin is plumper after applying, and velvety to the touch after the cream dries. I like the cream so much, that I don’t wash it off in the morning. I apply my morning skin care right over top followed by my makeup. A very small amount (pea size) is all I use every day, and that is definitely sufficient. It has such nice spreadability that I don’t need any more than that! Since I’ve been using this cream, my skin has been smoother, softer, and most notably, it is plumper! I really enjoy this cream and would recommend it to anyone. Plumper skin!
