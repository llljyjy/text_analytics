After using this cream twice a day for 2 weeks, I noticed how it made my skin look smoother, more toned, and firmer. It plumped my skin and softened the appearance of my fine lines and made the pores in my t-zone less noticeable. It wasn’t too heavy for my combination skin and didn’t make it appear oily.I like how it toned my skin  and look forward to increased results from continued use. I recommend its use for its anti-aging benefits. Effective Anti-Aging Moisturizer
