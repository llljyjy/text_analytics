I have been using the IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream Anti Aging Hydrating Moisturizer for a few weeks now. I was excited to try it as I’ve always been a fan of the regular Confidence in a Cream. The moisturizer definitely lives up to it’s claims of delivering intense hydration. My skin felt incredible after applying and the hydration lasted all day and/or night. My skin looked hydrated, healthy and glow-y. My reason for giving this product 4 stars instead of 5 is that while the moisturizer is incredibly hydrating, it is thick and heavier and would not be the consistency of choice for myself during the hot summer months. Sometimes I felt like walking outside in the heat/humidity, I looked like a grease ball. The hydration was worth it though and I am SO looking forward to using this product all winter long. Extremely Hydrating!
