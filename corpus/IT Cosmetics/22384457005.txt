WHAT?  Only 3 STARS??  I do not get it.  This is the best night time moisturizer for my skin.  I wake up without the typical dry skin feel, only a little goes a long way.  I use this specifically when bringing retinol into my night time skin care.  It is the healing final step. Best night moisturizer, a plus when using retinol
