Iâ€™m starting to get older and wanted to find a cream to help with hydration loss. This cream fits the bill but I found it to be a bit heavy for summertime. My skin is on the oily side but dehydrated nowadays so I think I might try to find a gel and switch back to this one during the fall/winter! nan
