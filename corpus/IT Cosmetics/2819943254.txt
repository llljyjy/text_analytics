I was very excited to try this moisturizer. I had a small sample in the past and wanted to try it over a longer period of time. I really like this moisturizer! I feels great on the skin for overnight use. However, I found it to be too heavy to use during the day for my combination skin and the high humidity of Florida. My makeup became shiny almost immediately when I used it under my makeup. However, it’s summer so I’ll definitely try it again under makeup when it cools off a little. I would definitely recommend to a friend! nan
