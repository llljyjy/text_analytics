So truth is I’m getting old & I’m super afraid of any type of fillers, mostly because I’m not fond of needles in my face.  I’ve tried quite a few different face creams and nothing has quite worked.  I’m not looking for a miracle just something that looks close to miracle-like.  Anyway, I knew IT as a cosmetics brand, which I like, so I decided to try their Confidence in a Cream.  The cream goes on heavy, so I was initially concerned but my skin absorbed it and after about a couple of weeks my lines are there but way less noticeable. I put on foundation and now it doesn’t look like I have deep crevices, looks way smoother. Love this cream!! My new forever face cream.
