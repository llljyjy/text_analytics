I have always loved confidence in a cream - it’s one of the best heavy, luxurious face creams for the price. It’s so silky and absorbs so quickly - it plumps the skin, minimizes pores and reduces fine lines. Definitely for more dry skin than oily, but great for combination skin Great product for the price
