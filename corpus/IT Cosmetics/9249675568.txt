This, like every other It Cosmetics product I’ve tried, did not disappoint. This cleansing balm is a 3 in 1 product with a creamy texture that melts away makeup with minimal effort and can also be used as a brightening cleanser and a hydrating mask. It has a light rose fragrance that isn’t overwhelming and i after every use my face feels so soft. It didn’t leave behind a sticky residue or make my skin feel tight like other cleansers I’ve tried in the past. I also appreciate that it didn’t clog my pores or cause any adverse reactions to my combination skin. This is the only product I’ve used that can effectively remove my favorite waterproof mascara. nan
