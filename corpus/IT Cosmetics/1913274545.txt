The IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream is great! I love the size and that it’s a think formula. I didn’t feel like it moisturized my skin as much as I would have like but that also could be because I am sick. I still need to continue to use it to see if it improves. But overall I’m satisfied with the product. Great thick formula.
