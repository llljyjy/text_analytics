It Cosmetics Bye Bye Makeup 3 in 1 Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm is amazing! I love the creamy texture of the balm. It feels so nice on your face and you can actually feel the balm melting into a creamy oil on your face. The scent smells like roses and reminds me of a spa. I like that you can actually feel your makeup melting off. It effectively removed my makeup when I wore bright eyeshadow, eye liner and waterproof mascara. I leave the cleansing balm on my face for about 10 minutes before washing it off to get the hydrating mask effect. It definitely works to hydrate skin and feels wonderful as a mask. I like that a little bit goes a long way and this product will last me a long time! I received this product try for free in exchange for my opinion. Hydrating Mask & Removes Makeup Flawlessly!
