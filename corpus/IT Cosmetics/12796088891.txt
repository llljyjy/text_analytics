Miracle Product! I have searched the ends of the earth for a product that would cover my broken capillaries around my nose and my rosacea on my cheeks…and I have finally found my Holy Grail Miracle Product!I was concerned that it might be too yellow or orange based on some reviews due my complexion being fairy to light with heavy cool pink under tones, but Porcelain Beige is a spot on match and it doesn’t oxidize and look obvious. It blends effortlessly, and a tiny amount covers such a large area. I typically use it along with a CC or BB cream because I don’t like a thick foundation look while I’m at work or during the daytime unless I’m at a some type of social business function. It can take the place of concealer, and it’s excellent to use on your eyelids on days that you don’t want to use eyeshadow but want coverage and brightness. I’m in my late 40’s, so I have fine lines, and combination skin. If you prep your skin with moisturizer and primer suited for your skin type, this product will last all day. Some days whenever I’m extra dry I even skip the setting powder under my eyes and it never creases as long as sparingly and over a primer. I love It Cosmetics, and if I could only pick one product of their’s to have for the rest of my life out of everything they make…This would be the one because there’s nothing else like it on the market! I like it so much better than Bye Bye Under Eyes Concealer for covering redness, and it’s far more effective that Dr. Jart’s Redness corrector which is useless. Try it! You just might find that it will change your life! Confidence Restored!
