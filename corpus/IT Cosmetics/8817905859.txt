I love the packaging of this moisturizer, it’s heavy and feels so luxurious.  It’s a thick cream consistency so a little goes a long way which is nice.  When I apply it I get like a cooling sensation from the cream and it’s so nice.  I haven’t noticed any big changes yet, I’ve been using it a couple weeks.  But I hope that it does what it claims.  Either way it is a nice moisturizer! nan
