This moisturizer worked really well for my sensitive skin. It is super hydrating and did not break me out, which is an issue I have had in the past with other products. I found that this moisturizer works best for me as a before-bed moisturizer to help keep my skin from drying out overnight.I would recommend giving this a try if you are looking for something that is very hydrating but doesnâ€™t feel too heavy once it has been applied and been absorbed. I will probably purchase more when I run out. Great moisturizer for dry skin
