I love this, I also use makeup forever matte velvet but I prefer this in the summer.  The coverage is similar to a foundation but does not feel heavy.  I like that it has spf and a little product goes a long way with this. It is not cakey and does not crease on me in nearly 100 F heat after several hours. recommend
