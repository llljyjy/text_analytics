This cream is very moisturizing and I can see results within a day. It’s not sticky like other moisturizers and absorbs nicely into my skin. My skin is more hydrated, supple and looks radiant the next day. I use this at night but skip it in the morning because I don’t like the shine but it works so well to leave my skin feeling soft. nan
