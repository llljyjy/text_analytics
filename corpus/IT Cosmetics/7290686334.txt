I was excited to receive a sample of IT Confidence in a Cream for review.  I was hopeful that I would see some of the benefits the product claimed it provided regarding improving signs of aging.  My first impression was I liked the light citrusy scent and the texture was neither too light or too heavy.  It also left my skin feeling silky and hydrated.  Although I did not notice much improvement in my fine lines, I did feel my skin a little firmer and less dry.  I would like to continue using this cream to see if my skin improves further.
