I always loved the original CC cream, but as someone with oily skin, I always hated the eventual greaseball effect caused by the original formula’s emollience. This formula is totally free of that and somehow manages to keep your skin hydrated as well. One thing I’ve noticed is that this foundation HATES SILICONE PRIMERS. If you use anything that’s pore-filling, this will literally just slip and slide on top and settle in pores because I believe this is meant to be used by itself. I layer this on top of my Japanese Kiss me Mommy SPF 50 and spread it out with my fingers/artis brush and the affect is stunning and super poreless. This formula does not cause deep creasing like the original one did when I bake with it. This foundation is very blurring as well. This product is totally only for like a day look, not for sweaty night out going to the club or gym. When you’re extremely greasy and you touch your face, the transfer/sliding off is quite severe so just make sure you powder before touching.A cool aspect about this product is that 8 hours after doing my makeup I re-set my foundation with powder and added a second wet layer overtop with a sponge where the product faded and it lays on top of itself seamlessly. Super thrilled with this formulation and I adore the blue metallic packaging. Awesome foundation but don’t use any silicone base
