I was gifted a free product courtesy of @Bzzagent & it Cosmetics in exchange for my honest review. I’m totally in awe.This cream is absolutely wonderful, thick and thin wrapped up in one super intense, hydrating present for my face. At 52 with combination skin this is exactly what I need. I followed the directions and applied twice a day on a clean face and around the neck area rubbing in an upward direction. After a long day my skin still felt hydrated and soft and it didn’t make my oily spots worse either Great results after a few weeks!!
