I was really excited to try this cream as I have heard so many good things about it. I wouldn’t say it lives up to the hype, but it is a very good hydrating cream. I have not seen any crazy improvement in my fine lines or anything. Also, the scent is a bit herbally which I don’t love but isn’t terrible either. Overall, I probably wouldn’t repurchase just for the price point. It would make an awesome gift though. nan
