I love the moisturizer. I have very dry skin and it gets even more dry when I put on my acne medication so I need a good moisturizer. A little goes a long way. I applied to my skin and automatically my skin felt hydrated and didnâ€™t have the white flakiness on my skin. I will definitely keep using this moisturizer. Amazing
