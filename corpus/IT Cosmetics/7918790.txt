This cream has a very smooth, silky texture, and absorbs quickly. It is not greasy. Itâ€™s not overly fragranced, but it does have a pleasant scent. Unfortunately, it does not layer well under my makeup: it pills up and looks cakey. It is suitable for nighttime use. I received this product free through BzzAgent. Just OK
