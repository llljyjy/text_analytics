Loving the New Formula! It Smells so light and is not heavy at all. The cream is rich and soft and it absorbs beautifully. You don’t have to use much and you get amazing hydration for the little ant you do use! My fine lines have taken vacay and skin is much smoother. I’ve only used this a cpl of weeks and I cannot wait to see my skin after a cpl of months. At this rate, I know I am going to be astounded! I haven’t had a Cream like this in a LONG time and I am super happy with the results to date. It hasn’t negatively impacted my skin since I started using it. No breaking out, No greasiness and no headaches!! I can’t wait to try the Night version of this Cream!! Definitely recommend. I received this complimentary for my honest opinion. Blown Away!
