I’ve tried a lot of face creams. I normally go for lighter moisturizer as I don’t want my skin to be weighed down. This moisturizer while heavier than the ones I’ve used didn’t feel it. I was pleasantly surprised especially since it’s summer. I had no extra oily residue and my skin was left soft and supple. It reduced fine lines, made my skin look brighter and refreshed. It’s definitely something I’d buy again and recommend to friends and family. nan
