I have used this multiple times to try and figure out my opinion. So pro tip, blend this with your fingers mostly and then lightly perfect it with a damp beauty blender. This is a beautiful product. Did it cover my red pimples flawlessly like the tik toks i saw? Not really but still pretty good. However the downfall is price and quantity you get. Itâ€™s expensive for how much product you get vrs how much you need to use to get good coverage. love this, but too expensive for quantity
