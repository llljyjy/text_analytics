The It Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream has a soft, creamy, moisturizing feel to it just to the touch. Dry skin loves it. I like to think of my skin as combination-ish, leaning more towards dry (I used to be very oily). It can easily be worked in to the skin so that’s pretty quick moisturization for the thickness of the cream. My apprehension was on it breaking me out as I’ve tried other moisturizers that were on the same level of thickness and ended up with issues, but so far so good. I’m a big fan of niacinamide for evening skin tone as it is in some of my current products and have heard squalane is great for skin hydration so we shall see the results over time.  A little goes a long way so it’ll last for quite a while. Bring on the anti-aging! Don’t skip your neck! Thanks to BzzAgent and It Cosmetics for introducing me to this moisturizer. Nice and Creamy
