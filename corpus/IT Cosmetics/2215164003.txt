After trying this face cream out for about a month I’ve come to like it. It’s very moisturizing without feeling heavy. It’s also helped with my skin tone a bit already. Some pigment on my  cheek bones have lightened up a tad. I’m oily skin type but it somehow still works. It totally does plump up the skin. Extra bonus! I did try the older formula and it’s similar but better. I feel it’s creamier and better at hydrating. In all I like it and will definitely think about buying it when I run out. Oh there is a slight fragrance to it. Just something to note. It did not irritate my skin and my skin can be finicky with fragrance. Nice!
