I recieved this product for free from Bzzagent. I used this moisturizer for 2 weeks consistently, but havent really noticed any anti-aging like the product claims. No real noticeable difference in my fine lines and wrinkles. This moisturizer is very thick consistency, I personally prefer a thinner, gel-like consistency for my oily skin. I feel like this would be great to use in the colder, winter months. The thing I didnt like is the strong smell, it is very heavily scented, so beware if you have sensitive skin. Strongly Scented
