Iâ€™ve been trying to find ways to ditch makeup wipes that are also easier than washing your face every night. This makeup melting balm is awesome! Just a little bit took off all my makeup including eyeliner and mascara! I just use a washcloth to wipe off after and had a fresh face for bed! Definitely my new go to! Great Makeup Remover!!
