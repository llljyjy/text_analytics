I used this product for the last week. I think if was someone who wore more makeup, maybe it would be more to my liking, but for me, I still had to use my regular eye makeup remover and I’m not generally sensitive or usually break out from products but I did have a small breakout/reaction from this one. Nothing that would make me stop using it but it was just surprising. I’ll probably go back to using my make up removal cloth. nan
