I loved this moisturizer! I used their regular moisturizer for a long time and can really feel the difference with the supercharged one. It’s really the same going on to me, but the next day my skin will feel a little plumpier, tighter, and softer. It lasts me a good while too because you don’t need to put that much on. I’ll also put it down my neck as well, which is where I’ll normally get acne if I use anything there…but this cream doesn’t clog my pores at all so I’m an all around fan :) nan
