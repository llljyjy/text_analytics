I’ve been using Confidence in a Cream for a couple weeks now and have been enjoying it. I have extreme combination skin, so some areas are super oily while others are dry and can be flakey during certain seasons. This cream is light but seems to be packed with hydration. It’s been amazing in healing and keeping the dry skin away and hasn’t left my skin overly oily. It also has a nice light scent to it. Overall I enjoy this cream and will continue to use to hopefully start seeing more benefits of it after longer usage. I definitely recommend! nan
