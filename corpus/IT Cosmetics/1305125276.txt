I got a free jar to try from BzzAgent.  I have used IT Cosmetics for years and truly believe they’re the best at both skin care and makeup.  I am 61 and do not have wrinkles or lines, although I do have sagging skin.  I think it’s due to weight loss.  I prefer IT’s gel moisturizer in the heat of summer as it’s lighter, but I will definitely keep buying this one for the colder months.  I highly recommend this one beginning around age 35.  Make sure to use down your neck and to your bra line.  It’s very gratifying to have an even skin tone in this entire area, with no crepey skin.  You need to start early!  I have some of the eye cream but don’t find the need to use it as this one is similar to eye cream. Affordable luxury
