This moisturizer has such a rich, thick texture that melts into your skin. The smell isn’t my favorite, but it’s not a deal breaker. I’ve been using this consistently for the last two weeks and have noticed how soft it makes my skin feel. For reference, I have combo/oily skin. It doesn’t make my skin look greasy, but gives a nice hydrated look. Personally, for the summer I like this at night and my lighter weight water cream in the AM. Come the drier months, I’ll probably use this both AM and PM. Highly recommend. love it
