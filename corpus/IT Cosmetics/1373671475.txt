This IT Confidence in a Cream is everything it’s hyped up to be! I received it complimentary but I definitely intend on purchasing once this jar is done. It’s lightweight and goes on smooth. It hydrates and softens instantly. It doesn’t leave me greasy or break me out. It’s such a pleasant texture. It’s great for sensitive skin. It doesn’t clog my pores which is a must for me! A little goes a long way, even on the dryer areas of my face. My skin feels like how I’d imagine how touching a cloud feels. It’s bouncy and super soft. I love everything about this moisturizer - including the price point! I’d definitely recommend as a day cream - as it can easily be incorporated into any skincare regimen. Everything it’s hyped up to be!
