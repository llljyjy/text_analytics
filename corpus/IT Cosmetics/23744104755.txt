I got the “Bye Bye Makeup 3-1 makeup melting cleansing balm“ with rose hip and vitamin c. The packaging was exactly how it was advertised as sustainable and no waste. the information & directions are printed on the jar & is able to be seen all the time! It is also very moisturizing & you get a small hint of smell from the rose hip it is not strong or overpowering. I tried this as all 3; cleanser, make up remover & mask. I loved it as a mask & makeup remover because the shea butter & the thickness & smoothness of this product made it stay on my face in the places I put it. When used as a mask it is very hydrating & relaxing as applies like a mask & not a cleanser that is soapy etc. It made my makeup a breeze to take off including the waterproof mascara & eyeliner. I didn’t have to use 3-4makeup wipes you just put this on & wipe it off with a washcloth & my face was bare & felt clean not dry & stiff but moisturized, soft &silky.  I definitely recommend this if you are looking for any of the 3 as you will be getting a product that does more than 1 job. Especially of your like to have your skin feeling moisturized & not dry & stiff after cleaning or removing makeup. This will replace your makeup wipes also! 3-1 Cleanser
