I’ve really enjoyed trying this confidence cream. Its a nice thicker texture and the smell is subtle. A little goes a long way. At first I thought it made my face feel greasy like other creams I’ve tried but then it soaks right into my skin and gave me a really nice smooth feeling and allowed my makeup to go on flawlessly. I have dark spots on my cheeks and after using the cream for 2 weeks I already notice a difference and the spots have gotten lighter. I also feel like my forehead creases are not as prominent. I would definitely recommend you give it a try. Confidence in a jar
