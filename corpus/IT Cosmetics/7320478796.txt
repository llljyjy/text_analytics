I received the IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream Hydrating Moisturizer complimentary from BzzAgent for testing purposes. I’ve used this cream nightly for the past 7 days and I must admit that I really like it. It’s both gentle and lightly scented, while being incredibly hydrating. The cream itself has a thick consistency, which I really love in a moisturizer. And a little product goes a long way, which is good compared to higher price tag. Overall, I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family, this is a great facial moisturizer. nan
