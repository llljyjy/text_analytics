I consider myself an avid It cosmetics user and super fan, I’ve always enjoyed that I can get makeup and skincare packed into one product , it’s perfect for a girl on the go when you’re short on time (specifically mentioning their holy grail CC creams) I have oily skin that is acne prone therefor I usually try to stick to water based gel moisturizers even more so during the summer months (they also make this in the gel)However after application I couldn’t get over the luxe feeling and am even more impressed that it packs super skincare ingredients to target aging skin. Rarely have I been disappointed with this brand and I will continue to purchase, explore and recommend ! It cosmetics is always a good choice!
