I love IT CC cream! However, I did make a mistake thinking I had purchased the oil-free matte version when I actually had the anti-aging formula before. Even with oily skin, I prefer the anti-aging as it applies smoother and lighter while somehow seeming to have better coverage.I tried other cc creams, though, and this really is the best! Best CC cream around!
