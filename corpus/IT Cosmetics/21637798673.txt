Literal confidence in a jar. I have used other moisturizers before and while they did fine, none of them felt like I had new skin. Literally I feel like I just had my face done with a mask. If you havenâ€™t tried this and skeptical, I understand $50 is a lot, but realistically it goes a LONG way and will certainly help you feel better. If I go a day without it, I feel overly dry and just not my best. nan
