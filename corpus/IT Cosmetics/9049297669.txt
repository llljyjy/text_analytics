I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I have combo skin  and I am at the age where Iâ€™m beginning to have fine lines  and wrinkles. I love how thick and creamy this moisturizer is without feeling ti heavy on my skin. It make my skin feel and plump and hydrated without making me greasy or breakout. It wears well under makeup as well. I definitely recommend it! Creamy hydration
