(I posted this review on IT cosmetics website and provided pictures of my chemical burns, and they denied posting it)Be so careful if you have sensitive skinI am no amateur when it comes to Retinol. I take very good care of my skin and have a strict skin cycling skincare regimen (exfoliate one night, retinol next night, repair following 1-2 nights, repeat). I received this as a sample and LOVED it. I personally love the smell, I’m not sure what people are talking about there! Then one time I used it I got a very bad chemical burn. Bummer. I know how retinols go though so I reduced this retinol to once a week, still to much. Reduced to bi-weekly, still too much. I’ve been off and on using it bi weekly and diluting it with hylauronic acid. I believe it’s time to give up on this product and accept it’s not for me. Pictures are from my last go of this product, trialing over 4 months. Love all their other products though. If you have sensitive skin…careful
