I have been using the Confidence in a cream for about 10 days now. I have normal to dry skin and when applying the cream morning and evening I have been using a very small amount as it goes far, If you use to much it could be a bit greasy especially in warm summer weather. I am enjoying the results though. It appears my fine lines are lessening, my skin is soft. I do like the fact that this product is developed with the assistance of plastic surgeons, it gives me confidence in the product and I will continue to use it to obtain maximum results. I would recommend this product to my friends. I received this product in a free sample program. I have confidence in Confidence in a Cream
