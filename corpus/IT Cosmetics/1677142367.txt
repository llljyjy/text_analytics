I have actually been really enjoying this product. It goes on extremely smooth. Love the feel of it on my skin. I have such dry skin and my skin feels really good after this. Haven’t been using it long enough to see the wrinkle improvement but I’m going to keep using it so hopefully I’ll see it. I usually have issues with the smell of products like this but the light scent is very nice. Very nice
