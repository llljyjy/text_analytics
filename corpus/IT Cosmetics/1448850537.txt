This cream seems to make a bit of a difference.  The wrinkles around my cheeks and near my mouth look slightly better.  I stopped putting it on my chin because of a small breakout but I am not positive if it was related.  I will continue to use and probably will buy again.  I would recommend it to my friends and family. nan
