Amazing!  Very hydrating and love how it makes those small crinkly wrinkles around my chin and lips just disappear.  I use about a pea-size amount of Confidence in a Cream on my face and neck and it soaks in well leaving a nice base for my IT foundation.  I does not make my mature skin feel oily.   I find the scent to be pleasant and not lingering. nan
