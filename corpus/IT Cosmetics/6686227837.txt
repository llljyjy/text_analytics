Iâ€™m sorry to say that I was disappointed in IT Confidence In a Cream.  I am familiar with the IT line of products and have used many in the past, but Confidence In a Cream did not measure up to my expectations.  I did not care for the scent at all.  I was not happy with the way it absorbed into my skin and I did not perceive any visible signs of improvement after use. Not What I Had Hoped For
