After using this for the past 3-4 weeks I can say it is a great moisturizer. I’ve only been using it at night and I really love how hydrated and plump my skin looks in the morning! Although I must admit it’s almost too hydrating for me during the day, currently mid-summer high heat and high humidity. The few times I tried it during the day my face was an oil slick within a half hour. However I’m sure it will be perfect for me when winter hits and my furnace starts sucking the moisture out of everything including my skin. Between this and my Pat McGrath Essence my furnace won’t be drying my skin up again! This has a light pleasant fragrance which doesn’t linger around, and it absorbs nicely with my other products. I haven’t experienced any pilling, although I haven’t tried it with makeup yet. Overall if you’re looking at this i say go for it! Moisturizing!
