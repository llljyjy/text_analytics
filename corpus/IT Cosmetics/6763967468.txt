I have used It! Cosmetics for several years but I had never tried their skincare line. I am so impressed with this cream. It gives my skin a subtle glow, helps with redness AND it smoothes my fine lines overnight. It also serves as a great makeup base during the day. It pairs extremely well with their CC+ cream foundation. I received this as a tester but I am adding it to my staples list moving forward. I highly recommend it. The name of this cream says it all!
