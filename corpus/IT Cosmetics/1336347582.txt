From the moment this touched my skin, it felt like a premium luxury cream. I’ve never before had a moisturizer that felt like it was feeding my skin such a healthy drink - but something about this immediately had a nourishing tingle. It’s thick and hydrating and just feels good for you. There is a mild scent that’s somewhat invigorating, somewhat medicinal, but I prefer to a chemical floral type smell. I feel more radiant after one use - this is my new favorite! Wow
