I had a chance to use the moisturizer and I like it. I used it at night since it is on the thicker side, and it left my skin soft and hydrated. I haven’t applied makeup after using it, but it goes fast into the skin, and I don’t foresee any issues there. Delicate fragrance as well. Definitely recommend. For all skin types
