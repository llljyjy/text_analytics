I love the nice rich formula of this product. I am afraid I am slightly allergic to niacinamide as my face tends to react poorly to anything containing the ingredient (which seems to be pretty rare). That being said, to be safe, I have been using this primarily on my body and haven’t noticed a reaction. It is very moisturizing and doesn’t feel heavy on the skin, even with the thicker consistency.  The scent is not bad, but I do prefer anything that I would put on my face to be fragrance free. Overall nice product! *I received this product complementary* Very hydrating!
