What a great product! This was my first time trying this product and a product from It and I was quite pleased. The results for me were quit pleasing. I could really tell a difference. The formula is thick but light on your face. My face felt hydrated and moisturized. Also soft, my face felt really smooth and soft. The product has a nice scent to it; not to stony. Just perfect. I also love the glory it gives as well. It helps give me a more youth appearance and I have noticed a difference in my fine lines diminishing. I would definitely recommend trying this product. I am really happy with it. Great Product
