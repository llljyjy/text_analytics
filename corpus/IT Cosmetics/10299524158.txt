I love how it makes my skin look and feel. This moisturizer seems a little thick when first removing from the jar but actually spreads very easily and absorbs quickly onto my skin leaving my skin feeling soft and hydrated each time I use it and I love how a little does a very long way for me. Since Iâ€™ve been using it I have noticed more even skin tone with less redness on my cheeks which is terrific and it leaves my skin plump with a vibrant glow and the pores near my cheeks are not are prominent. IT works for me so well for sure. nan
