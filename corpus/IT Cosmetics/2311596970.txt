This balm is amazing and so hydrating. Most people donâ€™t realize that a lot of cleansing balms are for double cleaning which means use this first to melt off the days makeup and grime and then follow up with a gentle cleanser to remove residue before toning and completing the rest of your skin care regimen. I love how much comes in the product too - lately balms have been getting smaller and smaller and I love to use on more than just my face when removing body makeup or after sun products Love it
