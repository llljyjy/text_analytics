I wasn’t expecting much from this because I didn’t know too much about the brand, and also because of the affordable price. It got this as a gift and gave it a go, and WOW I’m in love. It’s great for my sensitive skin and the results are actually noticeable because I started getting compliments on my skin - and that’s a rare occasion. Will definitely be re-purchasing. WOW.
