For a long time I thought IT cosmetics foundations were overhyped but I love this. I use a pretty small amount, like half a pump and it spreads so nicely and looks so seamless and natural although it adds really good coverage. I can’t wait to get a bit tanner because this is my summer shade but I can’t get enough of it. I find that it doesn’t crease in my fine lines or accentuate pores either. nan
