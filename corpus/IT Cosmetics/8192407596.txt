Let’s talk about this cream. I used this for about a week and almost immediately I noticed how much softer and smoother looking my skin was after applying it. Despite the thickness of the cream, it surprisingly doesn’t feel heavy on my skin and I am able to wear it under makeup. I use it both in the morning and evening and I would have to say, I think it gives me a bit of a glow. I don’t know if it’s suppose to or if that’s how this cream works, but I absolutely love what my skin looks like after using this. I also love that this has anti aging armorus benefits. It is lightly scented but not so much that you notice it while wearing it. I have and will continue to tell my friends about this because it’s fabulous and this has become my everyday moisturizer! nan
