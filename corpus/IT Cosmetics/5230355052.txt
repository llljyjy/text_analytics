My skin is super sensitive during summer months due to a not-so-sure-but-tests-are-leaning-towards UV ray allergy. This cream was not only very hydrating on my face, but I also applied where my skin gets itchy being exposed to the sun, and nothing else but this cream has helped soothe it. I can see a nice glow coming from my skin, it looks very healthy. For the price point, I love this as a face cream and would love to see a body lotion being developed. Ive recommended it to a friend of mine who was looking for a new soothing cream! nan
