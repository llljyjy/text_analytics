I really liked the texture of this moisturizer, it has a buttery feel and goes on smoothly. I applied it AM and PM, it did make my skin feel hydrated, but not as much as other products I have used. I also noticed it doesnâ€™t fully absorb into my skin and often left a film. I have dry, acne prone skin and need something more moisturizing. I also experienced a few breakouts, but tough to say if it was the product or due to environmental causes. I did not notice any anti-aging benefits either, so unfortunately this product is not for me. Nice texture but not for me
