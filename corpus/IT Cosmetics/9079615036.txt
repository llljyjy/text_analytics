I received this Confidence in a Cream Anti-Aging Hydrating Moisturizer complimentary from IT Cosmetics to try and review. I really like this new supercharged version of the Confidence In A Cream moisturizer.  I’ve always had fairly oily skin, but have noticed as I’ve aged that I am less oily and more combination.  This moisturizer works well with my fickle skin without making me feel greasy like some other heavy moisturizers.  It has a light clean, herbal scent that I find pleasant and it doesn’t bother my normally sensitive scent palette. This is a great moisturizer for my night time skincare routine.
