It’s Confidence In A Cream is hands down the best moisturizing face cream that I have ever tried! You don’t need to use a lot per application, just dab it on your fingers and smooth onto your face. It makes your skin feel so extremely soft and healthy. And it lasts all day and has a nice subtle scent to it. I have received so many compliments since I’ve started using this cream. I highly recommend trying it out for yourself, you won’t be disappointed. Best Moisturizer and Anti-Aging Cream Ever
