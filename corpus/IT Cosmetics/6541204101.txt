Absolutely love this cream! It’s on the thicker side so it doesn’t soak in instantly and feel like it’s disappeared, it actually makes my skin feel like I’ve put a moisturizer on. My skin feels softer and looks brighter & tighter after using it. Normally i have a very extensive skin care routine but sometimes i just don’t have the time or energy to do it (thanks to a very energetic and rambunctious toddler) so i love that i can confidently use just this and know my skin is getting the moisturizing and good stuff it needs just from this one cream. I absolutely love this moisturizer! Highly recommend! nan
