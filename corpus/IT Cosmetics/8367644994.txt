This smells gorgeous! I love the smell of roses, so this feels like a treat to use at the end of the day. It quickly dissolves my makeup, without irritating my eyes. My skin is left soft, not greasy. After massaging thus into my skin and using a makeup erasing cloth, my skin feels clean without feeling like it had been tortured. I have used other great cleansing balm, but I prefer this. A little bit goes a long way, so this will last me a long while- worth the money. Fantastic Makeup Cleansing Balm
