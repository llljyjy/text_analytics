This moisturizer felt amazing and was very nourishing. I donâ€™t have any signs of aging yet, but at 33 this made my skin feel soft and supple and for someone who has oily skin, this cream made it feel so nice and balanced. It softened my rough dry patches and felt thick and rich, perfect for keeping my skin hydrated since it seems to suffer most in the summer time! I love all IT Cosmetics but Confidence in a Cream is one of the best. Amazing!
