This is a lightweight moisturizer that nourishes like a heavier cream.  I was surprised at the weightlessness of the product because I could quickly apply makeup without a waiting a long time for it the product to absorb.  Other products I have used feel oily and I cannot easily or quickly follow with foundation.  My skin is glowy and supple when I use it.  I would buy this product and recommend it to others interested in great and effective moisturizing  products. A must for hydrated and glowy skin!
