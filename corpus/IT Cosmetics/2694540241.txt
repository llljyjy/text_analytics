This cream is very rich and thick. Honestly, not a cream I would personally choose, especially in the summer. But, for being as rich as it is, in the container, it absorbs quickly, and doesn’t look greasy or feel heavy while wearing it. Fragrance is listed in the ingredient list, but it’s not heavily fragranced, either. If fragrance wasn’t listed in the ingredients, I would think it was unscented. Did I see any specific “transforming“ or “rejuvenation“? I did not. nan
