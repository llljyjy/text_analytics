I want to say Thank you to IT Cosmetics for sending me a full sized Confidence in a cream product through BzzAgent for my honest review. I have a drawer full of IT Cosmetics. So I can say I am loyal customer. But I have to say I did not notice any difference after trying the cream for 14 days. I liked the way the cream felt when I applied to my face. I didn’t notice much of a scent which was nice. So was the fact that only a little goes a long way! I did notice my face felt sticky after applying. Every night for the 14 days my husband would say to me, What is that on your face? It’s sticky. Like I just didn’t tell him the night before what I was using on my face. He never listens. I am going to continue to use Confidence in a Cream for a few more weeks to see if maybe it’s just taking me a bit longer for some results. I will update my review to let you know my progress with the product. Thank you so much for this opportunity IT Cosmetics and BzzAgent. My Experience with Confidence in a Cream
