I was so excited to get my jar of Confidence in a Cream, but did not get the results I expected. I began using the cream at night after washing my face with a mild cleanser. I used the Confidence in a Cream moisturizer in the mornings and the evenings for a little more than 2 weeks. However, after the second week, I noticed a dry itchy spot by the right side of my nose.I continued to use Confidence in a Cream, but had to discontinue. The cream has a luxurious fee and wonderful smell though and I would recommend it to a friend. I just would not use it for myself.again. Wanted to love it, but.....
