This is a fabulous cream! I especially love using it at night time since it has a thicker texture. I really like the scent but I can see how some would be turned off because it is fairly strong - but does also fade away shortly after being rubbed in. I noticed my skin was more supple and soft after using for just a couple weeks! Fantastic!
