So let’s talk about the packaging, the glass is super thick so even if it slips out of your hands it won’t break. The product is thick but goes on thin. Don’t know how they do that but they did it. A little goes a long way. It has a very light pleasant smell. I would definitely recommend. What would make this product better adding an SPF but other than it’s a great product Smooth and Mattifying
