Oh. My. GAWD! I was not expecting to like this product so much, but I am in LOVEEEEE. Naturally, I put on my most STUBBORN waterproof mascara (Better than Sex by Benefit). Now if you’re a real makeup fan, you know how hard it is to remove the BTS waterproof formula. I rubbed some on my lids and lashes and it MELTED AWAY!!!! Like completely gone. I used a warm rag and wiped it right away. I don’t think it’s made for eye makeup BUT NOBODY PUTS BABY IN A CORNER! This product is absolutely great and I definitely recommend. There is Vitamin C and Rose oil in the formula that has my skin feeling amazinggggggg. LIKE BUTTAH!
