Packaging : the packaging came in a glass container, feels very premium. Easy to open, with large opening for ease of application as well. Feel : feels really smooth and soothing on the skin Result on skin: I have realized that since using this cream for the better part of a month, my skin feels elastic, smooth, hydrated, and retaining it’s softness. I haven’t noticed a drastic change but the subtle changes are quite noticable Combination with other products: I have been using this with a facewash every morning and night, a serum ( vitC in the morning, retinol at night). Scent : the scent isn’t anything over the top to write home about. It’s not pleasant or unpleasant, just present, which I guess is preferred as it makes it versatile to use. I’ll continue to use this until it’s finished but there’s a likelihood I’ll be buying this again afterwards. Would highly recommend as it has exceeded my expectations. Definitely one of the best moisturizers I’ve had especially for black skin Astonishing
