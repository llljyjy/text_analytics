Typically I stick to gel moisturizers as creams end up being too heavy and greasy for my combination skin. So I was pleasantly surprised to find that this cream felt lightweight when absorbed and didn’t leave my skin looking greasy despite it having a thick consistency. It kept my face hydrated throughout the day. Although, I’m not a huge fan of the scent. It smells nice, but it’s a little overwhelming. I love it
