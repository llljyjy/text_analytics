I really like this product compared to other products I have tried. It leaves my skin hydrated and smooth pretty much all day and in the morning when I wake up. It applies to my face very well and is a beautiful easy to use creamy texture. I’m not sure if I would buy this again though because this is the only moisturizer I have ever used that has left what I guess is dark or pigmented coloring on mostly my cheeks. I did go to the beach after not going in awhile and I did not use sunscreen since I never do. I recommend using sunscreen with this product though and you might not have a problem. I just don’t own any since I have never needed it. I really hope this pigmentation goes away quickly. It has been there for several days. Also, I do not like that it has fragrance in it because of the chemicals of “fragrance“ and whatever ingredients they are hiding behind that term... The scent is very mild to me and pleasant otherwise. very nice
