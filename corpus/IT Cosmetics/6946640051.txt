If you wear a full coverage foundation and your skin starts feeling dry towards the end of the day, try using this moisturizer before primer. It is so hydrating and nourishing, and it really makes my foundations look amazing all day. I used to get dry patches from wearing too much makeup, but this cream fixed that problem! I haven’t had any dry patches since including this in my makeup routine. I can’t recommend it enough! Great for makeup prep
