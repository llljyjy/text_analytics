The cream is truly a classic. It makes my skin feel so smooth! It also keeps my skin hydrated and dewy. The one thing I wish would change is the smell. The fragrance is so strong for a face product. I definitely wish this was unscented. However, the results I receive from using this product, outweighs that. Still would recommend! A Classic
