I absolutely love this Cleansing Balm.It takes off makeup better than Oils. It’s very gentle on my skin. I was happy that it didn’t cause my eyes to go blurry when it got near them when taking eye makeup off. It doesn’t leave a sticky or greasy residue. Left my face feeling very clean,smooth and soft. I highly recommend this Cleansing Balm. Great Cleansing Balm
