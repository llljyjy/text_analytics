Iâ€™ve  tried several moisturizer creams in the past few years.  I really like the creamy texture of this one. It glides on well, and hydrates completely without leaving an oily feeling. This is important when applying makeup over moisturizer. This is a nice cream for sleep and a base for makeup. nan
