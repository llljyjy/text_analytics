A little of this cream goes a long way. A little bit packs quite the punch and leaves my face hydrated but not sticky. Its scent was extremely light and not overpowering, which was perfect for my allergies and sensitive skin. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a hydrating but gentle cream.
