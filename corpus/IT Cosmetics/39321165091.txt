I wasn’t completely thrilled with this. It was a nice cream in terms of moisture but I didn’t like the “cooling effect” it has. I had just finished washing my face and whatever ingredient it has that makes it feel like menthol, made my face start burning. It didn’t harm my skin but I didn’t like the feel. It also has a strong lavender(?) smell to it and it’s kind of overpowering. Nice cream but smell isn’t great
