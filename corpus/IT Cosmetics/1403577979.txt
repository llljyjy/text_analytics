I am extremely picky when it comes to the consistency of a cream, but this cream was exactly what I look for. I love the feel of lightweight creams. Being that I have mature skin, it did not cause me to have any flare-ups. I like how it gave me a nice smooth texture with no itchiness. I will be definitely keeping this cream in my skincare routine. Absolutely impressed!
