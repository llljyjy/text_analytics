Pretty impressed with this cream! Right out of the canister the smell is a bit strong for me but you must power on. It feels super nice on your skin while applying I almost felt this tingling sensation. I do have to mention that my face did turn a little red but not noticable. I have been using this for more than two weeks time and I do think my skin looks more radiant. Super happy I got to try it. pretty nice
