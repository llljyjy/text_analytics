I received IT COSMETICS Confidence in a Cream Hydrating Moisturizer free to try for my honest opinion. I haven’t finished my first container and already have ordered my next one! I absolutely love this cream!! I apply it to my face every morning and night. It has improved my dry skin so much! It is really hydrating without leaving my face feeling “oily”. It has a very silky texture which is nice. It also has a pleasant smell! I highly recommend and will continue to purchase. love love love
