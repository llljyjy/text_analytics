I am a faithful double cleanser gal. I always use a balm type cleanser before my micellar water just to make sure I get everything off since I tend to wear a full coverage foundation.I am currently using another brand, and while it is effective, it feels a bit heavy and doesn’t really have a scent. When I tried the IT Cosmetics 3-in-1, I thought it would probably be something similar. I pleasantly surprised! It felt so much lighter on, I was wondering if it was going to clean effectively. And it did! Just like the name says, it melts right off! And the scent is light and lovely. Even if some stays on the skin, it’s fine because it can also be used as a moisturizing mask, which I love. I really enjoy it when a product has multiple uses as I feel like you get such a bang for your buck.I really loved this cleansing balm and would absolutely purchase a new one when this runs out. If you are on the fence, put it in your cart! You will NOT be disappointed! Incredibly effective & lightweight balm cleanser
