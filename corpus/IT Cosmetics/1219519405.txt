The packaging is nice on the outside opalescent but no scooper. Once opened it has a strong chemical smell to me. I used the product for 1 week am/pm with only sunscreen and it dried my face around eyes, mouth and chin area. Everywhere else was good moisturizing. It seemed to dry quickly once applied and didn’t get shiny or tacky to the touch. I didn’t notice any difference in skins texture or anything else noticeable. Personally I would not purchase this product. *I received this product in exchange for my honest review from bzzagent* Not a must for me
