I’m 47 year old South Korean female living in Bay Area, CA.  The weather over here is mid 80 degree Fahrenheit these days.  I developed few liquid filled bumps on my forehead and cheek area after using this product for first two days.  I thought it was too rich for my skin during very warm weather.  So, I tried to mix this cream with my toner to dilute some and applied to my skin. No more bumps!! I think my guess was right.  It might be perfect during cold weather.  It glides smooth and absorbs pretty quickly on my skin.  It doesn’t have overpowering scent which is perfect for me. This cream is a pretty descent skincare product. IT Confidence in a Cream
