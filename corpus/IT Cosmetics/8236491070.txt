I got this to try from #BzzAgent. It was a nice large size and it had a creamy consistency. It went on with a nice light feeling but it made my face feel immediately hydrated and smoother, it definitely diminished my fine lines and a little bit goes a long way. It did not irritate my skin at all and I think this is a very good product, I will continue to use it. A good product that delivers
