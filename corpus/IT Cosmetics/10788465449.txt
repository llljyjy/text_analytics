I really enjoyed being able to test this IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Makeup: 3 in 1 Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm. I was quite skeptical when I first saw this product. It completely changed my mind quickly. It removed all my makeup with ease and it very good while applying. It even removed my makeup products that were waterproof. You can even use it on your eyes as long as you keep them shut of course. I also used this cleansing balm alone for the moisture benefits it provides. My skin felt smooth and has a glow after use. It definitely didnâ€™t strip my skin as some removers would. I would definitely recommend this product!! Moisture and Cleansing Balm
