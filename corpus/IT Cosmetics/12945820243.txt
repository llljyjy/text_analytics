I have a very it cosmetics heavy skincare routine! So when I got sent this to try I was SUPER excited! And I do like it. I always hear amazing things about it! But I feel like it would be wonderful on mature skin, or better suited for mature skin. It’s not heavy, it adds moisture and plumps the skin! It’s truly a beautiful product. Better for mature skin
