I dont know why anyone would like this. It is like pure silicone (dimithicone, a silicone is the third highest ingredient). It is very slippy, and does not absorb at all. It feels like I have a greasy veil over my skin and it does not feel healthy or nourished at all. I got a sample of this and would never buy it. I avoid silicones because they dont look good and I doulbt they would be good for the skin, as your skin is likely to absorb some of what you put on it. It makes my skin feel like its suffocating.
