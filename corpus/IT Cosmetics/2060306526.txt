I have extremely dry skin. I apply this moisturizer twice a day once after washing my face in the morning and once at nighttime. The moisturizer is thick in texture but its not greasy. It absorbs into the skin completely and my skin feel so soft and smooth. It has pleasant scent into it which is not overwhelming. The packaging is nice. The moisturizer comes inside a nice jar. This moisturizer became part of my daily skincare routine. I would definitely recommend it Great moisturizer
