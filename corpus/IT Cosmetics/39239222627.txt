was not disappointed with this cream, I did see a difference in the fine lines in particular areas. It was rich but not too heavy that I felt like a was wearing a heavy duty cream. I will say this is for a younger aging group. Mature skin may not see the same results as someone in their early thirties. Did I mention that I love that it is vegan and paraben free? For a younger age group of maturing skin
