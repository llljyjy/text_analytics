I really like the way it moisturizes my skin and my skin looks and feels more smooth however it did break my skin out at times during my review period.  I don’t normally break out so it was surprising.  I’m hoping my skin will get used to the moisturizer and I can continue to use it.  It is very lightweight and has a pleasant smell and I really like how it makes my skin feel I like the way this moisturizes my skin!
