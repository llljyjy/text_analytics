i know this brand for other products, and i used samples before that never disappointed, but this cream is truly special. i love the subtle citrus/floral scent, and the texture is just right. rich but absorbs in seconds and truly leaves my skin soft and hydrated all day, even after spending few hours at the beach. great, as expected
