The IT Confidence in a Cream is a great moisturizer.  The consistency is thick and luxurious.  It has a nice smell but the fragrance is not overwhelming.  If you are dry, you will really like this product.  I have oily skin so it is a little heavy but I prefer a lighter product because of that.  It worked well and did not cause me any issues. nan
