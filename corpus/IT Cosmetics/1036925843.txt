This is an awesome cream that i honestly believe is good for all skin types.  I have sensitive combo skin and i felt it moisturized nicely.  It is a pretty thick texture - almost hard, but goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly into skin.  So it moisturizes well for sensitive skin, but doesnâ€™t clog pores for oily skin.  I have been using it for a few weeks and definitely have noticed that my suntanned skin is less dry and looks luminous.  I would definitely recommend this cream. Moisturizer for all!
