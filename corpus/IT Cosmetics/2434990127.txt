This cleansing balm, makes it super easy to take off your makeup, all you have to do is massage it into skin. Even gets that stubborn waterproof makeup off too! I didn’t even mention that this is a 3 in 1 product. The second thing you can use this for is a facial cleanser and to do that you can add water and it turns into a cleanser. Lastly you can use this as a face mask, very hydrating, you can achieve this by spreading among clean face and leaving it on for 10 minutes.  This balm whichever way you use it, provides maximum hydration and doesn’t leave the skin feeling heavy or greasy. It has vitamin C, rose hip oil, sera use and Shea butter. Works great!
