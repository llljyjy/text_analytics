I received this fantastic cream as a free sample to review and even though it is pricier than I normally pay, I would pay it in a heartbeat.  It wicked away my eye makeup beautifully and left my skin feeling hydrated and dewy looking!  It smells nice and you don’t need much to get the job done!  It’s a must and worth every penny! You absolutely need this!
