My skin was in serious need of some help after a vacation filled with too much sun and overindulgence. I decided to scale back my skin care routine to help it recover. I would simply cleanse and apply this right after morning and night. The formula is super emmolient but actually sinks into the skin. I noticed such a difference in a few days. My skin felt and looked smoother and brighter. My skin is very oily so in the future I will only be using this at night, but those who donâ€™t have this issue could use this am and pm. Totally recommend! one and done!
