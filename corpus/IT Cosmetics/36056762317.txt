I received the IT Confidence in a Cream moisturizer as part of a sampling program and just love it.  The scent is not too overpowering and the cream instantly absorbed onto my skin.  I noticed the lines around my eyes and lips have slightly faded.  I love using it twice a day and a little goes a long way.  Highly recommend. Great for Mature Skin
