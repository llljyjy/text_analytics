I absolutely love this cleansing balm. I’ve never tried a balm like this before but I’m hooked!  It has a lovely light scent that I really enjoy. I like that the balm melts and removes all of my makeup with ease, mascara and waterproof eyeliner included! It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft. I highly recommend this! So good!
