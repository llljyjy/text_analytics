I received this product for free in exchange for a review. The product is lightweight and really hydrating, it absorbs pretty fast, but iâ€™m not sure if I see a difference in wrinkles yet. There is niacinamide, squalane, a peptide complex, hyaluronic acid, and ceramides, which suggests that this product should be fairly hydrating and brightening. This product is scented. Lightweight, Hydrating
