Confidence in a Cream is one of the most effective moisturizers I have ever experienced.  My skin is very prone to acne and redness after shaving.  Upon applying this cream, it mitigates the irritation and makes my skin very smooth and cool.  My skin stays smooth throughout the day and the addition of anti-aging ingredients makes this a superior product to use every day to keep your skin smooth and supple.  Since my skin is mostly dry, the Confidence Cream gives it the required moisture without leaving a greasy and sticky base on your skin.  It applies very well and highly recommend this cream to folks who have dry skin subject to constant irritation and redness.  You will see results that will make your skin soft and smooth.  I also like that the cream’s scent is very subtle and not over-bearing yet very pleasant.  The “Confidence in a Cream” is an outstanding product and I give it a 5-STAR Rating. CONFIDENCE IN A CREAM
