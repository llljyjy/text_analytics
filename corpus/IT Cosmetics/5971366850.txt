Since getting this moisturizer, I use my FAB Ultra Repair far less often. I love the dewy, ultra smooth skin it leaves me with and the bounce I have in the mornings. I use .05% Tretinoin 3x a week and combating the dryness can be hard as well as preventing sensitivity. This cream works wonders for protecting my moisture barrier and keeping my skin moisturized without being a greasy mess. It can be a little heavy on hot/humid days but it’s far from what I’m used to with other heavy creams and still feels fairly light for me. I can’t really speak to the brightening properties as my Tret does the heavy lifting there, but the other claims are definitely sound and I see the results even within a short period of use. If you need a good cream or battle dry/dehydrated skin, this is the one for you! Hardworking moisturizer - perfect pair for Tret!
