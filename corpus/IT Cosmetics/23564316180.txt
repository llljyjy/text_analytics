I didn’t love this moisturizer from it cosmetics. It felt very heavy and greasy on my skin and I didn’t see any difference in my fine lines or skin at all. I also hated the smell, it was very strong and did not fade even after washing my face. This was not the facial moisturizer for me. Not great imo
