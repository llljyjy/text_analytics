This is the holy grail of skin cleansing balms.  love the pink packaging, tub design and soft subtle rose sent of this balm. It has an amazing texture, soft that makes it easy to apply to your face. I was able to use it to take off my eye makeup with no burning. This balm can remove any makeup product from my face, even waterproof mascara, in just seconds. It rinses cleanly, leaving behind no greasy or oily residue, just soft, clean, hydrated skin. Say Bye Bye to Stubborn Waterproof Mascara
