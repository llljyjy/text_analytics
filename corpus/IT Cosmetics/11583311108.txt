It does the job, however it is very scented ... Scent reminds me of hairspray so if you can imagine a organic smelling hairspray that is what it would smell like and it lingers throughout the day but does disappear .. but the hydrating properties are really well and I also did break out a little but I can’t tell if it was from some other factor so I’ll have to keep testing it however if you can get past the smell I do recommend it for what it’s supposed to do as it has a lot of hydrating ingredients in 1 ..
