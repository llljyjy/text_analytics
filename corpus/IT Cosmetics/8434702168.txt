If you have sensitive skin, this is the best night cream! I loved the old formula, and I love this new one even more. It has colloidal oatmeal in it, and has helped me sooo much with irritation from a retinol that I was using. Supposedly, this new formula is more portent, and I do feel an ever so slight tingle when I first apply this, which I never felt with the old one. This gave me glowing, hydrated, smooth skin every time I used it. A winner for sensitive skin!
