Details: This #1, cult classic anti-aging cream from It cosmetics is now supercharged! This cream is formulated to be clean, vegan, paraben & mineral-oil free, is suitable for all skin types including sensitive skin. The original was designed to solve 7 signs of aging but this formulation addresses 10 signs of aging: tone, texture, radiance, elasticity, neck lines, firmness, plumpness, fine lines, pores, & wrinkles. Contains more potent, active ingredients than the original formulation with even more hydration (up to 48 hrs).My experience: For reference, I have oily, acne prone skin with some sensitivity & redness. This is a medium thick, beige colored cream with a mild lemon scent. This looks thick but absorbs well & leaves skin velvety smooth without being too thick or heavy. No greasy or sticky residue. Makes my skin plumped, moisturized, & prepped for makeup application. I didn’t notice that this clogged my pores either. Wrinkle reduction & more even skin tone results reported after 4 weeks of use but I’ve only been using for 2 so I’ll share an update later on but so far I’m a fan of this moisturizing super cream.Overall: After 2 weeks of use, I’m happy with my preliminary results. My oily, acne prone skin likes this moisturizer. It isn’t heavy, oily, or sticky. Leaves my skin smooth, plumped & moisturized without clogged pores. Can’t wait to share an update after long-term usage. Retails $52 for 2 fl oz. Plumping, hydrating, non-greasy moisturizer
