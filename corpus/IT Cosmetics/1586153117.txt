This Confidence in a cream has a great consistency, it’s thick but not tacky and sinks right into the skin. Made my skin look smooth & plump which hello who doesn’t love that, I don’t have the worst pore issues but I do think it helped with my minimal pore problem, I would like to see what it can do if you really need help with reducing the look of your pores. It does help with reducing the look of fine lines in my opinion as I said my face looked smooth and plump. I have very dry skin and it felt super hydrated all day which is saying a lot, it does have a bit of a scent but nothing crazy and it doesn’t last. I’m definitely going to continue using it and see what happens in the long run. Smooth & Plump
