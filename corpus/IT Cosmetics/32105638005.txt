This solid Bye Bye Makeup Remover felt so good on my skin. It melted at the touch and I really wanted to love it, but I didnâ€™t. The reason is because while it removed most of my makeup, there was a good portion that I did twice, and still had to use my normal makeup remover. It may be the type of makeup I wear, but I doubt it. It all comes off with my other product. It smells good and does feel great, but I need a good makeup remover. Felt great, smelled great, cleaned so-so.
