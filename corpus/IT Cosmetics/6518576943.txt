I’ve used this Confidence in a Cream moisturizer for about 2 weeks now and I have to say I’m actually seeing good results. I apply in morning after splashing cold water in my face as well as every night after deep cleansing my face. It is a cream colored, medium thickness cream. It spreads well. I use my knuckle to dip into the dar for a small amount then dot the different areas of my face with the moisturizer and then rub in to my skin. I also use on my neck, front and back. The excess I rub into my hands. My skin looks brighter, feels smoother, softer and tighter. I really love how my skin feels. It has a nice almost medicinal smell but it is not overpowering or annoying. My skin soaks it up real quick. On the hotter days I wash my face earlier in the evening and apply then some days I have applied again before bed. I will definitely keep using and buying because I love how it works. I did get to try this for free but the opinions here are based on my own experiences. Love the results! Love how it feels
