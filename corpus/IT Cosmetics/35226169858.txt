I felt like this cream moisturized my dry skin without making it feel greasy. It was lightweight and wasnâ€™t a heavy cream which is great. Left my skin feeling soft as can be. It is a little pricey, but alittle goes a long way.Received this free from BzzAgent in exchange for my honest review Lightweight and makes my skin feel so soft
