I felt a difference in firmness within minutes of using this cream.  Also, it provided good hydration and luminosity.  And there was an improvement in skin texture as well.  Although the scent was okay, it could have been more pleasant.  Overall, I think it is a good treatment. Improvement in Firmness and Hydration
