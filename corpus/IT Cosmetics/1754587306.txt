#sponsored #complimentary @bzzagent @itcosmetics #confidenceincream #moisturizer I received Confidence in Cream for free in exchange for my honest opinion and review from @bzzagent and @itcosmetics IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream Hydrating MoisturizerOk let’s start of by saying Amazing Moisturizer.Very hydrating, love the texture. I have combination skin very dry in some places then oily and sensitive in other areas. I was worried that the cream would be to heavy, but no. It’s perfect even for this very hot humid summer. My skin feels very comfortable when wearing it and has helped so much. I am going to continue to use this moisturizer every morning (whether I wear makeup or not) since it has collagen and hyaluronic acid in it which is know to  plump fine lines and wrinkles. It also has niacin, peptides, a super ceramide complex, and other active ingredients to help smooth texture, intensely hydrate, and enhance firmness. I wanted a moisturizer that would be great to wear under makeup and this one does just that. It absorbs quickly into my skin and leaves it feeling hydrated and soft. My makeup goes on effortlessly and looks great over the top. The only thing missing from this moisturizer is SPF, but from other moisturizers that I’ve used, it would just make this thicker and not quick drying unless it was thinned out.Overall, absolutely a great moisturizer and I’ve definitely seen a difference in my skin so far after suffering thru two times with poison ivy this summer. It’s soft, hydrated, and keeps my makeup looking great all day long when I got to wear it! Amazing Moisturizer!!
