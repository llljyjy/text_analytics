After using this for about a month I can confidently say ( pun intended) this cream is amazing. I added this to my regimen before bed and in the morning after washing my face. In a month’s time it feels lime my skin is firmer and much more hydrated. I’m very happy with the results and would consider adding this to my routine. The cream feels good going on and it settles in to the skin nicely without leaving a thick residue.  Great cream all around ! Game changer !
