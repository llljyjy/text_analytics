Let me say first, that I love the IT Cosmetics brand! I have tried a few products but never anything specific for skin care. I do love that their products have skin care built into them. The Confidence in a Cream is fabulous. The cream feels creamy and luxurious. It goes on smooth and blends easily. I could see a difference in my skin after about a week of using it twice a day! I will be purchasing more! I can hardly wait to see what happens after continuous use! Luxury in a Jar
