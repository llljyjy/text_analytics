I really like the way this cream feels, when I’m applying it. The cream is thick and luxurious. It just absorbs into my skin, beautifully. It goes well under makeup and keeps my skin hydrated, throughout the day. This cream has tons of benefits! It’s vegan, paraben free, dye free and just good for your skin. I can see a difference in my skin. It’s softer, smoother and my fine lines are less noticeable. A Good Cream With Great Benefits!
