I have never used a cleansing balm before so I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect. Upon opening the jar, the rose scent was just a little too overwhelming for me. I did like it, however, could be toned down some. I did like that it was firm and not soft. It melted my waterproof mascara right off without having to scrub and left my face with a nice glow and very hydrated. Also a plus that it is Vegan, non-comedogenic, and more sustainable. I would recommend this and purchase again. Hydrating
