I’m in my mid 40s and have tried so many different facial products. Confidence in a Cream is by far the best facial cream I have ever used! I received the cream as part of a product testing opportunity and have been using it everyday for two weeks. My skin looks refreshed, younger, HAPPY! Y’all just got yourselves a new customer for life! Absolutely fabulous product!!!
