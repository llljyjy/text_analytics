This face cream is amazing and it really works too! I noticed a huge diffrence in the appearance in my face and neck in just days of using this. My fine lines and wrinkles vanished away and also this cream transformed my face to look so plump, soft, and firm. Confidence in a Cream Anti-Aging Armour evened out the rough texture of my skin, so yes this did rejuvinate my face and neck. The texture of this cream is thick, and goes a long way, it also absorbs very well into my skin without leaving a tacky feeling like some other creams that Iâ€™ve used in the past. I highly recommend it Confidence in a Cream if you want to see transforming results in your face and neck! Amazing Anti-Aging Cream!
