Great! Lightweight coverage and helps control the shine on my oily t-zone. I also have sensitive skin and this product doesn’t cause breakouts for me. My ONLY complaint is that it does have a slight white tint because of the SPF coverage, so I wouldn’t recommend it for photos or fancy occasions. But for everyday wear & protection, it’s great! nan
