I have tried this product for 2 weeks and truly haven’t noticed a difference.  After applying to my face, it feels sticky to the touch and it has an odor that I can’t get past that I smell for 1-2  hours after application.  I have other creams that do the same thing without the odor or sticky feeling that I prefer over this one. nan
