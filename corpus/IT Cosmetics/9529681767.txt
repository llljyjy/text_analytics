I really like this product and it’s ingredients (except the fragrances). It has amazing anti-aging ingredients which is perfect for wrinkles and fine lines prevention. On application, the cream is VERY rich so you only need very little! So it goes a long way and it glides on my skin very nicely. I notice reviews saying they felt oily after applying but really, you only need very little to not feel oily. I do not have much wrinkles and my fine lines are minimal so I don’t see a huge difference in them but I do feel like my skin is more moisturized and it seems like a great product to prevent those lines and wrinkles. I’m docking on star off because it has fragrances and this one lingers for a bit. Would not be good for people with sensitive skin or sensitive to scents. I wouldn’t say the smell is unpleasant. I would continue to use this product. nan
