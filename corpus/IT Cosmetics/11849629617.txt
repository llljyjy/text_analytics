I thought I was going to love this product based on its reviews, but I have multiple issues with it. First of all (and this could possibly be my application, which would have been better if this product had a pump and wasn’t just in a jar!) but it was very thick and unnatural looking and didn’t even cover up all of my redness. I’ve had better results covering up my redness with regular foundations and even the glossier skin tint. Second, it made my imperfections even more pronounced. Hello, ginormous pores! Third, the container itself is very small and it’s literally just a jar. It should at the very least have a pump for easier and cleaner application, because the way it is right now makes it messy and annoying. Lastly, I bought this product because it was uniquely advertised as a natural not-foundation that’s  even somewhat of a skincare product with its benefits for redness. However, this product turned out to be a cakey unnatural foundation that does not really cover up redness. Many people still seem to like it which boggles my mind. I will be returning this and sticking to my regular foundation which addresses my concerns much better. nan
