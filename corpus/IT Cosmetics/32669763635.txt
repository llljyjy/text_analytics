Pure hydration in a jar! I have tried many creams, moisturizers, serums and exfoliating cleaners trying to get of the dry flaky skin on my face. None of them have worked until now. After the first application, I could tell a big difference in how hydrated my face felt. After two weeks, I have no more dry, flaky forehead or cheeks! I can now put my makeup on with confidence in knowing someone is staring at my dry skin on my face. My foundation goes on smoother and my face glows. I will definitely be keeping up with using the IT confidence in a Jar cream! I have told my sister and daughter, who also suffer with dry skin, to use this cream! It doesnâ€™t leave a heavy oily residue, like others or wear off after an hour or two. It has been life changing in the way I feel knowing that my skin will be hydrated all day and not worrying about dry and flaky skin anymore. Definitely Confidence in a jar!
