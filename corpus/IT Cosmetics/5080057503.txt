Over the past year I have noticed a difference in my skin, age-wise. I have purchased several different anti-aging creams in that time and so far, this cream has out-performed others. It goes in thick and creamy but blends in smoothly. I feel that my skins texture is better and I have less fine lines. I am very happy with this cream! Great cream for me!
