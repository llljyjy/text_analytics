I got to try this wonderful product, and it’s exactly what I’ve been looking for. IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Makeup: 3-in-1 Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm removed my waterproof makeup without me having to scrub my face raw. I work out and time to get emotional so I cry a lot, so I have to wear a lot of waterproof makeup. I didn’t like the feel of the ones that you have to really rub in and scrape off, and this one you don’t do that. I cannot wait to get my mom to try it because I’m sure she will love it too especially with both of us doing zumba. plus it leaves our skin feeling so like clean and soft.
