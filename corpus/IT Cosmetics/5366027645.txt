Iâ€™ve been using this product for a few weeks now and am pleasantly surprised! It has a light citrus smell and it is a great consistency - creamy and not too heavy. A little goes a long way with this product. It absorbs nicely into the skin and leaves a totally hydrated feeling all day. I will continue using this product and would definitely recommend it to friends. nan
