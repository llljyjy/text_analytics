It Confidence in A Cream anti-aging armour seems like a good facial cream that others should consider when looking for a new moisturizer. It has a nice light scent that is not overpowering. Once I have used it a few more weeks I’m hoping to notice more firmness and tone that I didn’t seem to achieve with the product I was using prior. So far I am really liking how well it absorbs into you skin and does not leave a sticky residue. I would recommend to others to try. Truly confident this will work for me
