After using IT secret sauce exclusively for a few weeks I find that is a product that I may need to keep on my rotation. The best thing about this product that is so smooth and creamy, went on on like butter and hydrated my skin. And unlike many other moisturizers it did not irritate my skin when applying. That is a huge factor for me. I have purchased several expensive moisturizers and had to return because of the excessive tingling after use. My overall skin texture feels more supple and I find that my foundation goes on and blend better with IT secret sauce. I would say this product is geared towards mature skin so if you over a certain age and seeking a good anti-aging regime this will a great product to have.I would definitely recommend as well as purchasing the product. Thanks to my BzzAgent survey panel for allowing me to test this product for free. Itâ€™s definitely a product that I will continue to use. The perfect moisturizer for mature skin
