I was really excited to try Confidence in a Cream Super Charged but sadly it didn’t work well with my skin for some reason. I have combination skin, oily t-zone with normal cheek area. I incorporated the cream in with my normal skin care routine and the product would start to roll. So I tried the product by itself and the same thing happened even I applied it in a thin layer & definitely didn’t work under makeup. It has a light citrus type scent that does linger nothing overpowering, I think this cream may work well for those with dry skin. Not for me
