This product worked great and cleaning my skin. I loved the smell and the texture. I took a star away from the rating because it left my skin feeling very dry. I thought, because of the oily feel, that it would leave my skin dewy and moisturized but it left it extremely dry. I had to apply moisturizer twice. I would still recommend this to people but with a disclaimer. Smells and feels great
