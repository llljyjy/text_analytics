I am 52 years old and have used my share of skin creams that claim to this or that and I have never been wowed but a skin cream.  Until I started using the it  Confidence in a Cream, Supercharged.  In just over 3 weeks I have seen my skin become more supple and my fine lines fading.  I have to say I love it! I apply both morning and night.  The cream has a light refreshing scent, not over powering at all, it absorbs quickly in to my skin and does not make my face feel oily at all, even under makeup.  I have never received  compliments on skin until I started using it Confidence in a Cream.  I will definitely be purchasing this product!  I received this product as a free sample box This Product is Fantastic!
