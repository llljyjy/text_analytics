I use a prescription tret, my skin can get quite dry and sensitive during the times it gets over exfoliated, this cream really helped my skin during the time it was peeling, and helped keep my skin soft to prevent getting to that stage. Really a lovely cream. It feels like a soft cushion on my skin. - rich soothing and healing deeply moisturizing perfect if you use tretinoin
