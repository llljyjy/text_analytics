Extremely moisturizing my dry skin is so happy with this! It’s fragranced i just didn’t like the smell of this at all. I love the texture and how it melts to my skin streaks free! As for the anti-aging part I didn’t see a difference to be honest but I’ll continue using my jar and see about that, but overall my skin is healthy, glowy, bouncy and fresh! My skin feels smooth and soft, texture free and so hydrated no dry flakes at all. Makeup looks flawless on top of this so moisturizing and smooth
