The texture of this cream looks thick but it massages on to my face very light weight.  When I massage it onto my face I can feel a hint of a tingle which makes me feel like the ingredients are activating and working. I start noticing results after using this for a week in the morning and at night I noticed that my fine lines were not as prominent and I was experiencing slight breakouts when I began to use it, I have acne prone skin and was hesitant that the cream may make me break out but it actually worked very well for my acne and help to heal  some breakouts that I was experiencing.
