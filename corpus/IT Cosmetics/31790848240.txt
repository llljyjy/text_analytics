I got a sample size with my last order. When I first used it I assumed it would make me break our or my face would be so oily at the end of the day because I have combo/oily skin to begin with. Much to my surprise my skin looked and felt fantastic all day. No acne and no extra oily. Pretty expensive for what I’m used to but I now have to have this! Can’t wait to see the results on my fine lines with continued use. nan
