Felt nice going on, but immediately noticed dry patches around my eyes after using it the first time.  Makeup did not seem to go on well over this.  When first putting it in I the AM, noticed it kinda burned.  Went away after a few min. Did not leave me red or anything.  Maybe if I use it longer? nan
