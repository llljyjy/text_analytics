I’ve used the original confidence in a cream and I like the anti-aging a lot more. This confidence in a cream is a little heavier and works better for my dry skin. I’ve been using this cream at night and I wake up with plump, nourished skin. Definitely recommend this one for drier, skin that needs hydration! Great for night time
