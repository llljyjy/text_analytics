Where do I start?! I’ve been using this cream for 2 weeks, and I’m blown away by the results so far, my skin looks supple and hydrated, I’m staring to see some fine lines fade, pores getting smaller, none of my other creams have done this for my skin in such a short period of time, I love the multi-benefits this cream offers and I love the fact I can use it day AND night!! I can’t wait to see how my skin gets better and better and I continue using it. I love how rich and thick it is and it doesn’t have a strong scent, it smells fresh and it glides onto my skin. This is it girls! This is the only cream you would ever need, I’m telling everyone I know about it, I’m super happy with the results! Thank you It Cosmetics!! Wow!! Life Changing Cream!
