enjoyed using this cream. I have very dry skin. After using this , my skin felt moisturized all day. A little goes a long way so I think the container would last a long time. The formula is a little heavy to use in Florida in the summer. I would definitely buy and use this daily in the cooler months IT Confidence in a Cream
