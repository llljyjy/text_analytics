Confidence In A Cream is not my favorite face product. I began using it when I received it as a promotion, and I am going to continue to use it. I am targeting the lines around my eyes, and I have noticed a significant difference in the past few weeks Iâ€™ve been using this product. I highly recommend it to friends, family, and you. My eye lines are disappearing!
