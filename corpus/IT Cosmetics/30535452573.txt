I received this product free In Exchange for my honest opinion. This Isn’t the best cleansing Balm. It removes Facial Makeup but not eye makeup, Glue or waterproof Makeup. It’s scented, VERY strong Of rose, so If you are sensitive to that I would pass. It also Leaves that film In your eye. It’s def a pass for me Hard pass
