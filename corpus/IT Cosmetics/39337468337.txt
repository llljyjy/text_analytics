I am so impressed with this product! It has a nice soft scent that isn’t overbearing. Applying the Confidence in a Cream was so easy, A little goes a long way! It didn’t have any type of oily feeling ànd it wasn’t heavy feeling. It left my face and neck feeling so soft and smooth. I’ve noticed some of my wrinkles diminishing. I’ve definitely found my new go to cream!! I definitely would recommend this product to anyone. nan
