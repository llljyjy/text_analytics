Absolute game changer. I’m 37. Extremely oily skin. Large pores. Redness. Rosacea. And I’m at the perfect age where I’m starting to get wrinkles but still have full blown adult acne on my jaw line and neck. Awesome! I cannot live without this stuff. It has been the ONLY thing to clear my acne. Really. If I stop using it I break out. I’ve been buying the small ones but splurged for the Sephora sale on the large one. Why is this not hyped more? My face looks, plump, firm, radiant, clear, bright, smooth, glowy, less oil production, less pores, hydrated, youthful…just… exactly what I want. It’s thick but more of a gel/cream hybrid perfect all year. Don’t sleep on this one ladies! Especially mature women with signs of aging or ones with adult acne! It’s a miracle cream. And it takes a LOT to impress me! I’m sensitive to smells and this has a SUPER light scent but just so nice - maybe slight citrus? Delicious. Don’t sleep on this one!!! Try the small version if you’re hesitant. Miracle cream!
