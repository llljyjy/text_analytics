I had tried the original IT Confidence in a Cream, and I was really excited to be able to try this anti-aging version. I loved the original version, but this one is even better. First, a little of this cream goes a long way and therefore, the jar holds a lot product. While I received this product for free for testing purposes, I truly believe that you get your money’s worth from this product. It feels so good going on the skin and it sinks into the skin quickly. It doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy like some other moisturizes do. Over time, I noticed my skin looked healthier and more hydrated. I would highly recommend checking out this moisturizer or the original IT Confidence in a Cream. Favorite Moisturizer
