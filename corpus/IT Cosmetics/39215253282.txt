I rate this product a 4 because it is not the “perfect” cream, but it is a really nice cream! I would definitely use this in the evenings. I like to slather it on after my serums and when I wake up my skin is plump and smooth. I like that it has niacinamide which is good for soothing redness and fine lines. And the squalene which holds in moisture. I wouldn’t really recommend this cream in the morning unless you are going barefaced with just some sunscreen. Or if you live in a hot and humid area as this cream is very thick (I think it has shea butter). It doesn’t work very well under makeup. That being said, a totally legit moisturizer that I would buy again if I didn’t already have other favorite products. Pretty Good but not the greatest
