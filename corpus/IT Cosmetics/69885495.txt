I was surprised when I opened the jar how the product looked. A smooth, solid, waxy look to it. I was surprised how my fingers melted into it as I scooped up a small amount and applied it to my face. Greasy/oily yet almost warm and soothing as I swirled it all over. I used a white muslin cloth I had to wipe the balm and my make-up off of my face and it worked quite well! I LOVE how my skin feels after I use it. So subtle, soft, and moisturized. It feels good to go to bed with my face feeling that way. I really like this product! I received this product as a free sample. nan
