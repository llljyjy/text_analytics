This is probably the thickest cream I’ve ever used on my face! It’s super nourishing. I’ve never used anything like it before. I think it’s beneficial to have something super nourishing for your skin especially in dry times of the year like winter. It did cause my forehead to break out a bit. Maybe the formula is a bit too hydrating for me to use everyday so I will probably reduce my use to every other day or few days. I would buy this product again and recommend it to friends. very nourishing
