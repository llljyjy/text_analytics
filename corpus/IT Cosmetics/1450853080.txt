Absolutely LOVE this moisturizer--so glad I gave it a try! Feels luxurious, no scent, thick and creamy so a little bit goes a long way. My skin feels plumper, smoother, and fine lines & pores are visibly smaller. Now I need to try the nighttime cream! Especially in winter, this will be my go-to daily moisturizer. Highly recommend! Wonderful!
