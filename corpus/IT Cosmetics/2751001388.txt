I’ve been using this cream for a couple weeks now. While I don’t see any age defying effects, I really didn’t expect to. I highly doubt there’s ANY cream that can truly fight aging, so I never expect that. I liked how light this cream was. It goes on easily and evenly and has a light but pleasant scent. I do find it a tiny bit sticky feeling when first applied but once it dries the stickiness is gone. It keeps my skin moisturizer all day, which is a great bonus. I don’t need to reapply throughout the day. Great face cream!
