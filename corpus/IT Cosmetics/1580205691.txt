I have been using It Cosmetics for a few years now and have grown to absolutely love them. When a Sephora employee first recommended them I was hesitant at first. Mainly because I didnâ€™t waste to admit my skin was ready for a line that is targeted at okay women. I am so glad I gave it a try. My skin looks and feels younger than it is and has a glow. This new Confidence in a Cream is just perfect. Still thick and full of moisturizing benefits, but also gentle on my aging skin. The smell is a bit strong at first but it fades fast. I highly recommend this cream to those who already have aging skin and those who want to protect young skin. Better than the original!
