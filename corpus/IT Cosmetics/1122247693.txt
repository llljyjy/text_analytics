This is the first time I have used It Confidence in a Cream for an extended amount of time.  I have received samples previously.  First of all the texture is thick, which with my aging skin is ok.  It doesn’t bother me.  I choose to wear it at night so it will soak in with no makeup on top.  My skin feels great the best day, smooth and supple.  My only con is the scent.  It’s a little too strong for my taste. nan
