I have been a fan of IT Cosmetics for a number of years but had never tried their skincare, in particular, the Confidence in a Cream Moisturizer. At first it seemed a little heavy and I wasn’t sure it was for me but I have it a few days and I’m thrilled that I did. After a couple of days, I noticed that my skin seemed to start just drinking in this cream. My skin looks fresh and dewy and it feels so soft, like it did 20 years ago!! My foundation glides on easily over it and glows all day without looking and feeling greasy. A win and a new staple in my a.m. and p.m. routine!! Time machine in a jar!!
