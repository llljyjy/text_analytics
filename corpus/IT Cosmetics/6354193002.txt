IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream Hydrating Moisturizer has IT going on! This ultra-hydrating moisturizer is suitable for all skin types and reverses 10 visible signs of aging after just two weeks. The big ones I noticed were plumper skin which reduced the appearance of my fine lines and pores. That’s probably due to its ingredients which include: ceramides, niacinamide, Hyaluronic acid, peptide-lipid complex, and squalane. It applies so smooth and is quick absorbing, which says a lot given my oily/combination skin. My only complaint is that it is very sticky to the touch afterward. Which should be no problem since touching your face is a no-no right? Well, not so much when you’re layering skincare products.. sunscreen, I’m looking at you. With that being said, I think this is an exceptional moisturizer, particularly at night since it’s a bit on the heavy side. I’m eager to continue using it, as you get more dramatic results over time! I recommend you give this product a try for yourself. nan
