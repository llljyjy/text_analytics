This makeup removing balm smells great and melts in my hands. It also melts away makeup so well. I’ve tried it with BB cream, foundation, brow and eye liners and everything comes off cleanly and fully. It feels gentle and moisturizing and also wipes away cleanly with water. My skin is left feeling soft and clean. As an ultra hydrating mask, it helps brighten and soften my skin, which is dry despite the occasional breakout. I haven’t used it as a cleanser alone, though it seems to be doing everything else right! Brighten, soften and remove makeup all at once!
