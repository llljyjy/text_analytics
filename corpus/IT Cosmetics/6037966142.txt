I’ve been using this moisturizer for about 2 weeks and I can definitely tell some subtle improvement in skin texture. My face feels “bouncy” after using this, and I like that. I have to be cautious when it comes to moisturizers because if they are too emollient or greasy I can get whiteheads. So far, this formula hasn’t done that, thankfully. I use it in the evening after my serum, and I do see it’s making a difference for the better. I appreciate that this brand gives you almost double the product that the other brands do, for a similar price. Now, for the not so good. The reason I took off a star. The packaging. It’s the old-fashioned tub packaging that exposes the product every time you open it. I feel this makes the product less potent over time & can raise issues with spreading bacteria. I would buy this product again, and yes, I would recommend it to a friend. I  received this product in exchange for my honest review. Love the Formula…but Not the Packaging
