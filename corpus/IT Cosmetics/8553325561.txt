I didn’t try the previous version of this but just comparing the ingredients, I’m far more impressed with the improved version. It has great ingredients including everyone’s favorite niacinamide. It’s a beautifully thick texture that sinks into the skin and leaves a semi sticky finish which I found was perfect underneath makeup. I’m actually impressed. improved!!
