I’m a big fan of IT Cosmetics products, so I was excited to try this cream. The packaging is simple yet nice. The texture of the cream is almost like a mousse. It goes on really smoothly and feels hydrating. I found it to be a bit too heavy to use under my foundation (which is also IT Cosmetics), but I love it as a night cream. My face and neck still feel hydrated the next morning. I typically don’t like scented products because I’m prone to headaches, but this lavendar scent was actually really nice, and it felt spa-like at bedtime. I’ve only been using it a couple weeks, so I can’t report any anti-aging results yet. I’m 55 and have some fine lines and sun spots, and I’m hopeful this will deliver some improvements over time. Feels and smells great
