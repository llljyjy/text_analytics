I recently received the it cosmetics Confidence in a Cream from bzz agent to try and review and I have to say I really love the formula! I was a bit skeptical at first,  because at first glance the cream looked very thick and I wondered if it would simply be too heavy for summer and the heat. To my surprise though it wasn’t heavy on the skin at all, actually quite lightweight and didn’t make my skin feel smothered or hot. It absorbs fairly quickly and moisturizes very well. I like to use it before applying my makeup.  It isn’t greasy or oily at all, but instead is a very soft , lightweight cream that keeps my face moisturized the perfect amount,  as well as soft and supple looking.  I did use this around the eye area as well and I did not have any irritation or anything like that.  I absolutely would recommend trying this product! love this
