There’s some people that love having an extensive skincare regimen with a product for every need and concern, and then there’s others who like to keep it simple - and SIMPLE is my middle name (next to “aging“ le sigh).  Less is more IMO which is why I love skincare products that offer multiple benefits, such as this one.  The product “promises“ to deliver a reduction on  the look of fine lines, visibly minimized pores, and brightening the look of skin.  I can say that after using it for a couple weeks, I have noticed a difference and now that I’m quickly approaching the 45+ category, it is even more important for me to find a product with visible results.  It’s think, lightly scented and absorbs perfectly, leaving me with soft, moisturized skin.  I usually brush my teeth while the cream works it’s magic, then I move on with the next step without skipping a beat. I'd love to buy this in a barrel to slather myself
