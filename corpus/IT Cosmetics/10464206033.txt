I have noticed that this is very emollient and that my dry skin will peel and roll off if I rub or scratch where it’s been applied. This cream is a very thick and lightly scented cream. The sent isn’t off putting or too intense. I haven’t noticed any anti-aging properties or benefits on my face, though I do have fine lines and some slight wrinkles around the eyes. I think that this would be better used as a heavy Moisturizer in the winter despite the fact that I do have very dry skin, I have other more structures that I prefer more but I would purchase this in the winter. I also have rosacea as you can see in the picture below and it didn’t make it flare up or worsen it in any way. Moisturizing yes, anti-aging, meh
