Confidence in a cream is the perfect cream for anyone who needs moisture with all the perks.  My skin is noticeably more supple and plump.  It’s very emollient and a little goes a long way. Less is more for me in the summer.  I’m looking forward to using this in the winter when my skin is super dry.  Right now I concentrate on my cheeks and forehead.  I’ve noticed less fine lines and brighter looking renewed skin, without the breakouts most creams cause me.  I use in the morning before sunscreen and at night before bed.  I have maybe 5 minutes a day for skincare with my little ones so it’s nice to have a cream that does it all for me.  There is a faint pleasant when applying but doesn’t linger all day. My skin thanks me for using this cream!
