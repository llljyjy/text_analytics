This is the new and improved version of this cleansing balm. I have tried their original product and liked it, but I do like this one better. The packaging is really sleek and cute. And the formula is so nice. The 3-in-1 means it can be used as a makeup remover balm, a brightening facial cleanser or a hydrating face mask.I also love this because it contains amazing ingredients like Vitamin C, Rosehip Oil, Ceramide and Shea Butter.I mainly use this as my first step in my cleansing routine. It removes my makeup really well, and it doesn’t sting my eyes. That’s really important to me since I wear contacts and have sensitive eyes. Gentle and Effective Makeup Remover
