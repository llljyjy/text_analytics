Absolutely my new favorite for getting my skin clean and clear of makeup. Over the last week I’ve used IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Makeup: 3-in-1 Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm each night. I love that it is a balm, which means that it won’t drip or spill, and it stays where I put it. I like to put it on before I get into the shower. Because it is a bit slick it requires a little more rubbing and rinsing in comparison to other cleansers, but my skin feels hydrated and not dry after using. Makeup and daily gunk removes easily. nan
