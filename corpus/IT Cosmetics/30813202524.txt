I loved this moisturizing cream. It’s thick and creamy and goes on smooth into your skin. I thought it would make me sweat because of the thickness but it didn’t at all. My skin feels softer and smoother. It has a nice light scent, not over powering at all. I love using this and had no breakouts on my skin which could be sensitive. I definitely will continue using this. Definite Confidence
