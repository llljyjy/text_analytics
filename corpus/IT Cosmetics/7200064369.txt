I had a few bad dark spots on my cheeks and chin, after 2 weeks using it on and off it the spots are gone! my mom is still trying it for her face as she has dark spots from her nose go down her cheeks to her chin(docs say itâ€™s hormones) and slight progress for her not much. she is still using it as her skin is tougher. but I love it ! Worth the try!
