I was using the original It Cosmetics Confidence and I was able to try this new improved version.  in cream for last few years. I love it. It does have beautiful consistency and applies so very easy without any greasy feeling. Skin is very smooth and feels hydrated. Only negative is no SPF. Great moisturizer
