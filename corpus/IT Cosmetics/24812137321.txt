I really love Confidence in a Cream Anti-Aging Armour Rejuvenating Concentrate! It has a luxurious texture that goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly into the skin on my face and neck. I immediately noticed how it smoothed out fine lines around my eyes and mouth and my skin is looking better than in has in a very long time. Leaves my face fresh & glowing and hydrated all day long. I wear it alone or as a perfect under my foundation. I love IT Cosmetics and this outstanding moisturizer. Definitely will continue to use and keep as a part of my daily skincare regimen. My 50-Something skin thanks you & so do I! Luxuriously Perfect!
