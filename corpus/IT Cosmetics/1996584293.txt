This is a great moisturizer! I use it everyday and it’s a great base for my makeup. The formula isn’t sticky and doesn’t make me oily. It’s very hydrating and it sinks into my skin. I love the packaging because the tube makes me get the amount I want. My husband also uses this moisturizer and he has dry skin. It works great for both of our skin types. Fabulous moisturizer!
