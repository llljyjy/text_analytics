Fantastic! I absolutely love this cream. It’s easily my go-to product for my face. The texture is perfect, and it has a pleasant yet not overpowering scent like some creams I’ve used Ive used in the past. My skin feels moisturized without feeling greasy or weighed down. I’m a redhead with sensitive skin and have to be careful about what I use and I absolutely love this.I’ve seen visible positive results on my face as well. I even have it along with the night cream in a travel size. Would definitely recommend to anyone! Awesome cream
