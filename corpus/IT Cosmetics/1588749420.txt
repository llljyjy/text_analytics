When I first opened the jar, I noticed that the cream had a greasy appearance, so I wasnâ€™t sure how it would feel on the skin. I used a small amount on my neck and face. It did not leave a greasy feel, in comparison to two different brands of vegan creams I have used which were heavier on my skin. I found it to be moisturizing and soothing. I did not experience any irritation. After using it twice daily for two weeks, these are my observations of the benefits. This cream helps with firming, plumping, softening fine lines, including neck lines and smooths the skin overall. There is an improvement in radiance and elasticity. There was no change in skin tone or dark spots. I like that it contains cleaner ingredients. It works well under makeup. I also used a powder zinc sunscreen over it for daytime. I will continue to use and purchase. I like the feeling of moisture without oiliness on my skin. nan
