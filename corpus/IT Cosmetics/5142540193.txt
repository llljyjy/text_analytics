This cream is a rich thick moisturizing cream that I would recommend for those with dry or combination skin. I have combination oily so I like using it at night or when my skin is feeling extra dry. Also I would recommend applying before makeup if you like a more dewy look. I really love the ingredients and would definitely recommend this cream. Great moisturizing cream
