I’ve been wearing it since I got it every night I use it as a night cream The smell is very medicinal so I give it four stars because the smell is a little off-putting as for the product itself it is very very moisturizing and I can really feel it on my face without it being too heavy because of it also absorbs quickly All in all this is a cream that I would use in the future and recommend to others and as for the aging effects I don’t think I’ve used it long enough to notice much of a difference. Rich and luxurious
