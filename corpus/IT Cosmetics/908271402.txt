The It Cosmetics products never disappoint, this cream is no different.  My face stays and feels hydrated when I use this cream.  I love the fact that it is created by dermatologists and free of Ingredients that might make my skin break out.  I cannot wait to see the results it brings after using it a couple of months.  So far my skin is hydrated and soft.  I love using it at bedtime, but also in the morning.  It’s a little thicker than my regular moisturizer, but the effects are so much better.   Hydrated skin in my 50s is a huge plus, as well as minimizing wrinkles.  My skin also feels tighter on my face.  The scent is pleasant and not overwhelming at all.  I will continue using this cream because I’m confident the results are amazing! A definite must buy! I’m confident!
