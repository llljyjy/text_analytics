I want to preface by saying I have atopic dermatitis and extremely sensitive skin. This product is LIFE CHANGING. The coverage is beautiful and looks wonderful on the skin, it covers my redness and it sits beautifully on the skin (I should add that I don’t suffer from acne or have any texture issues in my skin except for dry patches). It’s so lightweight that it doesn’t look cakey and dries completely so it doesn’t rub off! (Although I have set it with powder for a more longwear finish and it works wonderfully as well) This is a product made by angels and I will continue to buy it. That being said, I deducted one star because 0.37fl. oz. of product FOR THIS PRICE is just ridiculous. A standard high end foundation has at least 1oz of product so I feel kinda disappointed in the size of the jar. I’m attaching a photo of the jar next to my carmex lip balm and they are (sadly) almost close in size :/ give us more product IT Cosmetics! Life changing but minuscule :/
