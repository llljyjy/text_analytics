I’ve been using the Confidence in a Cream for a few weeks now. I’ve noticed a slight improvement with fine lines, which I’m assuming will only get better with continued use. It has helped even out my skin tone. It smells nice. A little goes a long way and is very moisturizing. I love that it is clean and vegan. Definitely recommend. nan
