I have been using the IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream for a while now and my skin has changed subtly. I have noticed that I haven’t had any dry patches since I’ve been applying this cream. I have dry skin and am noticing fine lines. This has replaced my other moisturizer and seems to perform better, giving my skin the moisture that is lacking in other creams that I’ve been using and my skin looks glowy, plump and healthy. I have even noticed that my makeup applies better. I will be buying this cream again once it runs out. It is a thick cream, a little goes a long way. The only thing that I’ve noticed is that if I apply too much, the cream has a tackiness to it, however, a thicker layer at night gives you fresh, glowy and super moisturized skin in the morning. I use this all over my face and neck, including under my eyes. I’ve recommended this to family and friends and even to some co-workers of some family. I’m enjoying using this product and look forward to seeing even longer term results in the future. Dry skin approved. Dry Skin Approved
