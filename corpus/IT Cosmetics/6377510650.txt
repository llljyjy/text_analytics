This is a heavier cream moisturizer that has a light scent that reminds me of baby lotion, it fades quickly and I didnâ€™t mind it. It absorbs well and leaves skin plump and refreshed. I really like creams like this at night.  I felt moisturized and my skin did look better after using this for a couple weeks. nan
