I’ve used this for a little more than a week, I love how nice it goes on, no greasy feeling or shine on my face. When I am done there is no difference in how my face feels, when I wash my face, it does feel very greasy, but it washes right off. I like that there is no smell or greasy feeling after it’s applied. Great non greasy moisturizer
