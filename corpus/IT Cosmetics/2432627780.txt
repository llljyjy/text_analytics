This is one of the best face creams I have tried in a long time. I really like it because it glides onto the face so well and I honestly feel my face is so moisturized when I wake up every morning after having it on throughout the night. I have already used 2/3rds of the bottle since I received it because I like it so much. It will be my night regimen from now on. I like the tingly sensation I get when it is first put on. Highly recommend to try for yourself! Although I was given this in exchange for my honest feedback, this is a must purchase! To note, my face is on the dry side so this feels great on my skin as a moisturizer! Amazing moisturizer!
