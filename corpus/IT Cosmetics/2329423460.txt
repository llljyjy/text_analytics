I was able to try this cream for an honest review. Being in my forties I love a good anti aging cream. I found confidence in a cream to be a great option. It has a nice citrusy scent and goes on smoothly without feeling oily. I would definitely consider buying this when Iâ€™ve finished the jar. Great choice with a cute name.
