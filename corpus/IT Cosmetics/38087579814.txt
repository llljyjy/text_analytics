I liked the Confidence in a Cream Hydrating Moisturizer by IT Cosmetic, the scent is light and not overpowering, lemony. The texture and constancy is good enough, not too runny and not too thick, just right.  It made my skin looks very fresh and smoothed some of my fine lines. But main thing was it hydrate my skin very deep, having dry skin this is my heaven, Hydrating!
