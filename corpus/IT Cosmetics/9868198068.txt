I’ve been trying this for a few weeks and I have to say the formula is fantastic. It’s smooth and have a lovely texture thy just glides on your face. I use this at morning and at night and it’s just a rich creamy moisturizer that hydrates and plumps up your face. I have to say it does live up to all of the claims. I think I would definitely repurchase this one. Wonderful formula!
