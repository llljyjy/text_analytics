I’ve never heard of this brand before receiving it to review. I tried it immediately and it’s become a permanent fixture in my skin care routine. From the first application my skin felt like velvet. Just don’t use too much or it will be a little tacky until it dries. I made that mistake once but rubbed the excess on the back of my hands. What a added bonus. Soft hands too!I’d advise trying this cream and you may not go back to anything else you’ve been using. Don't pass by this cream without trying!
