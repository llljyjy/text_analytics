I liked the texture and feeling of this moisturizer. I didn’t love that it was fragranced, I felt like it was very strong and not necessary. I had it on my hands, then washed my hands with soap and water and the scent was still on my hands. It’s a rosy scent, so if you don’t love rose, skip this one. For the price, I didn’t think it did much better than any other moisturizer I’ve used with similar or the same ingredients. I would have also liked to see retinol in here, as this moisturizer claims to be anti-aging. Peptides are nice, but retinol/retinoids are the ideal for anti-aging. I wouldn’t buy this in the future. I was not wowed, especially when there are so many nicer options for a better price. Not worth the price and the fragrance is extreme
