I got a full sized 2 fl. Oz jar of IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Cream to try out for free in exchange for an honest review. I was very excited to try this cream because I heard great things about it. This one I got was also “supercharged” version of the original Confidence In a Cream, so I expected it to be even better. It has a very mild scent, which I like because I don’t like strong scented products to go on my face.  A little product, just a pea size amount is enough for my entire face and neck. It goes on smooth and absorbs easily. There is no greasy or oily residue left on my face once it’s absorbed into my skin. I think my skin got noticeably smoother in general after a couple days of use. However, I do noticed my skin broke out a little bit, with a few pimples on my forehead and one on my cheek after using this cream. I have dry skin in general and I don’t normally get any pimples at all, so these pimples that erupted on my face were quite noticeable.  I also started putting the cream on my stomach area where I have a lot of stretch marks. I noticed that my skin there feels more firm and smoother after a week of putting on the cream 2x/day. I think I will stop using the cream on face because of the breakouts and will continue to use it on my stomach area to treat the stretch marks instead. I hope this cream can at least smooth out my stomach area and get rid of the stretch marks. Overall, I think this is a great cream, just didn’t quite work out  too well on on my face because it caused me to break out a little. But it does say it can be applied to any skin that needs moisture and rejuvenation. moisturizing cream
