I use this morning and night to remove stubborn makeup after a long day of work. It has a light scent to it that will not over power you when using this beauty product. I have combination skin and have not had any sensitivities with this makeup removing product since I started using it. My skin on my face feels refreshed and clean after using it on a daily basis. Thank you. SheReveals
