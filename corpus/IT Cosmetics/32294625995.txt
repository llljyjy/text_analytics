I tried Confidence in a Cream for several weeks. Yes, I received this as a sample, but that doesn’t mean my review isn’t honest. If I didn’t like it I would say so. That being said I like this moisturizer a lot. It is very hydrating. It sinks into the skin without making your skin feel sticky or heavy. We are having a heat wave right now so it would really bother me if it felt heavy. It is very moisturinzing though. I like that it has hyaluronic acid in it. That ingredient has been scientifically found to increase moisture. The plumping does somewhat help fine lines too. What would make this better? If it had a tint to it and also SPF. That being said I will continue using it at night but will probably use my go-to tinted moisturizer with SPF in the morning. Nice moisturizer, not too heavy
