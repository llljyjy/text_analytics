I’ve been using Confidence in a Cream for a few weeks now and I love it. I’ve noticed a reduction in the appearance of my fine lines around my eyes and mouth,  and my face looks more youthful overall. Even though it felt heavy when first applied it absorbs quickly into my skin leaving it nice and soft. I also like that it has a nice,  light fragrance that is not overpowering. Love it.
