Truth be told it didn’t take a lot of convincing for me to try IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Makeup: 3-in-1 makeup melting cleansing balm, I’ve been a fan for years.  This product has such a luxurious feel, and smells lovely.  Just a hint of rose, nothing overwhelming.  The best part is that this removes my highly pigmented, super stay lip color with one quick swipe. Another winner from IT cosmetics
