I like this moisturizer. It works well and isn’t greasy. It does have a perfumed scent to it, though. I prefer unscented products and avoid using it on top of strong retinol or tretinoin. That said, I still use the product, the scent isn’t bad, and haven’t found the scent too irritating to my allergies. It’s a solid moisturizer. nan
