I was excited to get to try this make-up melting balm, and it has exceeded my expectations It has a creamy/oil like texture, and a light rose scent that is pleasant and not over powering. It takes of my face make-up beautifully and leaves my face clean and soft. I especially like it because it removes my mascara and eye make-up easily without making my eyes burn. All other make-up removing balms make my eyes burn. This one has replaced my old one and I will continue to use it for as long as they make it and donâ€™t change it. My New Favorite Make-Up Remover
