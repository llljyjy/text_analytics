It is a moisturizing face cream that you can use daily (Morning and Night). I used a small amount of this cream for my entire face. It is for all skin types and can be used as the last step in your skincare routine.Something that stands out about this product is that it has a high concentration of active ingredients (Niacinamide 4%, Squalane 3%, Peptide-Lipid Complex 2.5%) that help moisturize the skin.It comes in a glass container. The product has a cream-gel texture (but is instantly absorbed). The shelf life of this product, after opening, is 12 months.I would buy it again and I think it is a must try product! A moisturizer that feels good on my skin!
