It’s for all skin types, transforming moisturizer super cream. It’s the Anti-Aging Armour. It has a very light subtle scent,(I couldn’t plant what it was)  it didn’t bother me at all.  I’ve been using it for the last 14 days.  I enjoy the creamy soft texture of the cream, it just melts into my skin. I’m noticing a slight difference with some of my fine lines and I’m sure as I’ll more of difference over time. Overall, I’m loving it!!! The one thing that I didn’t care for but by no means would it ever be a deal breaker.  It’s slightly sticky for few seconds as it absorbed.  into my skin.  I’ll definitely being making a purchase once it time for a new bottle. It is Confidence In A Cream
