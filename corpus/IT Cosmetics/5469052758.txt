I tried this Confidence in a Cream by IT Cosmetics. From the first time I applied it I fell in love with it! It made my facial skin and neck SO very soft, supple and hydrated! It went on so smoothly without it being too thick or too thin. It applied perfectly and absorbed quickly into my skin so nicely without leaving a film or heavy greasy feeling. My skin just felt so moisturized and beautiful! I have been using this cream for about 2 weeks now & I feel like some of my wrinkles have disappeared & my facial skin feels “tightened”. This cream is better than any other cream I’ve tried so far! I highly recommend this! I will definitely be purchasing this cream again! Best Facial Cream I’ve Tried!
