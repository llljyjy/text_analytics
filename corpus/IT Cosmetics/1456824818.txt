I love the formula of Confidence in a Cream! It’s thick, but also lightweight enough that it really sinks into my skin. It’s not greasy at all and a little can go a long way. I’ve been using it over my face oil and under my SPF. Most creams can ball up, but this cream marries perfectly with the combo! My skin is visibly smoother and my makeup seems to set better as well, since it evens out the texture. Love it so much!! Super impressed!!
