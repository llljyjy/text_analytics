This formula is new and includes a 2% Super Peptide Concentrate. What I like about Confidence in a Cream is that has made my fine lines around my eyes less noticeable.  It is lightweight and not scented which are also huge plusses for me.  I am 51 and take skin care seriously, I will definitely add this in my rotation! So Good- It's Out of Stock!
