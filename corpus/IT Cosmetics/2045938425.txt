I just turned 50 on 7/31, finding a good moisturizer is important to me.  This moisturizer is amazing It feel so nice to put on and does not have a strong smell. A little goes a long way, especially if you’re using oils and treatments too. It last throughout the day or night! This is my favorite face moisturizer. I don’t like when I can feel them all day or have to reapply during the day or wake up dry. My skin feels smooth and soft as soon as I apply it.  I would definitely recommend this product to my friends and family. Age Is Just A Number
