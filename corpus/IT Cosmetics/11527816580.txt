I have tried alot of creams in the past. I got offered to try IT confidence in a cream and I was very excited about it! With having very sensitive skin, I was a little apprehensive with trying a new product but IT delivered! My skin tends to dry out in the winter months and IT confidence in a cream delivered the perfect amount of moisture without it feeling too heavy or greasy! Great cream for the price!
