This is more and likely the best moisturizer I have ever tried. I received this product as a free sample and boy was I a lucky gal!  It is so hydrating!!! It goes on so smoothly and it stays all day.  I have been using this product for almost two weeks now and I am already seeing results and I have to say it again, MY SKIN FEELS AND LOOKS GREAT! It is definitely worth the price! The Best of the Best in Moisturizers!
