I must say,  I do enjoy this moisturizer. It is pretty heavy,  so I use it strictly at night.  I can see it being used as a day moisturizer for those who are extremely dry and for very mature skin. I noticed that when I do use it,  it doesn’t absorb into the skin very quickly, leaving a tacky feeling.  It’s perfect to go to sleep in,  because then I wake up with super soft, supple skin. I think any skin type can benefit from this product. nan
