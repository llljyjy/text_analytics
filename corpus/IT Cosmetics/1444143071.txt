I was really intrigued to try this product but I can’t get past the fragrance of the product. It is not a scent that I’m a fan of, and so it makes wanting to use this very difficult. The actual cream itself isn’t too bad, though I find it to be a tad too much for my oily skin. Overall, I don’t think it’s a bad cream, but just not something that I’m in love with. nan
