I received the IT Eye Cream from Bzzagent to try and provide my honest review. First, I only gave it 4 stars because I’ve only been using it for a few weeks but I love this cream. It is a gentle cream that keeps my face moisturized all day with great results. Also I feel that my eyes don’t look as tired as they did.  This product feels good on the skin, very little is needed so I anticipate this bottle is going to last me a very long time which I happy with.  The scent is nice and not over bearing at all.  If you’ve been thinking about using this product, I do recommend you try it out. Love the Confidence in a Cream Moisturizer
