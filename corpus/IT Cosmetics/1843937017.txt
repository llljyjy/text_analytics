I have been using this cream for over 2 weeks now and I have noticed my skin’s overall appearance has improved. I have “mature“ skin with wrinkles and fine lines appearing around my eyes and mouth. I have noticed those lines diminish with use of this cream. My skin feels more dewey and smooth as well. It is easy to apply and the smell is not overwhelming. I had been using an oil-based serum before and like the consistency of this product better when used underneath my makeup. Improves my skin's overall appearance
