I was excited to try IT cosmetics Secret Sauce Anti-Aging Moisturizer and I was not disappointed. The cream had very little fragrance and was just thick enough to smooth over my skin and immediately absorb. It never felt greasy or oily on my skin. My skin felt smooth and hydrated. I will definitely consider adding this to my skin routine. Made My Skin Happy
