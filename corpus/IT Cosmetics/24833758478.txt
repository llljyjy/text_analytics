I heard about #ITCosmetics secret sauce a few months ago and I wanted to try it, but it was rather expensive. I just happened to receive this product via #BzzAgent for their honest review of this product. Both the box and the jar have a holographic glow and look very nice. Upon opening the jar, it had a smell like Elmersâ€™s glue. The smell brings me back to my childhood and my fake face lifts I would do for my friends using the glue. The product feels very creamy and silky and goes on my face well, it absorbs into the skin fast and leaves your skin very soft, it is not sticky or greasy at all. I have only been using the product for less than a month and it does make a great moisturizer, but as far as its claim to reduce the look of pores, lines and wrinkles, I have not seen much of a difference yet. If I could improve it, I would give it another scent, possibly a light floral note would be nice, and I would change the price and bring it down a little, it is not worth that much money.
