This cream exceeded my expectations, I’ve been using it for about two weeks now and have noticed a difference on my skin, looks more plump and smoother. The cream is rich and a little goes a long way def. something that I will love using during the colder months as I feel it’s a bit too rich  for these hot humid months that we’re having. Overall love the cream and highly recommend. Love!
