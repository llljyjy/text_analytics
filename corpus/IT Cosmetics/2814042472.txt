I really enjoyed this product. This cleaning balm was a new type of cleanser for me. I’m used to a foaming wash so it was weird to not have that. I got about a dime sized amount and that seemed perfect. It was a nice milky cleanser. Subtle rose scent and left my skin feeling clean. My only complaints were it wasn’t as hydrating as I was hoping and it left a slight waxy feel. A new kind of cleanser
