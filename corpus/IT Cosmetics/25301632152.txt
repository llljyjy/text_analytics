I absolutely love this IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm!! My skin feels amazing and my makeup comes off very easily. It literally “melts“ off!! It’s extremely easy to use and my face is not only clan of makeup but clean of oils or dirt and so soft from the moisturizer. The Vitamin C and Rose Hip Oil does wonders for my face. This is a well-made, quality makeup cleansing balm. My Go-to Makeup Cleansing Balm
