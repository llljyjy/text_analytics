Love this formula...Anti-Aging Moisturizer that will instantly hydrate and transform your skin. The Secret Sauce seems to be a Fermented Complex, Drops of Light Technology, diamond powder, vitamin C and licorice root. In addition, it contains collagen, peptides and hyaluronic acid to really help with the hydration and overall youthful plump-ness of the skin. I was worried it would feel heavy and more like a night time cream but it does absorb rather quickly on the face. I still like to apply this at night before bed and just let it do its magic while Iâ€™m sleeping. It is still absolute perfection as a day cream. My skin looked radiant, hydrated and I even got compliments on how my skin looked very good. Better results than I thought
