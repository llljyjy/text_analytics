I was very impressed with the results of this cream, I have used several foundation products from It cosmetics and they have all been great. This cream has a light fragrance but it dissipates and doesn’t trigger any reactions. Ingredients in many of It cosmetics products have replaced some of skincare items such as extra oils and moisturizers and this product is no exception. (I wouldn’t skip sunscreen) nan
