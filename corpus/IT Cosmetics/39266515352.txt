This cream is on the thicker side, which I actually like since a little goes a long way! It’s hydrating without being greasy or comedogenic. It’s also gentle and won’t irritate your skin. It leaves a nice healthy glow. It is on the heavier side, though, so I wouldn’t recommend it for everyday use during the summer since it can feel too heavy! nan
