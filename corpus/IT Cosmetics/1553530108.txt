Great packaging with the screw on/off feature. A little goes a long way for my combination skin. I was a little nervous for it to be used during my summer skin, but it was great to keep dryness at bay without the grease factor. I love the creamy texture, and feels cooling upon touch. A great overall moisturizer! Itâ€™s the Moisturizing Moment
