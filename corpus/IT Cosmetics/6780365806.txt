I found this balm to be very easy to use and that it did an amazing job at removing my makeup, even the water resistant mascara that can be difficult to remove usually. The balm itself glides on to the skin with ease, truly does feel like it melts the makeup away and then rinses off beautifully. It leaves my skin feeling refreshed, not dry at all, and it even gives me a slight dewy feeling after use. I have found that it doesnâ€™t irritate my skin in any way and overall, gives me a cleansed look with ease. I really like the idea of this product as it will last a long time and it removes my need for makeup wipes, so is a more sustainable option in the long run. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a better makeup remover option! Amazing cleanser!
