IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream hydrates well while feeling lightweight throughout the day. I used this product in the morning before my SPF and makeup. It left my skin feeling hydrated  without being greasy. There are a lot of great benefits to this product, such as the addition of ceramides, antioxidants, and hyaluronic acid. Definitely a cream I feel good using on a daily basis to keep my skin looking itâ€™s best. a great lightweight moisturizer
