I must start off by saying that i love this brand. I have used various products in the past and am always pleasantly surprised on how they work, especially at the price point.  Compared to other Anti-Aging Moisturizers out there, Confidence in a cream feels that much more hydrating as it has the right amount of moisturizing without the sticky grease feeling.  Although i have not been using the product long enough to see any antiaging claims, i do love the benefit of this is extremely nourishing to the skin, a lot goes a long way. I use this every day after i get out of the shower, it is a great primer pre-makeup. I will continue to use this in my skin year routine and would definitely recommend this to friends and family. So Hydrating, easy to apply
