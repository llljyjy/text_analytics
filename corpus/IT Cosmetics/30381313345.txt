I’ve tried a lot of skin care products & very few of them really impress me. I haven’t found many where I can actually see a difference but this product is amazing. I got the mini size to try and am already purchasing the full size. I have combination skin, dry on my nose and mouth and oily all over everywhere else. Hydration has been key for me keeping hydrated skin overall & using this at night has done that. I also love the slight lavender smell, it’s not overpowering but just enough to be relaxing. nan
