I was pretty disappointed when I opened up my new box of Secret Sauce moisturizer from IT Cosmetics. I have been using this moisturizer for YEARSSSS. They up and changed the formula. Magically I found a box of the other SS Moisturizer and when I compared the boxes/ingredients I saw a HUGE difference. The older formula boasted about having collagens and peptides, hyaluronic acid, vitamin C etc. new box and formula do not mention of these. The ingredient list was cut in half basically and when applied to skin the new formula makes my skin look dull. The older formula made me glow and honestly at 39 I barely have wrinkles (if any) thanks to this cream but I’m pretty dissatisfied with the new formula and I will now have to find something else comparable and it’s truly unfortunate. Bring back old formula
