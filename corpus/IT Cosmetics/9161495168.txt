Confidence in a Cream is an excellent quick-absorbing moisturizer with a rich, creamy texture. For the week I’ve been using it, my combination skin has been seriously hydrated all day. It has a slight scent that I would describe as that classic moisturizer scent - without being perfumey. Although I haven’t seen a visible difference in pore texture or overall plumpness, I feel like my skin has been cleaner and clearer overall. Truly Confidence in a Cream
