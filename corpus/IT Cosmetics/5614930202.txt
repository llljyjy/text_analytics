I have fine lines and wrinkles and have been using Confidence in a Cream for over a month now, I havenâ€™t noticed any changes in my skin. I do feel as if it has helped reduce the appearance of my pores. I still have plenty of product in the jar because I only use about a pea size amount and it leaves my skin feeling somewhat sticky after application so i typically use another moisturizer as well. Overall I believe that IT Cosmetics offers some better creams than this. Not my favorite choice, but still testing product
