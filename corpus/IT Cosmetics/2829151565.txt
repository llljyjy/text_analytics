I had the opportunity to try a complimentary sample of the IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream moisturizer and absolutely loved it! From the light citrus scent, to the texture and how it felt on my skin! Even the packaging which is simple, but I love that it’s a glass jar. From the first day I applied it, I noticed the texture is thick, creamy, but not greasy. It is hard to describe, but my skin almost felt as if I was applying a primer. It felt smooth and definitely moisturized. At the end of the day, my face didn’t feel dried up which really surprised me. As far as noticing any blurred fine lines, I haven’t seen anything major, but it does give my skin an inner glow and I have been enjoying wearing just the moisturizer with some mascara, eyeliner and lip gloss instead of wearing a full face of makeup! Definitely recommend this moisturizer and love that it’s for all skin types. So Moisturizing!
