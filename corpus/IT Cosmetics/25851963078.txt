I wasn’t sure what to expect from this this cleansing balm, but I love IT Cosmetics so I was excited to try IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Makeup: 3-in-1 Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm along with my 15yo daughter.  My opinion doesn’t even matter here.  I have no complaints, but more importantly it has been life-changing for my daughter!  Not only does this balm clean away makeup with a simple wipe, it left her skin smooth, supple and NOT IRRITATED!  This is the first cleanser we have found, including specifically “sensitive skin“ versions, that did not leave her red and blotchy.  The smell is not strong nor unpleasant.  The container is huge and easy to get the product from.  And a little balm goes a long way.  We love this product! Life-changing cleaning balm for my teen!
