After using this product 2x/day for 2 weeks, I can confidently say how effective it was in reducing fine lines around my eyes and really plumping the area. The product itself is thick, but not uncomfortable and really easy to apply (I love the little pot it comes in!). It dries down very well and I can see a difference in the way my concealer applies -- and even feel more comfortable now than ever not wearing concealer! Great product. Great eye cream!
