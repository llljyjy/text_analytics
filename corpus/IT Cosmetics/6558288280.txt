I have a lot of confidence this cream has a lot of potential. You are never too young to start thinking about wrinkles. I have a pretty tight regimen now as far as skin care and this cream made it’s way into the rotation. The smell is subtle and the packaging is nice and heavy. I like that it isn’t heavily scented because I have sensitive skin as well as rosacia so I like any product that doesn’t cause my skin to react. The moisturizer itself feels nice and light, not greasy. I don’t have a crazy amount of wrinkles but I do have fine lines that I wish would smooth out and I’ve seen a small difference in the smoothness of my skin since using this. Small, but noticeable and I think with continued usage it’ll get better. It absorbed into my skin fairly quickly so i like that. I would definitely recommend it to and buy again. nan
