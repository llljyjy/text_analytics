I have drawers of skincare products but this is my trusted OG. I have psoriasis. I need to have a gentle cleanser on my sensitive skin to avoid any unwelcome flare ups. This cleanser is hydrating. I use it after a cleansing oil to remove all of my makeup. When it’s washed off, there is no trace of dry, tight skin like other products. This is the perfect foundation for a skincare routine. The fragrance is very light. It foams without stripping the natural barriers. I don’t leave home without it
