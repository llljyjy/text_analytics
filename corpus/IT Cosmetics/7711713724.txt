This is a very rich cream, a little goes a long way! It smells slightly of citrus. It melts seamlessly into the skin. It moisturizes very well. It helps aging skin fight 10 different concerns, and does it very well. I noticed definite firming of the loose skin along my jawline and neck! I also saw an improvement in the depth of my lines and wrinkles, pores appear less noticeable, and my general skin tone has evened out. Iâ€™m very pleased to have tried this. I usually buy 1 or 2 other popular mainstream brands, but this is more effective, and when you find something effective you stick with IT! This Is IT
