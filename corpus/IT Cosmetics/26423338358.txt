I received this product to try and review and I love it. It claims to reduce fine lines and wrinkles and it lives up to its claim. I have used it for 2 weeks and saw a difference in my skin looking smoother and soft. It is quick absorbing and does not leave a residue. I recommend this moisturizer to anyone looking for a good anti-aging cream. Great Anti-aging Moisturizer!
