I cannot say enough about this cleansing balm! It is an amazing product that not only removes makeup but also hydrates skin leaving it silky smooth but not greasy feeling. You apply it to dry skin and massage over your face and rinse. It has a very thick consistency but it doesnâ€™t feel greasy on skin. It has a light scent of rose petals. My skin is left feeling smooth and hydrated. This is a great product that I would purchase again and would recommend! Smooth hydrated skin
