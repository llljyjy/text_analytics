I’m horrible about washing my face at night, even though I am 36 and definitely know better. IT Cosmetics: Bye Bye Makeup 3-in-1 Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm destroys my #1 excuse for not doing it: I hate splashing water on my face if I’m not in the shower. Since Bye Bye Makeup goes on dry, it’s so quick and easy to put it on, brush my teeth, then wipe it off. It leaves my skin smelling amazing, and feeling clean and hydrated. I love leaving it on a bit longer a few times a week as a balm, too. I’m doing a much better job of crawling into bed with a clean face now than I ever have before. I love it! Bye Bye Excuses
