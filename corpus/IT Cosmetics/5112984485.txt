I received Confidence in a Cream as part of  a promotion.  First off I was a bit disappointed that it had no sunscreen.  I would have to use a separate sunscreen while using the cream.  Secondly I was hoping that I would really love the moisturizer, but it seemed to dry out my skin instead of moisturizing, so I started using my serum under it to prevent it from totally drying out my face. It did seem to tighten my skin, somewhat, but not enough to rectify the drying nature. Unfortunately ,  I think I prefer my  regular moisturizer Lâ€™oreal Age Perfect to this, nan
