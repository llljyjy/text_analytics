I love this stuff. The texture is great, it applies and absorbs easily, and it truly does moisturize my skin. My skin texture has improved and I have not had any skin irritation, and I have sensitive skin. I would recommend this as a daily moisturizer (I use it at night) and I would repurchase this product. nan
