This is a fantastic moisturizer. It soaks in quickly and does not feel greasy or heavy. It has a light fresh scent which I like. It moisturizes my skin well and leaves that lasting hydrating effect for hours. Itâ€™s not sticky and allows makeup to be applied over it easily. Unlike with other products, my skin appears smoother and much softer. I highly recommend this moisturizer! Great moisturizer for my aging skin
