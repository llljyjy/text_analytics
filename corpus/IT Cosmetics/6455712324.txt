The IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream is the new favorite. My wife and I both use it morning and night. We use it on our face and neck. It goes on so creamy. It leaves our skin super soft. It is very hydrating without any greasy feeling on the skin. It soaks in quickly too. The ingredients are for anti-aging. Such as, ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and peptides. We love this product and I think you will too! Love this product!
