I’m 45 years old and not use Botox or filler‘s. I have melasma and dry skin. This anti-aging cream transformed my skin in two weeks. Gave it the moisture it needed, plumped it up, made me look years younger-hallelujah, decreased the age spots/melasma dark spots, and rejuvenated my skin is texture. It worked extremely well under my make up and provided a very youthful appearance. With initial application my skin turned slight pink as it absorbed the cream and quickly returned back to its normal color. The scent is also very heavenly it’s very organic and reminds me of a spa. I apply this with a moisturizer face brush for even application and gentle light massage. I will be purchasing this again when I run out as I’ve been applying it to my face neck and décolletage since I’ve been noticing dramatic results. nan
