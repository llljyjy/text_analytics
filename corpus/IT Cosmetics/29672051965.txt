I received this cream from Bzz Agent to try and review and I absolutely love it.  It is a thick cream but spreads easily and is not greasy or sticky.  I use it in the morning and at night and my skin looks and feels soft, smooth and healthy and I have not had any breakouts or reaction from it.  I have noticed a slight reduction in fine lines and am hoping that with continued use will show more reduction in them.  The smell is nice and almost like lavender so to me it’s quite relaxing, especially at night.  After I finish this jar, which will take a while since you don’t need alot, I will definitely purchase it and continue using it as part of my skin care regimine. Love how my skin feels
