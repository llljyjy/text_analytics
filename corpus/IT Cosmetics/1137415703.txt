I have just started using the IT brand of face products and makeup over the past year and have been so impressed. They truly do what they say. The Confidence in a Cream is amazing on my skin. I’m 40, so my skin is getting dryer and showing more lines and different pigmentation. I started using this cream morning and night and I’ve started feeling and seeing results in the first couple of weeks. You only need a little bit to get good coverage. There is no scent and it absorbs quickly. The moisture is amazing and really keeps my skin hydrated all day. I can still apply my makeup with no issue and it doesn’t smear or melt. I think the price is fair because you use so little for an application, it should last me a long time. I plan to keep purchasing this cream. Love it, works great!!
