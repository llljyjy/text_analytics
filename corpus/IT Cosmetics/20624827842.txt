This Confidence in a Cream really doesn’t compare to other products I’ve tried. This is such a beautiful consistency, such an emollient formula. It just felt so beautiful, and hydrating on the skin.  Some benefits of owning this product will give us soft, supple skin. I have a dry, sensitive skin, it didn’t make me red at all, and there wasn’t any burning sensation at all! I was sent the It Cosmetics  Confidence in a Cream for promotional considerations, and leaving my two reviews.  Even after FTC information, with this said, after using the product I would absolutely buy it involving my own money. I would highly recommend this product to your friends or family. nan
