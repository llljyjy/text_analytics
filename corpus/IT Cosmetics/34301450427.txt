I really like the Confidence in a Cream product.  It goes on smooth and my face feels soft and hydrated all day without feeling greasy. I see improvement in my skins texture when I apply the cream and I can wear it under foundation without any issues.  I do not see any major changes to my skin when I am not wearing the cream but I still rate it 5 stars because its a cream I really like.  The scent is soft too and the packaging is nice. I will continue to use this product. Nice Cream
