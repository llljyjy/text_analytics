I really love the way the It cosmetics Confidence in a cream smells and is a nice thick cream. A little goes a long way. It makes my combination skin look and feel great. I use it in the morning and at night and my skin looks great. I will continue to use this product for my moisturizer every day. I would definitely recommend this for anyone to try. Great moisturizer!
