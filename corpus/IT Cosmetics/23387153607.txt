This is my absolute favorite all-time moisturizer! It’s so good I can’t even explain how good it is. It leaves your skin so soft and moisturized. In the ingredients are absolutely incredible. I’ve noticed a huge difference since I started using it. This will definitely 100% be my go to moisturizer from now on. It’s especially good for aging skin. A little bit goes a long way, and you get so much product. The price point can seem a little scary, but it’s going to last you such a long time. It cosmetics for the win once again The best!
