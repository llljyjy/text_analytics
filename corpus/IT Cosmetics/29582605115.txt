I’ve only been using the IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream for a couple of weeks, but so far I’m happy with it. My face feels moisturized without being sticky or stiff when it dries. I’ve noticed it’s easier to apply makeup around my eyes after applying this moisturizer. The verdict is still out for the long-term differences, but overall I’m happy with it. So far, so good...
