I received this product to review from BzzAgent. This moisturizing super cream has a soft, lemony scent. Confidence in a Cream has a buttery texture and a little goes a long way. I like this cream, but it did cause my mild acne to get worse. I’m hoping that my skin is still adjusting to a new product. It’s thicker than past moisturizers I’ve tried. If you are looking for a super hydrating moisturizer, then this is it for you. I would buy this product, if I had a great coupon. All The Moisture!
