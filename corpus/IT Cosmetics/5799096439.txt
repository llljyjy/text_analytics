I loved this cream, specially the “clean” scent is just so nice, it definitely adds to my “fresh” feeling after showering and it’s extremely nourishing. I use it as the last step of my night time routine, I love how fast absorbing it is even though it feels really heavy. Among all its ingredients it has many that I already use so it definitely reduced the amount of steps. I do feel a little tingle after I apply it but it lasts less than a minute and that’s it. I’m very pleased with this product. super nourishing!
