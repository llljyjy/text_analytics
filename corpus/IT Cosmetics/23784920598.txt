This works! I found that a little will go a long way. I used about a half a penny sized amount and it spread like silk over my face and neck. I felt that my skin was truly moisturized and it felt smooth. It did not dry tacky, nor was it sticky. The amount I am using and the size of the jar guarantee me that I will have enough to use day and night for quite some time. Very impressed. a gem in a jar!
