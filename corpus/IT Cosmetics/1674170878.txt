I got this thinking it was just a cleansing balm and that the other claims were superfluous or exaggerated. Wrong! So this product works great at removing makeup. It’s easy to spread and doesn’t require a lot to remove a full face. I can take it over the eyes and not get irritation. I love that it’s not stripping the skin as I wipe the product and makeup away. It makes for a great mask too. I didn’t realize how much texture I was experiencing until feeling my face after using this as a mask. The amount of product is very generous especially since it doesn’t take much per use. I am very pleased with this IT Cosmetics Cleansing Balm! nan
