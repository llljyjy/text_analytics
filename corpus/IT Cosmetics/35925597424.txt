I have mixed feeling about this cream.  When I first began using it I felt it left my skin greasy and it caused me to break out a little.  I then began applying the smallest dab of cream and it felt much better.  Iâ€™ve seen an improvement around my eyes and mouth.  I plan on continuing to use it in hope it will begin to see a difference on my forehead.  I would recommend this cream as long you do not have oily skin. Mixed Feelings
