I have been using this confidence in a cream anti-aging hydrating moisturizer for about two weeks now and my skin can really tell a difference! A little bit goes a long way and as soon as this hits my skin I immediately feel it going to work and hydrating my dry skin. I’ve been using it just once a day and I can really tell that my skin feels smoother and is much less dry. I do feel that it has helped with some of the fine lines and wrinkles on my forehead as well as my eyes and cheek area. I’ve used many products from IT cosmetics and they never disappoint . Great hydrating moisturizer
