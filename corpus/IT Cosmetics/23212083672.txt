iT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream is easy to apply and absorbs well.  My skin felt moisturized without feeling greasy. I like that I am able to apply this product to my entire face and neck and did not have any sensitivity issues.   I really liked that it had a hint of fragrance that was clean smelling but not overpowering.  it Cosmetics went a step further and provided a bonus in that they reduced the packaging for this product resulting in a smaller environmental impact. nan
