Seems like a great cream. I enjoyed the smell, reminded me of suntan lotion. It wasn’t super sticky or greasy, it sank into my skin pretty well. I added four stars because I did get some breakouts from the scream. It could be from purging, adding a new product to my routine or my oily skin just didn’t take it. I will continue using it however. Seems like a great cream
