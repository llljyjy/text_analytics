This was the first time using this product. It only takes a little bit/small amount of the cream when applying all over the face. I donâ€™t like the smell of the cream and it lingers until washed off.  It has been used for two weeks and no visible results or refining of face wrinkles can be seen.  On a positive note, the cream goes on smooth and is quick to absorb into the skin on the face and neck. nan
