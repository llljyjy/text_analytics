I absolutely love this cleansing balm! I have tried similar products in the past and did not like them, so honestly my expectations were low. However, just a small amount of this product cleaned my entire face and removed every trace of makeup, even waterproof eyeliner and mascara that I have had difficultly removing in the past. I have very dry skin and this product did not strip my skin or make it feel dry but left my skin feeling so soft and hydrated. The only thing that I even slightly disliked was the floral scent. However, I loved everything else so much that I am more than willing to overlook that. I will recommend this and continue to use it. Amazing, Hydrating Cleansing Balm
