When I first used this product my face turned red. My skin continued to feel dry. It was only after using this product after a week that my skin started to feel more moisturized and less red. My pores seem to look smaller after 2 weeks of using. I do like the texture of this cream and I feel that it is not too thick and not too thin. Could moisturize my skin more
