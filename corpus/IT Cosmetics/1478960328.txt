To start, the smell reminds me of products my little brother’s grandmother used to always use.  I wasn’t aware that I had a smell-based memory trigger for her; she wasn’t a decent person...so, that wasn’t pleasant.  I still tried it for a week, since it was a free product for review program, and I’d have to in order to give an honest review.  It felt pleasant. Not greasy.  But it didn’t feel...satisfyingly moisturizing.  Like I still needed to go back to my regular face moisturizer as well (I went one day without doing so) before my skin would feel right...less tight and dry as it does after washing my face. I felt it sink in, but then it still felt  like it was sitting on top of my skin.  Though it didn’t leave a residue that my fingers felt much at all.   I didn’t want to keep having the smell right in my face, so I stopped using it after a week.  I didn’t notice much change in one way or another that was an improvement on the basic face products I regularly use.  So maybe, in my case, it’s just not a formulation that is right for my skin, or at this point in my skin’s ageing.   So while it isn’t something I’ll keep using, I will select positively in the recommend/don’t recommend options below.  I’ve spent a bit looking up reviews and information on several other sites and cosmeceutical reports/research/news sites and, for one, it has review averages similar to those here, all over the place.  Something that overwhelmingly approved of is worth giving a try. Despite my odd-one-out personal feelings and results about it. Not for me.
