This is a nice moisturizing cream that feels luxurious. It’s a pretty heavy cream, so I prefer using it at night only, especially in the summer. I am eager to see how it helps my skin in the winter when the cold air dries my skin out. I appreciate that this cream is fragrance-free and doesn’t irritate my skin, which can be sensitive. I am not sure about the anti-aging claims, but my skin does look healthy and feel moisturized when using this cream. nan
