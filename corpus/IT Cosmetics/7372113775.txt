I’ve been using this product for several weeks after I wash my face (1-2x a day). It *is* moisturizing, but my skin is normal-dry and it’s too heavy/thick for me to consider rebuying. To be fair, I’m sure it has lots of good ingredients and it hasn’t had any adverse affects on my skin (though I’m not sensitive.) It’s just hard to use a small enough amount to avoid looking a little greasy afterwards, because it’s thick and a bit tough to spread without adding a serum/oil to thin it down. I’ve done that several times lately with my vitamin C serum or rose hip oil and that helps. It’s got a bit of an herbal scent and doesn’t sting or produce any redness so that’s good. I’d prefer this maybe as a night cream or in the winter (it’s summertime currently.) Once this is gone, I’ll be happy to revert to my Neutrogena HydroBoost Gel for extra dry skin (no fragrance or dyes, and it’s light/cooling and super fast absorbing.) Works but thicker than I’d like
