I’m no stranger to this cream since I’ve tried the original formula a while back. The first thing I noticed is the very creamy almost scentless medium consistency of this cream that is super fast absorbing, it doesn’t feel oily/greasy upon application but it surely offers optimal levels of hydration, it feels quite moisturizing, plays very well with my serums, and under makeup and it doesn’t pill.After using it for around 10 days, I’ve noticed that my skin looks a bit plumper, has definitely helped with lines and I think this is a wonderful pore eraser, I didn’t experience any acne breakouts what leads me to believe this is a non comedogenic formula. I love its versatility because I feel it’d be a suitable formula for all year round. A little goes a long way and 2oz is a very generous amount.I’m loving it, and will continue to use it to keep those anti-aging benefits coming! Wonderful Cream!
