I have dry and sensitive skin, and this moisturizer has quickly become my go to. It is super creamy and thick and leaves my skin feeling and looking so smooth and healthy. I also love that it is not scented, because sometimes that irritates my sensitive skin. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to hydrate your face :) So creamy!
