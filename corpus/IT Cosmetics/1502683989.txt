Ok,  I’m SUPER into this cream!!  I’ve been dealing with stress and hormone induced adult acne for the past 2 years. I’ve been dealing with stress and hormone induced adult acne for the past 2 years. I’ve tried a ton of products;  some have dried me out, many have left me  broken out even worse. On top of this, I’m in my mid forties, so signs of aging is an increasing concern. Confidence in a Cream seems to even everything out, I, I feel moisturized and treated. My acne has subsided substantially, and I have noticed improvements in skin texture and fine lines. I Have the Confidence in an Eye Cream by the same company company, but I much prefer that prefer this It Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream Anti-Aging Armour. It’s amazing!! I’m actually repurchasing repurchasing another jar tomorrow. HG status?
