This is my first experience with IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Makeup: 3-in-1 Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm and I am already loving the convenience of an all-in-one product. This can be used as a waterproof makeup remover, a cleanser, and hydrating mask. Easily apply morning and night with fingertips or a cotton round and see how much more makeup comes off than traditional facial cleansers. If using as a mask, simply leave on for 10 minutes. After, my skin was radiant and healthier looking with a lovely soft glow. I really enjoy the IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Makeup: 3-in-1 Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm and the convenience of simplifying my skincare routine. I received a free product in exchange for my honest opinion and review. Wonderfully Hydrating Combination Product
