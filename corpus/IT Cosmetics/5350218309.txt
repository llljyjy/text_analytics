First thing I noticed was the scent, it’s beautiful and light, not heavy at all. The texture is thick and creamy and feels amazing on my face. I’ve been using every day and morning for a couple weeks and I definitely feel that the texture of my skin has improved. It feels very smooth and soft and just looks better and healthier. I would purchase in the future and possibly make it a staple in my skincare routine. love this stuff
