I have absolutely fallen in love with this stuff. Which is saying a lot since I have prided myself to have never needed or even wanted to use lotions or balms on my face. I spent my 20’s blessed with perfect porcelain skin. My 30’s still didn’t phase me. Now at 43? Ok, I caved and started using lotions. But I hate that funky layer of gunk feeling most lotions leave you with. it’s Confidence in a Cream does not! Glides on smooth and really gives my makeup a great foundation to build on. My skin just eats it up and looks much healthier. Whether I look younger? Who knows! My kids always say I’m “ancient” so they aren’t very helpful on that front. Lol Younger? Eh. But definitely healthier and happier! Smiles in a Jar
