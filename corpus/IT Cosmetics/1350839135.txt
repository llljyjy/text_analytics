So I wanted to give this cream a solid month and half of consistent use before having any final thoughts. My initial take was while I liked how it feels very creamy and absorbs well (not too greasy) I honestly just didnâ€™t feel much of a difference between this and the original confidence in a cream (which I love). After using it consistently for over a month now my thoughts have changed. I truly think this formula has made a bigger difference in helping my skin feel plump and youthful and less oily. I feel like the original while it does similiar for me I still throughout the day would get oily in my t zone and depending on weather dry in other areas but I always chalked it up as my skin type. This formula though has made a big difference for me on my skin type and even for make up application. I absolutely love it and will have this on my normal skin care routine now :) loveeee it
