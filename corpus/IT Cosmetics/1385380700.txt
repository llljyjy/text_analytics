I really enjoyed using this cream. The scent is very pleasant, and I love that it’s cruelty-free. When applying, it’s a bit thick, but it’s very moisturizing. You only need to use a small amount to see results. I think my fine lines are getting smaller, and my skin is definitely feeling healthier. Great cream!
