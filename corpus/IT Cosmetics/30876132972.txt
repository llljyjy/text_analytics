I received a complimentary jar of IT Confidence in a Cream from BzzAgent and IT, in exchange for my honest feedback.I was so excited to receive this because of all the benefits offered in this cream. It is extremely thick, but not sticky. It melts right into my skin. One instant benefit I noticed, was my skin was brighter. After 3 weeks of use, a deep line I have above my upper lip has steadily started to diminish. This is a new staple in my face care routine! Miracle in a jar
