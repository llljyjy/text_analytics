I was skeptical when I first opened the IT Cosmetics Bye-Bye Makeup 3-in-1 bales, but using it has me a believer! I love how soft these feels going on my face. I can it feel it hydrating my face and then leaves my skin actually feeling clean. I tried using a cloth to wipe off and rinsing with water.â€”both work great. I really like using the cloth because you can see all of the makeup off of it. I have noticed, just in a week of using the bales, a reduction in my fine lines and wrinkles. My face looks brighter and smoother than before. I love it! Love how soft this feels!
