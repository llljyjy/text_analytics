This cream is a great moisturizer. It feels luxurious on your skin if that makes sense. It goes on do smoothly and leaves the skin feeling plump an not oily at all which surprised me because I have oily skin. I’ve only tried it for a week and love how my face feels with it on. Price point is a bit high for what I’m used to, but I think this product is worth it! Face feels plump and smooth
