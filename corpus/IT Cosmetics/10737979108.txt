Received this product free to test.When I got this product, I assumed it was a cream makeup remover. I was surprised to find that it was a semisolid, waterproof and that it was also a mask and brightener. It was unscented. Felt moisturizing. Took makeup off extremely well. And was very moisturizing as a mask. Definitely recommending Surprise in a jar
