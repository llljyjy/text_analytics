This cream is exceeding my expectations each time I use it. At first I was worried it was too thick and creamy, but it actually absorbs so nicely into the skin , leaving no sticky feeling . I wake up to fresh glowy skin. Having seen a huge difference in fine lines but I hope to over time and more use . I took a star off because I donâ€™t like the scent - would like it to be unscented Nice absorption , feels good!
