I was hesitant about liking this moisturizer as I haven’t had a lot of success with this brands other items. Let me say I was pleasantly surprised at how creamy and smooth the texture of this moisturizer is. Sometimes my face still feels dry and I need to apply other products but this stuff is it! Highly recommend and I’ll definitely be purchasing. love love love
