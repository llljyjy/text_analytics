The confidence in a cream was great for hydration, but felt a bit heavy for my morning routine. I switched to using it after an evening shower so that that hydration set. I liked how my skin felt in the morning, and even on the fist days of putting it on at the start of my day it never felt greasy like some products can. The fragrance was very light almost as if it was just the natural smell of ingredients, not chemical smelling at all! hydrating and soothing
