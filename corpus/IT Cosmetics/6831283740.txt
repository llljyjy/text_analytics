Due to an accident of chemical burn, I have been experiencing really bad skin sensitivity and redness for the past few weeks. However, the IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream has saved me from all the uncomfortableness by providing hydration and really helped repaired my skin barrier. My face is barely red now and feels so much softer than before. Also since I am in my late 20s, after using the cream for 14 days I noticed great improvement in my smile lines and skin firmness. Very powerful cream with great results! Most importantly, it feels light-weight on the skin and gets absorbed quickly so my face feels fresh by the time i go to bed. 100% recommend!! nan
