I really like this CC cream formula. I have combo skin that tends to be on the oiler side in the Summer months, and this CC cream works really well for me. I prep my skin with serum in the morning and I love using this product because it is my SPF, my moisturizer and my foundation all in one. I have used several methods to apply this product, including the IT Cosmetics brush, and the best method I have found is using my fingers. It is very thick, but blends out very nicely. Multi-tasker
