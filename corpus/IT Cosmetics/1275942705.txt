I was unsure how this would work because it’s not like anything I’ve used before to clean my face. It has the consistency almost like a lip balm. You swipe it on your face dry, rub it in, then rinse with water. I was skeptical, but it really works! It gently cleans your skin and leaves it so soft. It has a very light rose scent. I would definitely recommend giving it a try! Skin feels so soft
