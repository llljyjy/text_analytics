I tried Confidence In a Cream Hydrating Moisturizer for 14 days and my skin has never looked so good! This cream melts right into my skin and doesnâ€™t leave a heavy residue. I use it morning and night after cleansing. My old moisturizer would pill up on my face and I hated it. I will definitely be purchasing this product again in the future. My new skin BF
