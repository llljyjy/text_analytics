So glad a Sephora employee recommended this over the FAB hydrating serum! I have combo skin (oily T zone with dry areas around my nose and mouth) and wanted a hydrating serum that didn’t make me feel greasy and THIS IS IT! Sinks in right away, makes my skin look and feel hydrated, didn’t hurt my sensitive skin, and great price point ! I didn’t buy it for wrinkles as I’m 26 but for the hydration and it’s going to remain a staple for me nan
