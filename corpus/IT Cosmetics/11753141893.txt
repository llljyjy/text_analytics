I have been using this for about three weeks and have noticed great improvements in my skin. It looks better, it feels more moisturized, and my makeup goes on better too.  I use it morning and night on my face and neck. It has a nice cooling feeling when going on too. It does have a light scent, like a cold cream scent, but not overpowering. Great product
