I tested a jar of IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream Hydrating Moisturizer for the past 2 weeks.As a guy, This cream had a pleasant scent that any man or woman would enjoy or share. The texture was sort of thick and creamy but still easy to rub into the skin. In the 2 weeks, so far I haven’t seen any improvements but as any skincare products, we all should test the products for a months. My skin does feel smooth but just havent seen improvement in deep wrinkles and that’s the areas we should gives products more time to work its magic.I would definitely keep trying this product but also add the IT Cosmetics Eye Cream. PLEASANT MOISTURIZER FOR ALL SKIN TYPES
