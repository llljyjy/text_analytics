After using this product for two weeks, I can tell that my dark marks have faded and my skin tone is overall more even and smooth. My skin feels firmer and looks brighter compared to the moisturizer I used to use. There is a light lemon scent, so be careful if you are sensitive to fragrance. I have sensitive skin, and this product did not bother me or cause any breakouts. One downfall I can overlook because of how great this moisturizer is is that it sometimes pills if you overwork it into your skin. I have to adjust how much time/how much pressure I use to I apply the product to my skin. I would recommend using an applicator for easier use. Overall, this cream is great and I will continue to use it in the future. Great for uneven skin tone
