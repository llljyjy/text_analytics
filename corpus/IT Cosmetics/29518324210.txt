I have oily skin that is acne prone, but have at times dry patches. So I guess I’m a combo. I rarely wear moisturizer because they always seem to be too heavy and I live in South Florida. This was the perfect product for me and I will be buying it again. It goes on lightweight and works immediately. It’s not a super heavy cream and a little goes a long way. It doesn’t make my skin too greasy or shiny and allows my foundation to go on smooth. great standard moisturizer
