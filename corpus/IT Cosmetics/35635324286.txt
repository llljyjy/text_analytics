This product makes my face red and doesn’t feel as moisturizing as compared to other products I’ve tried. However, it does make my skin soft to the touch all day long. Additionally, my skin has a nice glow to it.I think I’ll stick with my current lineup but I’ll keep using this until I run out. I know others who love this product, I just happen to prefer a different one. Pretty good
