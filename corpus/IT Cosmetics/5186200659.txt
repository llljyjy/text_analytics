IT Cosmetics’ Confidence in a Cream is a great product. The cream is super thick and luxurious, but not greasy. I’m able to use this cream day and night. It leaves my face feeling soft and hydrated. I can’t quite place the smell, but it is fairly neutral and unnoticeable to me. A little bit of product goes a long way, so this tub will last a while. nan
