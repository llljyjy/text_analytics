My skin likes this cream which is hard to find. I have combination skin so a lot of creams either dry my skin out or make it oily and I break out. Since starting this cream my skin has been happy. Not super thick but enough to feel like itâ€™s a great moisturizer. Good smell and a little goes a long way. My skin loves this cream
