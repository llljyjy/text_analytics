This cream is amazing! It has a very light lemon scent to me. I have combination skin and it did not affect that at all. The cream felt very lightweight on my face and absorbed quickly into my skin. It did not leave my skin feeling or looking greasy at all. I am not at the age for wrinkles yet but I love the benefits that this cream provides. I will continue to use this cream and recommend it to friends and family! nan
