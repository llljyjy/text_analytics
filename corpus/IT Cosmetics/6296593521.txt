The IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream Anti-Aging Hydrating Moisturizer smells great! It really hydrates my skin and leaves it soft. The consistency is a litter thicker than I like- I am afraid it may clog my pores. I have been using a exfoliating cleanser to help prevent that. Overall I really like it. Very nice
