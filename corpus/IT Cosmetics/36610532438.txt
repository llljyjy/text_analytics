I really like the thick and creamy texture of this cream. It was very hydrating on my dry skin but was not greasy or oily. It had a fragrance that was stronger than I prefer which irritated my eyes and made them water. Although the fragrance makes it difficult for me to use on a regular basis, everyone has different preferences so it is worth a try. Great texture, strong fragrance
