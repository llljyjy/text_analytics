This makeup melting Balm is soo good. I use it both for Make-up removal and regular double cleansing too. Love the subtle rose scent and I love the fact that it leaves my smooth soft & supple. Such a generous amount of product and little goes a long way. My only complaint is that I wish it came with a little scooper that’s all. Otherwise it’s amazing Excellent
