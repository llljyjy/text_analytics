I love that the Confidence in a Cream moisturizer is a thick yet easily blendable formula. I think the consistency lends it to be a great moisturizer for both summer & winter. Not only have I noticed myself, but I have also received many compliments about how much better my skin looks. My skin is smooth & glowy! I will definitely continue to purchase this product. I have already recommended it to my family & friends. Highly Recommend!!
