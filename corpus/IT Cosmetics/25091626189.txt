This is my first IT product, and I must say, I’m definitelyimpressed with the results I’m seeing after just a scant 2 weeks of using it. I wasn’t expecting much, but it has diminished the fine lines around the apples of my cheeks and is showing improvement in the area of my 11’s, which are much deeper. I love the hydration I get from it, and it layers very well, absorbing quickly. This is definitely a product worth repurchasing, and I cannot recommend it enough, an a little goes a very long way, so it’s cost effective! Fantastic Results
