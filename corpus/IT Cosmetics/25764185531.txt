I really enjoyed using this cream! I received a jar from BzzAgent and love it. It is smooth, rich, and creamy, yet easy to rub in and absorb.  I can wear it alone or mixed in with make up and it does the job My face is smoother, plumper, and more radiant. I have already bought two more full size jars. I am a person that has my make up on-even days I am staying home. I had a headache for a few days and used only this as the base for my makeup-no foundation or BB cream or anything! I put in mascara and a little blush, and looked good enough I didnâ€™t bother with the rest! This stuff is amazing! The Name Says it All
