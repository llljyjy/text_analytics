I received It Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream from bzzagent in exchange for my honest opinion. I have to admit I absolutely love this moisturizer. To me it has a faint scent that goes away quick. I love the texture and how this moisturizer feels going into my skin. I have been using this for awhile now and this moisturizer cream does exactly what it says. My skin is way more plump, my wrinkles are way less hard and visible. This one to me is very comfortable to wear, not to heavy like some. I have no problems or irritation just great results. I highly recommend this. Absolutely Love it
