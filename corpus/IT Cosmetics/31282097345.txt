I absolutely love the packaging â€” the item feels very durable and luxurious. This  cream does leave my skin feeling very soft and moisturized. However, I did notice that the cream burned/stung a little when I applied it, and I noticed I had several breakouts. I do have very sensitive skin though, so this may be a miracle product for those with less sensitive skin. Soft & Moisturized Skin, But Several Breakouts
