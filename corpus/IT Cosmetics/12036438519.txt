This is a very thick cream that feels super moisturizing and sinks in rather quickly. It doesn’t feel oily (I’ve had a few thick creams that were too oily or too heavy on the face). I love using this last in my routine. I did get this free for review. I try a lot of products (either purchase myself, through lifestyle boxes like fabfitfun etc) and this one is really good. It is a thicker cream but it doesn’t feel to heavy or thick to use even in summer. very thick!
