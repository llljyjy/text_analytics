Very luxurious product with a nice heavy jar and silky cream where a little goes a long way. Unfortunately my desert dry skin is very sensitive to sodium hyaluronate and I live in a dry climate so this is not a long lasting moisturizer for me, I dry out by the end of the day even when applying on damp skin. However I think the feel and look of my skin is really nice at first and that most people would love this. The ingredients are excellent and formulation seems very thoughtfully done. I would recommend to those with normal to oily skin, or those who live in a less dry climate of you have dry skin. nan
