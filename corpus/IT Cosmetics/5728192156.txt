I am fascinated by this moisturizer! It really does give me confidence lol. I love that it’s a thick cream yet it absorbs quickly into your skin. I’ve Noticed an huge difference in my pores and my wrinkles in between my eyebrows. As soon as I’m done with this jar I’m ordering a new one. I’m so glad I got to try it and review it because I found my new favorite moisturizer. Thanks bzzagent! My new favorite moisturizer!
