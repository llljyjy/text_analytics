This cream is delightfully rich and nourishing, yet it’s non-greasy and doesn’t feel heavy on your skin, absorbs quickly and provides outstanding lasting hydration. It offers incredible anti-aging benefits and pore care and leaves the skin incredibly soft, smooth, even-toned and radiant. I also love its light citrusy scent, it feels so nice and invigorating in the morning. nan
