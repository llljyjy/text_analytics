I have heard such great things about Confidence in a Cream and this formula is just amazing. My skin tends to be oily and while this is a bit rich, it still feels amazing and absorbs into my skin. I love that my skin feels soft and supple after using this and it has a myriad of great ingredients for anti-aging. Can never start too early. Also, itâ€™s perfect for the winter time! Love this for winter!
