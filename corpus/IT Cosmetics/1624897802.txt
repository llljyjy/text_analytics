I have been using this at least once a day for about 2 weeks now. I havenâ€™t noticed a visible difference in my skin yet; however, I still like it and will finish the product. A little goes a long way, it is very moisturizing and has no noticeable scent. I love hyaluronic acid and squalane and that this is vegan. nan
