Product works well removing makeup. It does not leave my skin feeling greasy at all. It has a light pleasant scent and is easy to use and gentle on the skin. My only issue is that the price seems a bit high for the amount of product. If you hold the jar up to the light youâ€™ll see that it contains a false bottom, and the jar is only about half full.  This is just really misleading. The jar should reflect the amount of product you are purchasing. Works good!
