I love cleansing balms and this one has vitamin C!  It says you can use it as a hydrating mask too, so I used it that way first.  I didn’t notice any immediate improvement, but I did break out a little bit although it’s non-comedogenic (even after thoroughly, and I mean THOROUGHLY, washing it all off)I also noticed that this cleansing balm didn’t come with a scoop, and it doesn’t take off all my foundation.As a cleansing balm, it doesn’t stand out above any of the other brands I’ve tried. It’s not my favorite but I will continue to use it as a first cleanse! Not my favorite
