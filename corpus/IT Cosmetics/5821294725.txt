I thought this cleansing balm was pretty amazing! Not only does the lightweight balm itself melt, this stuff melts even the most resilient makeup easily off my face! I was especially impressed with the speed, effectiveness, and relative ease with which this balm removed my waterproof mascara.  It is the most gentle way to do so that Iâ€™ve ever tried.  IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Makeup: 3-in-1 Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm is extremely hydrating and leaves my skin feeling plumped with moisture, yet perfectly clean.  It reminds me of the cold cream my mom uses and swears by to this day, and she has just absolutely perfect skin for her many years! This balm is not exfoliating in any way, but aside from that aspect, this is literally the perfect cleanser for me! I love it and am switching to this for my everyday cleanser from now on! Gentle yet crazy effective!
