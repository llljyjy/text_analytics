I have dealt with adult/hormonal acne for several years. I have tried Differin, Tretinoin, Spironolactone, and Clindamycin. Although Spironolactone did clear my skin, I didn’t want to rely on a pill. I know everyone’s skin is different but I have been off my prescriptions for about a month and this has kept my skin so clear. I hope it continues. I absolutely love this stuff and would definitely recommend you give it a try if you have acne prone skin! I have not had to use any foundation, and my skin feels soft and looks bright.
