I received a complimentary sample of Confidence in a cream from Bzzagent and IT Cosmetics for my honest use and review.This cream is amazing, it smells mildly so it’s not overwhelming. The jar is heavy so you know you are getting your money’s worth. It is very light, I dab my finger in it and smudge between index and middle finger then apply to face, ooth it out with upward motions and can feel it sibkong into my skin. Does not feel heavy or greese. Hydrates but more of like a water sensation and smooth the wrinkles and diminishes imperfections on the face within a blink of an eye. I have been using it day and night for 2 weeks and csn honestly say I see a huge improvement in wrinkles and age spots. I definetly recomend it to everyone out there, once ypu try it you will not want to use anything else. Trust me, heck better yet prove me wrong and check it out for yourself. Amazing
