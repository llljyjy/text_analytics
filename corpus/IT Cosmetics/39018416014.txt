I felt this cream was just right for me. I have pretty oily skin so I like creams that moisturize but that are NOT super oily and this hit that sweet spot.I thought it did the trick as far as softening and plumping my skin. I would definitely buy this and would highly recommend it to friends and family members. Great product (especially for oily skin)
