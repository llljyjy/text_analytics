I received this complimentary from BzzAgent for a honest review. I have been now using it for 3 weeks and I have seen a noticeable improvement is my skin. It’s more supple and dry patches have improved. Also the wrinkles seem to improving. I love the smells. It’s not oily and easily gets absorbed into the skin. Also it works so well before putting make up. It’s my new favorite my new holy grail
