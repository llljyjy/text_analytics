Thick, rich, and moisturizing, this product made a noticeable difference in my skin after just two weeks of use. It’s a little heavier than I’d usually use in summer, but it does absorb completely into my skin. Only downside is the strong botanical scent and a slight irritation on first application (which I think is related to the essential oils meeting my sensitive skin). All in all, the benefits far outweigh that, and I’m loving this product! Noticeably improved my skin
