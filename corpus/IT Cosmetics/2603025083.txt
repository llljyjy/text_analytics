was given the pleasure to review this cream that I received free with my promise to review honestly. I must have tried a million face creams in my day(Iâ€™m 53)! I am underwhelmed by most of them. This cream is worth every penny in my opinion! It is reasonably priced, has a ton of skin-loving ingredients, and is suitable for ALL times of your routine! I was using a separate cream for day, one for under makeup, and one at night. Then I took this on a long road trip as my only face cream! It performed wonderfully in every usage. It is fast absorbing, making it great for day routines, and under makeup. It did not leave my face greasy, but ever so slightly tacky which made it great as a moisturizer before primer! It did not cause any breakouts, nor did it cause my makeup to break down or appear oily. I used it as a night moisturizer (even around my eyes) without irritation! So it eliminates a need for a separate eye cream(always test on small area to see if it causes irritation first). It is an all purpose super hero, in my opinion! Super cream
