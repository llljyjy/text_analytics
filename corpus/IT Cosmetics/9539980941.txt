I’m a fan of the confidence in a cream anti-aging moisturizer. The formula itself is smooth and easy to apply without leaving a greasy feeling. My skin feels smoother and softer since using it. I have combination skin which is hard to find a good moisturizer for, but this moisturizer leaves my cheeks feeling soft without feeling dry and my T zone, which is usually oily, feeling smooth. I’m also pleased with the mild and pleasant scent of this cream. It’s not too overpowering, but it is refreshing. Overall I would recommend this to anyone looking for a cream that moisturizes, hydrates and keep skin feeling smooth. Smooth application
