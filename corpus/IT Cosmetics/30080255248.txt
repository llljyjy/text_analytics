I am so happy to share my experience with Confidence In A Cream. I have used the day & night cream for 2 weeks and I’m super impressed with the results. First, let’s talk ingredients. This cream contains 4% niacinamide, 3% squalene, and 2% peptide-lipid complex. It’s super creamy! And, it absorbs quickly so you can apply primers and makeup in the morning or oils in the evening. Now, let’s talk about results. In the two weeks that I have used this cream both day and night, I have seen a noticeable improvement in my forehead furrows and in the fine lines in front of my ears. I am extremely happy! Game-Changing Cream
