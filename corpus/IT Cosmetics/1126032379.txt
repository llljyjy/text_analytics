This is a great go-to for days when you need to repair your skin barrier or when you need extra hydration. The texture is dreamy. The claim that it reverses signs of aging is quite lofty. I mean, itâ€™s a face cream, not an injection. It does temporarily plump fine lines and helps my makeup sit well. Mild scent. Silky texture!
