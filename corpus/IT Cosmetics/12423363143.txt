I’ve only used the cream for a little over two weeks now but I’m thinking that I may already see some tiny improvements in my skin’s elasticity and reducing the appearance of some fine wrinkles. The texture is creamy and not too thick. It layers on nicely over an exfoliate and other products. I use it with a drop of a tanning oil and it mixes so well. The scent is also subtle enough that it doesn’t bother me. Just Wow
