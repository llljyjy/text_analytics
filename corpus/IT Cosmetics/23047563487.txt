I love this product! Melting is the perfect word to describe the way it feels when you apply it to the makeup. It feels like the makeup is immediately breaking down. The true test for me was my mascara and it worked great, so much more gentle on my eyes than a makeup wipe. I just rub the product all over my face and use a damp cloth to wipe it off and it is very quick. I will agree with a lot of other reviewers that this product is VERY expensive though. nan
