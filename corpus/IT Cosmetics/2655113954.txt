This product is so super hydrating.  My skin is typically very dry so I love a moisturizer that leaves my skin feeling plumped and hydrated all day long.  A little goes a long way with this product.  Also love using this product at night before bed to give my skin an extra boost of moisture throughout the night.  Added bonus of anti-aging makes this moisturizer a winner in my book! Very Hydrating
