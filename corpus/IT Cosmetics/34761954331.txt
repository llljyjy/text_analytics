I got this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I am not a typically IT Cosmetics fan. Their products usually break me out or just aren’t the right fit for my skin. Not this one! It didn’t break me out and made my skin feel smooth and supple. I like it a lot, actually. Medium weight cream, not too light or too heavy. It’s a great moisturizer for any season, I feel. Try it! I don’t usually like IT Cosmetics, but I love this
