This is one of the best moisturizers I have used in a long time. I have noticed a huge difference in my skin. My skin tone is more even and brighter. My dark spots have faded. My redness has reduced significantly. It did not break me out or irritate my skin in any way. It also didn’t irritate my psoriasis. It absorbed into my skin really well. It didn’t leave my skin too greasy after applying and wearing for several hours. The texture was nice as well. It only takes a little for your whole face. I would definitely recommend it to everyone. Best for anti-aging
