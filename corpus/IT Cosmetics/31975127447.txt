For comparison, this is most similar to the CeraVe cleansers. I got this as part of an It Cosmetics holiday skincare set over a year ago that was being discontinued and hence was on discount. I used it up and enjoyed using it but would I spend the $$$ to buy it again? No - especially for a cleanser. Not bad
