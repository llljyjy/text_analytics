I have combination skin with slight texture and pigmentation around lips. I replaced my night moisturizer with Confidence in a Cream Anti-Aging Hydrating Moisturizer and the results were great! I wake up now with moisturized, plump skin. Texture has considerably improved and pigmentation around my lips has lightened. Though the fragrance is subtle, making it fragrance free will be even better. It spreads effortlessly on skin. One solution for all my skin problems!
