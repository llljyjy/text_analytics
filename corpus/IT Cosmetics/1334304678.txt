I was genuinely curious house this product would compare to Clinique’s version and I’m happy to say it’s just as good! It melts off all my makeup, even my most stubborn mascaras and washes away clean without leaving a film on the skin. I will continue to use this in combination with my regular cleanser, I love it! I’m going to buy this when it runs out and recommend it to all my friends. melts away everything
