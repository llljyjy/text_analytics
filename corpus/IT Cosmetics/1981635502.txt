This  moisturizer feels like it would be perfect for people with dry skin. It’s super moisturizing and leaves your skin feeling smooth an nourished after a single use. Because of this, this moisturizer is a perfect product under foundation. Since I have combination oily skin I have to make sure I don’t use too much or it makes my skin look oily. While I don’t hate the scent it’s not my favorite. If a product is going to have a scent I prefer that it not smell too powdery or florally. In this case I would’ve preferred if it was unscented. You don’t smell it once it’s on your skin though which is why it’s not a huge deal for me.I do like the moisturizer very much and will consider purchasing it depending on how much the texture and tone of my skin improves with continued use. I’ve noticed my skin does feel softer since I started using this moisturizer, however I can’t make any claims as to any improvements in the tone of my skin, as those type of improvements do take a bit longer to appear. But since i don’t need to use very much product to cover my entire face, I do feel I’ll have more than enough product to throughly test it. I don’t prefer products in a jar as they feel more unsanitary than products in a tube. As such, if they changed the container i would be even more inclined to repurchase. Really moisturizing
