Oooh, the product I didn’t know I really needed and would love so much. IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Makeup: 3-in-1 Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm is amazing. This literally melts off even the toughest makeup. There’s really no comparison to other products I have used. This one is great because it removes make up and cleanses the face at the same time. It really leaves my face very moisturized too. The cleansing balm is a product that I will definitely be buying in the future because it really is so timesaving. I don’t need to scrub or rub to even get off the toughest waterproof makeup plus it leaves my face soft with the mask effect. Effective cleansing & makeup removal
