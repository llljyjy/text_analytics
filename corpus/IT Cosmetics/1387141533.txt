The IT Confidence in a Cream Product has become a new favorite cream for me. I thought I was happy with my other competitive cream, turns out there is something better and at half the cost. Upon my first application, I knew this was something special as it goes on the skin very creamy. My first thought was that this was going to sit on my skin and my makeup would wash off in the summer heat. I couldnâ€™t have been more wrong. The cream absorbs into the skin leaving a smooth velvety finish. My foundation stays on perfectly. Since using this product, I have noticed a smoother texture to my skin along with softer fine lines. I might also add that my decollete has never looked better. If I could put this all of my body, I would!! IT Cosmetics does not disappoint
