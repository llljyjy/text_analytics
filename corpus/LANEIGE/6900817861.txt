I don’t even know what to say other than Laneige may have lost me with this one. I’ve been loyal to the WB cream for about 3.5 years and it was my everything. Truly amazing. Gold star. That GIRL! I literally recommended it to everyone I knew and they all loved it. The OG (dark blue) was hydrating, smelled amazing, worked well with all of my other products and most importantly, never broke me out. Then came the middle child (light blue packaging) I coped with this one mostly. It wasn’t terrible. It did what it had to do and I kept purchasing it. But this last one…. I have no words. No thoughts. Actually I do… why? WHY? It’s just NOT IT. This feels tacky on the skin and is just there… giving nothing. It doesn’t feel hydrating at all and the smell is ok????? Then there’s the packaging…actually lol I’m not even gonna address this because I can’t. What were they thinking?? Who was the target demographic? Honestly, please I have to know. I hate to sound harsh but after using something this long, I’m upset! Respectfully, I’m gonna need them to take the L. Who allowed this?
