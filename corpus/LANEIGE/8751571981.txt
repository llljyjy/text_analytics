The newly reformulated version no longer has sodium hyaluronate and cyclohexasiloxane (emollient). It is now formulated with squalene and Lactobacillus ferment lysate (probiotic). I found that this version has a slightly thicker, yet still gel-like texture and takes time to absorb which leaves a slightly tacky feel. It has a much less intense scent of the original sleeping mask. I have oily skin with dry cheeks and found that it helped keep my skin feeling soft and hydrated. It did not break me out and made my skin look glowy instead of greasy whenever I used it. I would recommend to anyone looking for extra hydration in their night time routine and also if the previous formulation did not work! #freeproduct Less fragrance, Helps hydrates and soften
