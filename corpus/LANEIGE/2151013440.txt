Wow. I bought this because the science behind the blue hyaluronic acid sounded interesting. Really impressive how hydrated my face felt. Gel moisturizers have come a long way. I was worried it would only hydrate my skin right after application and I would start to feel tight after an hour or so but nope. This is my personal thought but for oily skin the micro size hyaluronic acid is way more effective because it sinks deeper in skin and sits less on top of skin. Not sure about the mint though, didnâ€™t feel exceptionally cooling. Maybe you would feel it more if you keep it in the fridge. nan
