I have very dry under eyes, in the summer time my skin begins to flake and my moisture barrier under my eyes becomes damaged. I received this eye cream #freeproduct with #trywithtopbox , I used it with my night skin care routine before bed and I have to say it did help repair my dry under eyes, it also kept it hydrated the next day. I loved the consistency and the feel, it was super light weight and didn’t make me feel oily or greasy like other eye creams. I’m giving this product 4/5 stars, one star is missing because the scent wasn’t my favourite. Other than that, a super great cream, especially if you have dry under eyes like me. good eye cream!
