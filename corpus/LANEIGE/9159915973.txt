Laneige gifted me this product complimentary for testing and reviewing purposes. Over time my skin has been changing from oily to combination with a bit of dehydration so I’ve been needing extra moisture on my skincare. That’s where this friend comes to the rescue. When I first used this my skin was inmediately drenched in moisture. My skin absorbed this like a thirsty man in the desert. The next day my skin looked so nice and supple si I love this moisturizer and won’t stop recommend it. Like a thirsty man on a desert!
