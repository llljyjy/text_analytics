My favourite nightly moisturizer! I can definitely tell the difference in my skin in mornings after nights that I wore it vs. after the few nights that I’ve forgotten to put it on. I have sensitive, acne-prone skin so a lot of products cause me to breakout, but this moisturizer is definitely going a long way to prevent breakouts.It is expensive for not a whole lot of product, but I only need a tiny bit per night! The application stick that comes with it helps to make sure I don’t pick up more product than I need. I’ll repurchase again and again and again. nan
