The new packaging is pretty and easy to travel with. It seems a little bulky but I don’t have a problem with it. I have used the old formulation and now the new. I like both versions of this product and found them both to be moisturizing. However, I feel like I prefer the new version more so as night time moisturizer than a day time. It doesn’t provide me with enough moisture for the day but the old version did. I only use this at night, on top of all of my serums and it’s glorious! I wake up with the most amazing skin, The smell is nice but I can do without the little stick since I don’t have a proper place to store it. Really good moisturizer
