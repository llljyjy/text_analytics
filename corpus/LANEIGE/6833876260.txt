the product itself is good, i have the og berry and the vanilla and was so excited when the cherry blossom came out, i bought it right away. but it smells and tastes exactly like the smiths rosebud salve. perfumey for no reason. while i don’t mind the smell so much, i find the taste is pretty gross and that’s why i don’t use the rosebud salve anymore so i can’t see myself reaching for this often to be honest. i will keep it as a back up but am pretty disappointed at how different from the others it is in a bad way. i recommend the product, just not this flavor. just like the smiths rosebud salve *yuck*
