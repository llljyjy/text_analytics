My lips were quite chapped and windburned recently from working outside. I tried using this overnight, and their Lip Glowy balm for maintenance during the day. I was disappointed to realize after a few days of this, it seemed to be making my lips even more dry and irritated. I stopped using these two products and replaced them with Aquaphor and a medicated balm from the drugstore and my lips got better overnight. This mask has nice flavours/scents and lasts a long time. But I would definitely not recommend it for people with very dry lips, especially when there are cheaper and more effective options available. nan
