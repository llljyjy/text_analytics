I am SO sad they changed this formula. It use to be the best moisturizer but it is so drying and has a weird smell now. I’m so disappointed and I’m actually returning it for another brand. I tried to give it a real good try for over a week but just couldn’t stand the new formula. I really hope they bring the old one back. Also the packaging is frustrating because you can’t easily put the top on. Overall I would seriously not recommend this product anymore completely not worth the money and does worse for your skin then better. nan
