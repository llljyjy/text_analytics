Complimentary from Laneige. I love the new packaging the Laneige has done for this line. From the front it looks like a baby blue airpods case. It’s so sleek and modern, I love having it on my table. It also comes with a small plastic spatula that makes it easy to scoop the cream out if you don’t want to use your fingers. As for the cream itself, this isn’t super thick, yet isn’t super thin. It’s just in the middle. I find that during colder days it works pretty well at reducing my skin flakiness. On hotter days it can feel a little heavy for me. I’ve never used the original version so I can’t compare the two, but I really like this so far. Does have fragrance tho, like all of their products do. nan
