I’ve owned basically all of the different flavors that this lip mask has ever been released in. I’m a lip mask junkie. This is the best flavor I’ve ever used of this lip mask, or any other. Occasionally the flavors can be a little lackluster, just not as strong as I’d like for them to be, same with the scent (the peach tea for example). This one is not one of those. The pumpkin spice smell hits you right when you open the container and it is divine. Smells fantastic, tastes the same lol I’m immediately replacing the onenext to my bed with this one. Favorite Flavor Ever!
