Okay Iâ€™m obsessed with all of the laneige lip masks but this one is by far my favorite of them all! It smells SO good and I love that it has a slight color tint to it! I use this morning, occasionally throughout the day and at night! I just feel so complete and so boujee adding this to the end of my skin care routine. 10/10 would recommend this!! Obsessed is an understatement
