Got this as a sample and definitely plan on purchasing the full size. I have very sensitive skin, redness and a lot of dryness and flaky spots, even in summer in humid weather. I’ve been using this daily for a week now and my skin looks fantastic! No irritation, no breakouts, just supple, soft skin. The formula is a little strange - it’s too “milky“ really to use with a pad, but almost too runny at the same time; it’s easy to get too much in your hand and end up wasting product and having the skin end up sticky. Less is more with this product but the consistency makes it hard to get less. I can also say that it is moisturizing, but would really only work on its own in the summer. For right now, in winter, I’m still letting it settle in for 10-15 minutes and going back in with a standard moisturizer. In the summer I think this would layer great on its own under sunscreen. Amazing
