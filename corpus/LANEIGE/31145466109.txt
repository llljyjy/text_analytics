Highly recommend!!! I actually ended up trying this cream by chance when I got it in a Laneige skincare kit. Before this, I had tried a handful of creams, and none of them worked for me. But this cream leaves my skin soft and supple. The formula is lightweight and super hydrating. So, if youâ€™re looking for a hydrating cream that will leave your skin silky smooth, I would definitely recommend getting this cream. Worth it
