Focusing this review on the scent since the formula is consistent with all other permanent lip masks. I was anticipating this to smell super sweet (almost like a mango hi-chew candy) because the other ones I own have that artificial kick to them. However, this smells more like an actual mango fruit... sweet with a hint of sour. If you’re sensitive to fragrance but want to try a Laneige lip mask out, Mango would honestly be perfect because it doesn’t pack as much of a punch as Sweet Candy or Gummy Bear, for example, but it still smells good. I took off 1 star because I personally would prefer if this had more of a sweet Mango candy scent but I have no regrets about the purchase and will definitely enjoy using it during the summer. Great summer scent!
