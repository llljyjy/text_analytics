Idk how long this product has been around but I wish I had discovered it earlier. This skin mist has actually transformed my skin in a matter of days. I was seriously struggling with dry skin/a damaged moisture barrier and nothing was repairing it. I couldn’t find anything moisturizing enough - until I found this. I am SO sensitive to new products. It’s very rare I find any products that my skin likes - I usually break out, no matter if they have fragrance or not. My skin is simply super sensitive & acne-prone. But I have been using this twice a day for ~5 days now and my skin has COMPLETELY cleared up, my redness has reduced, and my skin looks plump & hydrated everyday! I no longer feel like I have a dry, itchy face throughout the day. I spray this all over my face, let it dry, and apply my moisturizer & spf on top and it’s been a game changer. It also looks great under makeup, in my opinion. If your skin is already consistently moisturized, then I could see this stuff being a bit too much & over-moisturizing. But if you have dry skin/a damaged moisture barrier - you need this. Esp if you have acne prone skin and struggle to find products that don’t make you break out. It’s formulated for sensitive skin. The closest I’ve come to finding a product that helps like this one is Krave Beauty’s great barrier relief - but even that product would help me for a couple days, and then I’d have to stop using it because it would break me out in little whiteheads everywhere. 10000% worth the money. I am so happy I found this product! Game changer!
