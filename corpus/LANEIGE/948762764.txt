This cream does exactly what it’s supposed to. I’ve been using this now for four months and have seen an improvement in my skin tone and brightness. It has a lovely texture and smells like citrus. It absorbs into the skin nicely after a couple minutes. I have no problem wearing make up over this cream. I will be re-purchasing this. Delivers
