I live in a very dry, very hot place so my skin suffers a ton from it. This moisturizer has brought life back to my skin! It’s so light weight and leaves my skin feeling soft and silky. My foundation looks amazing too! My only concern is that it does make my face a bit shiny sometimes, like when it’s very humid outside my face becomes super oily but, again, humidity is incredibly rare where I live so this product is perfect for me still Love itt
