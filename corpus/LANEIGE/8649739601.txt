I was disappointed that this product was reformulated again, and I was, frankly, a little nervous after reading the reviews here. I have been using the water bank line since at least 2017, since it is the only skin care I have found that agrees with my dehydrated, sensitive skin. Most things break me out, whether by being not hydrating enough, or by having disagreeable ingredients. I will say, I am not 100% sure on this reformulation. I don’t love the new smell (it reminds me of sunscreen?), but it doesn’t linger too long. It is not as moisturizing (I have to use a little more than on the previous version of this cream). I don’t love the packaging (it feels cheap and flimsy, and the spatula has no tapered end, which makes it hard to clean off).That being said, my skin looks great. So far, I haven’t had any crazy breakouts. So, despite the qualms listed above, I will keep using the Waterbank cream moisturizer. so far, so good (with a few caveats)
