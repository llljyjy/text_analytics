I got this as a gift last Christmas (1year ago) and I must say this is the BEST lip product I’ve ever tried. I use it every night, and I’m only half way through the jar. So it lasts forever. And the product itself is amazing. I wake up every morning with soft hydrated lips, which is something no other product has ever done for me. It smells sooo good. Super smooth, melts into lips and overall so worth it!! LASTS SO LONG!
