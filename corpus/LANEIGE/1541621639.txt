I had heard the raves about this sleeping mask and I was excited about it, but this is one of the most horrible smelling products I have ever seen. It smells nothing like “sweet candy“ but more like some sort of industrial plastic. Just awful. I wouldn’t want it anywhere near my mouth. This is going back for sure. Smells like industrial plastic - yuck!
