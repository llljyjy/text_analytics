While I did receive this as a #freeproduct through #trywithtopbox, I don’t blindly write glowing reviews of products unless I truly loved them. The real disclaimer I need to include is that I’m a huge Laneige fan – everything of theirs that I have used has turned out to be amazing. It might just be that my skin is the right fit for their product line, but I have never been disappointed (the water sleeping mask, lip sleeping mask, vitamin C cream, to name my regulars). Not surprisingly, this eye cream was great for me as well. It’s very lightly fragranced - I know that some people may not like that in their skincare - but it didn’t bother me, was a very lovely scent (particularly as I was using this at bedtime), and didn’t cause any adverse reactions. The consistency is on par with their other Water Bank products – very lightweight and almost gel-like, so it absorbs very quickly, which is much appreciated during the hot and sticky summer months. It’s always difficult to say whether skincare really works – my eyes did seem less puffy in the mornings, but I think I’d need a rougher night in order to truly gauge its efficacy. Given that I always use an eye cream in the evening anyway I’d have no issue sticking with this one in the long-run. I’ve come to trust Laneige and the fact that this contains hyaluronic acid is definitely a plus – even if I can’t see immediate, overnight results, it’s still important to keep that area moisturized and taken care of, even as just preventative care. Bonus points for the very cute and aesthetically pleasing packaging. It’s silly, but this looks Instagram-worthy sitting on the vanity. Also, as with all of Laneige’s products, a small spatula is included for hygienic purposes (big fan of this approach). nan
