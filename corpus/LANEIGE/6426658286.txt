This only thing to save my dehydrated lips! I started new medication last year that gave me a few months of intense night sweats. I would wake up quite dehydrated with cracked lips. This sleeping mask was the only thing that helped. I used it as a lip balm all the time to heal my lips and now I just use it at night time. It has become a permanent staple next to my bed. nan
