#ad #trywithtopbox I received this retinol firming cream treatment to test and review and first of all, I am obsessed with the packaging. It’s so cute that you can’t help but want to show it off on your bathroom counter. I’ve loved every Laneige product I’ve tried so far so I’m not surprised that I liked this one as well. It was actually quite moisturizing and non-drying which I was originally concerned about with trying a retinol given that it’s winter and my skin is already dry. I did not irritate my skin at all and it is scent free which I know is a bonus for many people. Overall so far I feel like this is probably my favorite retinol I’ve tried so far. I look forward to continuing to use it and see what it does for my skin Love Laneige!
