i put this lip mask on every night before i go to sleep & have been seeing pink/purple all over my white pillow cases. i didn’t understand what it was from; even after washing/bleaching, the pink/purple is still there. today i woke up & saw many more spots, i realized that it’s the gummy bear pink/purple lip mask that’s staining my white linens…. love this mask but it keeps staining pillows
