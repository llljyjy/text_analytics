I was fortunate to receive this #freeproduct from #trywithtoobox and I’ve been using it for close to 2 weeks. It comes with a little wooden spoon which makes it wonderful if you find dipping your finger in the cream unsanitary. I love the subtle fragrance as it isn’t overpowering to my moisturizer. I do find that a little goes a long was as it is super hydrating. Great eye cream
