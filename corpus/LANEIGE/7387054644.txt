Like the headline suggests, I waited a year before writing and submitting a review for this sleeping mask. This sleeping mask has done WONDERS for my lips. I initially purchased this hoping it would make wearing lipstick possible. My lip texture just couldn’t support lipstick because my lips would crack under the lipstick. After a few months of wearing the lip mask at night, my lips completely transformed in texture. They don’t peel anymore and they are so soft, and lipstick application is smooth. I’m so impressed.
