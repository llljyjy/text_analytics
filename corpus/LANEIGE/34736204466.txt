Used this for about 2 months now, threw it away today. It’s decent for a balm, but the smell became nauseating after awhile. I don’t feel like it’s worth the price but it does feel nice on the lips and is averagely hydrating. Just doesn’t last very long-it’s not a gloss so don’t expect it to be long lasting and thick. Have to reapply every 30 mins or so if you want the shine to stay wouldn’t buy again
