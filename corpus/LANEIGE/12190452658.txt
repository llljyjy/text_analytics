I’ve been wanting to try this product out ever since it became viral on social media. However, I wasn’t really intrigued by any of the scents until the peppermint one came out recently and decided I’d finally splurge on it! I’ve been using this product for a few weeks now and have used it most nights (enough to know how long it wears and ultimately, enough to review the product with honesty). First things first, I would not consider this an overnight lip mask as it only lasts about an hour/hour and a half (that’s even pushing it) after application. My routine with this is usually to apply it right before I head to bed. I’ll usually browse through my phone/read a book for an hour or so before I actually sleep. Throughout that hour or so, I am usually not talking or doing anything that would cause the product to disappear from my lips, but somehow, it still does not stay longer than the duration I mentioned above. Furthermore, I have not noticed a change in the moisture/hydration of my lips in the mornings after applying this the nights before. At times, I even find that my lips are drier after I use this product. The only components that I enjoy about this product is that it comes with a good amount and the peppermint scent is very refreshing. I find that this lip sleeping mask is only really benefiting me when I want to lather something on my lips to make it slippery and smooth for an hour (like lip balms that don’t have other uses but to make your lips feel smooth in that moment).I would not recommend this product and I will not be repurchasing it. Not what is says it is
