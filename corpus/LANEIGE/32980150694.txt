I love this mask. I have dry lips, I’m always digging at the bottom of my purse for a chapstick. Every once in a while, during the winter, they get so bad that nothing makes them feel better... except this mask. I use it nightly when I need extra moisture, and every few days otherwise. It looks like it’s going to last a long time! Awesome!
