Laneige gifted me this serum and It’s amazing. I love how lightweight and fast absorbing this serum is. It leaves my skin hydrated and has become an essential part of my AM and PM skincare routine. I absolutely love the packaging. Not only will it tell you when you’re almost out of product but it also has a pump which doesn’t allow for bacteria to touch the rest of the product. Although I do wish that it was fragrance free, the smell is not too strong. I love it!
