Itâ€™s hard to find non-gifted reviews for this product which is unfortunate to tell which are honest reviews. I love laneige and loved their prior formulation of this product. This one is great too, very light yet moisturizing, fantastic smell, and great packaging. A great staple moisturizer. really good
