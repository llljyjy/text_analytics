I love this sleep mask and have it in various flavors.  Being a huge peppermint fan, I was thrilled that the peppermint flavor came back this year (I missed out on it last year). But Laneige, where is the peppermint?  This has zero flavor.  The formula is great as usual but there is absolutely no peppermint.  Skip this one and go for Berry or Vanilla. where is the peppermint?
