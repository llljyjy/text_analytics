This is a great cream for the mornings! It really hydrates my very dry skin and brightens my complexion. I thought it may be too thick but it really absorbs nicely and looks great under makeup! It smells really fresh but isnâ€™t overpowering and I love the packaging and spatula! The only con is the price, but it really is a great cream. Great, hydrating cream!
