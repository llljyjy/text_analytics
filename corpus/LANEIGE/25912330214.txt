Really moisturizing! When I finish applying on my lips, I wipe the little residue on my finger on my knees and elbows. Itâ€™s made them really soft LOL. Very tentative guess, but people with drier lips/irritated lips in the morning may have a habit of licking or biting their lips due to the taste/feeling of the mask at night. If so, then applying during the day is wonderful too :) I put this on before my mask and it keeps my lips comfortable throughout a work day. The jar also lasts quite a while, so I will be repurchasing this as a treat. Love it a lot.
