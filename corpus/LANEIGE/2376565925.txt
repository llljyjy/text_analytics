The new mango scent they came out with is not as sweet smelling or even anything noticeable. I was so excited because I have the peach iced tea flavour and I love that so much. This has a subtle natural mango scent to it, and not anything artificial so my nose barely picks up the scent as I’m wearing it. The other lip masks I’ve tried from them have been better scent wise, but if you like something more subtle and aren’t a fan of overly fragrant products, I’d recommend it. The formula will always be my favourite and definitely worth the hype, but even their original berry scent is better than this. Mango is a disappointment
