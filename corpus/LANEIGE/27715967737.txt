Excited to share my thoughts on the Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Serum that I was recently gifted by Laneige in exchange for an honest review. I am someone who loves to include a good hyaluronic in their skincare routine, so this was a treat for me and my sometimes temperamental skin! The serum comes in a very sleek, modern packaging with a lovely light blue color motif and with a unique pump where you twist the top to then dispense the serum. The serum itself is lightweight, but feels instantly hydrating on the skin. It absorbs like magic and has kept my skin looking and feeling quite plump, supple and hydrated when applied both morning and night. It is slightly tacky prior to absorbing completely, but is temporary and once the product sinks into the skin it just feels supple and smooth. Packed with peptides, green tea enzymes and blue hyaluronic acid, it helps not only to hydrate the skin, but also creates a more firm appearance (remember that plumping I mentioned!) and a more smoother complexion overall. It even has a nifty indicator on the back of the bottle to let you know when youâ€™re running low on product and need to reorder. I have quite liked adding this serum to my routine and find it effective, lightweight and gentle enough to recommend for any and all skin types looking to add a hyaluronic to their regimen. Wonderfully hydrating and smoothing!
