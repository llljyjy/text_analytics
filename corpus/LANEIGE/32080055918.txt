The serum works really well on my skin. Usually I use it in the night time. Right after I put it on, my skins feels so moisturizing and soft. Then I apply the face cream. By the way, the packaging looks very high quality too and I love the pumping head. Very easy to use. Itâ€™s also a great gift for the one you love. The serum is complimentary from Laneige. Love it
