Upon trying this cream for the first time, I was immediately satisfied with how it felt on my skin. I wore it overnight and the next morning, my skin seriously felt pillow soft. It has a cold cream texture to it so it’s on the thicker side but it melts into your skin really quickly and doesn’t feel sticky at all. This is a product I’ll definitely be reaching toward often, though it might a little heavy for summer time, I think it’ll be perfect in colder months or as a hydrating cream after a long day at the beach or in the sun. Surprisingly soothing, great for pillow soft skin
