This is gifted by Laneige for my review. I’m in love with this moisturizer! Honestly everything I’ve tried from Laneige has been great! I have combination skin and need an non-oily moisturizer in the winter but gives me enough hydration throughout the day. This is it! Feels super comfortable on my skin and goes well with my makeup too. Highly recommend! Love it
