I recently received the Laneige Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Cream moisturizer complimentary from Laneige to test in exchange for my honest review and I’ve been thoroughly enjoying the product. #freeproductI’ve used the original version of the Water Bank Moisturizer before, which I absolutely love and this new and revamped version is even better. The packaging of this whole entire line is also really stinking cute (you best believe I’m already eyeing other products in this line). It’s a beautiful pastel baby blue colour with pops of pastel dusty pink accents (i.e. the spatula), and it honestly looks so good on my vanity.The cream is quite thick, but I feel not as thick as the original formulation, which I like even better, as I can use it in warmer weather as well and doesn’t feel heavy on the skin.The product is scented, but it is quite light and subtle which I personally do not mind.I’ve been using this product regularly everyday in the am and pm after cleansing, toning and a serum and my skin has honestly been feeling and looking very moisturized, hydrated and smooth throughout the day, providing me with deep levels of hydration. I would highly recommend this moisturizer. New favourite moisturizer
