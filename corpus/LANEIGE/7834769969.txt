I received the Essence, from Topbox, in exchange for an honest review.I really liked the scent and consistency of the essence. It went on nicely and didn’t leave a greasy residue. People noticed a difference in my skin after only two days of use. It’s well worth the price and I’ll be purchasing it in the future. nan
