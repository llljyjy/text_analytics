I received this complimentary. I was excited to receive this and I was ultimately disappointed. Aside from shipping issues the product finally arrived. Super cute container, also comes with tiny scoop spatula thing. Smell is citrusy but mild. I have combo/dry skin. Meaning its combo but it leans more to the dry side.  Applying is easy and this product is super moisturizing so a little goes a long way.   It did moisturize and it did brighten my skin, however I’m really upset that after using this I’ve been extremely oily for about a week now. And i only used it twice. Hate the change. So imma have to give it a 2. Disappointed
