Iâ€™m a guy and really picky about toners/moisturizers. I want something quick I can put on before my sunscreen and this checks almost everything. One huge benefit: it doubles as a eye cream. It glides over my under eye area without any tugging and pulling and I feel a huge difference in my eyes the morning after. Also AMAZING as Eye Cream
