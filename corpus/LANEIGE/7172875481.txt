I was gifted by Laneige. I’m a huge fan of the water sleeping mask and this gives me a great feel too! It’s less intense than that in my opinion. It is very hydrating and leaves a glowing look. The thing that won me over is the packaging! It’s so sleek and easy to use. It lets you know when you need more. Hydrating!
