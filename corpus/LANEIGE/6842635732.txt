One of my new fav products. I got a free sample and I had to get a larger bottle of my own. It goes on so smooth and feels luxurious on the skin. I use it about every other night and I’m happy with my results. My skin feels moisturized a smoother after only the first night. I’m sure this isn’t a Miracle product so make sure you’re still taking other steps to take care of your skin. Highly recommend this will be included in my skin care buys from here on out . You also get a lot of product for the price so I think it will last pretty long nan
