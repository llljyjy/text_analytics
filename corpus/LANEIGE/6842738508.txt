I’m so disappointed they changed the formula and packaging. This new formulation is extremely drying to the skin compared to the old version and the scent/fragrance is overpowering to the point where it feels like I’m putting cheap perfume on my face. The new packaging is cute, but it’s plastic which is a downgrade to the old glass jar it previously came in. Too Drying and Strong Fragrance
