This is the new rebranded version of the old Water Bank Moisture Cream, which I believe is now discontinued and replaced with this new formula with hyaluronic acid. I tried this new formula out at Sephora bc I ran out of my old one and do not like this new one unfortunately, it’s just not the same :(. It’s slightly thinner and greasier I guess? And it’s totally unscented now, comes it a cheaper plasticy container and they’ve raised the price. I loved the old version! The old one, the smell reminded me of the spa and the glass container made it feel more luxurious and I felt like it was worth the price. Idk why they always feel like they have to change a good thing! If it ain’t broke don’t fix it! Lol, Needless to say I’m on the hunt for a new moisturizer. Considering one of the Tatcha ones. They’re a little more expensive but at least the quality matches the price! If you didn’t like the scent of the old Laneige water bank cream you might like this one? Idk  I just feel like it’s not worth the price anymore. Not as good as the old version water bank cream
