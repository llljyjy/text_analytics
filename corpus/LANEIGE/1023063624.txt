I received a travel-size jar of this product complimentary from Sephora as part of my birthday gift and it is amazing! This sleeping mask is so hydrating and leaves my skin unbelievably soft! This lightweight gel-like cream absorbs nicely. I use it several times per week as a mask, leaving it on overnight. In the morning, my skin feels velvety soft and smooth with a newfound suppleness and luminosity. I absolutely love this sleeping mask and highly recommend it. nan
