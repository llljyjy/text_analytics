When I heard that Laneige was releasing a retinol skincare product, I could hardly contain my excitement - being such an avid enthusiast of this ingredient! After using it for the last few weeks, I’ve come to understand that its potency is remarkably high which means you don’t need to use too much at once. Applying it 2-3 times weekly has already yielded incredibly visible results in terms of skin improvement and appearance. nan
