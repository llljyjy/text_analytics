This product comes with a twist top easy to use pump that is a gel like Cream and very lightweight and becomes watery when it is worked into the skin. It absorbs quickly and doesnâ€™t feel sticky and gives a nice dewy look. It provides long lasting hydration and after using this product for 2 weeks my complexition is pretty well evened out. Lightweight and Fresh
