Feels great, not at all waxy like so many balms, which I hate. It doesn’t just sit on my lips like a weird coating. Also, it has nice, soft taste/scent and is really moisturizing. I’m using it as a regular balm and it fixed my chronically chapped lips. I got this as a sample and am going to grab a full size. It’s fun to find something new and good! My lips love this
