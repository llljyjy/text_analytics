This brand is becoming my favorite brand I swear! It’s so soft and gentle on the skin without all the harsh chemicals and fragrances. It keeps your skin hydrated glowing and healthy. Once I heard about this sunscreen I just knew I had to get it. It doesn’t leave you with white cast or super greasy but  you can put it on under your makeup, and it keeps you protected from that hot sun. This is perfect for all skin types and you only need a small amount too! perfect for the summer!
