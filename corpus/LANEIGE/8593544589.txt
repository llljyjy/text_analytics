I received a gift card to select a product of my choice, I love the Laneige lip mask so I really wanted to try more products from them. I have sensitive & dry skin so I thought this product would be a good fit for me. It definitely hydrated my skin, but I felt like it was too lightweight for overnight. It works best for me when layered on top of my usual moisturizer. I started out using it every night because it gives my skin such a beautiful glow but it started to clog my pores so I decreased it to twice a week and that has been working so well for me. Iâ€™m a medical esthetician so I mostly stick with medical grade products but this will definitely be a regular part of my routine! nan
