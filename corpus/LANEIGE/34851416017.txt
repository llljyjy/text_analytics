Looking for that extra hydration during winter? Look no more! This product works WONDERS when it comes to giving you extra moisture and to seal all your products in before your beauty rest. It has a nice consistent texture and it absorbs real good. The smell is very delicate and soft, like white flowers. It’s an excellent hydrator! Once applied to my skin, it’s instantly absorbed and provides a nice shield to keep all my other products on and working! The next morning I’ve found my skin will plump and hydrated with this beautiful glow that honestly seems to last all day!! Easily, this has become my #1 sleep mask. I will definitely buy again and so should you!! oh and the size... seeing as you don’t need much, this is going to last a long time!!!I received this Water Sleeping mask from TopBox circle #freeproduct . Great Sleeping mask
