I really LOVE this product.  LOVE!  I have very dry skin and live in a dry climate.  I’m pretty good at keeping my skin hydrated, but I was having issues finding a balm that kept my lips soft and hydrated.  This is when Lineage entered the chat.  I initially received this as a sample, and love it so much that I bought a jar.  It has consistently kept my lips soft, smooth and I wear it all day and overnight.  I cannot recommend this product more.  If your lips are constantly flaky and dry, you’ve just found your solution.  Try this, you’ll thank me later. Heals My Very Chapped Lips Overnight!
