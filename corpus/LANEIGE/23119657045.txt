Love this mask! It gives a plump to the lips and it is super moisturizer! It says it’s a sleeping mask but I use during the day by itself or on top of a lipstick. It is different than a gloss because it seats on your lips and it can get sticky. Doesn’t bother me. A little goes a long way. Love it! super plump!
