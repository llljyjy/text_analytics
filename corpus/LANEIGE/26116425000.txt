After reading the reviews and struggling with dry patches, I bought this and I’m so happy I did! It truly goes hydrate the skin when you press it in with your hands, i couple it with a hyaluronic acid while it’s still damp & it’s really improved my skins hydration! I haven’t noticed anything else, but it only claims to hydrate so I’m happy with the outcome so far! hydrating!!
