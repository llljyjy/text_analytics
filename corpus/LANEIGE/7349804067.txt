Smells yummy and feels very luxurious on the lips. But I cannot say this has been a game changer for me. I do like the idea of using a lip mask in my routine, but like others have said my lips aren’t all supple in the morning or anything crazy like that. They’re still dry, just not AS dry as they would be if I didn’t use this. Maybe that’s just an issue for people with drier skin types? I’d actually recommend using this as more of a lip balm throughout the day instead since it makes your lips look plump and juicy when it’s freshly applied. better as a daytime lip balm?
