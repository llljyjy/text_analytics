This is exactly what my skin was asking for. I have normal to dry skin which has a tendency to break out with heavier creams. I have noticed some slight dry patches and have been using this water sleeping mask nightly over my usual moisturizer. I’m VERY happy with the results so far... no breakouts and this has given my skin the added moisture boost without feeling sticky or heavy. My makeup has been going on more smoothly the next day also. Highly recommend! I will repurchase in the future... GET THIS!! ❤️
