Not the worst moisturizer I’ve used and it doesn’t break me out but it’s not amazing either. The old formula was what got me into buying Laneige products. I don’t understand why they reformulated the Water Bank Cream when the old one worked great. I find myself having to apply more with this one compared to the old formula. It has a matte “finish” when it fully absorbs into the skin, I preferred the previous which gave me a dewy look. Please bring back old formula
