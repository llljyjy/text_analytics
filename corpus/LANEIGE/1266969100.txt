I am truly in love with the lip sleeping mask; I have tried the berry, gummy bear, gingerbread, peppermint, the limited edition set which had lemon sorbet, mint cocoa, and sweet candy. A lot of the reviews are saying it didnâ€™t work for them, I understand everyone is different but some may be using a lot of product; a little does go a long way and it last you a long time.
