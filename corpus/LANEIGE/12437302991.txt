This is the best product I have ever used on my lips. I used to use the agave lip mask by another brand, I’m sure you know what one I’m talking about. This gives your lips that same juicy look but actually keeps them hydrated and smooth the next day without having it on still! It smells like literal gummy bears and has a little wand that comes with it to apply the product so your hands don’t get sticky. Most lip products I get nervous about getting on the skin around my mouth in fear of it causing pimples but I tested it with this product and it did not cause any breakout whatsoever. I just moved to a new climate so my skin and lips have been dry and in need of a miracle and this product is exactly that! A miracle! I couldn’t recommend it enough. Best lip product on the market
