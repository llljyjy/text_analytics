I liked the sample of this so I bought the full size. I like the packaging, built in applicator, and the shimmer in this product for daily wear, but it has dried my lips out badly with continued use. In my opinion, the lip mask from Auric Cosmetics does way more for my lips, has a beautiful color, smells amazing, has a beautiful applicator and built in mirror for just a few more dollars, and I’m disappointed that the $25 I spent on this didn’t go to a new one from Auric Cosmetics lol Drying
