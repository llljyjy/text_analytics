Received this as a #freeproduct to try in exchange for an honest review. Overall I would not recommend this product. Pros: Packaging prevents spills, lightly scented, serum is lightweight and non irritating. You get a decent amount of product in the bottle. Cons: Packaging is incredibly wasteful and nonrecyclable. Product is nothing amazing, a much more affordable hyaluronic acid could do the same thing. Product is pricey and doesn’t really add anything to the companion cream. I used this on with the water bank cream and didn’t find it improved hydration beyond what the cream already did on its own. nan
