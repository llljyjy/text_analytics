This is not the Laneige cleanser that I thought I was ordering, but maybe they have discontinued the one in the travel size that I have used before. After a few weeks of use, I am quite pleased with this product, its gentle and you donâ€™t need to use a lot.  The downside is that it smells like your great-grandmothers old bar soap that she used, otherwise I might have given it 5 stars. nan
