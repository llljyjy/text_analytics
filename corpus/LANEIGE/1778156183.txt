I had high hopes for the new version since I loved the old one so much. Unfortunantly, this cream feels so much heavier on the skin. I normally donâ€™t break out, but after two nights using this, I had pimples show up on my chin and forehead and this was the only thing I changed. Super bummed with this new formula. Will be returning. Disappointing new formula
