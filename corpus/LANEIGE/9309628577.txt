So hydrating without making my skin oily (I have combination skin) and my skin has never been so supple and soft. I’d received this as a sample and bought the larger size. I break out pretty easily and I have had no issues since using this (in fact, it’s my best skin in years!)Super light, not tacky, and I use it in the am and pm! am&pm light, supple moisturizer
