Gifted by Laneige. This is an incredibly hydrating and soothing sunscreen. The formula goes on smoothly and feels very emollient. Love the addition of cica in it for the added calming benefits. It does look very dewy on my dry skin by the end of the day, so if you have oily skin, keep that in mind. Very hydrating
