i recieved this serum as a #freeproduct from topbox. I love Laneige so I was so happy to get to trythis serum. I have combo to dry skin and was looking for a new serum to boost hydration. this serum is lightly scented but it didn’t seem to upsetmy slightly sensitive skin. It sank in quickly but did leave my skin slightly tacky. My skin’s hydration was definitely improved after a week of use. I will continue to use this serum, but am not sure yet if I would repurchase. Hydrating serum from Laneige!
