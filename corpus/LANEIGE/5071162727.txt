Not worth it. I love Laneige and this a great glossy balm that does the job, however it’s nothing special and it’s only lightly moisturizing. I got Peach but it doesn’t smell like anything at all. What’s the point of having scents when they don’t even have a scent or a flavor? This is just an unscented, orange-colored lip balm. I returned this so fast. I may try a different scent to see if those are actually scented. nan
