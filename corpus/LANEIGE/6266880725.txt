I picked this up because I love the Lip Sleeping Mask but I wanted something a little more portable. The original lip sleeping mask has a tiny spatula which is cute but is inconvenient and unsanitary to store when not in use. This is not quite as thick as the original and is more akin to a gloss. It is hydrating and feels good on dry lips, but it disappears quicker than the original and doesn’t have quite as much cling on the lips. Because of that, I feel like I have to reapply more often. I do really like the grapefruit flavor, but I love grapefruit flavoring to begin with. Overall, it’s a good product that I would recommend if you are looking for a hydrating gloss. I removed one star because I expected the formula to be closer to the original, since it was marketed as a more portable version of the original. Portable, lighter version of original
