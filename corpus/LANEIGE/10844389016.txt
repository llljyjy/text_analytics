This product sucks. I wanted to love it! Specially after seeinf this is what Karol G uses and it leaves her lips beautiful. It made my lips super super super dry! I kept an eye on my lips after every application, and it seemed that it made my lips worst every time. Now I have blisters and irritated lips. Could be due to my sensitive skin. As I said, I wanted to love it, but it didnâ€™t work out. I do not recommend.
