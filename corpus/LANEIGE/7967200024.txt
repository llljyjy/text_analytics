I tried this product randomly and I am so glad. It is the best. I wear it all day and night because it leaves my lips so smooth. I have small, thin lips naturally and there are a lot of “cracks” so I am constantly putting on chapstick. This stuff lasts all day, the scent is not strong, child like or over powering. My lips feel so hydrated and refreshed when I wake up. Since I typically wear acrylics and the product likes to get under my nails, I’ve found using a Q tip to apply is the best way for me. A little goes a long way and this will last a long time! This and the water mask (blue ombre bottle) are my two go-to’s, can’t live without, every day uses! 110% worth the price. A MUST HAVE
