I received this product for free  from Topbox #freeproduct. I have been using it every other night for about 3 weeks now ( however will begin to incorporate it nightly).  I love that this product has not caused irritation or dryness as some retinol products typically do. I apply it every other night as my last step in my nightcare routine. After three weeks of use, I noticed that my skin is firmer, hydrated, and the lines under my eyes arenâ€™t as noticeable.   The packaging is premium and the cream has a very subtle scent. The formulation absorbs very well into the skin and is not tacky or greasy. This product is gentle on the face and is a must try if you are looking for a gentle retinol.  Thank you Topbox! gentle and effective!
