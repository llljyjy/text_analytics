This did not make my lips hydrated or soft. It was just a thick coating. The joie de vivre lip balm from it cosmetics which I received as a complimentary gift is amazing. My lips feel so hydrated and smooth- no lines, with that one, which is better than the Laneige and the sugar lip balms. Pretty Disappointing
