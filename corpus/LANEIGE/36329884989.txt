I received this product from #trywithtopbox and this is a fabulous product. 1st off it comes in this cute bottle in orange colour. I have applied this product every night for a week to my skinand my skin looks so bright, smells sooo good and fresh. I suffer from dry skin which tends to make lose my confidence...this cream is awesome it has hydrated my skin right from my 1st use and made my skin so plump and lively. What I love MOST of this product is that it has vitamin c and antioxidant rich acai berries, which I think for me is a plus. this cream has softened my skin appearance and brightened it.if you are looking for a hydrating trusting skin enhancing product give it a try....u will like me fall in love with this product brightened textured skin everyday now!!!
