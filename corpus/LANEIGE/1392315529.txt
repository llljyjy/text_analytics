The only thing that keeps my lips hydrated in the winter. I put this on at night and don’t need to use any other lip balm throughout the day. I used the vanilla scent prior to this one, and both smell great! I was worried this one would be too sweet, but it’s super subtle, and I don’t taste it at all after I apply it. Definitely worth the price, especially since it’s the only thing I use and it lasts so long! Best lip balm
