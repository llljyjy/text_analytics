These lip masks smell nice and look pretty but they do not hydrate lips at all. The lip mask just sits on top of your lips, does not absorb at all. I would put it on at night and wipe it off in the morning and there would be absolutely no difference. This product has a lot of hype, but if you actually want to hydrate your lips overnight try something else. I would recommend the ’Fresh Petal Rose Lip Cream’, that one actually hydrates! No Results
