This is great stuff.  Small jar seems to last a long time.  I only use it at bedtime, wake up with the softest lips.  Next time might buy another flavor but I like the original so much I don’t know if I will!  Have tried another brand lip mask sample size when I was out of town and it was meh.  When I first tried laneige as a sample I wasn’t a huge fan because it’s a bit sticky or goopy feeling but my amazingly healthy morning lips are brilliant.  Ten stars. Ten stars.  Is that a thing?
