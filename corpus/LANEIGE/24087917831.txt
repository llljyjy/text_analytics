I received this product from Topbox free of cost in return for my honest opinion..I have been using this product for almost 2 weeks now . I really love how supple my skin felt in the morning . During this time of the year itâ€™s hard for me to keep my skin hydrated but this product helped a lot . I like the packaging and easy to use . I would definitely repurchase it again . Great
