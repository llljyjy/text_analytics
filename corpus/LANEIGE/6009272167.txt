I absolutely adore this moisturizer! I have oily skin that is sensitive to the changing weather and dry air. I also use tretinoin which causes my skin to peel and become sensitive. I use this after all my other nighttime skincare and it’s a wonderful barrier that really locks in moisture. The first morning after using this cream I woke up to the most beautiful supple skin I’ve ever had. Not oily in the slightest and my pores were itty bitty.  I’ve even used this in the morning before applying makeup and it doesn’t interfere with my foundation and my makeup still lasts all day. I have the trial size now but I’ll definitely be purchasing the full size! Supple & Soft
