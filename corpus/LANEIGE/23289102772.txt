I’m only giving it a star because I really thought it gave my lips a cute shine. However after using it consistently, it dried out my lips to the point they were tight and dried out.I started using it more frequently because obviously I thought it would help but even after a week they never got better. Eventually my top lip started peeling. When I brought it up to my mom, she said the same thing happened to her when she bought the glowy balm and gave me aquaphor so I could give my lips a break and let them heal.Since I still have a lot left over, I’m going to use it sparingly once my lips heal. It’s just disappointing because it’s supposed to provide hydration so for it’s price I’d say there are better things out there. Dries out your lips so use it sparingly
