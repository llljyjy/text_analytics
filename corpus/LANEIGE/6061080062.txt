AMAZING!! I have tried so many different sunscreens (I live in Texas) and this is the only one that 1) doesn’t break me out 2) doesn’t leave a white cast 3) that I can wear under my makeup everyday and it doesn’t pill!! 4) has a high enough spf where I don’t get burnt. I have combination skin but oily in the T-zone and it doesn’t make me feel too oily and moistures! nan
