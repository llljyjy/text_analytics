Not impressed at all. I use to use the Peter Thomas Roth cloud moisturizer and switched to this because it was cheaper. I regret doing so because although this was fine for my skin, it barley did anything. It did not absorb well into my skin and often my skin as left very dry. It is also very fragrant which was annoying. I would definitely recommend spending the extra money and going with the Peter Thomas Roth cloud moisturizer. I just ran out of this and decided to get the PTR one and wow have I noticed a difference just within a day of switching back. So I am disappointed I wanted so long. Doesn't do anything and is sticky!
