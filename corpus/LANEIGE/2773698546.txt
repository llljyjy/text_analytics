I’ve been enjoying this cleanser but it definitely leaves my face pretty tight afterwards so I wouldn’t say it’s one of those “gentle“ type of cleansers. I wouldn’t use it in the morning either. It works pretty well for days when I need to take off makeup or remove sunscreen, etc. It’s fairly fragranced but I find it pretty pleasant so I don’t mind it. In fact, I like it when it can get rid of the icky sunscreen scene that’s so hard to clean off sometimes. Overall I would recommend. Cleans well but leaves face tight
