I used the old formula for water bank moisturizer and this one is does not even compare. I put it on at night and by morning my face feels very dry. If I put it on in the morning my face feels dry mid day. This never happened with their old formula. Their old formula was so good I wish they would bring it back. My face would always feel moisturized all throughout the day without re applying. bring back the old formula
