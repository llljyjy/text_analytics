I was excited to try this, but now that I have I’m not impressed. The scent is definitely not gummy bear - it’s just chemically sweet smelling. I like that the formula is thick, and it feels great when I first apply. The directions say to wipe the leftovers off in the morning; however, there’s never been any leftover product on my lips when I wake up in the morning. My lips don’t look or feel any more hydrated after consistently using this product than they do when I use the Vaseline brand lip balm, and for the price I will absolutely stick to the drugstore stuff. nan
