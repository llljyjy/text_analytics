I absolutely LOVE this lip mask. I use it at night (or sometimes when I have a face mask on doing some skin care me time.) My lips feel amazing in the morning, I wake up with my lips hydrated and not cracking (which is a big deal during the winter.) It smells great (I havenâ€™t tried the other scents but I am excited to eventually!) I love the applicator, and it cleans up well. Will definitely be buying again once the container I have is all done! My Favourite Lip Mask!
