This is by far one of my favorite toners! I use this every night before bed and wake up with glowing skin. I pour a few drops into the palm of my hand, rub between both hands and pat onto my face and neck; sometimes I apply 2 layers if Iâ€™m wanting extra hydration. I have acne prone skin and have not had any problems with break outs while using this product. nan
