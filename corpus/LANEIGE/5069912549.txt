The Laneige lip sleeping mask, put simply, can’t be beat... or at least I have yet to find something come close. You know how most lip masks/chaps that are pretty good, are more or less comparable to vaseline? This one isn’t. It’s in a lane of it’s own.... and better. Not as thick, not as greasy, melts in faster, and of course... has a great smell! Don’t get hung up on the “sleeping“ part. This is good for all day. A must have!
