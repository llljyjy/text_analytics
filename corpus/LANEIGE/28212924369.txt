I got this as a #freeproduct from #tryitwithtopbox and its been pretty good! I’ve never really tried Laneige products but I do find this quite moisturing for my finicky skin. It has a nice lightweight texture that doesn’t make your skin feel oily after using it. It’s more on the pricier side than what I would usually pay for though hence the 4 stars. nan
