I received the Laneige Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Cream Moisturizer complimentary from Laneige for my review. The cream is very rich for my skin and helps instantly moisturize my skin and replenish moisture into my skin to reveal supple and smooth skin. The cream has sort of a strong fragrance which smells like flowers but I really like the scent because it smells like freshly cut flowers. The cream does not leave my skin feeling heavy at all and is perfect for when I apply makeup over it too which does not leave any pilling. I can use this cream during the day and night which helps improve the texture of my skin from being rough or dry in areas of my skin. Smoother and Softer Skin
