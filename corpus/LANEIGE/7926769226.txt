This toner is a staple in my routine. It is so hydrating and lightweight at the same time - I really don’t think there’s anything comparable to it in the market right now. Also, it’s such a great deal! I’m still using the same bottle with about a quarter of it left after using it twice a day for almost a year now, so it’s definitely worth the price in my opinion. A must-have!
