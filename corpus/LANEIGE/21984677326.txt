This is a great sleeping mask! A little goes a long way. I have extremely sensitive and extra dry skin and this works great for me without irritation. I received a sample size in a gift and I will be purchasing the full size today. Very dewy glowy skin the next morning and my face is incredibly soft. Would definitely recommend to those with similar skin types. Great for dry sensitive skin!
