This product was my SAVIOUR when I was on accutane! I would use this at night and the tube version during the day and no product other than lanolin could compete, but the flavour and practicality of the Laneige beat out Lanolin every time. I do think they could improve their packaging, as the applicator would get a bit gross and sticky and there wasn’t anywhere to put it. Also, be careful wearing this at night, as it stained my boyfriend’s shirts a few times while I was sleeping! Overall a fantastic product. So hydrating while on Accutane
