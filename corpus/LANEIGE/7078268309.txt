I received this #freeproduct for review and I am absolutely in love! I’ve been using it every night for the past 2 weeks and my skin has never been so glowy and clear! I apply a pretty thin layer 15 minutes before bed and I haven’t gotten any transfer. Reminds me of slugging without the mess. There’s no overwhelming smell which I love. It’s a good price for value, a little goes a long way! Perfect for the winter weather. I will 100% be purchasing again and again. New favourite!
