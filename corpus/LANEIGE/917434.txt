I received this product complimentary from Laneige. I’ll admit, I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with moisturizers. Most of the time, I need one, but I absolutely hate for my skin to feel or look greasy or sticky, which most seem to do to me. I was therefore a little nervous trying this cream out, but I definitely did not need to be! I LOVE it! The water bank cream comes in the cutest blue squared package with a spatula for application. There is a light clean-floral scent. The cream felt fairly thick but sank right into my skin with absolutely no greasiness, stickiness, or shine, just bouncy soft skin. My skin has felt soft and hydrated all day and I can keep my hands from touching my cheeks! I’m definitely going to pick up more water bank products. Bouncy soft skin!
