I like this new retinol from Laneige , since it did not dry out my skin or cause any flaking or peeling. My skin is fairly sensitive and other retinols I have used I have caused my skin to dry out. This has not been as effective for me and stronger retinol since I donâ€™t know the strength of it but I would recommend this product. I did feel like my acne scars lightened after using this but not much wrinkle reduction. nan
