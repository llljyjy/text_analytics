I was really excited to try this because I’m obsessed with the old formula. When this one came out I immediately bought it even though I had just bought the ‘old’ formula a week before. This is a decent moisturizer but does not compare to the original. It doesn’t spread as far on the skin and more importantly doesn’t make my skin feel as moisturized as the old one did. Huge bummer bring back the old formula!!!!
