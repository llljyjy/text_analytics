Complimentary from laneige but 100 % my honest review I love this serum more than I though I would. I only need 1 to 2 pumps to get really hydrated skin. It absorbs so quickly into my dry skin it really does make my skin feel smooth and hydrated all day long. I usually use it in the morning because I love how it makes my skin look and feel hydrated. I really recommend for someone who wants a hyaluronic acid that will really give you hydration. Definitely a serum worth trying
