I had the original berry one of these and I loved it! It made my lips so soft. So I bought a holiday kit with ginger snap and mint minis which were garbage. Stank to high heaven and didn’t moisturize at all. Bought this scent/flavour for my nine year old who was suffering badly cracked lips and hated the tingle of mint. It worked okay for a bit….now we’ve both noticed that it makes our lips look real pretty when it’s on (nice shine and colour) but when it starts coming off, it’s so drying that I start picking. I prefer to use a vitamin E o from the first aid section, actually. My phone wouldn’t let me see what I was typing
