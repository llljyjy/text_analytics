I was excited to try the new formula since I was in love with the previous one; it’s not bad but it’s nothing amazing… I find some days it actually stings when I put it on, which is not something I ever experienced with the previous formula. unfortunately I’m not likely to purchase this one again, which is a bummer as I love Laneige products. really wanted to love the new formula…
