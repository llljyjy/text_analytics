I was so excited when I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox!! I mostly use this at night along with the cream. If feels really fresh and soft on my skin. I had some serums irritate my skin and make it feel like it was burning, but this hyaluronic serum make my skin feel refreshed and moisturized. Iâ€™ve been using it for a few weeks so far and it works well with my other products. Would Definitley purchase once my bottle is out. 11/10 for me!! Fresh and plump!
