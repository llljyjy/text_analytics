I’m sad! I really liked the highlighted ingredients, so decided to give it a try. The fragrance is what isn’t working for me. I think this would be an excellent moisturizer if they removed the fragrance, or at least offered a fragrance free option for those of us with sensitive skin. Not good for sensitive skin :(
