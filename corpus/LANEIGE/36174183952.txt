I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox.I used LANEIGE Radian-C for 10 days now and it is amazing. I started only in the mornings with my sunscreen and then started using it in the evenings too as indicated in the box. Usually vitamin C are not for me. they make my skin look darker than it is. I tried and failed years ago and just accepted it’s not part of my skin care routine.I was excited to try it this time because it’s a free product. I was not disappointed: the texture is great and my skin really loved it. It feels fresh and more radiant.Highly recommend. Amazing product
