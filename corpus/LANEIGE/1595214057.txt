This stuff is amazing! It is like water in a little plastic jar. I put it on every night at bedtime and in the morning my skin is plump and hydrated. I like that it has fewer ingredients than most night creams and I also like that when I put it on it is absorbed and not sticky. It does exactly what it says it will do for a not bad price! Amazing!
