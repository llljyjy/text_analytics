Very hydrating and absorbs nicely in the skin. I love how my skin feels with this product. It is highly fragranced however, so if that bothers you this may not be the product for you. I finished the container in exactly a month, so I do feel that itâ€™s a bit overpriced for the amount that it comes with. nan
