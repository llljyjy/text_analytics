I really loved this cream! It felt really nice on my skin- not too heavy, but heavy enough to feel moisturizing! It definitely left my skin feeling soft and glossy right away and for hours after applying. Also- I have sensitive skin that can be easily irritated, but this didn’t cause any breakouts or irritation for me (which isn’t always the case with products that have vitamin c in them!) Overall, I loved this product! Laneige is killing the game! Great for my Skin!
