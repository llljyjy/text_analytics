So, I got this by chance, because my usual Laneige moisturizer was out of stock, so I thought I’d give it a try! (Hey, combining two steps to be able to go to sleep faster? Sign me up!) I wasn’t expecting much, because my skin is really fussy, BUT! Holy moly. This product paired with a serum has been a game changer! I have sensitive combination skin, and my skin loves this formula. A Pleasant Surprise!
