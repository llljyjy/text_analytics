I liked this lip balm, the grapefruit flavor is amazing and the packaging is really cute! The only thing is that I found myself still having dry, cracked lips at the end which I don’t mind since I can just reapply it. But I still prefer aquaphor over this since it actually heals my lips more, and for $17 I probably wouldn’t purchase the laneige balm again. Aquaphor is still superior
