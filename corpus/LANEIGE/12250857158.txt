So far I really like this LaneigeWater Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer! I have combo skin type that is oily/dry. This helps balance out my skin with All day hydration. It is a smoothing wet like texture that just glides across skin and absorbs quickly and evenly. I plan to use this in place of other moisturizers I was using daily. I was gifted by Laneige.
