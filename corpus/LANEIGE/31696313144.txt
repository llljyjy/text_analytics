Complimentary from Laneige. First off, the packaging looks really sleek and feels really luxurious. The sunscreen is a little thicker than what I’m used to, but it still works great. My skin tone is on the fairer side, but I personally did not notice any white-cast with this. Also haven’t broken out from it yet, so that’s a plus. Overall, I really like it, but it is a bit expensive for a sunscreen of only 50 mL. nan
