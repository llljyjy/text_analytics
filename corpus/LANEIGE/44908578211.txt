This product has been blowing up so I purchased because my lips get dry this time of season. I was NOT impressed. I put in on before bed and when I woke up my lips still felt the mask on them so I was impressed with that. By around 10am, my lips felt more dry than the previous night. This prduct only feels nice when in use. Good alternative is the vaseline lip therapy. Leaves my lips nice all day, costs way less, last way longer. Stay safe. nan
