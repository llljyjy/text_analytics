amazing toner! this is the perfect addition to any skincare routine that is lacking in moisture. something particularly impressive and noteworthy about this product is its ability to make it feel as if moisturize is coming from the inside out of the skin - and not just layered on the top of the skin. it’s such a refreshing and hydrating product. it’s also great for anyone that sometimes has late or hard mornings and wants a flexible routine - i sometimes use this as a moisturizer on days where i’m much more tired. highly recommend such a unique & amazing product
