I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox I began using this about 2 weeks ago, it has made a huge difference around my under eyes as the appearance  is now much more brighter and darker circles have gotten less visible! This cream has a great gel consistency as it’s not greasy at all! It’s good for dry skin as it keeps me hydrated, smoother and softer! I love that there is a light scent Laneige never disappoints me!!!
