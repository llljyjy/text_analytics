I have used this in the past and didn’t repurchase it for the longest time. After trying a few other lip balms / lip sleeping mask I just know I had to go back to this. The formula is super silky and smooth. It doesn’t feel goopy or dry on the lips as some other lip balms do after 5 minutes of applying it. I will be trying out the Mango scent next!’ HANDS DOWN ONE OF THE BEST LIP BALMS!
