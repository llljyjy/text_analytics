I’ve received LANEIGE water bank blue Hyaluronic eye cream product as a #freeproduct with #trywithtopbox, the eye cream is smooth, watery, very hydrating and fregrance free, It comes with a spatula which I’ve found easy to apply on the skin under eyes and it’s more hygienic. After 2 weeks of use, I’ve already seen that it helps nourishing and brightening the area under eyes especially that I’ve remarquable dark circles.I highly recommend it! Very hydrating eye cream!
