I personally am a fan of scented lip products. I have their sleeping mask and I’m in loooove with it. So I figured I’d buy the glowy balm. It does not smell like peach, in fact, it smells like nothing. No scent- which to me, was one of the main reasons for me to purchase. Which had me pretty disappointed. The texture and moisture is OK. I 100% prefer the sleep mask. nan
