I had fallen in love with peach and Lily’s peach lip balm, but they don’t make it anymore. It’s a tragedy. It had a wonderful peach flavor, with a wonderful slippy balm texture. Not too sticky, and it didn’t disappear immediately after application. So when I found these I was very excited! Yes, they’re a lil pricey, but for someone with terribly dry lips that will sit and pick at them until they bleed, this is a god send. It does help restore the barrier, and I notice I don’t bite or chew at my lips as much when this is applied, as the texture is hydrating and comforting. Will definitely repurchase. I use the lip masks at night! Feels nice for a lip picker.
