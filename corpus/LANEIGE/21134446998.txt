I really like this product when used as a first-step oil cleanser. I follow with my first aid beauty water based cleanser. My skin feels great and very hydrated. I took off a star because it doesn’t remove makeup all that well, but my second cleanser finishes the job so I don’t mind too much. I also feel like some product is wasted because it’s so runny it doesn’t all make it to my face. Good Oil Based Cleanser
