I’ve only recently started incorporating this product into my skin care routine and I already see a huge difference in my skin. My skin feels so much more smooth, hydrated and overall more glowy than usual. This product is so unique because I have dry skin and after I apply it it feels like applying a moisturizer. I know this product is advertised as a toner and moisturizer in one but with dry skin I was very skeptical. I have to try this product I can say with confidence that it 100% acts as a moisturizer as well. I combined it with my typical moisturizer and together they work amazing, but I’d feel comfortable using it on its own. My skin is so much more hydrated, smooth and healthy. Incredibly hydrating for dry skin!
