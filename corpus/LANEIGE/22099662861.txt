I did try the older version, and my experience was pleasant! It’s one of the first products containing a silicone that hasn’t caused me issues, and actually has a solid contribution to my complexion. It’s wasn’t heavy and left me nicely moisturizer for about 5 hours. Changing of the seasons and tret have an influence in my skin, so this may hold out all day for somebody who doesn’t have the mentioned issues. Solid product.
