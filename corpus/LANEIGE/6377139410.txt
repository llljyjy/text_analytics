This is the best toner I have ever used on my skin. I don’t normally write a review but I couldn’t help it this time. I have oily combination skin with redness and acne concerns and this completely keeps the oil at bay during the day/night. I apply both morning and night after cleansing with CeraVe SA cleanser and then follow with Avene light moisturizer. With this routine I have minimized my acne by 70%. The toner feels so refreshing on my face and I love the fresh clean scent. Will never stop buying!! 10/10
