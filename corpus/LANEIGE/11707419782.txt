I picked this up because I love the Gummy Bear version of the LANEIGE sleeping mask.  I purchased believing this to be a lip balm.  It’s not.  It’s a very high shine formula lip gloss with a lilac tint.  It’s very pretty, but it’s most definitely a makeup product and not skin care. While it’s moisturizing and I like it, I do feel that the marketing is a little bit misleading. This is basically a make up product.
