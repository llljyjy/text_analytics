I am convinced that my prolonged use of this product has made my lips more prone to dryness. I was also on a set with professional makeup artists and they commented that every model they worked with with dry lips used this lip mask. I do not recommend, even though it feels great on your lips, i donâ€™t think its good for you in the long term use. I used this for two years and my lips have never been more dry and trying to find something to heal them has been challenging avoid this product, unfortunately
