Letâ€™s talk about hydration. I received the Laneige water bank blue hyaluronic serum and cream  from topbox circle for free in exchange for a honest review. This line is dermatologist and hypoallergenic tested and is suitable for sensitive skin like mine. The packaging is dreamy but hopefully are refillable as they are plastic. These are also a great size for travel at 50ml. After testing these for over one week, I felt that the serum left my skin hydrated and feeling more smooth and firm. I loved the scent of this product and the light and dewy feeling on my skin. Some ingredients include Blue hyaluronic acid, Fucoidan, Peptides and green tea which all help with hydration, firmness and smoother looking skin. I absolutely love testing out the Laneige water bank blue hyaluronic collection and would definitely recommend this to skincare loves and those who have dry or sensitive skin. #laneige #topboxcircle Hydration in one pump
