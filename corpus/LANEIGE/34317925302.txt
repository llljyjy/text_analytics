I really wanted to like it considering how much I payed lol I really only payed because the packaging was cute lolIt feels super heavy on the lips which is good to lick in moisture but it really bothered me and it didn’t really do much for my dry lips also I’ve bought so many other better products and it’s just not worth itPlease don’t buy it because the packaging is cute lol save your money sadly not worth it
