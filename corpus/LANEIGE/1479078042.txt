I wanted to love this product so much because I was excited about the mango scent, but there is hardly any scent at all.  It is not an artificial mango flavor but I did expect a little more to be there.  The formula works the same so thatâ€™s why I leave it at 4 stars, otherwise it would be 3.  If you like very neutral scented products, this could be for you!  Just not what I had hoped for and I have the original, gummy bear, and sweet candy to compare to. Pass on the mango
