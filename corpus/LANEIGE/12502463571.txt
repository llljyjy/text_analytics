I have been using this for a few months and have not been amazed about this until now because tonight I had an acne flare up to a new product in my routine and I put this on and it calmed my skin down! The reason I took a star off is because if you use too much it can cause fungal acne, I learnt this from experience. For a product that is like made for more acne prone skin, I donâ€™t think it should give me fungal acne. BUTTT if you use a little amount it can really help and since its big and you only need a little it can last u a long time :) calmed down acne flare up
