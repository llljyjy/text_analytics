Comes with a handy little jar scraper/lip applier for when you’re at the end of the jar so you don’t waste a single iota of the mask. It’s extremely easy to use, and the grapefruit scent/taste isn’t offensive if you’re looking for a scent-free option like I was. It’s just a little sweet and fruity. I didn’t want to get the vanilla because that would be entirely too sweet for me. This was the perfect balance for me. So, I used it on a night when I literally couldn’t talk, my lips were so dry, and the next day my lips were so soft my partner said I always gave the best, softest, kisses. And I was kissing them with abandon with no fear of hurting my lips! Though I put the mask on again that night, and the next day my lips were even better! This mask is a gift that I never thought I could receive. I am so grateful I got a sample so I could try it and understand just how it works so I could buy a bottle for myself. I absolutely love this product, and trust Laneige in general. Without this lip sleeping mask, I wouldn’t be able to work in the extremely dry environment I work in now. I know you’re all saying “USE CHAPSTICK!“ And I do, but it’s not enough! Without this mask, my lips are dry bricks! Thank you Laneige and Sephora for bringing me this product!
