I got the trial size and tried it for about a week, very impressed! I’ve always had crazy oily skin but as I’ve gotten older it is getting drier and showing fine lines. I use this at night after the drunk elephant framboos serum, and my skin is amazing in the morning! After a few days of use my fine lines are much softer and overall skin hydration is perfect. I bought the full size, so now I put it on my neck and chest as well before bed. If you’re dealing with early signs of aging this is fantastic. nan
