Received a small sample with purchase. I love the thick nourishing texture and the smell is delightful! I used this product while I was taking Accutane and found that nothing (including this) helped my lips quite like aquaphor ointment. I’d wake up in the morning with dry lips and not a hint of the lip mask on but when I used aquaphor my lips were noticeably less chapped. Would love to try the product again now that I’m off Accutane because the texture and scent are so delightful. used while on Accutane.
