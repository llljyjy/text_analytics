I am obsessed! I used this for 2 things. When Iâ€™m home all day and my skin starts feeling dry in the afternoon, this is perfect to give you that feeling like you just apply your morning skincare again. And 2, when I do my full face of makeup and go out all day or night, I spray this on every 2-3 hours to revive my makeup and make it look like I just put it on again.  It works great even on top the Hula super hold settting spray. Love Love this. I am obsessed!
