This mask is sooo YUMMY on the skin, thereâ€™s just no better way to describe it. I put it on after the rest of my night routine and it feels so light, cooling, hydrating, and refreshing. It makes my dry skin feel so nourished, soft, and plump. It is perfect for those times where you just need some extra hydration. Did not irritate my redness and did not break me out. DELICIOUS
