I don’t wear makeup and that seems to be where this cleanser loses everyone. I love the way this cleanser feels on my skin, I look forward to using it every night. I apply it to my dry skin like lotion then use a hot, wet washcloth to remove it before using my second cleanser. I have noticed a huge difference in the texture of my skin since using this and it’s my “can’t live without“ skincare product. I recommend this to everybody! I am OBSESSED with this cleanser
