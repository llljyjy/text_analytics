There’s probably better oil cleansers. But I do like this one, might buy again. The milky color is really cool and makes me happy to use. Really feels like I’m putting milk on my face. It’s very softening to the skin after you use it, I have dry skin so that makes me very happy. It’s not strong enough to get rid of make up though. So I use this as a morning cleanser. Sometimes at night I use a makeup balm eraser and layer with this to wash everything. Then go in with my other cleanser. Hope that helps. personal fave
