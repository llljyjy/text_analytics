I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. I’m a huge fan of Laneige products and this isn’t any different. The consistency is smooth, not too thick, it’s perfect. My skin feels really hydrated after application and when I wash it off in the morning. I would recommend it. Really hydrating!
