I got this in one of the Christmas sets, and this cream is amazing! I have been using it about 2 weeks now, and my skin looks SO good and even..definitely brighter. I hate having to use multiple products so I try to look for moisturizers that contain most if not all of what I would want in a serum (vitamin C in this case). This really hits the mark. Is also super moisturizing and doesn’t leave any kind of greasiness on the skin. It absorbs super quickly. It works perfectly for my ‘Normal’ skin type. I wish it was 1.7 oz like most moisturizers, but that’s my only complaint. Love It - New Top 3 Favorite Moisturizers
