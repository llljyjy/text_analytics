Pull up a chair and let me tell you something: This lip mask is a GOD send! I have tried several, matter of fact MANY lippies but none compares to this. My lips are usually super dry and when using other lip balms, chap sticks, lip glosses, Vaseline, ect they have ALL made my lips peel. This lip mask makes my lips look and feel so supple. Never in my life has my lips looked and felt so good! I donâ€™t just use it at night, I use it throughout the day. I pray they never change their formulary because it works for me. Forever a customer.  Laneige is top notch! Fixed my peeling Cactus lips
