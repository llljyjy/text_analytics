Bought this lip mask with the hopes that it would make my lips feeling soft the morning after using- instead it dried them out. I gave it two stars because I did like the smell and how it went on initially. Unfortunately, the final product, wasnâ€™t what I was looking for- Vasaline works better IMO - Returned the product. Dried lips :(
