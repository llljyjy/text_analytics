This has changed everything. I use this as my night time moisturizer in the warmer months and layer it underneath a cream at night in the colder months. I’ve never felt this hydrated/moisturized before. It sinks into my skin, but doesn’t disappear. It leaves a slight tackiness/glazed donut layer on the face that isn’t like a film or sitting on top, but coming from within. It’s so calming and soothing. I’ve never had a product so compatible with my skin. Honestly, I put it all over my body, too. Wish they came out with a bigger bottle so I could just pour this all over myself, lol.
