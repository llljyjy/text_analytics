It felt nice going on but I just can’t do it with the fragrance. I’m worried my sensitive skin won’t be able to handle it. If it had no added synthetic fragrance I would keep it. *sigh* back to Sephora tomorrow. I didn’t use it long enough (obviously) to see any real benefit. If synthetic fragrance doesn’t bother you, go for it. Smells too strong
