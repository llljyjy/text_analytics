I really loved this #freeproduct that I got to try. My skin felt rejuvenated and youthful looking within a few days of using it. I liked the texture which was light and is absorbed quickly into the skin, without leaving it greasy. The gel has a cooling effect when you apply it and gives it a fresh feeling, with a nice scent. It is an amazing serum that I have now included in my beauty routine. Loved everything about this serum
