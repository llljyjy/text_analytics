It is a wonderful product! Iâ€™m so glad I purchased it. It has virtually cured my constantly dry, flaking/peeling lips. The reason I say virtually is because you have to be consistent with the application at night and ensure you are applying enough of the product to maintain the moisture retention (and I have slacked a couple of days and noticed the dryness creeping back-up) until the morning. Buy this mask if you constantly have had dry peeling lips. Lest we forget, being hydrated is first! However, slathering this mask on at night is second. Wishing you happy and healed lips!
