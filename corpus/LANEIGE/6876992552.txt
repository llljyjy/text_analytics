Lineage’s original water bank moisturizer was perfect. It went on so smoothly and hydrated like no other product out there. I don’t know why the decided to change the formula. I tried this one out in hopes that they would tweak it but it’s a whole new product. Not worth it at all. I’m so disappointed Not like the old one
