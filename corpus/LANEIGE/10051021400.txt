The balm lasts on your lips and is not sticky. For a squeeze balm it’s great but it doesn’t come close to the lip sleeping mask. I was excited to try this because I am obsessed with the sleeping mask. I was hoping it was a very similar formula in a tube with a little more color but I was a little let down in that aspect. Still a great tube balm just does not stand up to the sleeping mask great balm but sleeping mask is better
