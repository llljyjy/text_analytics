The texture is super watery so be careful when dispensing it. I’ve tried many application techniques (cotton pads, sponges, q-tips. etc.) but I feel bare hand works best. Being so light weight it’s hard to image how much it works when the product feels like water but don’t be fooled. I’d say after one week, one application every day before bed time, I have seen a drastic difference. My redness is gone, blotchy skin tones are evened & my skin is so moisturized! I don’t really like the exaggerated shine after (as I am a fan of matte) but it’s not sticky like most products, just an extra glow if you like that type of finish. Definitely recommend! A 2 in 1 that actually works!
