At first I was quite apprehensive and had not realized how much I would love this. Ive been using this lip mask many months now and it did the job, but I wasn’t so sure it was worth the money or any better than using just a moisturizing chapstick or even vaseline. I WAS SO WRONG! I recently ran out of the mask and I’ve been using vaseline instead. My lips are freakin’ dry and chapped now. I apply before bed and before leaving for work in the morning and use a moisturizing chapstick throughout the day. Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask is an essential product and I will never let my supply deplete. nan
