Pretty mediocre. If it has been soothing for some it def has not been for me. I knew I was taking a gamble on a chemical sunscreen. My marker is always…does it sting when it shouldn’t? And this does. Esp if it’s anywhere near my eyes. No white cast, sure but that’s pretty easy to find these days. Also doesn’t offer much in the way of extras (ie doubles as a decent primer). I’d rather an spf product offer something in the way of improving my skin in addition to protecting it. Not just me enduring it. I will keep it up for a few days and check in with the rest of my routine but so far. Blah. nan
