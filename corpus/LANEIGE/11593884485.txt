This lip mask is one of the best lip masks I have ever tried. I only use a small bit and it lasts me a minimum of 6 hours, and it is non-sticky and highly moisturizing. As for the fragrance, it is very light and not overwhelming at all, in fact, I previously tried the berry fragrance, and most of them have lightly fragranced. A Little Bit Goes a Long Way
