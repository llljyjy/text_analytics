I bought this thinking it would be super moisturising, but everything is kind’ve average. The cream has a lovely smell and texture, but isn’t anything to write home about - in fact despite using the whole regimen my skin is quite dry. Perhaps this is for normal skin types more than ageing skin? (I’m 38). Everything is kinda OK
