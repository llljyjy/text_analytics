This is a nice step in my skincare routine, but it honestly hasn’t made any difference in the long run. It’s one of those temporary feel good lip balms that lasts a little bit but doesn’t do a whole lot once it’s rubbed off after a while. I like that it comes with an applicator and a little goes a long way. I’d go for a different scent/flavor from vanilla next time. ehhh?
