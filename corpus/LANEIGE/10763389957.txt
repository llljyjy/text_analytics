I generally have dry skin, so when I applied this moisturizer, my skin drank it up. It is a pleasantly crisp, clean smelling product, and it is thick and substantial. It felt like it would stay on the surface of the skin longer but it was absorbed very quickly. This isn’t a bad thing, my skin needed the moisture. I like this cream as a means to rehydrate my skin. My skin was somewhat dry and irritated by the cold and wind and since this cream has hyaluronic acid, I thought it was perfect to see if it solved me a little. The truth is that I was surprised by the speed with which it has hydrated my face. The first day I had some small peeling near my nose and so on, and, after giving myself this cream (next to the tonic and the serum) the next morning I woke up with my skin like new. It’s wonderful. It spreads super well and with very little product in enough. Besides, it’s not sticky at all. In my case, I prefer to use it at night or during the day if I’m not going to put on makeup. It also comes with a pallet so you don’t have to stick your fingers in to get the cream which is ideal.  #laneigewaterbankblue #hyaluronic #moisturecream #freeproduct #trywithtopbox# Moisturize Me Forever
