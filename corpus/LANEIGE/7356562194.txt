I got this as a sample with an order, so it was like a little blister packet. I really loved the product but hate sticking my fingers in a lip balm/mask bc it gets in my nails. I decided to just check out how much it was to see if I would change my mind. Upon pulling up the product, I found out the little jar comes with a silicone applicator that is PART of the packaging. The packaging is pretty AND practical. The product looks gorgeous on the lips and really does hydrate and heal. My mouth was cracked OPEN from dry New Jersey weather, and this balm helped heal them in like two days. All while looking stunning for day and not being sticky for bedtime. Could not recommend this more highly. Run, Donâ€™t Walk, to Buy This
