Okay, most of us probably saw the Laniege lip MASK before the lip BALM. I bought the balm thinking it would be easier to apply. First off, the tube is ridiculously small for almost twenty dollars. Don’t waste your money and either buy the mask from this brand or a regular lip balm; it works much better. The packaging is cute but you can’t buy/keep a product solely if it looks aesthetic. Don’t waste your money.
