I received this product complimentary from Laneige in exchange for my honest review. This moisturizer provides a good amount of hydration to my combo/oily skin. I’ve used several different water gels, and this is definitely one of the more hydrating. I like that the gel is slightly thicker than most and can be built up on my dryer areas, although a little does go a long way. My main issue with this product is that it’s quite sticky and leaves a residue that remains on my skin for at least an hour after applying. I’d compare the texture to aloe vera gel. Despite the stickiness, it layers well with other products, and I haven’t had problems with it pilling. I’m also very acne prone, and it hasn’t caused additional breakouts like many products do. I typically prefer fragrance-free skincare, but I don’t mind the scent of this one. It’s light and pleasant and hasn’t irritated my skin so far. I like that the product comes with a small spatula so it doesn’t become contaminated or get under my nails when I scoop it out. I do wish there was some kind of holder in the container for the spatula though, especially since the top corners are rounded, and anything stacked on top may slide off. Overall this was a good moisturizer, but due to my issues with the texture I’m not sure I would repurchase it at full price. Hydrating but sticky
