Thank you @topbox and @laneigeca for selecting me for this mission to try and review Radian-C brightening treatment essence. I have received this product for free in exchange of my honest opinion. #tryitwithtopbox #freeproduct  I am in love with this one! I have been using this product from last 7 days twice daily in the morning and night time after cleansing. I can clearly see the difference in the skin tone and texture. It is fading away my acne scars so effectively. I loved the fact that it gets absorbed into the skin quickly. Also, it brightens and hydrates the skin so well. It is dermatologically tested and suitable for all the skin types. Key ingredients are super berry complex (antioxidant) , caffeine and potent and stable vitamin C. The recommended dose for the AM skincare routine is 3 pumps and for PM is 5 pumps. Packaging is so convenient to use and carry. It is available exclusively at @sephoracanada . I will definitely be buying this product after finishing the bottle and would highly recommend this product to all the people who are looking for fast acting and easy to use product. I am in love with this one!
