Okay I love this moisturizer!!! I’m super picky about my moisturizers, I have very dry skin so I need something super hydrating yet I don’t want to feel sticky or smell my skincare throughout the day. This Laneige moisturizer is so nice! It goes on easily, a little goes a long way. It makes my skin so soft and smooth. It absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave a residue on my skin. I love the scent of the product, it’s very light and goes away after a few minutes. Also, the packaging is beautiful! Definitely recommend! I received this product complimentary from Laneige. nan
