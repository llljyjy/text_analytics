Just finished my bottle and I have my thoughts:Pros: - doesn’t irritate - does fog the eyes- hydrating (leaves skin feeling nice, but not greasy)- I love milky things lolCons: - DOESNT REMOVE MY MAKEUP!as a person who wears makeup daily, I need a cleaner that removes my makeup well. This doesn’t do that at all, it just moved it around. This would be good for someone who just wears spf during the day. Not for me, won’t repurchase. It’s OKAY
