The best! I have been using this for 3 years and just realized I was taking it for granted. I put it on every night. Recently, I went on vacation in the mountains and thought a different lip balm would do, so I didnâ€™t pick my laneige. My lips got SO chapped. My lips were flaky and felt uncomfortable. When I got back home I started using laneige again and my lips are definitely healing. I just bought another one in grapefruit so I have a back up. get this period
