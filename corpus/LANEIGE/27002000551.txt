I received my Laneige Water Bank blue hyaluronic serum as a gift complimentary from Laneige,and itâ€™s been the best gift! From day one of using it I immediately loved it. The bottle itself is so neat the way it opens up and closes back so you dont get the funky chunk for the next use. The serum smells soo good and fresh, it feels so fresh as I apply it and my face feels so moisturized. It soaks in nice and quick and it doesnt leave a sticky feeling after it dries, it stays smooth. I can already notice a huge difference in my complexion i am very pleased. I will definitely continue this in my daily facial essentials. Total hydration
