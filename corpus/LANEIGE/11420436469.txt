Went to a lake in Utah for the 4th of July weekend and it was a scorching 105 degrees both days I was there. I forgot to put sunscreen on my face and by the end of the first day I was sunburnt from being at the lake all day. My whole face was red and it was painful. I kept reapplying this sunscreen and it felt so soothing! It did sting my eyes a bit and felt greasy but it did a great job at avoiding me being more sunburnt the second day. I have very sensitive acne prone skin and I had no issue. If this worked amazing on burning, itching, cracked sunburnt skin itâ€™s an A+ for me. SAVED MY SKIN
