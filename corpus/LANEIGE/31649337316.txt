I got this gel complimentary from Laneige. I have dry skin so this gel is like a remedy for me. I use it day and night and feel how moisture my skin became. I like gel consistency: it is very light and convenient to use before daily makeup.  The hydration is really felt lasting. I think it is a fair price for what I got using this gel. Well work for dry skin
