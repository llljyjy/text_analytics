I am loving this Vitamin C moisturizer from Laneige. I have been using it for almost 2 weeks now and my skin is looking brighter and feels moisturized. It absorbs quickly into the skin and does not look or feel greasy at all.It has a light scent that I think is nice. I love the packaging; it really makes the product feel more luxurious. Another one of my new favorites from Laneige. Love their products! My new favorite moisturizer
