I received this complimentary from Laneige in exchange for my honest review. I live in texas, where it is mostly hot all year round. I look for a light moisturizer that is still hydrating. This moisturizer is just that, and I love it. This is probably the most lightweight moisturizer I have ever tried. It has beads in the gel moisturizer; however, you donâ€™t feel them. I can already tell I will want to repurchase. nan
