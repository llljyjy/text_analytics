This used to be my absolute most favorite moisturizer and hands down worth the price. The formula changed and I thought I would give it a go despite the bad reviews. It’s somehow less hydrating, heavier and makes my skin feel oily which I never had with this product before. It just feels greasy and not hydrating like before. It used to smell amazing previously, like an expensive scent, which is also gone now. I am so sad ☹️ PLEASE BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL FORMULA!
