this one is great if you have oily skin, as this is what it was intended for. it has a soft, clean scent to it. I love that after using it, I see the left over oils and debris that my cleanser missed, which makes me feel like my face is very clean. leaves a very light moisturizing feeling. if you want more moisture or have dry or dehydrated skin. try their ’cream skin’ toner. that is one of my favorites as well when I want extra moisture and hydration ! if you have dry skin, this may not be moisturizing enough for you. but I really like this one for my skin. great for those who have oily skin!
