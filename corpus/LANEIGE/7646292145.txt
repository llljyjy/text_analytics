I really love this as a hydrating sunscreen so far. I love centella as an ingredient in their Cica Sleeping Mask especially while using Tretinoin so I wanted to try this sunscreen because of it. It has a slight scent and when it goes on it looks a bit greasy but after it sinks in for a few minutes it leaves a really nice hydrated look great hydrating chemical sunscreen
