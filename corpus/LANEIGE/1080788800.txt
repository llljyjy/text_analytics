Laneige has been my go-to lip balm for about two years. Why? It’s nourishing and isn’t sticky! And the shine is lovely without having a teeny-bopper shine, which at my age, I just can’t pull off. The gummy bear color is sheer with a pleasant smell. It’s also perfect to pop into your pocket or small bag for the evening. I keep one in my wallet, on my desk, in my car, in my makeup bag and on my night stand. It’s a must-have! Also an affordable gift for your fave friend! Go-to lip balm!
