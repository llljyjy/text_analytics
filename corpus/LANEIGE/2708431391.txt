I’ve used the Choco Mint and Gummy Bear ones before, but as my favorite coffee during fall is PSL (oopsy, I’m basic), I had to order the Pumpkin Spice version. As you apply it, it glides on smoothly and forms a uniform layer across the lips. The scent is literally spot on to my nose, maybe a bit more mellow than the drink, but it smells pretty strong (probably also because it’s fresher) of pumpkin spice. I love it and it doesn’t taste funny. I use about half a scoop every time, using included the applicator. When applied, it doesn’t leave a yellow or orange color on my pale pink lips. I actually taped the applicator on top of the lid since it seems it can be easily lost. I ordered the Gummy Bear version from Sephora as well, and both Pumpkin Spice and Gummy Bear smell stronger than the Choco Mint version I got from Korea. A literal must have, especially for fall!
