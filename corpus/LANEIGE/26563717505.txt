Gifted by Laneige.I have been using this Laneige water Bank blue hyaluronic serum for about a week now on my very dry skin. It gives instant hydration which is great however I don’t feel it gives lasting hydration.It’s a light serum, with a nice mild scent, it absorbs fast, my skin soaks it up. It leaves my skin feeling soft, comfortable and happy. It’s not greasy or oily so it layers well with other products. I have also notice that it makes my skin look brighter the morning after.I love the packaging/dispenser. It’s cool it twist open. I love all the power bank containers. hydrating
