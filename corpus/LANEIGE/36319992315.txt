Iâ€™m over 70 yo and have been discouraged by fine lines. This moisturizer is by far the best ever!  I love the way it makes my skin feel and a little goes a long way. I have a tendency towards enlarged pores and this doesnâ€™t clog them at all. After having used it for 2 1/2 weeks, a friend whom I hadnâ€™t seen for a couple of years commented on how beautiful my complexion is!  Itâ€™s been a long time since Iâ€™ve heard that. .  .  and remember Iâ€™m 2 years older than last time we saw one another ðŸ˜Š My New Favorite
