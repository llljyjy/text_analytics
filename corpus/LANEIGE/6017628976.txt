I really like this!!! It definitely creates that milk skin effect I’ve been seeing online and doesn’t seem to be breaking me out. I’ve been using it for about five days morning and night and I like it a lot so far. I do understand the reviews saying it makes the skin sticky because it does a little, but that goes away after you put your serums/moisturizers on. But don’t layer too much or else it’ll get a little goopy. Would recommend, I get the hype!! milky skin!!!!
