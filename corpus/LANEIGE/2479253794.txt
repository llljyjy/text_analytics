I was really excited to try this because I love laneige products, but this is not the sunscreen I wanted it to be.Pros: It is SPF 50 and does not leave a white cast on skin. The packaging is nice.Cons: It leaves a greasy film on your face and feels heavy on the skin. If any of it moves throughout the day, it gets in your eyes and stings. There are better asian sunscreens on the market that do not cause these issues. Mediocre sunscreen
