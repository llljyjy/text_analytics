Probably the only sunscreen I’ve used that doesn’t leave you with a white cast. I have a very deep skin tone so it’s hard to find sunscreen that actually works and looks good on my skin. People always claim no white cast on sunscreens and I’m often disappointed, but this one really does not leave a cast. It also leaves you with a really nice glow in my opinion. Actually leaves no cast, gives nice glow
