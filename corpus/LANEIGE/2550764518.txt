This is the BEST gloss, lip product I’ve ever used in my life in the 30 years I’ve been alive. Dramatic, I know, lol. But honestly, it’s not tacky or cheap feeling, it’s perfectly moisturizing without being obnoxious or heavy on the lips. Tiny tint of color adds a natural pop along with the scent- I’m an unscented girl, I hate scents of any kind but this gummy bear scent is heavenly. Also, it lasts for a very long time and it’s not drying on the lips, big plus, if you ask me. Get it and won’t regret it
