So.. TikTok made me buy it but after a couple of weeks.. I don’t get it. While it did kind of hydrate my lips.. it felt a little filmy but not really more smooth or supple (even after exfoliating my lips). I do like the texture and the “flavour“ but.. I was really hoping for more. Maybe I just need to continue to use it for longer? I don't get it
