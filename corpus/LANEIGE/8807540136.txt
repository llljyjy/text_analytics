I recently had extremely dry and cracked lips to the point of them bleeding if I smiled too much. It was so uncomfortable and so not cute. I decided to give this a try after Aquaphor failed to heal my lips. I saw drastic improvement after just one night of using it and after the second night, it completely healed my lips! It is an amazing product that I will continue to repurchase! Healed my chapped lips!
