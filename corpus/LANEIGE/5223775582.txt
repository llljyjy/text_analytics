I originally went into Sephora to buy The Essence by Tatcha but was confronted with a lot of 2nd thoughts after seeing the price tag. One of the sales associates recommended this Laneige Cream Skin Toner as a dupe and dare I say I love this more! It is a very watery consistency that feels super light and refreshing on your face. It soaks into the skin quickly and leaves it feeling plump and hydrated. My coworkers have been noticing the change in my skin too! I keep hearing how glowy my skin is. This product is my holy grail! HOLY GRAIL PRODUCT
