It took me months to find my perfect moisturizer for my severely dry skin. So sad they changed it. My skin feels soft at the initial application but once its dry, my skin feels just like before I applied the cream. I might look into pairing it up with their milky toner for extra hydration but as of now, I will probably be looking for a new moisturizer:( Old formula was better
