This past winter, my face had a period where it got really dry and irritated. It got super gross, my skin was flaking off especially around my nose. This was out of the norm since I usually have quite an oily complexion. This sleeping mask worked out really well for me and through consistent use, my skin calmed down and the flakes dissipated. Thereâ€™s a mild fragrance but to me, it smells nice.With warmer weather coming up, I will probably not use this every night anymore. Maybe once or twice a week. nan
