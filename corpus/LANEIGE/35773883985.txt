Each time I get this the cream is never fully full in the container. There is so much missing, and for the price of this it should be full to the brim. Will be trying to find another alternative in the mean time. However, I do love this product it is the only thing that actually works for my skin. Like I said though, the price for half of that container to be full is simply a scam in my eyes. nan
