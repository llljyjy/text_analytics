I received this as #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox. I am using this for a three week now as I did brought for myself before receiving this but thank you topbox for give me new one for later use. I am very fond for an eye cream that helps on my puffy morning eyes and this cream really helped me a lot. I am using it night and day and I can see an improvements on my under eye. I like the cooling effect under my eyes and Laneige is very good brand. And I really like this new packaging. Love this cream!
