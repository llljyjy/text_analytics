This is the absolute best lip balm I’ve ever tried (and I’ve tried a lot). I use it multiple times a day and the tube lasts me for months. It’s very moisturizing and not sticky at all, the scent is very light I don’t smell it when I put it on, which I prefer in lip products. The color is very faint so it barely shows up on the lips, it looks more like a clear gloss. I will keep buying this as long as they make them, they’re simply the best. nan
