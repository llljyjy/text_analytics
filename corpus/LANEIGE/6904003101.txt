I was disappointed with this product considering Laneige makes some of my fave products. The lip mask is one of my favourite skincare products ever so I thought I would love this but this pales in comparison.It feels more like a makeup product than a moisturizing lip balm but even as a lip gloss it’s not as long lasting as an actual lip gloss. I feel like it’s not too great for either category. When I apply this it doesn’t feel like it actually moisturizes. I have to apply a lot of product or apply a different product on top of it for it to truly moisturize my lips.It’s not like, overly bad or anything, but it’s just nothing special. There are better lip balms out there if you want it for a lip balm and there are better lip glosses out there if you want it as a lip gloss. nan
