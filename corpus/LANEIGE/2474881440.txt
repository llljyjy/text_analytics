Similar to a few other reviews, I unfortunately also found this lip mask to be very drying and irritating to my lips :( it feels lovely when applied... but my lips are dry, tight and irritated in the morning. The irritation will last a day or two with discontinued use. I typically just use Burt’s Bees without issue, so wondering if the fragrance in this product might be the culprit? Not sure, but unfortunately won’t be using this any longer as a result of the irritation. Negative reaction
