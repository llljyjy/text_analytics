I use this mask whenever i use chemical exfoliants to help soothe my skin. It works really well and helps calm my red, inflamed skin down. The cream is relatively thick and can take a while to absorb into the skin, hence the reason itâ€™s a sleep mask. I do find that the price is high for the amount of product they give you, the jar looks deceivingly large as there is not that much product inside. Other than that, I would highly recommend to anyone with stressed-out, irritated skin. Soothing and calming.
