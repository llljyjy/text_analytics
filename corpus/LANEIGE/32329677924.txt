Not only is the product amazing, this is hands down the coolest packaging I’ve ever seen! The pump twists up and down making it nearly impossible to leak. Also there is a sensor that will turn red when you’re out of serum - how convinent?! The serum itself is ultra-hydrating and soaks into the skin almost immediately. It has a water like consistency and doesn’t feel heavy on the skin. I’ve found my new holy grail part of my everyday skin routine - I’m in love! I was gifted by Lanegie but all opinions are strictly my own. Best Serum EVER!
