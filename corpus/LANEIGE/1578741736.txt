This product is overrated, but it’s still nice. I have dry/sensitive skin, so I think it’s more geared toward someone with oily skin. It is moisturizing and lightweight which I like. And it doesn’t irritate my skin. If you are looking for an alternative to a heavier night cream, then this may be a good choice for you. nan
