One word: HYDRATING. I was gifted this to review from Topbox, and this is hands down the most moisturizing and hydrating eye creme that I’ve used to date. If you have dryer under eyes or just dryer skin in general, this product is for you. This product definitely has fragrancing which is something to note. In terms of results that I’ve seen throughout the nights that I have used this, I haven’t noted too much of a difference from when I started. I will continue using this eye creme! #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Super hydrating!
