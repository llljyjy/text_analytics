Really enjoy this product! I would really recommend exfoliating your lips first with either a scrub/toothbrush/towel and then applying this on top because it can easily get too thick and thatâ€™s when people complain about the consistency. Other than that, super great formula and a little goes a long way! A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY!
