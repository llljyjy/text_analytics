I loveee this product. It has a watery type of runny consistency, and works amazing on the skin. When you apply it on the skin, it’s cold so you automatically feel refreshed. It’s definitely giving me late night beach vibes I’d totally recommend this product, however Im just not a bit of a fan of its kind of stickiness onto the skin, when you first apply it. Though , later on it fully absorbs. WONDERFUL PRODUCT!
