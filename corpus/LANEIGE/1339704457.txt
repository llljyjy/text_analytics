I don’t write reviews unless I have a really positive or negative experience, and I don’t understand hype around this at all. I wanted to love this after reading the reviews. I used it nightly for two months. I stuck with it, thinking maybe it just took some time.. it’s not cheap, I wanted to give it a shot. If anything my lips are worse. My upper lip in particular gets so dry and sensitive with this. Literally Vaseline would have been better. Save your money and your lips. Skip it, save your money and lips
