Amazing product. I have very oily skin prone to breakouts even at 40 and this is one of the only products I’ve found that moisturizes without causing breakouts and helps hydrate skin in dry Canadian winters. I can apply a few times a day when needed and it doesn’t add layers of grease. I use as a moisturizer and not even an overnight mask. It also helps hydrate dry skin from acne products. Amazing nan
