I’ve had issues with my lips being chapped and cracked since I was a kid, but this stuff changed my life. The rich moisturizing formula whipped my lips back into shape and I recommend it to anyone that needs a little TLC. Not only does it have a light, yummy scent, but it also lasts forever. It’s been a few months of daily use and I’ve barely made a dent in the container! It’s worth every penny and my lips have never been happier! Holy hydration, Batman!
