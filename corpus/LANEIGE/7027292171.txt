I have been using this sleeping mask almost every night for the past month and have really liked it! There is no extreme noticeable change but is leaves your skin very soft the next morning. I have extremely dry and sensitive skin and my skin has reacted very nicely to this moisturizer. It has a very silky soft texture and is lightweight so it leaves your skin feel hydrated but not too sticky or overly moisturized. If you have very dry skin it could also be used in the morning especially for winter. Overall I would recommend as it hydrated my very dry skin and left it glowy and soft. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox lightweight and hydrating
