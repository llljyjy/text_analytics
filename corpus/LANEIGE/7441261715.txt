i feel like this product really didn’t do any good for me at all. a 2 in 1 combo product like this sounds amazing since i’m always looking for ways to simplify my skincare routine, but it was always too much or too little. on its own it doesn’t provide the hydration that i need unless i pack on multiple layers in which it starts feeling grossly sticky, and paired with another moisturizer on top, no matter how light or heavy, always leaves me terribly greasy(and also sticky) in the morning. super sad that this didn’t work out :( great concept, however
