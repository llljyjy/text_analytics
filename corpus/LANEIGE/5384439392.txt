Loving this sunscreen! I have dry skin and have been using this instead of moisturizer. It’s very hydrating but doesn’t leave me greasy or white cast - just glowy. I put this to the test on vacation in the strong Arizona sun - did not burn at all, and was able to reapply throughout the day (after hiking/sweating) and it layered very nicely and never felt heavy or greasy. I also used it under makeup (using the fenty eaze drop for foundation) and had no issues with pilling at all. It does have a slight scent…but I’m yet to find a sunscreen that doesn’t. Definitely will repurchase! love
