Nothing compared to the original water bank cream! I was so excited to try the new la neige moisturizer as it has been my holy grail for my dry, dull and acne prone skin for the past couple of years, however I am greatly disappointed. I have applied it about 4-5x only (twice a day for 2-3 days) and my face feels super dry and have been experiencing never before seen texture and breakoutsâ€¦ I miss the old water bank cream!!!! Plus there is a lingering smell. So if you are sensitive to smell like I am, be aware. Disappointed and sad that I have to restart my search for the perfect moisturizer NOTHING compared to the original waterbank cream
