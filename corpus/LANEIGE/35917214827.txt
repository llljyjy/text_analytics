I received this product as #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox in exchange of my honest review. I am a big fan of the new packaging. I have been using it from past 2 weeks and I do see a little bit difference in puffiness of my eyes. Although I don’t like the fact that its not absorbed quickly. Its fragrance free which is good but I won’t spend 50$ for this. nan
