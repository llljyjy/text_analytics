I love this stuff. Is it more effective than Vaseline or aquafor? Not necessarily. Depends on what you’re looking for! Yes, those two products keep lips moisturized/hydrated just as well. However, this one tastes good, smells good, comes in pretty packaging, and has a fun little applicator (which I lost months ago). So in that way, I prefer it to Vaseline. I use it over lip balm every night and wake up with it still on my lips. I never have chapped or dry lips now, even in the dry Midwest winters. I will say that this isn’t a miracle worker and it isn’t necessarily “plumping” - but it’s a lovely product and it lasts a long time (I’ve had mine over a year now) and $22 for a product I can use for over a year, that makes me happy, = worth it to me! It feels ritualistic and it has become part of my nighttime skincare routine. Will buy again. Now a staple in my nightly routine. Moisturizing!
