So I was very skeptical about trying the new formula. And then I received the ten day sample (which lasted me for 20) of the new formula and I decided to give it a try. Now this review is based on that sample but It’s led to my purchase of the full size. To me: it’s not very different from the old one.Pros:Less scent. The new one has a weaker scent which I like. The older formula’s scent was stronger.ConsIt’s not as moisturizing as the old one.If you’re very dry, this is an easy pass. If you’re okay with lesser moisturization and willing to layer moisturizers then you should find this a good buy. Alternatively, purchasing the water bank serum (which I love) and layer a moisturizer over it. Neither better nor worse than old
