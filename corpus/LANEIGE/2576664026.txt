I received this product complimentary from Laneige in exchange for my honest review. This product first is packaged very well and very aesthetically pleasing. There is a scent that I felt stayed a little longer than I would like but overall not a deal breaker since it sunk in quickly and was very hydrating without leaving any film. This is going to be a perfect summer moisturizer since packs a moisturizing punch on top of being very light weight. I also love that it came with a scoop so I donâ€™t have to dip my fingers in the product. nan
