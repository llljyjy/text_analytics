The new formula is sticky, and is not hydrating. My skin feels dry immediately after using it, and I honestly think it hurts my skin more than helps it.  The original formula was amazing, and it made my dry sensitive rosacea prone skin feel amazing!   I am so disappointment that the formula was changed. Do not believe the marketing that this  new product is “improved”, it is not improved and is now unusable. I do not recommend anyone buys this new product. Horrible compared to the original formula
