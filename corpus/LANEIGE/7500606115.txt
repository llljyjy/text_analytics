This Review is long overdue.This is probably my 4th one.A little bit goes a long way!Its a bit thicker than like gloss (but not too sticky) almost like a heavy cream but I slap some on before I go to bed and I wake up my lips still have some left on it.They always feel soft and moisturized.Itâ€™s part of my nightly routine. DONT DEBATE IT,JUST DO IT.
