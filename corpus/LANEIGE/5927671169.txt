I have very dry skin and suffer from frequent dry patches.  In the past, I have had to re-apply moisturizer 3+ times a day because my skin would feel parched after a few hours.  When I apply the Laneige Water Bank cream moisturizer in the morning, my skin actually feels hydrated until I do my nighttime skincare routine.  I would describe the consistency as a lightweight cream and the scent as subtly floral.  It instantly and thoroughly hydrates while also quickly sinking in so there’s no greasy or tacky residue left on the skin.  It also doesn’t pill with my serums, facial oil, sunscreen or makeup.  After applying this moisturizer, my skin looks plump and feels soft, smooth and bouncy.  I like that it comes with a spatula so that I can get the product out without having to put my fingers into the jar each time.  It is more hygienic and keeps the product fresher.  The process of opening the jar is unique to me, but it didn’t take long for me to get the hang of it.  Instead of completely twisting off the lid like you would with other jarred moisturizers, you turn this lid part way and then lift up.  Gifted by Laneige. Dry skin approved for all day hydration!
