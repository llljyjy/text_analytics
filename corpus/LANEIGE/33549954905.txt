#freeproduct #trywithtopboxThis product is a great layering serum, thicker than water but not as thick as say a snail mucin serum. I would recommend layering it under a moisturizer unless you’re in a very humid climate. The packaging imo is amazing. I adore the twist and pump action. Not only is it cool it’s almost great to keep the opening of the pump hidden and not exposed to dust in the air. nan
