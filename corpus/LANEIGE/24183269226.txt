I received this amazing #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox and have been using it for 2 weeks now. The packaging is quite classy and it smells great, not too strong. I have a very dry skin and was looking for a suitable serum to help reduce the dryness of my skin and this serum works wonders. I apply it every night before applying my Laneige moisturizer, which also I received from #topbox as a #freeproduct, and in the morning I can feel the difference on my skin. It helped a lot with my dryness and made the skin more firm. I have already bought another one for my sister. In love with the product. Amazing
