I got this SPF complimentary from Laneige to test and really like it. This cream has pretty thick texture so I need to work a bit to spread it evenly but there’s no white cast or any greasiness. It’s completely invisible on the skin and feels lightweight and hydrating. I also love that there’s Centella extract in it to sooth skin and the scent is very light. nan
