$20 for a lip balm is a lot so I was hesitant to purchase this however I think it may be worth the price! It is super hydrating without being sticky and plumps up the lips. I really enjoy this product and will probably be trying the other ones once Iâ€™m done the peach one! sheer, hydrating, plumping and not sticky !
