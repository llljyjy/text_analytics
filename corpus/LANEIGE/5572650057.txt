I got this free from TopBox and was excited to try it. I really wanted to love this but sadly I just didn’t!I love the way the packaging looks and the pop up feature is neat BUT it feels awkward to use and it’s a lot of plastic which is wasteful.The scent was light and pleasant - which I did like.This serum has a light gel type of texture which just didn’t work for me, I discovered I much prefer a more liquidy/oil type of serum. When I used it with the Bank Blue Moisturizer during the day, I would notice my skin felt tacky - which I hate! So I had to stop using them together. If you DO like light weight gel serums,  this may work for you!Overall, I did not enjoy it and will not purchase it in the future. nan
