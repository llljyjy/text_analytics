It is a juicy serum that will help your skin be more hydrated.  It is  hypoallergenic, dermatologist-tested, and suitable for sensitive skin.  It is nice silky feeling on my skin. I find this serum working so nicely and I use it as well in day and night routine of skincare . It is lightly scented. It does absorb so well onto my skin. I like so much the packaging it came in. It helps for dullness and dryness.  I can I am loving this beautiful serum.  My skin is looking more firmer and even softer.   #trywithtopbox #freeproduct The best serum to have.
