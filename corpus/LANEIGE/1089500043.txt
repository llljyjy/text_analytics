Iâ€™m so glad to have received this #freeproduct from topbox circle to try. I used this product gradually from once a week at night time to twice a week and now three times a week. I saw some slight differences in my fine lines but not so much on my forehead wrinkles yet. I love that it did not irritate my sensitive skin. The rest of my skin looked brighter and it felt smoother. Definitely was hydrating. Will continue to use! #trywithtopbox Awesome retinol
