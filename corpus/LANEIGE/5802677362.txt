I wanted to try a lip gloss I could put on when I’m not wearing makeup or light make up. I’ve heard a lot about this brand when it comes to the sleep mask lipgloss so I decided to try this one out. I like it, it does last a bit longer than others but it definitely doesn’t last for hours and hours you will have to reapply it after awhile. It smells good and lays down on your lips nicely and this one does actually has a real light purple-ish tent to it. As far as the price point I think it’s pretty decent for this product. Smells Yummy!
