I absolutely loved this serum. I got this #freeproduct with #trywithtopbox pros: packaging is cute , easy twist off and has a nice click when you close it very satisfying.non scented which is even better I’m sensitive to scents. so that’s nice.and it truly did make my face smoother to touch. I used this in the morning and at night before using the laniege cream. I noticed a change in my face immediately. will buy in the futureCons: The press down function with the little nozzle that the cream comes out of isn’t long enough so the cream actually gets stuck under the lip of the bottle instead of going into your hand. And if u tilt the bottle u can only do it so much until the straw inside isn’t touching anymore product. So the design needs a little work. Smooth serum
