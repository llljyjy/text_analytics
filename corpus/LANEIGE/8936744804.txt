Go to moisturizer for the summer! I have combination skin and during the summer I always try to use a gel like moisturizer, so it is not heavy and with all the sweating, my face doesnâ€™t look greasy. And this is just perfect! It feels like a punch of fresh water. In love! I received this complimentary from Laneige in exchange for my honest review. Punch of fresh water!
