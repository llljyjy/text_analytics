It’s very hydrating for dry skin and I was gifted by Laneige. I have used Laneige for a while and I like their products. I like the design of the bottle because it’s very innovative and not in a jar. I like the formula because it feels very light and hydrates my skin. It’s good for sensitive skin. nan
