it feels nice but isn’t really like a mask?? i’ve been trying to figure out what recently has been breaking me out bc it wont go away and it keeps getting worse:( i realized it’s probably this mask because that’s the only new step i’ve recently added into my routine. i do use just panoxyl and a moisturizer but i’ve been replacing my moisturizer some days for this and i think this is the problem. but i’m not sure if benzoyl peroxide just inside compatible with the ingredients in this. nan
