I read all the reviews on this and decided to try it because the price was too good. I can see why people say it soaks in and it feels like you need more. I applied one layer and my face felt very tight and dry, but to touch it almost almost felt Sticky/tacky as I got into bed. Decided to roll with it and see what I woke up to and I woke up to beautiful soft skin. Does exactly what it says it does! Big fan. lalalalalooooove
