Had high hopes from this and I’ve got to say it has not worked for me consistently. On some days my lips become super duper dry the next day, it’s bizarre. I don’t feel the super softness that others get from this. My lips are dry & rough after using this.Overall I regret spending $24 on a product that is making my lips worse than before.My holy grail lip product is the Aerin rose lip conditioner. It keeps my lips absolutely soft & supple. Makes my lips drier!
