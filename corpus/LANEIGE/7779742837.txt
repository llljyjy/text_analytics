Unfortunately, Laneige changed the formula to a cheaper formula recently and now itâ€™s a terrible product. My face used to feel so fresh and moisturized after using it, but now if feels dry and has started itching. I wish they would bring back the old formula in the glass bottle with the blue bottom and white top! No Longer Worth It
