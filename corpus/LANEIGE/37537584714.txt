I felt that I had no choice but to purchase this lip sleeping mask after reading the multitudinous positive reviews--and I’m not disappointed! I love that it’s packaged with a little spatula for easy and luxurious application of the mask on your lips, and the mask itself is well-formulated to be smooth and creamy. The purple container is also super cute and minimal, which I adore. And the gummy bear scent--it’s so addicting and delicious that I need them to make a candle for it. This magical product turns my lips from dry to cushiony and plump overnight. I love it and can’t wait to purchase others with different scents! Highly recommend if you’re willing to splurge a bit! Leaves me with cushiony, plump lips.
