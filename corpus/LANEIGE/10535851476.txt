I use the Laneige Radian-C cream at night as my moisturizer and I notice bright and more even skin tone when I wake up in the morning, without changing anything else in my skincare routine. It comes with a really cute, little spatula and the product applies semi-thick on my really dry skin and doesn’t sit greasy on my face. It has a typical vitamin-c scent which doesn’t linger, and overall leaves the skin feeling really soft and looking bright. nan
