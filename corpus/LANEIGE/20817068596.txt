Ages ago I came across the original product/formulation and I LOVED it. It was incredible. My skin was plump, refreshed, and felt so hydrated. It never pilled and was perfect to wear under makeup. It was a holy grail product. Now? They’ve reformulated. Why? Why ruin such an amazing moisturizer? Please go back to the original! I haven’t been able to find anything of the same caliber since and I’m so sad. Extremely disappointed - Bring back the original!
