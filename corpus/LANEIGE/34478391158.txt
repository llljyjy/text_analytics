I love it on the lips, it stays on until the next day and keeps the lips hydrated. Unfortunately, it’s bad for the skin. I mean if you don’t sleep on your back, the product will rub off on the pillow and end up on your face. I used this sleeping mask for two months and was never able to determine the reason for my acne. When I stopped using it for a week my skin started to clear up. Now I use it during the day for a few hours and then take it off before I eat. It’s not cheap so I won’t throw it away but I wouldn’t recommend it as a sleeping mask. nan
