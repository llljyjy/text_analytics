I wanted to like this so bad!! The packaging is so cute but I prefer the old formula for sure. It’s not as cooling but it is nice to put on. But on me, it stung after I put it on. I would say this isn’t for sensitive skin. I wish I could keep using it but I don’t want my skin to breakout after trying so hard to have a good regimen. Wish I could like it
