I was using the water sleeping mask which was great for summer but not cutting it for summer and my skin got dry and irritated. I received this as a sample and it was amazing! I immediately felt a cooling sensation when I applied it and felt completely hydrated the next morning. I started using the moisturizing cream too during the day too and alternating nights with the Cica sample and my skin has felt great! I will definitely be buying a jar of the Cica! A+, even if you donâ€™t have sensitive skin
