My review of the water sleeping mask is part of a review for a #freeproduct I used this at night and washed it off in the morning.  I usually do my nighttime cleanse a few hours before bed, so I got to feel how it was like while I was still awake too.  It goes on smoothly, and feels almost like a gel cream.  It’s probably because it’s winter but it felt like there was a cooling feel when applied, which is refreshing.  I have oily skin and I noticed that I was looking a little shiny by the time I went to bed.  That’s not a huge issue while I’m sleeping, but I thought I’d note that if it bothers you to know you’re lying there with an oily face + this mask at night.  When my skin is particularly dry, I can see that this added hydration in the morning and the dry skin gets repaired pretty quickly after that.  When I don’t have any dryness, I don’t really notice any difference to my skin the next morning.  I pair this with the Laneige moisture bank cream. PM pampering
