I love langiege lip masks, it was perfect timing releasing this one as their last collab release last year (ptd in Las Vegas gummy bear lip mask) finally ran out! these will last you forever. the flavors are nice smelling and butter is interesting as it smells like popcorn I guess its if you perfer savory smells? or to be a bit on the nose lol. Iâ€™m currently using permission to dance (peach iced tea) and it smells just like those powder ones you mix with water. I got another one as a gift for my army friend too! so these are perfect as a gift for anyone you know who loves bts ðŸ’œ love love love ðŸ’œ
