I received this product complimentary from Laneige in exchange for my honest review. If you know Laneige, then you know they are incredibly hydrating and simple skincare. If you are looking for supple, hydrated skin, then this product is for you. It will smooth out texture, plump out minimal aging and won’t cause irritation on your sensitive skin. I’ve used their sleeping mask and the day moisturizer and this one is definitely thicker and I also find it more hydrating and longer lasting. It’s less like a gel as well. It absorbs quickly and doesn’t make you feel like you need more product later on. Comes with an applicator stick for extra bonus. I would recommend. Love Laneige. So hydrating!
