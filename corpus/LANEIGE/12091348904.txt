My lips get soooo dry during the winter especially this has been a life saver. I’m also a healthcare worker and the hospital can be so drying however this keeps my lips hydrated through my shift with just a one time application. I’m im love I even put some on my boyfriend sometimes and he definitely feels a difference. I think I would like a scent free one a bit more. I also love how it comes with a little application stick. SO Hydrating the hype is REAL
