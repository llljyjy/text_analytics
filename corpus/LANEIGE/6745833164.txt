So far, pleasantly surprised. I don’t think any lip balm exists that isn’t a little bit sticky feeling, and this does feel a little sticky but it’s not overly intense and I don’t find my hair getting stuck in it. I have noticed that my lips are less prone to splitting and getting chapped and that’s really encouraging. Also smells great! Worth It
