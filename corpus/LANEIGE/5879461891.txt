Used the original Berry before and loved it, but Mango is my new favorite. It has been light and perfect for the summer. I apply once at night and once in the morning and I never need to use chapstick, even in the desert. I know the container will last me a long time, but I plan on buying a second Mango asap since it is limited edition. Mad for Mango
