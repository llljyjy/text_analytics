I cannot live without this lip sleeping mask. I apply it day, night, and anytime in between. I have multiple jars stashed aboutâ€¦my work bag, bedside table, makeup bag, car. This is one of those products that I will rave about to anyone who will listen. It is the only thing that keeps my lifts from being dry and cracked. 4 years and counting
