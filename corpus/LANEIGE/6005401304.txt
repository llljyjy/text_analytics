Just got my hands on these lip masks after seeing it everywhere on social media and I think they’re absolutely worth it! I originally got Vanilla which is a very classic scent that I so enjoy! I then got Peppermint and enjoy it even more! My favorite lip balm is the original Burts Bees and have always wanted a lip mask form of the peppermint scent AND THIS IS IT. Definitely going to restock before it isn’t available anymore as a limited edition. The Peppermint and Vanilla scent is worth it!
