I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review.This sleep masking is a very thin watery texture that spreads and soaks into your skin very nicely. A someone with dry skin, I’m always looking for new mosisturizers and sleeping masks. Even though this is super hydrating I would reserve this for the warmer months because it’s very lightweight but still hydrating. If you had combo/oily skin this would be great year round but for me and my dry skin I think it in the warmer months because I need something a bit more heavy. With that being said it’s January and I’m still enjoying it very much layered with other thicker creams. Amazing lightweight texture, not greasy
