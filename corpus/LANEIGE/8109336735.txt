I only tried the sample of this product and when I tell you I tried to make that sample last... This definitely is a daily balm since it is not think. This moisturized my lips amazingly, smells fruity, and the iridescent in it creates some sort of fullness effect to my lips. It is so smooth and once it dried off my lips (through out the day of course) my lips felt amazing on it’s own. This is better than the lip sleeping mask. It is pretty tiny, a reason why I got the lip mask instead but I don’t care anymore. If you love something, get it !! Best bougie lip balm
