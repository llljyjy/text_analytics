I received this product as a #FreeProduct from #TopboxCircle for product testing and review. I’ll start of by mentioning it had no fragrance. The product comes with a spatula to apply under the eyes. I have used it for a short period of time, not the full 4 weeks as advertised. My experience with the product was wonderful, the eye cream instantly hydrates my eyes and my concealer doesn’t crease and bakes better then ever. The consistency is a light blue gel, not too light that it feels like water. I would’ve liked to see some results in my dark eyes but I haven’t used it long enough to notice a change. nan
