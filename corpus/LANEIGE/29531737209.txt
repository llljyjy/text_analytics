I received this product complimentary from Laneige for an honest review. This is such a wonderful moisturizer! I have combination skin and I really liked how it made my skin feel. It looked and felt more hydrated, especially my dry parts if my skin that can get so dry this time of year. It did a great job of balancing my skin out too, not making the oily parts look/feel more oily. My skin felt hydrated and smooth all day! Great
