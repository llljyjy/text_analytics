I love these so much. They last a very long time and they’re so hydrating. They smell great, but they don’t taste like anything. My lips get very dry and all I need to do is apply it before bed and my lips are very soft in the morning. It also softens the loose skin on my lips by morning making it very easy to remove and it helps speed up the healing process when my lips are bleeding. I’ve tried 4 different scents and I just love them so much! My favourite
