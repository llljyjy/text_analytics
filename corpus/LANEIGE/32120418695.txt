Such a Laneige fan here. I found this serum to be very hydrating and lightweight on the skin. The packaging is adorable. The light blue and twist to open makes for a luxurious experience. I follow with moisturizer and find hydration on my face to be locked all day giving me a nice glow. Overall really enjoying this product. I was gifted by Laneige. nan
