I put off getting this for too long. It couldn’t be THAT good, right? Wrong. It melts into a super moisturizing oil as soon as it touches my lips and stays there for at least 24hrs. My lips are always peely no matter what I put on them but not with this. It has a very light sweet berry-ish smell/taste that isn’t overpowering at all. My only complaint (if you could call it that) is that it is very transferable — I can’t kiss my partner without wiping it off first, and if I kiss my cat, my mouth is instantly furry. However that’s not enough to make me switch to a different product. My everlasting search for the perfect lip stuff might actually be over! This is gonna last forever too, there’s so much in the pot. Get it! Lives up to the hype. Only lip balm I need
