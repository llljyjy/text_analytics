I received this complimentary from Laneige. Ok, so first this packaging is amazing. It is so easy to open and so cute. I love that it can actually stand up on my desk and look good! There is immediate hydration without being greasy. It lasts a good few hours which I appreciate. I like how quickly this absorbs because I can get right back to work! My hands look visibly smoother and bouncy. I would definitely say this is the most efficient and comfortable hand cream I have used. I would just like a little more tropical of a scent because I am not a floral person, but I love this so much! nan
