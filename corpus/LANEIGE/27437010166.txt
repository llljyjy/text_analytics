I was gifted by laneige the water bank blue hyaluronic gel moisturizer. This is a light weight moisturizer. It rubs on and feels like water, drys and absorbs very nicely. This is perfect for my dry skin. This left my skin feeling smooth and looking bright and very hydrated. Perfect for sensitive skin but not only used on sensitive skin. I have combination skin dry and oily. I have mild acne and this has not effected or caused any more acne. Works great with my everyday toner and serum. Love this moisturizer!! Hydrated and glowing
