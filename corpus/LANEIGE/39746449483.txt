Wow! I’m hooked! I tried this #freeproduct with #trywithtopbox and so far, I am loving it. I apply it in the morning (under my sunscreen) and evening (under my favourite moisturizer) and my skin already looks brighter, smoother and more hydrated. The glass bottle feels luxurious, and the scent is invigorating. I’m used to a more runny serum like this one and typically apply with my hands, but I can see why someone might opt to apply on a cotton ball instead. I’m excited to try more Laneige products. Love this serum!
