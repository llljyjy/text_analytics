I have tried dozens of different products over the years and this is the only lip mask that has actually worked for me. I apply a single layer before bed and when I wake up, it is literally still intact and has kept my lips moisturized all night, unlike other brands that I find absorb into my lips and leave them dry in the morning. I recommend using a cotton swab to apply this; Iâ€™m not a huge fan of washing the little included spatula since the formula sticks to it. The only thing that could be improved is perhaps an even lighter or fragrance free formula, but the vanilla is the closest you can get as it has a pretty light scent. Most effective lip mask by far - life saver!
