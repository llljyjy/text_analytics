cannot say enough good about this stuff. truly a lip rescue, I stopped using it for about 4 months and my lips were so sad dry would get the lip line scratchyness... but then I bring it back instantly plumps my lips right up don’t need alot at all so lasts forever. I mean like 8 months too a year lasts so price is very fair when put that way. and that’s with using it every night every morning and easy one 2 times through the day.. like I said you do not need alot just a dab. always Lind the first layer doesn’t really have a smell tell a could dips in then you can smell it. but smells very good too like every one does amazing stuff
