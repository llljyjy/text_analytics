I bought the mini set of 5, so I have tried Berry, Sweet Candy, Gummy Bear, Lemon Sorbet, and Mint Choco. I’ve used them consistently for about 2 months and have definitely noticed a difference. I don’t have dry lips, but I’m definitely the kind of person who would die if I didn’t have my Burt’s Bees chapstick with me at all times. I found that after using this every night before I go to sleep, I’m not needing to grab my lip balm as often during the day because my lips are already moisturized. I also love how you can wear it normal during the day as a glossy balm. This product just makes me feel like I’m pampering myself every night and that makes it worth it too. Wonderful Hydration
