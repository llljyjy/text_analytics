I’ve been using this product on-and-off for years. It smells great and dose provide a subtle plumping effect, however it really is for sleeping only. The formula is so sticky, you definitely won’t want to apply until right before bed, and you have to be extra careful not to accidentally get any on your sheets. I probably will stop using this after I run out. There are less sticky options on the market these days. nan
