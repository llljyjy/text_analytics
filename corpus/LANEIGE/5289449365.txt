I was very excited to try this since I usually love Laneige’s products but this one is just not for me. The packaging is very cute a little does go a long way. However, I’m not crazy for the feel or texture of this moisturizer. It feels just as putting after sun gel on leaving my skin with wet feel and takes way too long to absorb into my skin. I will say once absorbed, it does leave my skin feeling very soft and silky but I probably would not use this again in the future since the other is bothersome. Laneige Waterbank Hyalouric Gel Moisturizer was gifted by Laneige. Some perks but a pass for me.
