I’ve been having to travel a lot recently and picked up a mini version of this as I’ve heard lots of praise of this brand coming from both locally and people who live in Korea. I like that this is not a super thick and greasy formula - it honestly is a lovely regular cream consistency - if it wasn’t called a mask I would assume this is just a thinner consistency night cream. I would happily wear this during the day throughout the year as well as I have dry and sensitive skin. I love that this shows no signs of being greasy or making the skin feel suffocated like slugging with petroleum based products does, but does the job of being the barrier to everything attacking the skin.Each time I use this on top of my regular skincare routine, I do not need to use much at all to cover the face and neck as it spreads very well, and I can visibly see my irritated, flushed and disturbed skin go from bright pink to my normal skin color in mere minutes. I also feel the heat from my face reduce to a normal temperature shortly after applying it as well. So this is the perfect skin rescue as I was able to keep my skin from staying upset after the night with this on. I was able to wake up everyday to being able to prepare my skin for the battle of the day without any sign or feeling of my skin being angry at me despite the stress of travel, not eating well, wearing makeup all day, and having to wakeup super early (which always leaves my skin an inflamed mess by the end of the day).I also love using the F.A.B Arnica rescue pack, and the only sensorial difference is in the application experience as F.A.B is much more acutely cooling immediately upon application and spreads on a bit thicker. I love both equally, I just choose which feeling I want on my skin that night. I will be using this regularly and keep it in my bag for skin emergencies from now on. The hype for this brand may be about their lip masks, but they clearly know what they are doing for skin overall - highly impressed Perfect rescue for distressed skin
