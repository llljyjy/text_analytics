Unfortunately seems like any time I find a moisturizer I finally like, they change the formula. I really, really loved the dewiness of the old formula, how well it sat under my makeup, and how my skin felt moisturized for hours and hours. I gave this a try with high hopes, and it’s nowhere near the same unfortunately. This new packaging looks nice but it’s too bulky for the little product I’m getting. nan
