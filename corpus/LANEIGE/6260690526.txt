I wouldn’t necessarily say it’s a sleep mask. It’s definitely not. But it is wonderful. I use this in the day time as well. It’s gives your lips a nice soft look. I HATE chapsticks, lipgloss, pretty much anything that goes on your lips, but I enjoy this. It’s not sticky and messy. It has made my lips feel a million times better in the winter. The scent is not overbearing. It’s a nice soft smell to it. I will purchase again :) Wonderful
