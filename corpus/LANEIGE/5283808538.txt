I tried this first when it was the old formula/packaging, Nov 2021. I loved it, kept me moisturized all day, didnâ€™t sting, and the fragrance was not strong at all. I ordered this one and I am soooo disappointed. The smell is so strong its like perfume, which now stings my skin (not sure if that is what is causing it or other changes). The moister does not stay in my skin like it used to, and its honestly just become a really expensive product that does nothing special for me. I am pretty disappointed with this because I LOVE 98% of my laneige products. If it is going to be marketed for sensitive, dry skin, then this is definitely not living up to that. Old formula was better
