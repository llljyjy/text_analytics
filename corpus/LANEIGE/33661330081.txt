I received a sample of this with a product I bought from Sephora. I absolutely loved it and knew I had to order it. It is clear on the skin and makes my face feel so silky soft and hydrated. It says to wash off in the morning, but I leave it on under my makeup at times. I will continue to use this! Highly recommend. Super soft skin
