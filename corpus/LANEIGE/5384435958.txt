Love this product. I’ve been putting it on the past couple of nights before bed and I’ve been waking up with hydrated skin. It’s also super light weight, absorbs quickly, and smells AMAZING - like some type of flower. I got it as a sample with my Sephora points and will be buying a full size when I run out. love it
