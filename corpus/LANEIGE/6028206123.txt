I received this product for free from TopBox Circle in exchange for my honest review. I absolutely love this serum. First, the packaging is adorable, however it uses a lot of plastic, so Iâ€™m hoping there is a refillable option in the early future. This formula is wonderful- it leaves my skin feeling hydrated all day without that greasy feeling. I believe this serum is perfect for all skin types, including sensitive skin. This line of products is hypoallergenic and made with hyaluronic acid. Especially love the fact the product is free from a lot of toxics and harmful ingredients- such as parable a, formaldehydes etc. My skin is hydrated and left looking firm and dewy. I highly recommend this product! Amazing Serum!
