I love this Laneige Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer. I suffer from combo skin with hormonal acne. I immediately noticed how soft, smooth, and moisturized my skin skin looked and felt after using this. I absolutely love the container with the spatula also. This absorbs really well also. I was gifted by Laneige in exchange for my honest review. Great Moisturizer!
