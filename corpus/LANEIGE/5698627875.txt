Love everything about it! The packaging is obviously the best part, like you don’t have to dig your fingers in the balm but also the piña colada scent is yummy! I also feel like it has an invigorating, minty feeling when you first apply it which feels nice. It’s a nice shiny finish and easily spreads on the lips. I took off a star because this product vanishes super quick from the lips. I don’t expect the product to stay 100% if I’m eating or drinking something but this just disappears really quick with just a sip of water. I like it
