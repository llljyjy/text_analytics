Absolutely love this product for overnight wear. I have very cracked, dry lips in the winter that bleed (to be fair, I also pick at them) and when I put this on, I wake up with soft, velvety lips the next day. Highly recommend for night-time use. Possibly a bit too thick for my liking to use in the daytime. nan
