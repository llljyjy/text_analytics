I just received my order two days ago. I used this product for the first time last night. I probably used a little too much because I didn’t realize how far a little bit actually goes. My lips instantly felt hydrated. They were starting to crack from the never ending manitoba winter we’re having. I typically use sun bum SPF 30 sun screen lip balm throughout the day which is great to prevent lip cancer but it doesn’t give the hydration my lips crave, nothing does or so I thought. This product is AMAZING! I woke up to hydrated plump lips like I’ve never experienced before! They’re so soft too! They haven’t felt dry at all today and the cracking has subsided already! New holy grail product for me! I was on the fence after reading some reviews here, I’m glad I tried it for myself! Highly recommend
