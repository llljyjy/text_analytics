This product broke my skin out. I assume due to the vitamin C being repeatedly exposed to the air/light every single time you open up the jar? It’s also STRONGLY scented in a way that tries to be citrus butler reminiscent of chemicals. It’s kind of moisturizing, but it leans more to greasy. It seems to just sit on the skin and make it slippery. I don’t have oily skin so I don’t see why it wouldn’t do that. Caused breakouts/greasy/chemical smell
