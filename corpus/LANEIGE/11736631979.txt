This lip balm saved me from crusty and dehydrated lips. I had received a birth control shot which destroyed my skin and dried the crap out of my lips, especially the upper one to the point where I could easily peel the skin off. I used to use the normal Laneige lip sleeping mask, but would wake up to flaky and cracked lips. Using this treatment lip balm instead worked so much better. I would wake up with a more hydrated, less cracked, and plump lips. Did I mention it smells like watermelon jolly rancher/hubba bubba gum? Saved my lips!
