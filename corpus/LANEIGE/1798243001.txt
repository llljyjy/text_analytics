I love the modern looking packaging. If you are like me and hate sticking your fingers into moisturizers,  you will appreciate the plastic spatula which is also included. At first the container was a little tricky to open (twist and lift) but once I figured out how to open it, it is really easy to open. The moisturizer is creamy and smooth with a light natural scent. It absorbs extremely fast without leaving behind any type of residue on the skin. My dry skin always craves moisture and this moisturizes does exactly what I need it to do! My skin instantly feels hydrated, moisturized, and extremely soft after use. [Gifted by Laneige in exchange for my honest review] nan
