Gifted by Laneige.I have really dry skin and this moisturizer hydrates my skin fast and it does last. It leaves my skin moisturizer and dewy.Itâ€™s very light, absorbs well with a very mild almost unnoticeable scent for me.I have been using for about a week now and all I have gotten is hydration. I have not see any other results, no firming, no smoothing, no softness, maybe with continued use I will get these.I love shape of the jar and the little dipping stick. This product is elegantly packaged. very hydrating
