I received this product complimentary from Laneige in exchange for my honest review. This is a great sunscreen to wear alone or under makeup. It applys very easily and gives such nice hydration and glow. I find that my putting my foundation over this works really well and blends nicely. Best of all is there isnâ€™t that white residue you typically get with sunscreens. nan
