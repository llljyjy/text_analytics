I’m one of those people who just do skincare in the morning and nothing else. so I cannot speak to how this works with makeup. However I really do not like this product. I let all my serums and moisturizer set in before I put this on as my last step. This product is very sticky/tacky. I feel like I can’t touch my face all day because this just won’t dry down. I spend all day excited to wash my face to get this stuff off  I do not recommend this product. Find something else
