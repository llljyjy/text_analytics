This mask is amazing. I have super sensitive skin and I also suffer from hormonal acne, and I’ve had the hardest time finding a moisturizer that works. ( I use this as my every day moisturizer, year round.) it’s fragrance free which is great. It’s super gentle on the skin, It calms any redness and irritation down. My skin looks so much clearer because of this. My skin also feels soft and supple when I use this. I 10/10 recommend. just bought my second jar
