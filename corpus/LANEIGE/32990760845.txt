I received this a gift from a friend. I have dry lips and sometimes my lip balm isn’t enough to moisturize them. This lip mask has my lips feeling supple and soft by the morning, and I always use it when my lips are in need of it. I would give it 5 stars, but the only reason I wouldn’t purchase this myself is because Laneige isn’t cruelty free :( not cruelty free
