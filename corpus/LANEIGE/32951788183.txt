I’m pretty sure a lot of people, like me, thought this looked like an AirPods case from the front haha. The cream itself is just thick and moisturizing enough for night use during the spring weather. For me, it’s a little too greasy during the day, since my skin type has been more combination leaning oily. Overall, I still like this cream, but it is on the pricier side for only 50 mL. I received this product complimentary from Laneige. nan
