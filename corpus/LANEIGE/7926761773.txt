I have not tried the new formula since it’s switched over but I live for this moisturizer it’s a literal drink of water for your skin. It’s super hydrating yet light for those summer days where you need a little extra help from the sun… it’s just fantastic! It plumps any fine lines or dryness in the skin it’s worked well for me and for my mom so it’s very adaptable to different types of skin! nan
