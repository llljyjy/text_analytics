I have been a loyal Laneige customer for a long time. I swore by the water bank moisturizer because it completely changed the texture of my skin for the better. HOWEVER- this new formulation is complete garbage. I have combination skin but I never in my life have had dry patches on my face. When I first used the new formulation I noticed a huge difference from the old formula. My skin felt fine initially- but within an hour I felt dry and I had FLAKES OF SKIN on my face. Not to mention I started breaking out. I don’t have acne prone skin, I’ve never had an issue with acne. This was a complete let down from Laniege and I won’t be a retuning customer to their brand.In my opinion the closest replacement I could find (a bit pricier) was Tatcha’s water cream. And it’s my new favorite now. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY
