I love to use this to target my wrinkle-prone areas, especially my crows feet. The retinol helps with keeping the wrinkles at bay but this product is also very hydrating. My skin feels firm and supple with this spot treatment. I havenâ€™t noticed any adverse affects nor irritation. Best ingredients!
