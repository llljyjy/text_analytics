At first I was a little bit skeptical because of the price and I figured vaseline does the same exact thing. I WAS SO WRONG. This mask leaves your lips so smooth and shiny like no other mask/gloss can ever do. It lasts about 3-4 hours on me during the day and all throughout the night, leaving me with plumped lips in the morning! Try it atleast once and I promise you will keep rebuying!! Definitely a must-have!
