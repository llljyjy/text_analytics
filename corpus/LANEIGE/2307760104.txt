Holy grail lip product! I never write reviews, but I love this darn thing so much. I actually use this more as my everyday “lip balm“ rather than a mask. I generally hate normal lip balms because I feel like they make my lips worse off -- even if it helps in the moment, it makes my lips more sensitive/prone to dryness and creates a dependency on them that drives me nuts. But this product makes my lips so so soft and hydrated without any of that. I use a very light layer of this during the day and just it looks like a pretty gloss, and then a thicker layer of it at night as a mask whenever I need some extra hydration. If I forget about it and don’t use it for a week or two, my lips still feel really good unlike with regular chapstick. Not to mention it smells sooo nice. Game-changer for Those Who Hate Lip Balms
