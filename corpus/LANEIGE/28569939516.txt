I love this product as a finishing touch to my PM skin routine- after my toner, oil, moisturizer- then this. A little of this product goes a long way with me- it absorbs into skin very quickly. I use it more like 3-4 times a week instead of the recommended 1-2 but I donâ€™t see any negative side effects or anything from doing that. Nice addition to PM skincare routine
