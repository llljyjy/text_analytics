Okay: 29, clear skin that is combination normal/dry in patches. THIS IS AMAZING. I got a sample of this with my last order on Sephora and I love it. I’ve been laying in bed for the last hour with this on my face marvelling at how quickly it fixed how dry I am!! It’s -30 Celsius where I am and my face has been so dry for two weeks now I can’t get anything to work and then this bad boy came along! Can’t wait to see how my face looks in the morning.Side note: doesn’t seem like I’ll break out, but luckily I don’t easily. BUY this for winter/dry skin
