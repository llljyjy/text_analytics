This is a great low fuss, no mess mask! Way simpler than a sheet mask or something you have to let sit and wash off. I use this after cleaning my face before bed and it absorbs nicely and dries to a smooth soft finish, no stickiness at all! When i wash my face in the morning, my skin is soft and hydrated. This also layers really well over serums, I pair it with hyaluronic acid to up the moisture. I find the fragrance a little strong, but once it dries, it does fade pretty quickly. Great for the dry winter months
