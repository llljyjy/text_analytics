I received this Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Cream Moisturizer complimentary from Laniege in exchange for my honest review. This is such a creamy moisture rich formula that it leaves your skin very hydrated upon using. It soaks into your skin immediately providing relief to your areas that need it most on your skin. I love that it comes with a spoon to get the product out of the package as well. I suffer from skin that dries out on my face but this leaves it fully moisturized after using and isnâ€™t oily at all. Very moisture rich formula & creamy
