The texture is really unpleasant. It feels like sunscreen and it pills. It feels like there’s a film on your face, as if it doesn’t absorb well. The packaging is also terrible. The cream gets stuck under the ledges so you have to search for it which isn’t really clean when using your fingers. So you definitely have to use a scoop for it. It’s overpriced too for the amount you get. Weird texture and packaging
