I have been wearing the sunscreen for a week straight, 6 out of days under my makeup. The texture is thick and the sunscreen feels a little sticky, like primer. It has a fragrance that I feel luxury skincare has, very light. I make sure to lather on a lot of sunscreen and compared to other brands I’ve used, it is very hydrating. Since I have combo skin, it definitely can make my makeup look a little oily if I don’t use powders or use other hydrating products I am enjoying this sunscreen
