After I used this for my fine lines under my eyes , I saw very good results. Fine lines are getting very smooth, hydrated and day to day it is about fading. I try this every other day in the first week and started with small amount of the product. I am in my second week and I liked this rational cream. Overall this is working and I am happy. Great for fine lines
