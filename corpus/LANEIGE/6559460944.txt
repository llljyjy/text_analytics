Love this product! It is so light and smooth. It says you can use it morning and evening but I love making it part of my evening skin care routine. It smells fantastic and I was worried that it would sting my skin like other scented products have in the past but it doesnâ€™t at all. 10/10 would get again! It will definitely stay a part of my regular skincare routine!!! Love it!
