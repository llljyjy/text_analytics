Love love love!!! Have been using twice daily for a week now smells amazing but not too overpowering and very refreshing on the skin I’ve noticed brighter and softer skin already I can’t wait to continue using it!! Product is very watery so best to use on a cotton pad I only use 3 pumps instead of the recommended 5 at night and find it’s more than enough product, sleek glass bottle and pump top, even has days marked on the side so you can track your use, will be repurchasing 100% definitely worth the price in my opinion!!! #freeproduct #trywithtopbox LOVE!!
