I received this as a #freeproduct. I really like the packaging. The pump is generous, I like to use my hands to apply liquid products like toner and find that one pump is plenty. Plus the product goes further as they recommend up to 5 pumps, which I think is really excessive, but do what feels best for you!Nice fresh light scent and dries down quickly so you can move on to the next step of your routine. As for brightening results, I haven’t seen much improvement with my dark spots from acne scars etc. therefore I’m giving it 4 stars but I’m not expecting a miracle so overall I really like this product! Refreshing step to the skincare routine
