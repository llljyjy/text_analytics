This is my ride or die!! I use this product as lip balm, a lip mask overnight, and I even like using it as a subtle but fresh looking lip gloss. I love the way it makes my lips look super healthy and plump and it stays on my lips for awhile without needing to reapply shortly after. The tub lasts for a long time so it’s definitely a great value for the cost. I recommend this product to everyone and truly have no complaints. They even include a cute little applicator if you’re not a fan of dipping your finger into tubs. My ride or die!!
