in order for it to squeeze out a tube it obviously won’t be as thick as the sleeping mask, however the formula is practically the same. I got the berry shade and it leaves just the faintest color but still looks very natural. It’s definitely heavier than most lip balms (I actually like that) but I love the way it feels and looks on my lips; smooth, hydrated, and lushes. I gave it 4 starts cause I still prefer my Aquaphor for morning and night. would repurchase
