i LOVE this. this is a perfect moisturizer for the summertime. it fees lightweight and cooling somehow. it absorbs right into the skin with out leaving any sort of film or greasiness. the texture is so interesting but it feels great when it applies to your skin. would definitely recommend the gel for anyone who is looking for something that wonâ€™t be thick! whoa
