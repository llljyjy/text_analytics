I have never tried gel moisturizers so I was estatic to receive this product. The packaging is super cute and compact and the product is phenomenal. It is super light but very moisturizing. It doesn’t leave a sticky residue and it layers well with my other skincare products, like my facial oil. Also, the scent isn’t overwhelming which I appreciate. Gifted by Laneige. nan
