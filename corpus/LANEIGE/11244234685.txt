For a year I’ve been into Lancôme’s pink toner - it made my skin feel refreshed without leaving residue which I like. However, I finally decided to give this toner a try and there’s no going back. This has moisturized my face more in a few uses than the year of using Lancôme’s toner. It has this beauty milky formula that smooths over the skin and leaves a slight layer of moisture that is not sticky but slightly tacky, which I love. My skin doesn’t just feel damp or dewy but after a day of heavy makeup and makeup cleanser my skin was so happy with my decision. It’s the next day and wow, hydration I never knew a toner could provide. This is a fraction of the cost of my jumbo toner, with ultra hydration and minimal fragrance, I understand now why TikTok skincare experts love this product. I will say it smells like horchata, I’m obsessed with it but if you’re sensitive to any fragrance this might not be it for you. I can’t keep swiping my soft cheeks, highly recommend. Oh Wow
