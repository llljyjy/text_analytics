I got this product #free from #topboxcircle. I was soooo excited to try it . First of all the packaging is so nice. Gorgeous really. I started using it during the day after my meowing showers. It went on smooth and made my skin feel very hydrated. I have combination skin so by the end of the day , my skin was quite oily. This happens with a lot of products. I do love this cream so much and recommend it! The only downfall for me is the scent. Iâ€™m sensitive to strong scents so for me it was just a little too much. Great product- amazing packaging.
