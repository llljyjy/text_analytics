After starting accutane I needed something stronger than a regular lip balm / Vaseline to help with my extremely dry lips. This sleeping mask was recommended to me by a Sephora employee and my God it has helped so much. For anyone struggling with accutane side effects with their lips, this mask can even be worn during the day and applied as a balm/gloss. A little goes a long way too so it really is priced well for how much you get! Great for accutane users! Saved my very dry lips
