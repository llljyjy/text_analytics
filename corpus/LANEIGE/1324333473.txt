First off, a disclaimer: If you have dry skin and like thick creamy moisturizers, this is NOT the product for you. Seriously, don’t waste your money here. Just move on and buy something else. But! If you have oily and/or dehydrated skin and prefer gel moisturizers, you will probably LOVE this moisturizer! It has a wonderful gel consistency, similar to Clinique’s Moisture Surge 100H Moisturizer. It absorbs more quickly than the Clinique, however, making it a better option to layer under makeup. (Yes, I use this Laneige moisturizer both morning and night, not just as a sleeping mask.) Maybe it absorbs more quickly because it includes squalane, which mimics your skin’s natural oils, whereas Clinique uses aloe and hyaluronic acid? Not sure. Regardless, this product leaves my skin soft, plump, and dewy. I love it! After cleansing, I spritz my face with a skin mist and pat on a few drops of hyaluronic acid serum. Then I seal in all that moisturizing goodness with this product. The end result? My skin looks and feels better than it has been in years. Again, love it! 10/10, would recommend! HOLY GRAIL FOR OILY &/OR DEHYDRATED SKIN!!!
