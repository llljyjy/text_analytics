One of my all time favorites. Absolutely loved this product. The smell and flavor is not overpowering but perfect for vanilla. It’s not to heavy to where it’s gummy & it really moisturizes the lips. I usually only use it at night because of its use and it stays on longer. 10/10 I have it in grapefruit too! nan
