This is one of the best products i have ever used for my lips and it lasted a lot of time. I have read a lot of reviews here saying that this product is a lip balm which is not, this is a lip sleeping mask people need to read before using. there is a huge difference between a lip balm and lip mask starting to say that a lip mask is applied generously to the lips in the evening and leave on overnight and gently wipe off excess in the morning. The lip balm is applied to the lips in the morning and throughout the day as needed. Lip balms may be our go to for a quick hit of hydration throughout the day. That being said Laneige lip mask fulfills its duty and makes my lips plummer and better looking. I have lip injections and this has extended the durability of them also prevents my skin from cracking or chapping and keeps my lips hydrated. This is a lip mask not a lip balm and works 10/10
