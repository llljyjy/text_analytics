I am so happy to receive this retinol from Laneige. I have been using retinol for years now and it’s been a staple in my skincare routine. This retinol cream is very lightweight, non-irritating and very hydrating. It looks like it made my skin radiant, firmer and glowing. I have a combination skin with fine lines and I can’t wait for the final results of using this retinol and making it part of my daily skincare routine. Overall, I recommend it! Skincare must have!
