I was not enthused when I finally purchased a full sized container of the Waterbank Cream moisturizer. I have received several trial sizes of this moisturizer in the past which was the original formula. When I finally bit the bullet to buy this product it was no where to be found. Upon asking an associate I was informed that the company was possibly going to release a new version. Well I wasnâ€™t mad about that. I mean what could the company do to make it better than it was? I absolutely loved the consistency and light scent of the original formula so when I finally got my hands on this jar and tried it out I was extremely disappointed. The product is not as moisturizing, the container is inconvenient to open and close and the price went up but my satisfaction went down. If I wanted a lighter consistency I could have purchased the alternative moisturizer gel. Miss the Original Formula !!
