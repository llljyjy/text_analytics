I genuinely don’t understand how this can be classified as a hydrating mask. the texture is fantastic and applies very nicely on the skin. however, it immediately dissolves into the skin leaving your skin feeling extremely dry to the touch. i’ve tried applying it alone and with a moisturizer, even with another hydrating mask underneath and it did the exact same thing ... it left my skin 10x drier than it was before. it completely sucks the moisture out of your skin. i wanted so badly to love this product and was hoping the new formulation would be better and more hydrating but sadly it was not. if you want genuine hydration/moisture go for the summer friday’s jet lag instead! want Sahara desert skin? buy this
