Amazing product. This mask has a gel-like texture and applies smoothly. It has a nice cooling effect once applied and light scent. This product absorbs well and it does not feel sticky or greasy. I apply this after my moisturizer at night and my skin feels hydrated and smooth. Itâ€™s great for dry skin especially during the winter. I love the packaging and the little spatula.   #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Hydrating Mask
