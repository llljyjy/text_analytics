I have combo skin, leaning a bit more on the dry side -- I received a mini of this in a birthday reward set, and it makes my skin so unbelievably oily, it’s like I’m in high school again. Even my dry patches are oil central! I love the laneige lip products, but I don’t think I’ll be trying their skin care again Makes me oily
