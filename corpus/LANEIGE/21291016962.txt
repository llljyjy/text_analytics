I have never used a lip mask before, but this is just so luxurious that I will have to repurchase it in the future. It glides on so smoothly, leaving my lips feeling rich and softened. My lips were so rough, chapped, and itchy prior to using this due to the cold weather, but after a couple days of use, my lips had never felt better. Now Iâ€™m using it daily even just as a normal lip balm. The smell and texture is addicting, and it is so worth it. Best thing since sliced bread
