The Good: I’ve been reaching for this stuff for 3-4 years straight which is truly impressive and speaks for itself. I have tried both the Berry and Vanilla versions (and finished several jars of each) and anytime a large sale rolls around I usually toss one into my cart. The product smell is an overall HUGE hit (except for the Gummy Bear scent that smells horrific to me and is their only true miss in the scent category). One of the top perks is just how yummy this smells on the lips, I reach for it often during times when my lips just need a little bit of a pick-me-up. This is a light-weight type of product, not what you’d expect out of something labeled a “mask“ but I do enjoy how glide-able it is on the lips in comparison to thicker masks/balms. The jar is extremely durable and its easy to tag it along inside a bag or even on airline travels. I also noticed over the years that I oftentimes bring this along on plane rides with me, it’s a godsend for that dry airplane air (if you know, you know). The Bad: As previously stated the Gummy Bear scent is something you should avoid if you actually like gummy bears because it smells way more like children’s cough syrup to me. Also, I have to say I would NOT consider this a mask. If you are looking for something to combat HARSH northern winters this simply won’t cut it most of the time and you need to purchase a different product. I would consider this more of a hydrating lip “cream“ as opposed to a mask and I really think that would be a more appropriate labeling for this product. The Ugly/Honest: This product lasts a long time which is great but the fact that you have to dig your finger into this to get product is a little off-putting. I know they used to come with a little tiny plastic scooper (maybe they still do) but it’s so tiny and flimsy that I always end up losing mine somewhere to no avail. Overall, this is a decent product but it’s NOT a lip mask. I Love This Stuff, But Here's The HONEST Review...
