These are hands down, the best thing to ever happen to my lips. I use it every day and it still lasts forever. As in a year or longer. I got the peppermint because I missed out last year. It smells like Christmas and Iâ€™m obsessed. Iâ€™ve tried the original, gummy bear, sweet candy and peppermint and I can say that Gummy Bear and Peppermint are my favorites. just purchased my fourth one!
