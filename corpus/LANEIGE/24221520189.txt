I have received this product for free from TopBox in exchange for my honest opinion. This serum is packed with Hyaluronic Acid, Peptides and Green Tea Enzyme which work together to provide long-lasting hydration, firm the skin and gently exfoliate. The gel-like texture is very lightweight and refreshing, and my dehydrated skin literally drinks it up. It is not sticky and it works well under the Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Cream, without pilling. It has a subtle scent, which dissipates quickly upon application. After a few weeks, my skin feels more hydrated and plump, and looks brighter. Highly recommended! #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Great serum for dehydrated skin!
