I will never admit how much this small tube of balm costs, but it is a game changer and the only thing that not only prevents moisture loss but, I think, repairs lips. I purchase twice annually during VIB sales, and since I’ve started carrying these with me at all times, I’ve not had any cracking, bleeding Minnesota winter lips. I’ve had these in every color/flavor; purple (gummy bear?) is by far the strongest scent and a bit overpowering, to be honest, but every other one had been a lovely, mild sort of scent. Highly recommend! worth the exorbitant price
