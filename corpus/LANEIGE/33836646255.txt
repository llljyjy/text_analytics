I cannot say enough great things about this amazing moisturizer. It’s got the most luxurious consistency, is so soothing to irritated skin, didn’t cause any breakouts (actually they’ve decreased), calmed the redness, and just makes my skin feel so nice and plump. I’m on tretinoin and dealing with dry, flaky skin as well as some new annoying breakouts and this has been the ONLY thing to work for me. I will truly never be without it. Also, if you’ve tried slugging and just didn’t like it or it felt too heavy, try this! It’s not ‘occlusive’ like petrolatum products are but as a last step it does feel like it’s sealing all the moisture in overnight. 10/10 recommend!! The absolute best for retinol irritation!
