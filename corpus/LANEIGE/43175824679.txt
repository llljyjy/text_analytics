This is the best lip mask that I have ever used!!! It is so long-lasting that I wake up looking like I just applied it. The scents are just strong enough to get whiffs throughout the wear. I try to use it every night but if I miss a few days the next time I use it you can see the layers of dead skin come off so quickly in the morning. This will be a part of my routine forever! Don't just get 1, get 2!
