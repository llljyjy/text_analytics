I love laneige lip sleeping masks and I’ve bought everyone but the grapefruit since I don’t like grapefruit at all. That said I’m not sure why people are rating a LIP product terrible because they are eating it..? I get it my accidentally get in your mouth being it’s on your lips but I’ve literally never had this problem and I don’t lick my lips plus licking your lips isn’t good  for you just makes me wonder. I can’t say enough good things about laneige lip masks they are honestly the best and I’ve tried many . it’s not food!
