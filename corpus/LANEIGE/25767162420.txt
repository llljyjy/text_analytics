I love Laneige products so I was very excited to try LANEIGE Radian-C Brightening Treatment Essence #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox! It is vey “runny” and comes out fast. You honestly need a very small amount on your face!!! I like to use at night, and my face still looks bright and radiant in the morning! It dries fairly quickly and doesn’t leave your face feeling oily at all just nice and soft, toned and bright! All what I expected from laneige! Plus the bottle is beautiful and love that it’s glass not plastic! Glowing skin day and night
