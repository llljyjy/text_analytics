I was referred to this product by a Sephora employee and I am in love! I was looking for a moisturizer to help with my redness, but didn’t want to break my bank toooo much. She mentioned that this product has cica, which is the key ingredient in what “cicapair“ has for their products that aids redness. Additionally, she said that even though this product is marked as a sleeping mask, it can be used as a moisturizer for day and night. I have rosacea in my cheeks, and this has drastically helped the redness in my face! I love the little spatula it comes with too:) highly recommend!! Perfect for Redness!
