I really enjoy the formula, it is a gel cream that stays in place where you apply it and doesn’t run into your eyes. Despite being a gel, it is also fairly hydrating and doesn’t dry down tight and uncomfortable like some eye gels do. However I would not purchase the full size because the fragrance is overWHELMING. If you are sensitive to fragrance or dont want to smell your eye cream an hour after putting it on, don’t buy. good formula, TOO much fragrance
