I love the texture of this sunscreen! It’s lightweight, blends easily into the skin, and is moisturizing. It leaves a naturally dewy finish, doesn’t leave a white cast, and does not pill underneath makeup or sting my eyes. $30 is on the pricey side for a sunscreen but this is very enjoyable to use. *gifted by Laneige nan
