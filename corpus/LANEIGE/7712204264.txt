I got this from #Topboxcirlce #Freeproduct to try for my review. First, the orange packaging and bottle really stands out. The texture isnâ€™t oily and my face adsorb it well. It has a nice scent to it too. I used it in the morning and also applied sun cream due to brightening was one of the key thing in this essence. nan
