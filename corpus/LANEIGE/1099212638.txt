I received complimentary from Laneige! This is there new dewy cream powered byvery good ingredients: Blue Hyaluronic Acid: Delivers effective, long-lasting hydration. Squalane and Ceramide: Provide nourishing moisture. I like the packing is so pretty, sky blue! Very cooling feel! it is very easy open design, just one turn! So simple! It comes with a small applicator, which is quite clean, so that when I take the cream, It might not afraid of contaminating other cream inside the jar! It has a tropical scent more like fruity smell! It is a heavy gel cream texture! It absorbed quickly! Not greasy! My skin feels so hydrating, smoothing, and soft! My skin also feels frimer and bouncier! I think it is good for combination skin use! Hydrating cream moisturizer
