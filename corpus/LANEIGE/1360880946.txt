Fair, oily, acne-prone skin here. I live in humid, sunny coastal Florida. I cannot even look at most SPFs without breaking out. (Don’t even get me started on physical sunscreen.)I have been wearing this daily for two months and I am hooked. Not only have I not broken out, but my skin also looks better than before I started. I have been getting compliments on how clear and glowy it is... for me, that’s huuuuuge.I use this as my AM moisturizer + makeup primer, going on right over my vitamin C serum. If you have normal-oily skin, you will not need additional moisture. (Cannot speak for drier skin types.) The finish is definitely glowy on me, so there are times I use a little more powder to knock down the shine. But it’s not a dealbreaker, because it helps my makeup melt into my skin and dry down to a lovely natural finish. And as for actually protecting from sunburns, etc-- it works! I cannot believe how many times I’ve been burned after being outside 15 minutes with a fresh face of $30-70 sunscreens. I have a lot more confidence this one will help with antiaging, because I don’t get burned with it on. EVERYTHING breaks me out, except this.
