Iâ€™ve been using this product for the last three weeks and I have nothing but good things to say about this product. The smell is great, not overpowering. It has really helped my skin glow more as well as keeping my face moisturized. I would use this product first and then I used the Laneige Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Cream Moisturizer! I typically use this twice a day, once in the morning, and once when I finished showering! #freeproduct Love This Product!
