After a picture in which I looked gray thanks to my old SPF, I went out searching for something that wouldn’t leave a cast and I found Laneige’s Hydro UV Defense. It’s creamy and it doesn’t make me look like I died and no one told me. As a dark-skinned Black person, it’s hard to find a good SPF, but this is it. OMG! I love this stuff!
