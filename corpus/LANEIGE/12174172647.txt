A bit pricey, but a little goes a long way, and it comes with a lot. I bought this because of a sample I received from Sephora, which honestly seemed to work better than this full size. I would give this 3.5 stars if I could. Does have a fairly noticeable fragrance, which doesn’t bother me, but it could be a bit much for some. It also seems to have a slightly pink color, so my husband wasn’t crazy about it when he tried it. nan
