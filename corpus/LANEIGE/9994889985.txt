I purchased this product some time ago and LOVE it! Has helped me soo much with keeping my lips from cracking and peeling. Sadly just found out that they come with an applicator from watching someone else use it as mine never did. Always thought it was strange that I had to use my fingers and wondered why it never came with one… just turns out I never received it. Would recommend 10/10 just make sure yours includes the applicator! There’s an applicator?!
