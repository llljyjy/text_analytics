Okay time for me to finally review this. I originally purchased this one year and three months ago and I’m still not done with the pot. I use it at least twice a day if not more and it’s amazing. It’s perfect for an overnight mask or to moisturize before a lip product. It’s much more hydrating than their glowy balm but that’s another good product. If for some reason you’re having a hard time purchasing, GO FOR IT! It is absolutely worth it, $20 for a years worth of amazing lip mask. can’t recommend enough
