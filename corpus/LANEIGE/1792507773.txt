I received this product complimentary from Laneige in exchange for my honest review. I love sunscreens so anytime I get to try a new one I get excited. The texture of this sunscreen is so soft and it sinks into your skin. It also felt very hydrating but not shiny which I love since I have combination to oily skin. The scent was very nice it had a hint of sunscreen smell and was not overbearing. Best part of all it did not leave a white cast for me! I canâ€™t wait to use this a lot more often! nan
