I’ve been using this essence consistently for the last 3 weeks and I’m loving what it’s done for my skin! First off, I’m a sucker for nice packaging and I love how it’s bright orange and comes with a pump for easy application. It has a nice citrusy scent, which is lovely for my morning skincare routine. This product has given me a nice glow and polished completion, giving an overall brightness. My face looks really glowy and I feel like my overall complexion has brighten up my skin.I experienced no sort of breaking out despite having sensitive skin!I’m very much satisfied with the product, and will likely be buying it again!I received this product from #trywithtopbox as a #freeproduct in exchange for my honest opinion Lovely product
