Love how this feels, texture and scent are amazingggg. A bit too light for winter for me. I am about a month in and havenâ€™t noticed my change in radiance or dark spots. Also not a lot of product. I am tbd to repurchase but if I do it will be for a normal day time moisturizer. I love Laneige products overall - the Cica sleeping mask is a fave. yes but no
