Felt zero difference in my skins hydration using this product and it left my skin feeling greasy, I used it about 4-5 times before I decided I wanted to return it.  They wouldn’t let me return it where I got it at Kohls bc I didn’t have a receipt and they couldn’t bring up my beauty insider on their computer to prove I bought it so I guess now I have to keep it Not worth the money
