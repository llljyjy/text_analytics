I have been using this serum for the past 3 weeks sometimes during the day but mainly at nights. I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox and I can say that I’m using this serum as a serum and moisturizer because it is so nice! The serum has a light floral scent to it, nothing too overpowering. The consistency is very smooth and one pump is able to cover my face and like I said it’s so moisturizing I don’t even put anything on top. I can see that my dull face is getting more plump (all the school stress is reversing). I’m excited to see what the results will be like in 3 months from now, but so far I’m liking what I see. Oh and kudos to their packaging. Very innovative! From dull to full
