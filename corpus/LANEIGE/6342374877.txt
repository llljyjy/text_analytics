I loved the texture and feel of this cream BUT I feel like it’s more for ppl with oily or extremely oily skin. I have combo skin leaning more toward the dry side and this made my mouth area very dry and flaky which never happens to me. So yea I would go with the cream version of this if you have normal-dry skin maybe even combo like mine (I’ve exchanged for the cream version but have yet to try it) Not Moisturizing Enough
