I love this so much. It is the most long lasting moisturizing stuff I’ve ever put on my lips and it smells like pina coladas. I put it on my lips before bed and when I wake up they’re still moisturized and look more plump. If this was a more aesthetic brand like dior this would be constantly sold out because this stuff is top tier and worth it. looooove
