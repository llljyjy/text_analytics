I have the pink one and the peppermint. I gave into the hype and the aesthetic of these and don’t get me wrong I feel like a cool girl using this but it’s just not worth the price. It’s glossy at first and does all that but 30 mins later my lips feel almost sticky and just like normal nothing special. If you really want it then buy it but just don’t expect too much. over hyped but cute
