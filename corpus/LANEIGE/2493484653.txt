great for the harsh dry winters. I switched from another serum that was leaving my skin dry. This toner + my current moisturizer leaves my face SO soft and moisturized it doesnâ€™t lose the feeling through a whole nights sleep. (My face is actually pretty oily in the morning, but better than dry.) super moisturizing!
