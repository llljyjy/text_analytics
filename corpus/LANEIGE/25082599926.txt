I’ll keep this short and to the point. I’ve tried almost every lip sleeping mask sold by Sephora and this is not the best. The vanilla smell is not sweet or strong, it’s kind of plastic or rubber chemical like. This unfortunately dose have an odd taste if it gets in your mouth too. It reminds me of the smell of the lip mask from Bite Beauty which honestly smells better, and the taste of almost a SPF lip balm. I’d recommend the Tatcha lip mask over this hands down. You don’t get as much but it works much better and it has no scent or taste and a very little amount goes a long way. This is ok for during the day though I guess. It’s ok but smells odd and isn’t really a “mask”
