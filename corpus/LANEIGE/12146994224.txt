I got this product because of the squalane upgrade. I had the original birthday sampler of the product and I enjoyed the feeling. The original version was nice cooling feel and was hydrating but not enough for a night cream. I was hoping the new upgrade would combat that. It doesn’t for night use. I put it on and it sinks in quick and feels smooth. I wake up with matte skin and not as hydrating and moisturizing as I hoped. I do see this more as a gel cream for summer or spring. To me, it’s not enough for winter or night use. Hydrating like a gel cream; not enough for night
