I got this as a sample and it smells really great, non irritating on chapped dry lips as well. Honestly one of the only lip balms that isnâ€™t annoying on my skin, I have literally only used eucerin and Vaseline after trying out several lip balms prior. Too bad it costs me portion of my kidney but might be worth LOL nan
