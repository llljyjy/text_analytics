I hate to say it, but this moisturizer is sub-par, at best. I don’t know if the formula changed or what but I used to really do well with this product but now I’m trying to finish it off quickly because I’m over it. It’s not moisturizing. It feels almost watery and it’s definitely lackluster. When I wear this I add a thin layer of Kiehl’s on top of it just so I can feel like I’m not wasting it, but also don’t have to feel like I need to reapply moisturizer during the day. I am such a fan of Laneige so I was very disappointed that this just isn’t good at all. nan
