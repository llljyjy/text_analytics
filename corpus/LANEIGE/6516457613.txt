I was sent this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox in exchange for my honest review. After using the Radian-C Brightening Treatment Essence my skin feels softer and looks a bit brighter. It has a water-like consistency, is very lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin. It also has a light citrus scent to it and I have been using one pump of it in my morning routine. nan
