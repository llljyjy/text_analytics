This is my first retinol product and I’m incorporating it slowly into my routine and haven’t experienced any irritation. It absorbs well into the skin and gives the right amount of hydration. Love how my skin feels bounces and smooth in the morning. Overall, I’m benefiting a lot from this product, can’t talk much about wrinkles or fine lines because mines are minor and I’m already preventing them. Newbie Friendly
