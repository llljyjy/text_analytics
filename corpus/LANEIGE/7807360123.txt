Horrible. Did not remove my makeup at all! Made my vision blurry. Itâ€™s basically white water. My recommendation is if you wear waterproof makeup get a product that has simmondisa as one of the higher up ingredients. This product does have it in it, but I think the amount is too small. why does this have good reviews?
