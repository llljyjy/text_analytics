I got the flavor gummy bear. I previously purchased the grapefruit flavor and loved it, just wanted to try something new. I was deciding between the berry and gummy bear flavor and my bf told me to get gummy bear. i was expecting some sort of sweet smell. this smells exactly the grape soda/grape flavored vape. if the scent was stronger it would make me nauseous. other than the smell, i still love this product. very moisturizing, non sticky, and glossy. a little goes a long way. this is the type of lip balm you always want to have on you. i prefer this over the lip sleeping mask any day.
