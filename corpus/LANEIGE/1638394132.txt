This is an excellent lightweight gel moisturizer full of tiny hyaluronic acid beads that melt on contact. I received this complimentary from Laneige and am so happy to try out this new release. It is suitable for normal,combinationand oily skin. As I have combination skin, I am loving this moisturizer since it is hydrating and refreshing without being too heavy for my skin. My face feels soft and smooth. I love that it is breathable and I think it will be good for spring/summer. I also think the new blue container is adorable and appreciate that an applicator is included. Excellent moisturizer for combination skin
