First of all the packaging is to die for. It’s so cool and futuristic! I’ve never seen any packaging like this. Lovely bottle. Really nice hydrating serum. Laneige always does a very good job of producing hydrating series such as the water bank series. So this is a newer better formula. I received this complimentary from Laneige in exchange for a review. Deep hydration serum!
