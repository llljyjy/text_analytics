i got the non squalane one in the bday gift, it was ok, not as hydrating as advertised. got this one thinking it would be more up to meeting the claims since it has squalane. my skin gets a little oily, by no means would i consider it dry. this “mask“ did nothing that I thought it would. It acts like a regular lightweight moisturizer so great for summer nights but definitely don’t see it as a super hydrating mask. there’s better options out there if you’re looking to build up hydration. Gave it 3 stars because it is nice and does something but not what it says it’s supposed to meh
