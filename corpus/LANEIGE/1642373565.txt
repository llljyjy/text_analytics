I’d like to start off saying I have been in love with this brand since Sephora introduced it back in 2021(?) and I received it as a birthday that January.  I fell in love with all the items in that birthday gift box and people were commenting shortly after about how beautiful my skin looked. I was sold. I had purchase I believe 2 bottles (not including the complimentary birthday set) of the Water Bank before they changed to this product. The packaging (plastic Jar) for a product that’s just under $40? The smell is different, that I noticed right away. The product isn’t bad but doesn’t feel the same going on. It’s not as smooth but more importantly the results are not as good. My skin doesn’t look as supple and creamy. Dare. Please bring back the original in the glass jar. Not the Same and not better
