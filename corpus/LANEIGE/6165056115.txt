pretty good moisturizer. does its job as a moisturizer. didnt really notice too much of a difference but my skin seemed more hydrated. I only issue is the container itself. when you are finishing up the product, itâ€™s hard to get all of the product out of the pot as there is a little ledge where the tool cannot access and even a qtip or finger can reach and I can only imagine how much product that can be wasted if you are not able to access it all. good product. need a new component.l nan
