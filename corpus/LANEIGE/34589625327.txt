I originally ordered this product as a mini, and in a matter of 2 weeks of using it regularly I knew I had to order the full size before I ran out. This product has miraculously transformed my skin. My skin has always been mixed with dry and oily patches and comedonal acne all along my neck/jawline and up to my cheeks. I’ve been using Laneige’s sleep mask as a last step in my skincare routine. I go to bed like a glazed donut and wake-up with my skin looking refreshed, moisturized, and ready for the day. I would highly recommend!! ( Honourable mention, the lip sleep mask is also to die for) Moisture Holy Grail!
