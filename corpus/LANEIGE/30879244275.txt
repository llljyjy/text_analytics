This yearâ€™s seasonal transitions have been brutal. My lips are constantly chapped and although vaseline used to do the trick, it only seems to make things worse now. My mom made me try this and it was a game changer. Over one night, my lips felt SO SOFT. Truly recommend it, especially during the winter! nan
