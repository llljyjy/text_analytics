I really really wanted to like this moisturizer. I was obsessed with the old formula it made my skin so hydrated and soft. However, this formula is drying and not as light. It is also very sticky and feels heavy. The fragrance is way too strong and it lingers. I want the old formula back, until then I will be looking for a new moisturizer :( the old formula was way better!!!!!!
