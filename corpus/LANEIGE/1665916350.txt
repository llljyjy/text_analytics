Pricey but it is worth it.  I rank this with BITE overnight lip scrub.  The scent is lovely and leaves one lips soft if one scrub lips gently with BITE  lip scrub  before applying Laneige lip sleeping mask -with a extra soft toothbrush or the pad of one finger.  Apply this lip mask throughout the night or whenever  one wakes up.  It will leave your lips very soft.  Believe me one will feel the difference. OKAY- for Spring/ Summer
