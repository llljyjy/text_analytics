The product is light and easily absorbed into skin, leaving it feeling hydrated  and soft, not greasy. Feels more expensive than it is! The package is well designed—attractive enough to leave out on vanity.   Extra plus is the light indicator when product is almost gone, so it’s easy to know when to restock. I may be buying another one soon because I think my mom may be stealing it from me!I received this product complimentary from Laneige. Excellent!
