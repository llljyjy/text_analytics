I love this retinol treatment! I recently started back retinol and this by far is favorite formula. It’s creamy, non-scented and very gentle on my sensitive skin. Im an check the ingredient list type of girl and I was so elated when I saw ingredients like peptides and hyaluronic! My skin also felt hydrated and bouncy right after each use and after a couple of weeks I can see small changes taking place on my forehead fine lines(that area looks plump!), I can’t wait for another few weeks to really see my results. Another thing I really like is the sleek and aesthetically pleasing packaging that was such a nice touch! Anyway I 10/10 recommend this. P.S please make a bigger one! I’m obsessed! I love how gentle this is!
