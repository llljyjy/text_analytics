This retinol comes in a really secure tube to ensure product freshness. I used the tiniest amount at first (size of a rice grain) to ensure that I wasn’t sensitive to the product. I’ve been using it every 3-4 days or so since I’m pretty sensitive to actives. So far so good. It does make my skin feel smooth, soft, and hydrated. I haven’t noticed any improvements in terms of fine lines and wrinkles yet though. nan
