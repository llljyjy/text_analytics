I love this sleeping lip mask! It is thick and smooth, and I find that in the morning there is still a little bit on my lips and they feel so moisturized! The original is my favorite so far as the taste and smell isnâ€™t overwhelming. I look forward to trying the gummy bear as I just repurchased that one! Holy Grail!
