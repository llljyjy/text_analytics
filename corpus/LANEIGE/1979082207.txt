I love this extra boost of hydration in combination with the water bank moisturizer! It’s a gel like consistency however it makes my fine lines fill in and my makeup nice and smooth because I have no skin dryness! I think it’s a worth while purchase to add for winter months or in the summer after too much sun exposure. It’s gentle and you can use it even when you break down your skin barrier with too many actives. This was gifted to me by Laneige for my honest review. Boost of hydration!
