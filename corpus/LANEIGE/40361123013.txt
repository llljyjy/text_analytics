I am absolutely in love with this product!Itâ€™s consistency is very light and it is super fast absorbent! It is not one of those sticky essences nor does it leave you with a stretchy skin sensation. I also love the refreshing feel that I get after applying it! The fragrance is not heavy at all and I believe my skin is so much brighter after I started using it!I have been using it as part of my daily skin care routine and I have been applying it twice a day, in the mornings and at night. It is most definitely a must-have and I absolutely love it!My LANEIGE Radian-C Brightening Treatment Essence was received as a #freeproduct from #topboxcircle. Such a refreshing product!
