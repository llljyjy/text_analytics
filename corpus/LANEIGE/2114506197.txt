I absolutely love the Laneige Treatment Balm and it’s a constant in my daily lip arsenal. At 70 years young I’ve tried everything ftom high-end to drugstore treatments and find this to be the very best. It does everything it says it will leaving your lips very plump and full. I’ve been blessed with fuller lips and known for my bold lip looks. I see a definite difference if I neglect to use this at night as my last beauty step, you’ll wake up with a gorgeous pouty lip look! I also wear it around the house during the day to help smooth and plump my lips, a little bit goes a long way and it lasts forever. I’m not a lip gloss girl but I can see this being worn by someone into just wearing a gloss instead of lipstick, it enhances your lips with its pearlescent shine. If you wear a liquid lipstick this is is must in your arsenal, no more dry peeling lips using Laneige, I swear by it. The Best Lip Balm Treatment!
