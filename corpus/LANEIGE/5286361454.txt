I am in LOVE with this sleep mask. I originally got it as a sample in a subscription box, and I now own 7 different flavors. Whenever they come out with a new seasonal color I have to get it. I’ve been plagued with dry lips my entire life and this is the only thing that’s ever made a bit of a difference. During the winter, I use the sleep mask during the day as well as a heavy duty balm. nan
