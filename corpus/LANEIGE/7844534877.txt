This mask makes me feel super bougie and well kept, but I feel like it doesn’t do anything too crazy in terms of lip hydration, my aquaphor is still my holy grail in that sector! It definitely makes my lips feel soft but not actually hydrated if that makes sense, it works best when I use it with a strong chapstick like aquaphor or carmex, because when the lip mask dries my lips end up feeling a bit dry themselves. Smells and tastes super good tho & I love putting it on before bed! I don’t hate this product but I’m not amazed by it either. Probably won’t buy again but I still have a lot left so we’ll see! Great for feeling fancy
