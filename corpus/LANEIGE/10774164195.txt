I received this product free from #Topbox in exchange for my honest opinion and review of the product! I’ve been using this Water Sleeping Mask almost every night over the past 4 weeks and am so happy with the results. I always have dry skin but during the winter months it becomes so dry that it gets unbearable at times. This product has helped sooo much in fixing my skin barrier! My skin feels so soft and hydrated when I wake up in the morning. I also have acne prone skin and this didn’t clog my pores or cause me the break out. The texture of the product is so smooth and silky and it just feels sooo good gliding this over my skin at night. Since it’s helped my skin barrier heal, I see a noticeable difference in my skins texture and overall appearance. My skin feels smoother and looks more bright and youthful. I would definitely recommend this product! #trywithtopbox #freeproduct Healed my damaged skin barrier!
