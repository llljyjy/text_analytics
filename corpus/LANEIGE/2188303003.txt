I like how this product goes on it feels hydrating at first  but I notice it seems to just not sink into the skin. It feels heavy and sticky on my skin and the scent I donâ€™t care for it smells like a rancid orange peel.I hade high hopes for this because I love the water mask moisturizer but I tend to use it at night but since this one is so heavy for day wear I may switch it up and use this one at night so I can hurry up and finish it up. Sticky and Heavy
