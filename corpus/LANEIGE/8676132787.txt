I really like this mask because it doesn’t break me out like a lot of other products do. It goes on pretty lightweight and smooth, when you wake up in the morning though it’ll feel like your skin is super dry because the mask like dries overnight? But once you wash it off your skin is so smooth and soft. I tried this during the day and by the end of the day my skin felt so dry cause the mask had hardened. So I recommend just don’t wear it during the day. great mask, just don’t use it during the day!
