Thanks to #trywithtopbox i got this #freeproduct! I really like Laneige products and this retinol firming cream was no exception. It has no scent really, absorbs well and left skin feeling refreshed and firmer. The only downside I feel is that you need to use quite a bit to have full coverage of your whole face. nan
