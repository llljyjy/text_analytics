first off I love the packaging of this product and how smooth and blended in it feels. The application does not feel heavy on the skin which is perfect. I’m normally worried when using new products since my skin tends to react and ive never had hyaluronic in any of my skin products before but so far this serum has been great! super smooth feeling and easy application with moisture yet not giving it a heavy feel. this is a #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox but I wouldn’t have thought this would be a product I would actually like ! would so recommend lovely serum
