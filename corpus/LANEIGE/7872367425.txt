Holy grail!Seen ppl rave abt this on instagram and had to try! I wished i used it sooner tbh! I have very combo skin and this works wonders, esp transitioning into the summer! I literally use this and Isntree sunscreen in the mornings for my skincare & call it a day! So lightweight, hydrating, and makes my skin soft- perfect for spring & summer (since I hate slathering thick moisturizer on my skin). nan
