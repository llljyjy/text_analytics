I bought this after trying a sample of the old formulation in a Sephora birthday gift.  The new formulation is a completely different product.  This new product is much lighter and feels less moisturizing.  The scent has changed to a strong floral scent that really lingers.  I wish Sephora would filter out all of these reviews for gifts because they are obscuring the real rating of this product. Dislike the new formulation
