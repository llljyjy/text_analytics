Another nice product from Laneige! I love the packaging and felt that this essence is really nice for morning use. It definitely feels hydrating and absorbs quickly into the skin without feeling sticky (as Vitamin C products can sometimes). The scent is a little perfume-y/fresh but dissipates quickly. My skin feels smooth and there is no pilling underneath heavier serums and moisturizers in my routine. I will say that the essence is very watery, so you have to be super careful with the pump or you’ll end up with product dripping from your hands - so a slightly firmer pump would be helpful! Other than that, it’s a solid product and I will continue using as a light AM essence! I received this product complimentary from Laneige Nice refreshing essence for AM
