My daughter bought me the berry flavour lip mask nearly 3 years ago and I’ve used it religiously every night ever since. Before I started using this I’d struggle with dry lips during the day and be constantly using lip balm, now I use the lip mask every night I rarely need to moisturise during the day. A little goes a long way, my first jar lasted me 2 years, it’s unfortunate that the applicator didn’t even last a year but honestly I wouldn’t mark it down for that, it’s still great value for money. Worth every penny
