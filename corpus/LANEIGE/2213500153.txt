My skin PEALS in the winter.I It’s super embarrassing and no matter what moisturizer I wear or how gentle my cleanser is nothing works. UNTIL THIS. I wear this as a sleeping mask often HOWEVER I use it as my daily moisturizer almost everyday in the winter because it’s the only thing that works. It is so amazing. This is my 4th time repurchasing and I will never stop. (i’ve never repurchased anything so often at Sephora) TRY IT. IT LASTS A LONG TIME AND VERY AFFORDABLE!!!!! AMAZING FOR DRY SKIN
