I first used this some years back when my doctor put me on a course of Isotretinoin (short-lived but intense!) and this was one of the products I used to help bring some much-needed moisture into my dry face. It looks almost like a light blue gel, but with a thicker consistency and hydrates quite effectively. On its own it didn’t work quite as well as my skin needed and I ended up going through a few tubs in succession, layering it on very thickly. However when combined with other Laneige products, and a gentle cleanser, I no longer needed to apply so much, and the results were actually much better. I recently got to try out the newer reformulated version and found it just as effective, if not slightly better than the previous one. I doubt I will be on Isotretinoin again anytime soon, but if somehow it was prescribed to me, I would be ordering a tub of this without hesitation. I would recommend this product to anyone with combination to dry or dehydrated skin, and who isn’t overly sensitive to fragrance in skincare.  ~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~(My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)1.
