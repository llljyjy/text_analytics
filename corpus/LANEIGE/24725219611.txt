There is very little fragrance in this product which I love but I find once applied on the lips it can be goopy, reminding me of some sticky and heavy lipglosses I had in middle school lol. Additionally, after all the product is absorbed it leaves my lips sometimes feeling drier than I started with... I like the luxury of the product with the tiny applicator and all but expected more for the price of a glorified lip balm. nan
