this is an excellent product! My skin felt smooth and supple, bouncy & hydrated after my first use. Fragrance wasn’t overwhelming, definitely more of a rich lather than a foam in my opinion. Didn’t feel any need to exfoliate after either. The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars out of 5 is because I felt as though my skin was slightly stripped afterwards. I have may used a little too much? I would be cautious if you have sensitive skin, try a sample or a patch test first! bouncy & supple skin
