I am a lip addict. I’ve tried everything and used religiously. I’ve been using this every night for almost 2 years now. I see no difference. Lips not moisturized when I wake up, need chapstick asap. Feel like I have more fine lines than ever before. This is def hyped out. Yes it feels nice and smells good when applied. But no long term effects at all nan
