This is the best moisturizing mist I have used! It has a milky texture and a nice fine mist spray. I like to finish my skincare with this to sandwich the moisture in, or use it to freshen up my face when it’s been a few hours since I moisturized. I do have very dry skin, and my skin drinks this up and loves it. I’m a nurse and I love to carry this is my work bag and freshen up with this after wearing a mask for 12+ hr shifts. best skin mist out there!
