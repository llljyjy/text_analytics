I love this so much better than the lip sleeping mask. I use this night and day if I don’t want to use my chapstick. Besides the fact that it has its own soft spatula and click-in storage in the large cap (should really make use of that space with all of their products - moisturizer and other lip masks/balms), it doesn’t dry out my lips in the morning like the lip sleeping mask. I have combo skin, but it gets especially drier in the colder seasons. So applying this balm at night makes my lips so much softer without feeling so tight. On another note, I personally like the smell; it doesn’t smell waxy or manufactured or disgustingly floral. Thank God as I easily get headaches nan
