I am a big fan of the original sleeping mask formula but not a huge fan of having to use my finger to apply it, or the bulky packaging. The formula of the glowy balm is definitely comparable in feel and wear, is easier to apply and travel with, but I find it a bit less softening/moisturizing. Itâ€™s worth getting if you want easier application on the go, and the peach sent is really nice! Convenient but less moisturizing
