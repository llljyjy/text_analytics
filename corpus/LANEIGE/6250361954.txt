This is hands down my favourite pre-moisturizer product. I have dry, sensitive skin and this makes my skin so soft. It replaces both toner and serum in my routine, so I only have to wear two products (this and a moisturizer) in the morning. At night, I put it on before retinol and have zero irritation or sensitivity, which is so difficult to find. It is on the expensive side, but I find it well worth it for my needs. Amazing for dry, sensitive skin
