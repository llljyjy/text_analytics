I was pleasantly surprised to with the Laneige Water Bank Gel Moisturizer. Not only did it leave my skin feeling hydrated and soft, but it didn’t leave a sticky film on my skin which I’ve come to expect with gel moisturizers. It didn’t add any additional oily shine to my skin after wearing it all day long which is another plus. I also really love how it comes with an applicator to avoid excess contamination from using your fingers in the little pot. I think I might actually repurchase this one! I received this product complimentary from Laneige. nan
