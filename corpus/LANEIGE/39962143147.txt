I have been using this serum for over 10 days and love it for many reasons, mainly that it has water like consistency and gets absorbed in seconds and helps absorb my other products better. Every morning I use it before work and layer my products over it and had no pilling issues and have noticed my hyaluronic acid absorbs so much better now and my skin feels highly plumped and bright. I have received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox and it is going to be a staple in my skin care routine for sure. I was searching for a good toner or serum from a long time as I was tired from using rose water after cleaning and this made my life. If you are looking for a serum to add in your routine just go for it..you will love it. Quick absorption, Great hydration
