I love this moisturizer! I have extremely dry skin with dry patches so I have to use cream moisturizers and this one was so good! I love the scent and texture. Itâ€™s not a super thick and heavy feeling moisturizer but you can feel the hydration. I use this at night and it makes my skin feel so soft and hydrated when I wake up in the morning. I highly highly recommend it if you have super dry skin like I do! This was gifted by Laneige. nan
