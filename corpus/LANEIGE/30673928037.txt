I received this complimentary from Laneige for my honest review! This is my new favorite moisturizer! The packaging is so cute and so sleek! I love that it comes with a little stick applicator. It smells heavenly! It soaks into my skin so well and makes my skin so hydrated! My skin was hydrated after the first use and stayed moisturized all day. I felt like my skin was firmer and bouncier than normal after using. Really gave my skin a glow as well! Seriously don’t even question it and buy it!! I’m in love! BEST MOISTURIZER!
