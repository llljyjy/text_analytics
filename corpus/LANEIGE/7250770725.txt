I received this #freeproduct from #tryitwithtopbox. I fell in love with LANEIGE after trying the water sleeping mask and the lip mask. This is yet another product that doesn’t disappoint. Whether you’re a skincare beginner, a pro, or stick to a minimalist routine, I think everyone can benefit from adding LANEIGE Radian-C Brightening Treatment Essence to their skincare routine. This product is super easy to use: simply just add 3 pumps to a cotton pad and distribute all over your face. I’ve been using it both in the morning and at night and my skin looks better each day. It’s helped with some acne dark marks that I had, my skin looks fresh and bright, and it’s never looked better and healthier. I really like the light, citrus fragrance it comes with. I normally have sensitive skin, but I have no issues using this. A bottle sells for $50 and this is truly worth every penny. I will be buying this again and again. Another must buy from LANEIGE!
