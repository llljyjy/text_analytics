I got this as a #freeproduct from #tryitwithtopbox and I really liked it! What’s not to love? It was moisturizing, plumping, it had a cooling effect, and it was so lightweight.  I have dry-normal skin, so I usually use more heavy sleeping masks, but this was good! Although I didn’t give it 5 stars because I recently tried Laniege’s other water sleeping mask and I loved it way more, but most of the time Laniege’s products are excellent. I definitely would recommend it if you like lightweight sleeping masks or you just want a good product! Its pretty good!
