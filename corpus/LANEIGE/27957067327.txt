I was Gifted #freeproduct this item from #topbox in exchange for my honest review.the Laneige Water sleeping mask is light weight and comfortable. I had no issues with breakouts which is a common occurrance for me.The scent was soft and slightly floral but in a spa like way, it was subtle and not obnoxious. I found I enjoyed the scent and it added to my experience.I tried this both in the am and pm but found my preferance was as a day cream. It was not heavy enough for the evening for me, that said it layered beautifully under a full face of makeup with no pilling or other  issues.I have combo skin and I would recommend this for someone to use during the day if you also have combo skin. nan
