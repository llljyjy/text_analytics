I’m on a quest for moisture. For hydration. For juicy juice. A facial mist is great for layering moisture into my skincare routine but also refreshing my dry skin throughout the day. This is really doing ~something~ here and I love it. I’ve been on the Tatcha Luminous Dewy Skin Mist for a while, and still think it’s maybe the best for just getting a quick quench over makeup. And Glow Recipe’s Watermelon Hyaluronic Acid Super-Fine Mist has a light, pleasant scent that invigorates. BUT. This one. Wow. Skin stays damp immediately in a after application and takes my moisturizer twice as far. If used as a stand alone, skin stays slightly tacky (in a good way) and glowy for several hours. I haven’t tried it over makeup and don’t know how something with this kind of a creamy, moisturized effect would impact makeup (can’t imagine it would be GREAT!!—guessing it might melt a little? But again, haven’t tried so not sure!!) But so far, it has done everything I’ve asked of it and more, for less $$$ than it’s competitors. The Essence of Wetness
