This has become a holy grail for me! I use this routinely in the morning and at night before bed. A little goes such a long way and my full size jar has lasted for probably 8 months+. The sweet candy scent smells delicious and I enjoy it now as much as I did upon first purchasing. This product is one of the best lip moisturizers l’ve tried and I’ve tried a lot. I recommend to anyone. Holy Grail Lip Product!
