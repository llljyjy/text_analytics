I love Laneige and majority of their products and scents but this Gummy Bear scent is a no-go for me. It smells like a grape cough syrup and something about it is not good. I recommend this product but NOT in the gummy bear literally chose any other scent and its amazing! Chose any scent but the Gummy Bear!
