I’ve been using this essence consistently for the last 20 days and I have a lot to say about it!First off, I love the bright orange packaging. There’s a lot of product in here and it comes with a pump.My routine is simple. I wash my face with a cleanser, apply this essence with my fingers and follow it up with a simple moisturizer.What I have observed is that every morning when I wake up and look in the mirror my forehead looks like it’s been polished! HahaMy face looks really glowy and I feel like my overall complexion has brighten up as well. I’m really intrigued to see how it affects my hyperpigmentation and acne scars in the long run! I can already see my red ones have started fading already!I experienced no sort of breaking out despite having sensitive skin!Very much satisfied with the product.I received this essence from #trywithtopbox as a #freeproduct in exchange for my honest opinion! Glow from within
