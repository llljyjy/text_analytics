I stopped by Sephora yesterday and picked up some skincare products and I given a laneige sample and let me tell you, I’m hooked! It feels amazing on my lips… it tastes so good, honestly I apply it to just lick it off! Haha I cannot wait to get paid so I can purchase my first little jar. No wonder it’s a cult favorite!
