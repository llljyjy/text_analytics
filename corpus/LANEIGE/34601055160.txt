During the wintertime, my lips are usually very chapped and dry. However, after a light dab of this lip sleeping mask every night, my lips have become softer and smoother within a week of usage. Also, the sweet candy smell reminds me of a pink Starburst, which I love! Everything about this Laneige lip sleeping mask is perfect. Effective and sweetly scented!
