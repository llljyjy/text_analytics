Okay, so I don’t typically write reviews, but I will say that this product is really good at moisturizing the lips. It has a nice subtle scent of mangos which I really liked because I prefer subtle scents. It also isn’t sticky like lip gloss and instead feels very soft on your lips. I will say that if you apply too much, you will see a very little pigment of yellow on your lips if you look really closely but normally it just makes your lips look hydrated and with a nice glow to them. Really great product yall, 10/10 recommend
