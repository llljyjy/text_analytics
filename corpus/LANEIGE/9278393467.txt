Been a long time fan of this product- it kept my lips soft and supple all throughout winter in the midwest/Europe! It gives you such a gorgeous natural, glossy, pink look to your lips- I’ll use Laniege instead of lipstick and gloss when I go out! I do recommend using it as a lip balm, rather than a lip mask, though. I’ve found that using a tiny amount at a few times throughout the day, rather than a large amount each night (it comes off in your sleep anyways), is far better at maintaining the softness of my lips, and makes one container last up to 3 months! Is a great Lip-Balm too
