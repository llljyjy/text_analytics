This is a lovely product, with a great texture and scent. But it’s not very powerful for an overnight lip mask. When I woke up in the morning after wearing it, my lips were ordinary - not dry, but not moist. I think the Aerin rose lip conditioner is the best sleeping mask I’ve ever tried. I plan on using this Laneige product during the day instead. Lovely lip conditioner - but not great as a mask
