I don’t know how to live without this mask. It’s one of the only products that I will rebuy! I absolutely love the herbal cica scent; it’s very a nostalgic feeling for me! A little goes a long way (thank goodness), because I use it as a nightly moisturizer and a sleeping mask for days I’m feeling more irritated or dry. Then my skin glows the next morning! It really helps soothe any redness or irritation I have. My holy grail!
