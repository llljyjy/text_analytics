I’m a very picky person when it comes to moisturizer as I look for maximum hydration with minimal weight. This product was gifted to me by laneige for me to try it out it and write a review. Boy am I happy—It feels like you are putting water on your face, super light and quick absorbing. After it dries my face feels plump and hydrated without the heavy feeling of a thick moisturizer. Definitely in my top 5 favorite moisturizers! Great
