I quite liked this as a nighttime moisturizer, and I found that it left my skin feeling soft and hydrated. However, it is very thick and very greasy - a little bit goes a long way. In fact, a little bit will spread over your entire face and a good chunk of your scalp. I couldn’t figure out while my hair was so uncharacteristically greasy all the time (I wash it every other night) until I reached for a different moisturizer one night, and problem solved. It was so bad that I couldn’t go back to using the moisturizer on my face, and I turned it into a very expensive body cream. I wouldn’t repurchase, and I would only recommend this product to a bald person. Greasy hair
