Thank you Topbox for providing me with the opportunity to try and review Laniege Retinol serum. I’ve been using it for a week and a half. I’ve used retinol products before so thankfully there was no purging or irritation with this product. It’s very hydrating and lightweight. Since it’s a retinol product, it will take more time to notice any visible difference in fine lines so I’ll continue to use it. #trywithtopbox #freeproduct Great beginner retinol product
