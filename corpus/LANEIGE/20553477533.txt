LOVE this serum. This product was gifted to me and I plan on repurchasing it once it runs out. First, the packaging is beautiful and simple and I love the pump. Second, the smell is AMAZING. So light and fresh. I use this in the morning for a little boost in moisturizing. It goes on so smooth and my skin instantly feels plump and refreshed. I have already noticed an improvement in my overall skin texture. I canâ€™t recommend this product enough!! Laneige NEVER misses!!
