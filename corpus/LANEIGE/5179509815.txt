I received this #freeproduct via #trywithtopbox. I’m a big laneige fan so was excited to try this new essence. I apply it during my morning skincare routine. The instructions suggest 2-3 pumps in the morning and up to 5 at night — I think that’s too much. 2 pumps were enough to saturate my cotton pad (I wonder if they suggest more pump to go through more product and thus need a refill sooner?) this went on my skin easily, absorbed quickly with no irritation. I notice my skin is slightly brighter, though I’ll take a few more weeks of testing it out to say definitively! nan
