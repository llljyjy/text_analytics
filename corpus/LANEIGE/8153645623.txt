I first purchased the lip mask in this scent, and fell in love. It smells delicious!! I wanted one that I could take on the go. So I purchased this. It smells just as good. Feels super hydrating as well and not sticky. I have it in my pocket every shift I work. I donâ€™t leave the house without it my go to lip balm
