I cannot go to sleep without some sort of chap stick or lip moisturizer.  My go to favorite for years got discontinued, so I asked one of the women at Sephora for a recommendation.  This was at the top of her list, so I tried it.  I LOVE it!  It feels great and has done wonders for my dry lips. Love this stuff!
