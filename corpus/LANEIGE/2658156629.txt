I received a #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox and have been applying it every morning for the past two weeks religiously. I have used many Laneige products before and this would be one of my favourite ones. I purposedly put a little more on my sunspot on my nose and noticed that it became a little lighter than usual. The product smells great and has fragrance; something to keep in mind if you are allergic to products with fragrance. What I love MOST and why I gravitate towards this product is that it has vitamin c and antioxidant rich acai berries, which for me is huge bonus. What a gem!!
