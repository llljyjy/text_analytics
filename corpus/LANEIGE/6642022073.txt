I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. I decided to try this product because I have extremely dry skin and I wake up with dry (ashy) patches on my face. So I tried this sleep mask and I like it! When I first apply it, my face feels like it has a jelly on it, but not in a runny or weird way. When I wake up the following morning, my face does not have those dry patches and my skin feels smooth. I usually try thick creams to combat the ash on my face at night, but this lighter consistency product was a nice change.I would say that I do have eczema and Iâ€™m prone to flair ups that sometimes occurs on my face. When I used this product during the onset of an eczema flair up, my face was not happy with it. I ended up making the eczema worse and feeling irritated. So I would caution to try a test patch first if you are in the middle of an eczema flare up or other inflamed period with a skin condition. Other than that, I will definitely keep using this product (as I have been doing). If you have non-sensitive dry skin, I think this product is great for you! A light-weight way to combat my dry face at night
