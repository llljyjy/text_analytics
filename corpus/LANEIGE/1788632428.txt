I’ve been using this product for about a month now.  I apply it every evening and and often apply a layer of vasoline or Aquaphor on top of it. My skin is looking better and I attribute it to this product.  It seems like there may be a light fragrance in it, which I don’t love, but my skin isn’t reacting to it.  Overall I think this product is a great value - there are nighttime moisturizers at the drugstore that cost more than this that aren’t nearly as good (I’m looking at you, Olay!). Great affordable nighttime moisturizer
