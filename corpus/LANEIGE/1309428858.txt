Same formula as the laneige ‘mist’ version Sephora used to carry. LOVE this. It hydrated my sensitive dry aging skin. I put it in a mister bottle and spray my face throughout the day. Love how it makes my skin look and feel:- dewy and plump. Meshes makeup together like most mists and it has no fragrance thank you!!! I hate fragranced things on my face. Hope this will always be around. I also like the youth toThe people face mist as well but this is more hydrating. But I do have and like both. nan
