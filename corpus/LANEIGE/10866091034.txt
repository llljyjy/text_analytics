This is, my dear friend, my HOLY GRAIL. Usually, I am more of a gel cream girl, but then I tried this cream: OHHH M. G. The scent is amazing, kind of a soft spa day. It is lightweight and goes right into the skin. My skin used to be dry and itchy, but I can now say that I can move my forehead without feeling any resistance (I am 23, no worries, thereâ€™s not botox there xx). After using this cream, I use the Laneige sleeping mask and my skin is UNBELIEVABLE. I recommand this one so much! nan
