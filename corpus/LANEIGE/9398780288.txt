This new formula is such an improvement. I had a sample of the old formula and it felt like a regular gel moisturizer. I wasn’t a fan. This new formula, though, is so much better. Even with the first use, I noticed a difference in the morning. My skin was much more hydrated. To be honest, this could be used as a light moisturizer as well. It’s a very light sleep mask, but still effective. try this new formula…
