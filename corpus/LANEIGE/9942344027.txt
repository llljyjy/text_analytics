Love love love this! I like having my lips feel moisturized before I sleep and this is the perfect thing for them! My only complaint is that it is sticky and needs multiple applications. Cat hair gets stuck on my lips occasionally which is also annoying, but this does the job of moisturizing and making my lips feel hydrated in the morning! nan
