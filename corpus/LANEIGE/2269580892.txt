Over the past couple of years I have been trying to find a serum suitable for my aged skin. I have been using this Serum for the past 3 weeks and so far this has been the best serum I have ever tried, it soaks nicely into my skin with no sticky feeling at all. I purchased the Laneige water bank blue Moisturizer and eye cream and love the complete line, this is not just for the younger generation, I am in my 70â€œs and I wish I had found this earlier. Best Serum for every age by far.
