For days that I want an extra something, this or the laneige lip mask is really nice. Very moisturizing and looks lovely with a subtle, flattering tint. The super glossy finish doesn’t last crazy long for me but I actually like the look when it settles down into a dewy finish after an hour or so. I use it when I go out with natural makeup, but I still use my jack black as a regular lip balm. It would be better if it didn’t have to be reapplied as often, and it’s more so a moisturizing gloss than a glossy lip balm. One of my favorites but could be improved
