Since starting to use this a couple weeks ago, I haven’t had my usual dry, flakey, peeling lips this winter. I use this at night and during the day for a burst of moisture. It’s a great occlusive. It has a comfortable emollient, slightly tacky texture that adheres to the lips well overnight. This has worked better than using Vaseline. Highly recommend if you have dry lips that need rescuing!
