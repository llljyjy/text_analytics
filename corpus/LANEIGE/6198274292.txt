I received this #freeproduct to #trywithtopbox, but I’ve tried tons of skincare products before and was pleasantly surprised with how effective it was - I would definitely purchase this essence once I run out! Here’s what I liked: - No strong fragrance- Layered well with the rest of my skincare routine (I didn’t change anything else, just added this inbetween my serum, moisturizer and cleansing steps, twice a day and used sunscreen regularly) - Actually did brighten/even my skin over 2 weeks of regular use- Good value, lots of product for the price (I feel like I barely made a dent in it) and there are lines on the side of the bottle so you know when approximately you’re going to run outWhat I knocked points off for:- Pump is very frustrating, too much product comes out at once and it’s watery so it gets all over (I feel like it’s easy to waste product due to spillage if you’re not careful) Overall, really great addition to a routine - easy to use, effective and in general I’ve found Laneige products to be good for acne prone and sensitive skin and a reasonable price for an essence.
