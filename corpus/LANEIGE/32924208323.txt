I’m utterly blown away by this stuff. I have oily skin, and I had a feeling my previous SPF was contributing to my oiliness throughout the day, as the days I wore it, my skin was extra oily, but I knew my skin was also over producing oil cause my skin just gets so dry in the winter. When I discovered this stuff, it changed my SPF game for life, I think. It’s super hydrating, easy to rub into skin, and leaves no white cast at all, and the SPF strength is just what I need (Im super fair, and burn incredibly easily). I cannot recommend this enough!! Seriously!! Give it try—your skin will thank you. AMAZING!!!
