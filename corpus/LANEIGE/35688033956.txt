I heard a lot of good things about this product and I decided to try it. It’s smells good. I’ve been using it before going to bed and my lips feel soft in the morning. I thought it was a bit pricey compared to a normal lip balm but I realized that after 2 weeks, my lips look more hydrated and plumped. It ended giving me a bit of volume. I would prefer the formula in a stick but I recommend it nonetheless. More volume
