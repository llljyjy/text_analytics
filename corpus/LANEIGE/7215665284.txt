I was super excited to try this sleeping mask as I love the laneige lip products. I put it on before going to bed and did as the instructions said to do, let it soak into your skin first. I could feel my skin drying out and it was tight. I woke up the next morning and my forehead and chin were starting to break out! Disappointed. 2 stars because the smell of it is nice and when applying it has a cool feeling… don’t recommend. Wanted to love it but….
