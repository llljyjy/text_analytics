I bought this because I absolutely love the sleeping mask but to be honest, I did not really like this balm. It was not hydrating at all, and it was extremely sticky. My hair kept getting in it, and my lips were honestly getting stuck together. On top of that, I didnt love the gummy bear flavour, it was weird. Meh
