This lip sleeping mask like grape candy! The first few times I used it, it worked great and was pretty moisturizing. As I used more, it soaked into my lips quickly and dried it out so I had to keep layering more on. When applied, it gives off a nice and glossy finish but honestly the texture is similar to Vaseline and works the same. I would say the pros are the scent and amount of product but that’s about it. I think people hyped it up way too much but it’s an ok product and overpriced. Okay but not amazing
