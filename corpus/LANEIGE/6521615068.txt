I started using Accutane (tretinoin) about 8 years ago and my skin has been terribly dry ever since. My face, my hands, and my poor lips worst of all! This is the only thing I’ve found that takes care of my dry, chappy lips AND smells good AND doesn’t have a weird taste/texture. It works pretty quickly and definitely looks great when you use it consistently. I feel like my lips appear plumper too because they don’t look so rough anymore. I love it! I’m giving the lip balm version a try but so far it seems to be quite different consistency. Works wonders!
