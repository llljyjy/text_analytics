This really is the best lip mask, especially in the Winter, when I find myself reaching for this all the time. I had bought the original until my sister stole it (she loves it too) and took it to Uni. I’m now trying to get as many uses out of a dime sample that I added to my order, lol and so far I’ve been able to get 15 uses out of it; and maybe 5 more. The hydration stays after application for a good couple or more hours. I have bite beauty lip masks too, but I’m finding myself gravitating towards laneige (bite is thickker in texture). The texture of this is like whipped Vaseline if that makes sense. There’s no taste to this, but a nice sweet Candy floss scent. I’ll see if I can purchase another scent next time I buy again. This one wins in hydration
