I bought this toner after I saw Madison Beer use it in a Vogue beauty secrets video and Iâ€™m glad I did. I usually put it on right after I wash my face and it hydrates my skin immediately after I put it on. Perfect for those who like a lightweight, milky, hydrating (and unscented!) toner to use year-round, but especially in the dry winter. I got my brother on this magic as well and he uses it as a moisturizer after washing his face. Overall, I highly recommend! LOVE this product
