This product looks really nice on the lips and does a good job of hydrating. I was disappointed at first because it wasn’t near the consistency of the lip sleeping mask (my favorite). It’s grown on me and I wear it every day now and I really do recommend it. It’s not too thin or thick but just know it’s different then the lip sleeping mask. Pretty Good!
