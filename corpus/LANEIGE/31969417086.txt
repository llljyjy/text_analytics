This was gifted by laneige. The cream is thick to touch but when it goes on it smooths out and becomes very silky.  It is extremely moisturizing so for the thickness it absorbs fast but there is a lot to be absorbed so it feels like itâ€™s absorbing in layers. You feel how soft and moisturizes your skin is instantly. After a few minutes my skin is super soft and feels great. Soft silky moisture
