I usually do not write reviews but it’s a hate and love with this product. I am used to using Sara happ lip balm. Since they have been sold out for a while I had to look for something else and stumbled on this. When I apply this product the SMELL IS AMAZING AND SO IS THE TASTE. It’s a very refreshing taste and smell for your kissable lips. It DOES make your Lips look plumped because it’s so shiny and luscious  looking .. on the other hand it doesn’t stay Moisturized too long. So I’m assuming when you apply it makes it very moisturized but because of that it also dries it out sooner than later. I do miss my Sara happ but if I was to choice something second I’ll stick to this I’ll just have to RE apply more frequently than I’m used to because of my previous product. bitter and sweet
