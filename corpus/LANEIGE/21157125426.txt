Loved it, started using a few days back and it made my skin looks brighter my dark spots looking better now becoming lighter and clear. The smell was amazing.  I really loved it.. I used it after cleansing and after hyaluronic acid although it’s written on it to apply it after cleansing.. But it’s a must try product. I used 3 pumps Am. And 4 Pm..
