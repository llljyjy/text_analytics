Some people complain that you have to keep using it to keep the pillowy lips but that is true with any lip balm! The difference here is the results, my lips look plump, the balm has an amazing shine and I’ve noticed that my lip creases (the little lip wrinkles) go away with consistent use. Never wake up with dry lips again! I’ve even noticed that with a decent amount applied before bed it will still be on my lips in the morning but not in a heavy way. Like a non transferring salve (lol idk how to describe it, but I like it)! warning: addictive
