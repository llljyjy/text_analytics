The old scent is much  heavier and possibly more pleasant but the new one doesn’t smell gross like everyone says. It’s a light floral smell (think wishful/honeywhip-esque) that dissipates quickly. I like the finish of the newer formula much much better. It’s more glass skin and less grease ball like the old one. I don’t find any change in the moisturizing aspect of it. I still feel very quenched all day with just a dime sized amount first thing in the morning. It looked fantastic under nars soft matte foundation. And by itself it didn’t make me sticky which is a personal pet peeve for me and I won’t use creams that stay sticky all day. The poor reviews on here shock me because it’s not too different from the original. If you love this cream, i think you’ll continue loving the new formula, I’m sure. And if you’re buying it for the first time, there’s nothing out there like it and I really recommend it. From someone who has tried both formulas
