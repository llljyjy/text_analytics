I use this lip treatment 1-3 times a day. I received this as a gift august 2021 and it is now April 2022 and it’s still not done. It is the only lip balm I use and my lips are always moisturized- even in the winter. I’m guessing it’ll be done by august 2022. In my opinion an amazing investment for the time it lasts and the effects it has on your lips. It’s minty and smells like pina colada’s. Long lasting and effective
