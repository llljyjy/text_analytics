I was gifted by laneige. I love love love the packaging! Very new and different! The scent isnâ€™t strong, barely has a scent. The serum is very light weight and airy which I like because it melts into the skin. I have very dry skin and helped with hydration and dry patches under my makeup. It did leave a bit stickiness on the skin but less than other products. Serum helped a lot with dullness! All laneige products are great. Another great laneige product
