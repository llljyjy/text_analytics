I know we were given trial size containers but I love the small size of this! I keep it in my purse for times I am on the go and need some coverage! I love that it is easy to apply and doesn’t leave me feeling or looking greasy. There is no overwhelming smell and it doubles as a moisturizer- amazing! I know we aren’t needing to review the true cream that comes with it but it is the perfect duo for some after sun cream! It reminds me of aloe with its consistency. New fav!
