Sephora Collection gifted me this product in exchange for my honest opinion. I tried both this moisturizer and the aqua bomb and I have to say this one was by far my favorite. It layered beautifully under makeup and was an amazing night cream as well. I woke up with the smoothest and most hydrated skin. I already went out and bought another one because I went through my sample in about two weeks. Definitely will continue to repurchase! Also no scent which is great for my sensitive skin.
