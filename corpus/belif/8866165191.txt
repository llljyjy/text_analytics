This is my first cleansing balm ( i usually use a cleansing oil) and a little goes a LONG way. It comes with a little spoon and I would say half of the spoon work for my makeup ( I could even use less product )which is just concealer, mascara eyeshadow, eyebrow gel and it removes it all perfectly. I would only use the full spoon if I had really heavy makeup . It has a nice light clean smell which I really like. I also found it remove all my pink eyeshadow cause sometime my eyeshadow stains but this removes it with no problem. My new fav
