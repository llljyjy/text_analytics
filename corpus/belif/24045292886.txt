Made my skin feel better than the aqua bomb, but I didn’t love it. The smell is a little too chemical for me- smells like fake oranges. I prefer a more natural smelling product. My skin was always dry by the end of the day and I never have that issue with other products.  I did like the way it feels initially on my skin but didn’t offer any long term benefits, just made my skin dry and blotchy. nan
