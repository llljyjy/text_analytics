I got this product complimentary from influenster and belif for my honest review. I like belif products, my husband has used aqua bomb for years. This chemical sunscreen is hydrating if not a little greasy. It is not waterproof so it will sting your eyes if you sweat. It is also slightly sticky. I think it might be great for the wintertime (skiing, hiking, etc) but after wearing it for 20 minutes I just want to wash it off. I would rate it at 3.5 if I could. Greasy, heavy, not waterproof
