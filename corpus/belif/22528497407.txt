I have fussy skin. The lyrics ‘shine bright like a diamond’ are a good descriptor. And yet, for how oily my skin is, it’s still very dry. It also enjoys entertaining me with regular, dramatic breakouts.This is the only moisturizer I have ever used that didn’t damage my skin in some non-negotiable way. Can I say that it will transform you into a poreless unicorn? No. It didn’t make my skin better, but it didn’t make it worse — and for that, I give it 5 stars.This is the only skin product I have ever bought more than once. 3 times and counting. nan
