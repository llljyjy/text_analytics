I received this product as a free sample for review. I like all the aqua bombs but didnâ€™t LOVE this. I love the original aqua bomb for my really dry skin, but for my vitamin c i prefer something more concentrated.  I could see this product being awesome for sensitive skin or younger people just getting into skin care. nan
