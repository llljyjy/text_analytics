I have been using the Tatcha water cream for years and finally I tried this one. Not only is it more moisturizing it is also half the price! My only complaint is that the packaging is not very efficient. The weird top takes up more space than a regular top, and it is difficult to get all the product from under the lip. Change the packaging and this would be an easy 5 stars. Great moisturizer, but donâ€™t love the packaging
