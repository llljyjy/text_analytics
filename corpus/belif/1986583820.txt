Recently my lips have been very chapped and dry because itâ€™s been cold here. This is such a quick easy mask to use. I usually apply the lip mask at night by applying a little bit of product on my lips. Once applied my lips become so moist, soft and not hurting either. You can also apply it threw out the day which I do sometimes because I love keeping my lips looking healthy. I so recommend this lip mask. I love it! Love it!
