My skin did not get along with this product which is very surprising. I’m normally a bit fan of belif. This cream unfortunately irritated my skin especially my forehead. If your skin isn’t prone to sensitivity, it might be a great fit for you. I also found that it didn’t sit very nicely under my usual spf and makeup. nan
