I really like the consistency and scent of this moisturizer. I was surprised how refreshing it was, and it doesnâ€™t leave any sort of sticky residue or oily feeling. I apply it after washing my face and it leaves it feeling soft and revitalized while smelling great. Would highly recommend! Refreshing and cool
