I was given this sunscreen fo free in exchange for my honest review. I just love this sunscreen..its spf 50 and looks just like other mineral sunscreens but on application doesnâ€™t leave a white cast and feels very light and hydrating. I have combination skin that easily gets greasy on application of sunscreen but this just did wonders. Not greasy and very hydrating!!
