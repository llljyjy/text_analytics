I was surprised how much I liked this. I am very loyal to my usual moisturizer, but this one may make me switch.  It was nice and light and sinking quickly and was very moisturizing. I liked that the vitamin C was already in the product and I didn’t have to do a separate serum.  There’s a slight  citrus scent that fades immediately but I really liked it. nan
