I received this from Influenster and Belif in exchange for a honest review.I’ve used this moisturizer before and I still love it. The weigh, texture, smell, and feel is there. This works great especially with the harsh weather right now. Because it’s water based; it doesn’t just sit on your skin, it absorbs. LOVE!
