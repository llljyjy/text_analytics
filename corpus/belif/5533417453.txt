I’ve been looking for a way to incorporate vitamin C into my routine, as I’ve used a few more concentrated products that don’t feel right on my skin. Like other belif products, it has a light, pleasant scent (citrusy?), and to my surprise, it is actually really moisturizing. It leaves me with a nice glow. The price is a little steep, but it may be worth it if you are looking to incorporate vitamin C without adding an extra step. nan
