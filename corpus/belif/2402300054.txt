After just one use my face feels smooth and soft. My flaky skin is repaired and hydrated. The only negative I have is it does not soak in quickly. It took a while for it to become not tacky. I suggest applying  the thinnest layer onto your face. A little goes a long way. Overall, I am super pleased and this mask is very affordable. I will repurchase. Instant Results!
