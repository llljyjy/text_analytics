No white cast and very good for dry to normal skin. I have only skin so this was not the best option for me. It kept my skin hydrated with the 2 in 1 moisturizer + sunscreen but it didnâ€™t fully dry down on my skin until i set it with a setting powder. Once i did that it was perfect. If you have dry skin definitely reach for this easy 2 in 1 moisturizer + sunscreen. Hopping more companies do this. We need more sunscreen in all of our products. Great for DRY skin
