I have a deluxe sized sample of this, but am not sure I’d buy a full size. I think I’d prefer something a little thicker and creamier. It’s definitely a slippery gel-cream consistency rather than an emollient cream. Nice fresh ginger scent. Does a good/sufficient job of moisturizing. Have not experienced any irritation. I can see this being a pretty good day time eye cream, but I currently already have a day time cream I like better so I’ve been using this at night and am not sure it’s right for me for that use. I'm not mad about it
