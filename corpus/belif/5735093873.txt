This sunscreen is a dry skin savior!! I have eczema, flaky, dry skin and it doesnâ€™t dry down and cling to patches like other sunscreens do. It leaves me glowy and wanting to reapply. I used to dread reapplying because of pilling and the oiliness but now I feel so confident and comfortable . Will repurchase! Finally a sunscreen for dry skin!!
