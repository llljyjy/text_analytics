Honestly I think the 100mL is more worth it for the price of $83 and I’ve been using this for almost 3 years now and it’s probably the best hydrating cream I have. I’ve tried many different creams that are supposed to hydrate and moisturize but they can’t defeat this belif cream. If you have dry skin especially during the winter times, I would recommend getting this item with the Witch Hazel Herbal Extract Toner! And during night times, I would use the laneige cica night cream twice a week. I’ve been using this pair for a while and it doesn’t defeat any other skincare items I’ve used before. If you’re in between oily and dry skin, I would try the aqua bomb hydrating toner with this! Both toners do the job ESPECIALLY this cream! nan
