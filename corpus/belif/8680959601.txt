This is not a bad product at all, and I wouldabsolutely use it if I didn’t already have my favorites.It’s lightweight as advertised, smells very clean, andcreates a soft dewy look! That being said, it makesmy combination skin almost too shiny and is leftfeeling a bit too sticky. Great product, just not myfavorite. Nice but shiny
