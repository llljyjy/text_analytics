I received this as a sample from Influenster for my honest review. My only complaint is the cost for the tiny pot of cream you get! I came to repurchase because it worked so well for a sunburn my son got on his face that I wanted to keep it on hand! Needless to say, the price deterred me from that. Really nice cream!
