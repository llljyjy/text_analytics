This is my favorite moisturizer of all time. It isn’t too thick and definitely hydrates like it’s supposed to. I’ve been buying the moisturizing bomb for almost four years and will continue. Perfect for my combination skin and doesn’t give me acne or make my face oily. I got this along with the aqua bomb, and prefer the aqua’s consistency, but both are amazing. Worth the money, buy a bigger size!
