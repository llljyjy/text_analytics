I purchased the sample size 4 weeks ago, after applying 1-2 times a day I’ve finished about 2/3 of the product. It does contain fragrance, but I like the clean lemony scent and it doesn’t trigger any redness on my skin. The appearance is phenomena! It catches light and creates a spectacular natural highlight! Unfortunately it also enlarges my pores, creates undereye bumps, and acne spots. On bare clean skin it feels heavy and sticky, like the product is generating an over production of oil and sebum. It also seems to accentuate small lines around my eye. Far from porefect
