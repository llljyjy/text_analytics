I really enjoyed this sunscreen! It is very light weight and moisturizer and doesnâ€™t feel like you have anything on. The scent to me is a very typical scent of Belief, which I enjoy, but if you do not, just a heads up. With sunscreens in moisturizers I always worry about enough protection but this seemed to have held up all day! Solid 4.5 stars to 5 stars! nan
