I received this in exchange for my review. I use this as my daytime moisturizer, and I really enjoy it even though I have dry skin. I find that it blends nicely into the skin, and it’s quite hydrating. I haven’t noticed any brightening effects, but I have been using it for about 2 weeks so it might be a product that takes longer to see effect. nan
