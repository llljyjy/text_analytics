I got this mini size of Moisturizing Bomb complimentary in exchange for my honest review. This cream is great for winter time or when my skin is super dry. It’s heavy and i don’t need to use too much to get enough hydration. I’ve used this cream in the past and I did not notice any differences in my skin other than extreme hydration. So if you’re looking for a good moisturizer that will help with extreme dry skin, this would work. The ingredients aren’t special so that’s a drawback for me, other than that, it’s soothing and practical if you just want a low-key, hydrating moisturizer. heavy layer and good for dry skin
