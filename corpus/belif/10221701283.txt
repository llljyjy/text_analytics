I went to Colorado on vacation and thought my lightweight sunscreen moisturizer was going to cut it and it did NOT. The dry air made me look 5 years older within two days. I stoped at Sephora in Denver and an associate recommended this and it was truly a life saver! Super hydrating, no strong fragrance, light and not sticky. I love it and definitely will purchase again. Saved my skin in from the dry air!
