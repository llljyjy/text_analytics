I got the product free from influencer and honestly didn’t have any expectations because I have really oily but really dry skin so normally moisturizers fix my dry skin but leaves me super oily so i’ll have to wash my face a couple hours after. I usually prefer a gel type moisturizer because it’s the only thing that doesn’t have that oily effect. This does the job but someone mentioned that there’s some type of alcohol ingredient that isn’t good for the skin, so be sure to look into that! nan
