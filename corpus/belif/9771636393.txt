I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I loved using this product! It has a light weight, texture like a creamy-gel, which absorbs nicely into the skin. My skin felt hydrated and refreshed.  I’m usually not a fan of citrusy scents but with this product it’s soft and I found it lovely and energizing, however I couldn’t assess the brightening aspect of the cream due to the product size Received. nan
