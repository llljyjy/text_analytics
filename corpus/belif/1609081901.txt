Really wish this was as great as I wanted it to be. The formula and texture is nice but the scent is way way too strong. If I had any irritation on my skin. If I explicated the night before or plucked my brows this would sting and burn. It definitely doesnâ€™t have lasting moisture power. I imagine there is a fair amount of alcohol limiting the moisture power because it felt like alcohol on irritated skin for sure. nan
