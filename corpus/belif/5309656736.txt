This is nice, a little goes a long way but the second ingredient in this is dimethicone. I want a face cream that isn’t packed with silicones. I didn’t really notice any changes aside from what I usually see when I use a primer. With that said I only have a small amount of the sample to really see any long term changes. I do like that it does feel and smell very light. nan
