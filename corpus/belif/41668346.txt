I already was a fan of Aqua Bomb skin cream before, but now with the vitamin C I love it even more! It keeps my skin hydrated all day without feeling heavy or oily. It applies fast and dries down nicely. Perfect to go org other vitamin c serums I use. I received this free from Influenster for my honest review. And honestly I will be buying a full size of this product. Itâ€™s great for the warmer months and even cooler fall weather. My skin loves it!
