I usually love belief Aqua Bomb moisturizers, but I did NOT like this. Compared to their other moisturizers this one is very oily feeling and it does not dry down like their gel does. It reminds me of the feeling on sunscreen on my skin. The “brightening” factor is more because the cream is reflective and shiny. Very oily feeling :(
