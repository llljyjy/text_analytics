Another great product from belif. The moisturizing balm is thicker and more emollient than the aqua balm, so itâ€™s perfect for those dry winter months. I love using this balm when my skin needs an extra boost of hydration that sometimes the aqua bomb is lacking. Despite being thicker, it still manages to feel light weight and refreshing on the skin once applied! Highly recommend. nan
