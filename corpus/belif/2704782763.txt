As far as vitamin c moisturizers go- this one is pretty good! Itâ€™s a little sticky at first but it ends up fully absorbing. It takes time to see any brightening effects of the vitamin c but first impression I like it. I did want to clarify I received this for free from Influenster for my review but I do purchase this brand on my own - I do like this moisturizer preferably at night on rotation with my other moisturizers. Nice vitamin c moisturizer
