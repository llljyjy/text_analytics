I have very dry lips and I’ve been on the hunt for the best sleep mask. I’ve tried dozens and this might be my favorite. Laniege and fresh are overrated in my opinion. Unlike those, I can feel this one on my lips when I wake up. Plus, it comes with a ton of product which I appreciate. I’ll continue to test more, but so far this is the only lip mask that I would repurchase. Might be “the one”
