I LOVE the Belief aqua bomb so I was soooo excited to see they have released a sunscreen too!Just like the aqua bomb, this sunscreen is super lightweight and doesn’t leave a white cast on my skin so it’s great to layer underneath my makeup. I have oily combo skin so some sunscreens actually end up making me more oily but this one is nice and hydrating without the extra shine! The scent is also light and isn’t overpowering at all. Love this product - it’s perfect for summer! Lightweight and perfect for summer!
