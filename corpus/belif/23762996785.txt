I have dry and sensitive skin. When I saw that this was a thin moisturizer with a fragrance, I was under the impression that it would irritate my skin. However, upon trying the moisturizer, it was hydrating, not greasy, and most of all, did not irritate my skin. I usually have bad luck with moisturizers and can never find one that suits my skin. This moisturizer is it. Itâ€™s simple and does what it says.  I LOVE IT! Shocking
