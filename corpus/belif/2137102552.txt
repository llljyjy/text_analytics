Really appreciate this isn’t drying, nor is it too sticky or greasy. It sinks in quick and leaves a fresh, glowy look that I really enjoy on my no-makeup days! The scent can be a little overpowering if you’re sensitive to fragrance, but it’s not unpleasant. It does get a little shiny for me with wear, but it’s not a dealbreaker. solid year-round spf
