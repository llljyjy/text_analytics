Belif Aqua Bomb Brightening Vitamin C Cream delivers an explosive dose of moisture with their skin-loving ingredients like Vitamins C and E for a brightening glow, an anti-inflammatory Lady’s Mantle, and a blend of four HLAs for maximum moisture retention. I was already a big fan of Belif’s original Aqua Bomb cream, so it’s been exciting to try their take on a Vitamin C cream. The first thing I noticed is the creamy gel texture that feels immediately cooling and nourishing, plus it’s very gentle so I didn’t experience any redness as I have with similar products. It also absorbs rather quickly with a pleasant citrus scent, giving plumper skin that’s bright and dewy right away. It’s certainly made a really strong first impression with an impact living up to the claims, so I’m excited to see how it will help brighten some discoloration I have over the long run! Very Hydrating Yet Gentle Vitamin C Cream!
