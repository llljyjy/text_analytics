It’s like the universe was listening to me complain about dry skin, and then I was sent a sample of the 24 hour moisture! I’m normally oily, but this winter hit hard this year and really dried my skin out. Because of that I don’t have many heavier moisturizing creams, being afraid they would make me break out with my oily skin. This cream is luscious and moisturizing without making me oily the next day. AND no breakouts!! I will likely be getting more of this for those times I need a little extra moisture. nan
