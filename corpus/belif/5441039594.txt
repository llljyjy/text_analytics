I was pretty loyal to Belif True Cream, and I bought this one by mistake. BIG mistake because it broke me out in large and angry cystic acne that I have not seen for YEARS. I use the same products over and over but had some dryness and needed something more. Good if it works for your skin, but acne-prone folks beware. Patch test or skip if acne-prone
