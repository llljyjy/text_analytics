I love lip balms so I was very happy to try this. What I like about it is it has a pretty finish, and it makes your lips look and feel softer. But what I donâ€™t like about this is the thickness of the formula. I can sometimes just feel this sitting on my lips and not soaking into them and it just feels like a film over my lips. Definitely would recommend hydrating your lips and scrubbing prior to applying. it's Okay
