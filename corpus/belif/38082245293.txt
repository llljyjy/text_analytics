First things first, I love how cute and small the products are almost travel size because I can take them on the go especially around the summer time! At first I was a little skeptical because I thought it would it would be too thick and have smell like most sunscreens but it was the total opposite. Soon as I opened it, the smell immediately caught my attention because it smells so good. Very natural but also has a nice organic scent. I rubbed a small portion on my face and it felt like lotion and it really works with my sensitive skin. When I would go outside, my face felt very normal and almost cool like despite sometimes how hot it would be and its also not a hassle nor does it leave sticky substance left on my face when I wash. I love it! I recommend this product! Little tip: you actually don’t need a whole lot just a couple or rub ins and you’ll be fine! I love it!
