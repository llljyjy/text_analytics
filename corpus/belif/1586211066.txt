Was ok. Did the job. I didnt hate it. But has tons and tons of silicones. So its is very slippery and just sits on top of the skin and never absorbs and does not really nourish the dermis. I got this last minute as I needed a moisturizer while traveling. I do not dislike it but because of the huge amount of silicones I would not buy it again. nan
