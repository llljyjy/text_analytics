If you like their other products, you’ll like this one. It’s a gel texture that is lightweight and hydrating without feeling sticky. It feels very refreshing after a day in the Sun. Compared to the original, this one brightens your skin a bit. It was not super noticeable for me but overall enjoyed the product. Great for summer
