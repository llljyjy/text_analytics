This moisturizers consistency is nice. Although it is a cream it feels like a serum. The skin absorbs it quickly and leaves a little tack. It’s not my ideal moisturizer as I’ve got dry skin and prefer a thicker cream. Overall if you’re someone with a normal skin type, I think you’d love it! Not for me
