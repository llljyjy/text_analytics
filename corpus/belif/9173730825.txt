This moisturizer is really nice. It’s lightweight, but really hydrates my skin. It doesn’t break me out which is something I’ve dealt with from other moisturizers. It’s not greasy, and leaves my skin nice and soft. I also love putting it on before my make up and it really helps to make it last and look so much smoother. nan
