Received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. Personally, I don’t think it really hydrates as much as it claims to. But I will say that unlike most other foaming cleansers, it doesn’t leave my skin dry. I have a pretty dry skin and after applying it, my face doesn’t feel stripped or excessively tight, but i also felt it cleaned well. I used a cleansing balm and then this cleanser. I could feel the clean skin right away. Nice Product!!
