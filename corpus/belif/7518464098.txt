I liked this moisturizer. It’s very moisturizing and it leaves the skin feeling hydrated. It says it’s a cream but it’s more of a gel, great for oilier skin. It’s didn’t visibly improve my acne or scars but it didn’t exacerbate the acne which is always a plus when trying new moisturizers. So no anti inflammatory results here but definitely brightening and moisturizing. nan
