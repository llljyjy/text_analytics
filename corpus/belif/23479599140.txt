I received this product for free from Influenster and belif in exchange for my HONEST review. To preface this review, I want to note I have combination skin and don’t consider myself to have sensitive skin. I have used the belif aqua bomb moisturizer for a long time and I really like it. This vitamin C cream is just like the moisturizer but smells like citrus. It helps keep my skin feeling hydrated and I look fresh and glowy after using. Overall, it’s a way to get your vitamin C and moisturizer in one product. I use this in the mornings. I recommend trying. Great
