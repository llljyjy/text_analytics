This moisturizer made me believe in night creams. You definitely have to make sure you rub it in, and don’t put it on right before you go to sleep, but it is FANTASTIC. I have had oily, acne prone skin my whole life but using this with the Paula’s Choice Antioxident serum and the Topicals Faded Serum have improved my skin so much. This is so hydrating without being greasy and it’s perfect if you’re working towards more “normal“ skin and need something heavier than a gel. Total Game Changer
