I received this as a complimentary sample from Influenster and Im very happy I did because this cream has multiple benefits and healing properties for healthy skin! After just a few days of use, I noticed that this lotion helped brighten and tone my skin, as well as enhance my natural beauty. I have combination skin care concerns and this lotion helped even out my face texture and eliminated areas of dryness. I especially love that there is no added oils and has a very light fragrance, as my skin tends to be very sensitive, yet more oily in my t-zone. I will be buying this again, a little goes a long way! Healing Hydration!
