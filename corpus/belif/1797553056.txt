I received a couple samples of this moisturizer, and I was able to try it daily for a few weeks. The gel consistency and the light scent were refreshing. It was a good daytime moisturizer, both with and without makeup over it. I can’t say it so vastly outperformed my other moisturizer to be worth nearly 4 times the price for half the volume. Personally, I’m going to keep looking. nan
