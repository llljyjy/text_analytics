Perfect sunscreen for everyday wear, with or without makeup!I’ve been wearing this every single day since receiving it and I fell in love with it. I’ve tried several different face sunscreens and hated them all. They either have a white cast, feel greasy, didn’t sit right under makeup, or caused me to breakout. This sunscreen did neither! Doesn’t clog my pores, feels like a dewy moisturizer and NOT greasy. Perfect for my dry skin! Sits beautifully under my makeup ALL day. I swear by it so much that told my sister in law about it who has acne prone skin and dry skin, and she loves it. Sticking by this sunscreen! Best face sunscreen I’ve ever tried
