This literally melts in your skin. There is no white cast or residue on your face once you apply it. It just a bit liquid so a lot can go a long way. I use a tiny pea size amount and it covered my whole face. Really love how easy it is to apply especially when I’m in a rush and don’t want to leave without sunscreen. Love it !
