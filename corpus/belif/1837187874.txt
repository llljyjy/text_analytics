I really  wanted to find a new face on the screen and this one is not it. It is very greasy as you would expect of body sunscreen to be. It does not leave awake hast which is a big plus however putting this under make up does not work. The foundation just slipped off my face. This probably will be good if you have really dry skin or if you donâ€™t plan on wearing make up that day Not it
