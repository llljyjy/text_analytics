I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I love the Belif brand and was very excited to review the Belif Aqua Bomb Brightening Vitamin C Cream. This product is a must have during the summer. My skin was so dry and dull, and this cream instantly hydrated and brighten my complexion.  The cream is easy to apply, is silky smooth, and even smells like lemons! Summer Essential
