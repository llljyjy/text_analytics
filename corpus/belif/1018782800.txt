I’ve bought close to 15 jars of this moisturizer. I use the aqua for daytime and the Moisturizing Bomb for night time. I’ve bought really expensive moisturizers and affordable ones, this one always wins. I have super dry/dehydrated and sensitive skin and this never fails me. Holy Grail for my dry skin
