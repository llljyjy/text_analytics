I liked how easily it melted into my skin after I applied it all over my face. I wasn’t expecting that because other sunscreens are too thick and don’t melt into my skin as fast or at all! This is a 2 in 1 moisturizer and sunscreen which I absolutely love. I just wish it came in a bigger size but i would still recommend of course :) Leaves skin feeling & looking hydrated/glowing
