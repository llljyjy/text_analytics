I love the way this makes my skin feel after applying it. I have noticed a difference in my skin and can truly say I will be repurchasing as this is worth the money. My skin is   A combo sensitive skin and my skin took it so well. Especially under my make up. It has a light scent to it but nothing extreme. It is quite a nice smell. Very happy with this product overall. nan
