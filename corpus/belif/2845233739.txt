Great lightweight cream based moisturizer. I’ve probably owned 10+ jars of this moisturizer over the years, always going back every once in awhile. My favorite thing about this product, besides how hydrated your skin feels while using it, is the scent. I have no idea what it is, something citrusy maybe, but it’s amazing. Instant serotonin boost to my routine. It doesn’t linger and it isn’t super strong. nan
