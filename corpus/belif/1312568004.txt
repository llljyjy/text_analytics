My skin looks so dry after I wash it with cerave gentle cleanser, I put this on at night,It has a thicker consistency but it feels really nice and is not greasy at all. I tend to break out and this did not cause any break outs. Been using it for 3 weeks now. I wake with well moisturized skin. Friend bought for me, she loves it too! I love this it is Korean skin care. Great moisturizer day and/or night
