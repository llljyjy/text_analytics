I give this product 4/5, bc truly it’s hard to be 5/5 perfect for anything in my opinion. I love the brand as a whole; I stand by the aqua bomb moisturizer & enjoy using all of the Belif products. With that said, that led me to want to try this sunscreen. I am painfully bad at using sunscreen on the daily, and I think it’s largely due to the scent of sunscreen and the white cast it leaves on my face. This product so far, does not disappoint. Of course, it still smells of sunscreen but it’s reduced; like half sunscreen scent, half the normal Belif scent. It applies very smoothly and results in a sheer layer, almost as if you just applied moisturizer. I didn’t experience any stinging or discomfort while using this product. If You Already Like Belif, Why Not This One?
