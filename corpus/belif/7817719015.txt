Love this water based brightening vitamin c cream. The scent is not overpowering and it is easy to apply. Made my skin feel soft, light, and refreshed. Since it’s water based it didn’t make my skin feel oily. This brand has such high quality ingredients and is worth the buy. It’s also easy to take on the go! nan
