Guys,  I will be honest, my skin is oily and thick, and I can say that this is probably not for me, or maybe be for winter. Because on humid summer day in New York, I felt over-moisturized even without a moisturizer under it. Remided me the feeling of Shiseido urban environment sunscreen. But not as burning around the eyes but still be careful if you are sensitive. I would say 8/10, just not for oily skin on humid days nan
