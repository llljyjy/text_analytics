This cream got a very nice sweet citrus smell. The texture is not too thick, but since I have oily skin type, it feels a bit heavy on me, leaves a slightly sticky feeling, and after using it for a few day I noticed that I got a few small pimples. I think I will go back to this cream during colder days, when I usually switch to thicker textures. nan
