This product has a wonderful whipped gel-based texture. It is so lightweight, spreads easily onto the skin and sinks in, absorbs within seconds. True to its name, “Aqua Bomb,” this product feels like I have splashed cold water on my skin after a long summer day. It feels truly refreshing. It has a mild cooling sensation, but not tingly like menthol-based products, it feels quite pleasant. Must believe and buy!
