I received this product complimentary from Belif & Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have enjoyed this product as it does heal chapped lips, leaving them quite soft. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I didn’t find it unique enough to be a replacement for something everyone has around: vaseline. It has a smell lighter than yet similar to Carmex. The product itself is smoother than I expected; for some reason I thought it might be a harder wax like a stick lip balm, which is obviously a negative for trying to take product out of its container if you have long nails. I do believe this would be a thoughtful product to add to a gift bag, especially during the dry winter season; who doesn’t love skincare? nan
