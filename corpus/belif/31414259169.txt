First impression was that I really liked the simple packaging, it caught my eye. But after using it I found to not like the formula. It was not spreadable, I found myself using a lot of the product on a small amount of skin. After rubbing it in, I found that it was a bit sticky and that after a couple of hours found myself super dry again. I personally would not buy this for myself, but I just have super dry skin. It might work for someone else. Honest Review-
