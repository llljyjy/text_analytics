I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I have been super happy with this gel cream moisturizer! I have quite a bit of sunspots and hyperpigmentation from spending years in the sun, and Iâ€™ve noticed that the vitamin C gel cream has reduced the appearance of the sunspots. I also like that the cream goes on light and does not feel sticky. It dries nicely onto the skin and I can apply make up over it without it appearing cake-y at all. Loving it!
