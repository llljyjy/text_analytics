So this product is nice and light once your skin absorbs it, but it doesn’t really stay feeling moisturized throughout the day. I like the idea of daytime use for this product because it does go on so lightly, but it’s lacking in the moisturization department. I got this product during winter in the Midwest, but it takes a great product to really do the job during these cold, dry winters, and I can’t say the aqua bomb was it.For the price, you can get a better quality product that’s going to give you all day results, BUT it’s not complete garbage. It applies nicely, product seems to go a fairly long way, and the smell isn’t overwhelming. Okay, but you can find better bang for your buck
