I got a sample bag in the mail full of skincare samples. I used this one after a shower and found it very light weight and immediately hydrated my face! There was so much in the little package that I ended up using it on my entire body! I have hard water build up in my house and constantly badly dry skin, but my skin soaked this up quickly and feels soft! Too bad I donâ€™t have any long term reviews, but I certainly enjoyed this little sample! definitely hydrating!
