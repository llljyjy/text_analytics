Unfortunately I have not found this eye cream to be particularly moisturizing, especially given its claims of providing 26 hours of moisture. While the formulation is fine, with a light gel consistency my under eye area doesn’t feel or look moisturized. I have been using this product for a while and don’t see any evidence of smoothing fine lines or improving skin elasticity. Furthermore this product for me is too watery to be refreshing or truly moisturizing. Not for me
