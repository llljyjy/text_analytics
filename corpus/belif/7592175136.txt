Got this together with the aqua bomb moisturizer to test out. I saw this one was thicker and and a tad more moisturizing and hydrating. It said up to 26 hours. My mom had just been telling me how super dry her skin was from this weather, so I gave her the moisturizing bomb to try out. And her skin went from being visibly rough to being smooth and soft when you touch it. Sheâ€™d only been using it a week or so too so the ingredients kick in fast! Definitely would recommend to anyone needing a hydration boost on their skin. Super hydrating
