This cream was very hydrating and brightening on my face - my skin drank it up! The smell wasn’t super pleasant and I would have preferred a more pleasant scent or an unscented formula, but it wasn’t unbearable. Overall, a good product, but it’s not life-changing enough for me to purchase at the $43 retail price. Very Hydrating, But Overpriced
