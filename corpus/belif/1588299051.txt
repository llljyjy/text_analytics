Loved the Aqua Bomb Brightening moisturizer by belief. It has a light fragrance, smells citrusy. The moisturizer wears like a gel, but feels great on the skin. Not too heavy or too light! Hours after applying I could still feel it on my face. It did not make my face greasy at all! Great summer moisturizer!
