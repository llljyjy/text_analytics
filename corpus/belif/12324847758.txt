Nice and lightweight gel-cream texture that quickly absorbs into my skin and doesn’t leave a tacky feeling on my face. Gets along well with my other skincare products, and doesn’t cause any problems with makeup application. Great option for daytime wear, and those with mild dry skin but can’t stand the feel of a heavier moisturizer on their face.Docked 1 star because of the fragrance. It smells like laundry detergent and elmers white school glue combined. Thankfully the scent doesn’t linger and isn’t too strong, but it’s noticeable enough for me that I won’t be purchasing this in a full size. Quick absorbing, great texture, bad fragrance.
