It’s clear this is a Vitamin C cream because the citrus smell is apparent! The cream left my face feeling moisturized and smooth as can be! There was no greasy residue and the formula is lightweight, just melting into my skin easily! It’s been a long time since I’ve felt my face this soft! I would recommend this product! The only downside is the high price for such a small amount. My face has never felt this smooth!
