I have very chapped lips, especially during the winter and I found that vaseline doesn’t work as good as it used to on me. This was the first lip mask I ever brought and I had high hopes of it working well. I wanna say it works but I have to use a lot of product and at that point I’d rather use a glob of vaseline. Again, my lips are very stubborn so if your lips are dry but they aren’t cracking or bleeding, I would recommend this product. I found the texture to be pleasant, kinda like having a thinner lip oil consistency on your lips. The smell is quite nice too, a bit like fresh flowers, very light. I just wouldn’t buy this again and I wouldn’t recommend this product to people who have extremely dry lips and are on a budget. Good for lips that are mostly dry to normal
