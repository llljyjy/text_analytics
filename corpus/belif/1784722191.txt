I’ve never reviewed a beauty product but this was worth the input!! This is by far the best moisturizer I’ve ever used. It’s light but super potent, a little bit goes a long way. I’ve been applying in the morning over a serum regimen and my face is supple, soft and glowing all day.  Has no unpleasant smell and absorbs gradually throughout the day! Definitely worth the money! I’m so glad I tried it! Amazing!
