I have very very dry skin and this sunscreen did an excellent job hydrating my skin. Did not need to use moisturizer like I do with my usual sunscreens. It has a pretty dewy finish that sits nicely under makeup. Not sure how great the spf is bc I wear hats when Iâ€™m outside. The scent, texture, and finish are wonderful and it leaves no white cast. I put a bit of powder near my eyes and so no sting from the product Great every day product
