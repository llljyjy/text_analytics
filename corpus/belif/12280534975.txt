*Received via Influenster complementary for reviewing purposes * I was very excited to find out I would be getting this, and had high hopes since so many rave about the moisturizer. However, I found it highly disappointing. While it felt great on the lips while wearing it, I didn’t feel like it made a difference in my lips outside of that. To be fair, I do have very dry lips naturally, but with the Laneige lip sleeping mask exfoliating isn’t necessary because it works so well, but this one didn’t perform the same way. So exfoliating was still a must with using this product. For that reason, it’s just not worth it in my opinion. Influenster review
