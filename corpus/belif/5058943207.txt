This moisturizer is super refreshing and hydrating. It glides on very smoothly, and it absorbs into the skin very quickly. It is lightly scented, but it’s a very subtle clean scent. Unfortunately, this did not work out for my dry skin because of how quickly it absorbed it but it’s still a very good product. I highly recommend this to anyone with oily skin types. Not the best for dry skin.
