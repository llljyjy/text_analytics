I am a big Belief fan. I had their Hungarian water serum and it helped my skin BIG TIME, so I was so happy to receive this free for review. My dark spots are noticeably lighter and my skin looks hydrated and plump. The price may seem a little steep, but a little goes a long way. It smells great too! BUY IT!!!!!
