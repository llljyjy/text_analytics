Okay I know this moisturizer is pretty expensive. BUT IT IS AMAZING, if you have dry skin like me then this is the one moisturizer you need. I have pretty severe peeling on my face from an acne medication and this product saved my skin and helped repair my skin barrier. My skin used to be very sensitive and this product didnâ€™t cause any redness or irritation even when my skin was compromised. Seriously, worth every single penny. HOLY GRAIL
