First, I just repurchased my second big one -after a month shy of 3 years! It LASTS and is the only expensive skin care I use. I got a trial size years ago from IPSY and I loved it. It feels great when you put it on. If your skin care has dried out the skin around your eyes, it makes it feel way better. I also always try to sell it (like get them to buy it themselves) to my friends bc it is AMAZING for when you’re hungover and actually have to adult that day- very moisturizing and it helps wake you up.100% love it and I started using it when I was 19, so I don’t use it for the age lines, but it’s still great even if that’s not why you’re buying it! P.S. you really do NOT need a lot. A little go a verrrry long way and you only need an itsy-bitsy amount for it to cover your under eye, eye lid, and side eye. Legit an investment- it works, it lasts, i love it
