I received this product for free from Influenster and belif in exchange for my honest review.I’ve been using this lip mask for weeks, and it definitely helps the lips to stay hydrated the next day. It barely has scent, so not an inconvenient at all. If this brand was cruelty free, I’d buy the product again. Good, but not cruelty free. Sorry!
