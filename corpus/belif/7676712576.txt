First, I definitely think this is a nice lightweight moisturizer for daytime.  I love the subtle lemon smell that seems to be present in a lot of Belif aquabomb products.  As far as the effects of the vitamin C, I can’t really tell any difference.  But it should be noted that I use tretnoin 0.1% every night so it might just be that I’m maxed out on visual improvements.  But certainly it could be protecting my skin from pollutants Hard to say if it’s more than a nice moisturizer
