Decent toner & lasts forever! I bought this because I needed a cheaper option than Akar’s Balance Toner ($55 and not sold at Sephora). I also wanted to try Belif’s toner because their Aqua Bomb is a great moisturizer. I saw some reviews about the denatured alcohol ingredient, but since there are mixed feelings about using it as an ingredient for skincare from different YouTubers and skincare experts, I decided to buy it and see for myself. I ended up really liking the results! I do not break out, it feels good on my combo/sensitive skin, and it allows following products in my skincare routine to absorb into my skin. I love the size, and there is a lot of product for the price. I have been using this day and night every day, and still have not needed to buy another one. This has not been my luck with other toners. I still prefer the feeling of Akar’s Balance Toner, but for the price of these benefits, I’ll probably keep buying this one. Decent toner & lasts forever!
