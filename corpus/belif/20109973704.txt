I love this product. The consistency was great and it made my face feel like extremely hydrated. The only thing I wish is that I got a bigger size because I only got the sample size so I didn’t get to test it out for that long. As far as the vitamin C aspect of the product, I don’t know if it works because I only tested it for about a week. I would definitely re-purchase this product though because it really hydrated my skin. Love!
