I mean, I was in love with the Aqua Bomb moisturizer already, but Belif has really done it this time…Adding a sun protectant to an already perfect moisturizer was genius and executed flawlessly. I hope whoever deserves it over at Belif got their raise and promotion. Well done. I know this is a weird thing to say, but I can’t wait to have to buy it again. Smells lovely, feels lovely, not sticky or greasy, and sits well under makeup. Would I recommend it? Yes, 1,000 times, yes. Flawless
