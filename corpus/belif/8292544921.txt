I’m always blown away with this brand but this Aqua Bomb Vitamin C cream is one of the best moisturizers I’ve ever used. The consistency and texture is rich and creamy. The scent is light and very great. It smells like fresh cut oranges! You only need a very small amount and the product smoothes onto the skin and neck and absorbs fast. I use this every morning for all day hydration and a healthy glow! Obsessed with this moisturizer!
