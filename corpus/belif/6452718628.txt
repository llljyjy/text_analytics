So I went through alllllll of the Sephoras toner section, not picked every single one and for some reason this one stuck, normally I would NEVER buy a toner with alcohol in it but my skin has been acting weird and honestly think it needs it.Been using for a week now and it’s simply amazing, I swear I am a skincare junkie and have tried EVERYTHING, I can’t believe I spent $28 on a toner but THIS WORKS.Sinks immediately into the skin, I soak a shiseido cotton pad with it and *chefs kiss* , lightly fragrances that fades quickly, felt no stinging in my tretinoin experienced skin, actually felt substantial like something was actually getting through vs like thayers witch hazel which just evaporates.Anyways I’ve had a few drinks I love this toner BUY IT :p Buy It
