Got it at the right time in this extreme hot summer. Love the fact that its hydrated and glowy at the same time. It definitely brightens my dry skin. I love all the belif products, they are worth every single penny. I already bought a full size jar of it. So so good. Its not greasy at all just like other vitamin c creams. Totally recommend it. So glowy and hydrated!
