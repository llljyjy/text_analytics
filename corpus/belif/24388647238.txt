Personally I really like this cream. I have eczema so I was a little hesitant to try this at first but I am so glad I did. This cream moisturizes really well however it is super light and does not leave your hands feeling greasy. Thereâ€™s not much of a scent to it! But, it leaves your skin feeling great! nan
