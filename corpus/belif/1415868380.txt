I have rebought this so many times I’m not sure I can even count. I love a good face cream and this is perfect for me. There’s no added scents or extra chemicals and I love its simplicity. It’s great for me year-round (though I use Fresh’s rose deep hydration cream and/or Dr. Jart’s Ceramidin cream in the winter time when I need some more moisture). I like this moisturizer because I don’t feel like it messes with my skin or other products much. So if I want to use an exfoliating serum, for example, it doesn’t interfere with that. My partner likes it, too, and he’s not exactly a big fan of moisturizer or skin upkeep. It’s a staple for my routine and always will be! I much prefer it to the aqua version as well. This will always be my go-to
