I received this moisturizer as part of a skincare set for a birthday present, otherwise I never set out to try it before because of the price. However, I am very grateful that I got it, because it is truly a wonderful product.Normally my skin is combination-dry, leaning more dry in the winter months (I’m a Canadian gal). This cream (actually more of a gel) instantly melts away my face’s stubborn dry patches with a wave of hydration, leaving my skin feeling dewy and smooth. Don’t worry about potential greasiness, because it’s simply impossible with this moisturizer; it’s winter now, but I can see myself using this when the temperature gets going and I have to worry about sweating, because it’s also very light in texture/consistency.It may have (key word MAY) broken me out a little the first day I tried it, but it stuck with it and no breakouts have occurred since. Because of that and the price I deem it 4-star worthy, but see no reason why it can’t be 5+ stars. A Godsend for ladies in the Northern Hemisphere
