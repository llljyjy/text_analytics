I receive this products in exchange for my honest review. I enjoyed how light this product felt when applied. It has a light citrus scent which is to be expected. I left my skin feeling hydrated and the product absorb very well. I really like the ingredients in this and I would recommend to those looking for a lightweight moisturizer. nan
