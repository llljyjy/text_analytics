I got this product free from influenster for my honest opinion. I have been using this for a few months and I really enjoy it! I don’t like how sticky it is so I only use it as part of my bedtime routine.  Personally there are other lip marks that I enjoy better,  but this does a great job at helping with my chapped lips from the winter! It’s a good product but I wouldn’t repurchase. Just ok
