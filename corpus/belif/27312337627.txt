This cream has a nice texture and absorbs really fast. I use it after the bha toner and my skin doesnâ€™t get irritated. Makes my skin glow really nicely. Someone said it smells like artificial orange. I have seen a little difference in my skin but longer use is needed. Overall this vitamin C cream is good. C cream
