I’ve heard about Belif’s moisturizers for years but never actually tried them, so here’s my review after testing the classic Aqua Bomb and the sunscreen spf 50. Both did a great job moisturizing without feeling heavy on the skin and didn’t mess up my makeup when applied underneath. Also, I should mention that the sunscreen did not leave a white cast on my face. I didn’t get any breakouts or blackheads which I’m really happy about! I can see why they’re well-loved products! Great and not heavy
