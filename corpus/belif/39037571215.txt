I absolutely loved this product not only is it lightweight but it doesn’t leave a white cast. It didn’t feel sticky after it dried off and once it’s dried off it doesn’t leave my skin either way too dry or way too oily it left it perfect. Not only that but It made my makeup look flawless. I’m definitely adding this to my makeup routine now! A new Must have in my makeup routine!
