This is the perfect moisturizer and SPF product in one.  It makes my skin feel soft and hydrated.  It worked well with my sensitive skin.  You just have to be careful when putting the cream very close to your eyes because it can stings them.  Also, if you have combination skin apply on the dry part, and a small amount where the oily part is. Works for sensitive skin!!
