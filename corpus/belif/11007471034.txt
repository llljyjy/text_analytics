This moisturizer is really wonderful and comparable to the Aqua Bomb. The biggest difference I’ve noticed is the texture. The Aqua Bomb is much more watery and light while this cream is a lot heavier. They both deliver great hydration to the skin in my opinion, but I also like to layer them. On their own, they don’t do enough for my skin personally. This cream would be a lot better in the winter time due to the denser cream. I would recommend this moisturizer. Note: I did receive this product complimentary for testing purposes through influenster. Great Moisturizer
