I received a sample of this product complimentary for testing from belif and Influenster. I’ve used multiple belif products previously, and I think this is the one that will be sticking around in my routine. One star off for the price (I think it’s just a wee bit steep for the full size). Other than that, I do agree that this is a nicely hydrating-but-not-greasy formula and it definitely does not leave a white cast. It works well as a base under makeup too, which is very important to me. It has a light sunscreen scent, but it doesn’t bother me. While I received this late in the summer season (aka past peak sunburn time), I have had no sunburns or irritation in general when using this product. Overall I recommend and would repurchase—but I’d prefer to purchase when it’s on sale. Pricey, but excellent
