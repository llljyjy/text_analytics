What I love about this cleanser is that it actually makes my face feel clean without stripping or drying out my skin. My skin is dry, but I don’t love cleansers made for dry skin as they tend to be a little TOO hydrating and they don’t make me feel clean. Some cleansers are too intense and make me feel horribly dry. This cleanser is the perfect in-between. It’s not drying but it also lathers nicely. It makes my skin feel very soft and I always look very glowy after. It also smells wonderful. It’s a beautiful clean scent, not too heavy. I also love that this cleanser does not break me out. I would consider this the most tolerable cleanser I’ve ever used. I think this will work for all skin types. It’s just perfect. the best out there
