I liked this! I got a mini in a kit and tried it for about two weeks. I have very sensitive skin and this didnâ€™t irritate me at all. I like the gel like texture of this. It definitely hydrated but I needed something with more hydration for the winter. Especially since I use retinol. This might turn into my summer eye cream nan
