I was hoping this sample would help my dry winter skin. For me, I had to apply twice a day so it was definitely not lasting 26 hours for me. I applied in am found my face would get dry again by end of my work day. I work inside so no real reason for it to dry out.  Also, this smells very strongly like oranges to me. Which is ok IF you like that.  The ingredients do list orange peel oil so I know Iâ€™m not crazy! Would I buy this? No, there are definitely better, longer lasting moisturizers out there. One pro I have is that when I applied to my crows feet it plumped the fine lines so they were less visible. Moisturizes but not for 26 hr has an orange smell
