I received this complimentary product in exchange for my honest review.Each time I have tried this moisturizer, it never fails me. I love the water/gel consistency, it’s refreshing each time it’s applied, and it’s very light scented - fresh almost. This absorbs very week into my skin, hopefully that doesn’t my skin is parched... this little sample/ trial size is perfect for me to throw in my purse when I need it. I recommend! nan
