As someone with extremely dry skin, I generally avoid water/gel creams because they’re never moisturizing enough for me. This one pleasantly surprised me. There’s a light citrus/citronella scent when you first put it on, but it dissipates and doesn’t stick around. It has a really light texture, like water/gel creams, and it’s easy/pleasant to apply. The amount I received wasn’t enough to really test out the product long term, so I can’t comment on any long term effects of the vitamin c; however, it leaves a nice glow on the face after application, which I do attribute to the vitamin c. I can imagine people with oily skin might not enjoy this particular feature. What surprised me most was that once you’ve rubbed it in, it feels like there’s still something substantial on the face, rather than disappearing completely, like most gel creams do when I use them. My skin actually felt moisturized, whereas most gel creams usually leave it feeling dry. It’s currently summertime and humid where I live, so my skin is definitely not as dry as it would be in the winter. Therefore, I can’t speak to whether it would be enough during the wintertime, but I could see myself trying it out as a day cream during the colder months. More oomph than I expected!
