I received this product for free. A pretty good sunscreen & good consistency. I wish it absorbed a little bit better because it does feel like I have sunscreen on my face - slightly oily. There’s also a slight smell, but it’s not off putting. I prefer other daily sunscreens over this one, but overall it’s not bad! Pretty good sunscreen
