I got this product for free in my Belief Influencer BoxVox. I used both the moisturizer bomb and the aqua bomb. I love how these products are not artificially colored. I love this moisturizer in the winter. It is thick enough to provide my skin with moisture, but not too thick. I have enjoyed using it after a shower before I go to bed. I did try using it under my make up in the morning, but it didn’t blend as well as I had hoped with my concealer and bb cream. When I wake up in the morning, my skin still feels hydrated. I did like the smell of the aqua bomb a little better, and it’s cooling effect, which is why I recommended it for the summer over the moisturizer bomb. I liked both for evening hydration after adding toner. Great Winter Moisturizer
