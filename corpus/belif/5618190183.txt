I received this product for free from Influenster  and Belief in exchange for my honest review. I am obsessed with this sunscreen. It has a very light scent that goes away, it’s not oily but instead it feels like a moisturizer. It absorbs by the skin very quickly and the best is that it doesn’t leave a white mark in your face. No residue, smell or oily
