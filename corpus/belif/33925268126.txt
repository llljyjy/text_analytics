I received this item from influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. After using this cream on my face for a little more over a week I’ve noticed a slight brightness in my face. More like hydration. What I loved is that this cream is not heavy on my face. It’s actually really refreshing. The scent is also refreshing. The only problem I had was I noticed I broke out a bit. Not sure why, but I will continue to use this cram and see if my breakout is effected. Glowing!
