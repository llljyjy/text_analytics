I received a sample of the aqua bomb and am more than impressed. With oily skin, I struggle finding moisturizers that donâ€™t leave my face greasy and this is great! It feels light and leaves behind only a subtle, healthy glow while quenching any dryness. I might have to switch to this full time! Wow!
