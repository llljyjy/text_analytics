This is pretty decent and does a nice job of making the skin bright! The smell isn’t too strong and it feels nice when applied. The only downfall in my opinion is that it isn’t very moisturizing. If you have oily skin this would be nice and lightweight for you, but if you’re dry, it wouldn’t be enough. nan
