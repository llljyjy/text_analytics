I absolutely love how this feels on my skin. I’ve never really felt like moisturizer does much for me except seep into my skin, but this truly feels like it’s moisturizing. The smell is also amazing and not at all chemically. I did receive this as a sample from Influenster in return for my honest review, but I would buy this in a heartbeat. very moisturizing!
