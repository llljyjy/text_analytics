I thought lip masks were a gimmick and I even tried another well known lip mask brand only to be massively let down. THIS STUFF HOWEVER, is actually very very very good. I changed my mind after just a week of use.This is fragrance, dye, and flavorless which is perfect for me. It’s a lovely balm consistency that isn’t sticky but it’s also thick enough to stay on your lips long enough to get absorbed into the skin. A little goes a long way so this can really last you a long time. It feels nice and has a nice shine if you want to wear it in the day. Most importantly, my lips feel nice! I live in a very cold climate and usually get chapped lips but I haven’t experienced that once since I started using this product. I will pick up this product again and again. I’m a Believer!
