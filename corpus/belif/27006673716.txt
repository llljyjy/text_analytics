I received this cream as a part of the Belif introductory set and I absolutely loved it from the first use. This moisturiser is extremely light and absorbs into the skin without the need for a lot of rubbing. I had a problem with skin dryness and dullness, and through incorporating this into my usual routine, I have been seeing a big difference. This cream is definitely a keeper!
