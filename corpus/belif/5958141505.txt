I sleep until the last possible minute in the morning, and probably even past it, so I often skip a step before running out the door. Having two products combined into one is clutch. It feels very moisturizing, leaves no cast as it is a moisturizer, and feels very light. There is a light scent, which is more mild than the other Belif moisturizers in my opinion (I do not like the scent of the heavier moisturizer). Overall, I would purchase this and recommend! Exceeded my expectation
