I’ve used the belif moisturizer before and really liked it so I was excited to see how the spf + moisturizer would work out. I was a little skeptical that there wouldn’t be any white cast but there wasn’t , it was amazing. It’s very moisturizing and doesn’t feel greasy on my skin at all Great product
