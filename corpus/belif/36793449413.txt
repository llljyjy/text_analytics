My lips are usually dry and flaky. I have tried many different balm, jelly, scrub, Vaseline, collagen and hemp products. This is by far the best product I have used. It keeps my lips feeling soft and hydrated all day and all night long. I apply it in the morning and at night. I have never been overly impressed with any lip products until now! This is the best thing I have ever put on my lips!
