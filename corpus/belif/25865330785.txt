I really like this cream because is light yet hydrating! I was excited to try this out because my skin its always dry and its dryer on the winter. The only thing I was a little worry was the scent because my skin is really sensitive and didn’t want it to cause a bad reaction in my skin but it didn’t. I would recommend it The true cream
