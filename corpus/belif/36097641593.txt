A friend of mine gave me some cosmetics samples and this is the first one I decided to try. I was blown away by what a difference it made in my skin. Not only did it make my skin noticeably softer after only three uses, but it helped some scarring on my face fade significantly; scarring that I’ve had trouble with for years. The only things I use at night are face wash and moisturizer, so this was an easy addition to the mix. A little goes a long way. Goes on easy and quickly dries so I didn’t have to worry about it sticking to my hair or getting on my pillow. I like to keep my routine as simple as possible so I haven’t added anything in a long time, but I will definitely be buying more of this as soon as my sample runs out. Best Sleep Mask I've Tried
