Wow! Talk about hydration. My skin loves this moisturizer. One of my favorite things about it is that it is lightweight and not sticky or oily at all. It absorbs fully within about 2 minutes. A little goes a long way. The scent is pleasant and not overwhelming. It did not cause my skin to break out and overall I would highly recommend this product. 10/10! I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. Hydration 100!
