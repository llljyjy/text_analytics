I have tried the original aqua bomb moisturizer and this 2 in 1 moisturizer and sunscreen is comparable to the original aqua bomb but with SPF protection! It leaves no white residue and is absorbed into the skin in a matter of seconds without leaving a sticky or heavy feeling. If you like Belif products, I would definitely recommend giving this sunscreen a try. Like the original Belif moisturizer but with SPF!
