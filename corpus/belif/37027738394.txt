This plus exfoliating and shaving your face is GLASS skin because this is more of a cream/gel moisturizer which is more on the hydrating side that’s not as light compared to a gel. First impression I was filled with JOY out of how good my skin felt and looked because it was giving a healthy glow. It does provide impressive HYDRATION FOR HOURS even as I’m about to sleep and do my night routine my skin still glows. If your looking for something for your skin to look really healthy and glowy this is it and wanting light weight but deeply hydrating this is truly it. I want to give it a five but I’m still curious to try more moisturizer because I do still think there’s better and this isn’t the best. But if your someone who just wants to find something that works, basic, and trust worthy so you get your moneys worth this is it. I was skeptical of this because it’s just so popular and I was scared it wouldn’t be worth it for me but it was SO WORTH IT. the HONEST TRUTH!
