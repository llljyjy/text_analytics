I was excited to receive belif: The True Cream - Aqua Bomb, as I know some pretty influential people use it. I didnâ€™t realize just how great it is though! Super easy to apply, this lightweight moisturizer gives full coverage using the smallest amount. I was truly blown away by how smooth and hydrated it made my normally dry skin feel. Good for most skin types, it helps with dryness, pores, dullness and uneven texture.
