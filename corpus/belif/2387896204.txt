I got these two moisturizers from Influenster for my honest review. I LOVED the Moisture Bomb! Personally, I’d choose this over the Aqua Bomb. This heavier cream formula is extremely hydrating and best of all, it didn’t make my skin oily. It actually set perfectly under my makeup! Before I tried the Moisturizing Bomb, I started using retinol for the first time and my face got soooo dry! I didn’t think anything was going to fix it that quickly but supringly overnight, this moisturizer with its comfrey leaves, oat extract and panthenol did the trick! It’s now a staple in my winter routine and I love it as the first layer in the “sandwich method” for my retinol! Holy Grail Product for me!!!!
