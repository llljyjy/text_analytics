I am a fan of Belif products and have used several of their skincare items throughout the years. However, this is my first time using their Aqua Bomb Sunscreen, and so far I’m liking it! It’s easy to apply, lightweight, and hydrating without making the skin overly oily. I am acne prone and this product hasn’t broken me out yet; I’ll have to keep monitoring. Packaging is simple and easy to carry around. Overall, I recommend trying it out if you’re looking for a lightweight sunscreen. nan
