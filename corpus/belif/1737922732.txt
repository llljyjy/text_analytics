omg where to even start, this is magic in a container. go buy it now, you wont regret iti have oily skin in summer and dry skin in winter, this works on both without leaving me greasy. love that it’s a gel based formula so my skin absorbs it a lot better vs others that feel like they sit on my face. i’ve looked high and low for a moisturizer and this one does everything i wanted it to and more. extra points for being my daytime and night time go to as i used with retinol in the evenings. ONLY gripe is that i wish it came in a tube or dispenser so i dont have to dip my fingers in it holy grail
