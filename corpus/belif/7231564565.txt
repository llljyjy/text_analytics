I have both this and the aqua bomb. After using both, Iâ€™ve come to realize that the moisturizing bomb is ideal for right now - New England winter season- and the aqua bomb for warmer temperatures. Unlike the aqua bomb, this moisturizing bomb left me feeling hydrated all day despite cold temperatures and harsh winds! It has been helping to relieve the flakiness the happens as a result from my dry winter skin. Unlike some of my other heavier creams, this one feels a little more lightweight and non greasy. It also has a very faint scent. nan
