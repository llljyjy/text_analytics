The belif True Cream Moisturizing Bomb is a cream based moisturizer that’s claim to fame is providing moisture retention in your skin for up to 26 hours. As someone with extremely dry skin, especially in the winter, I was so excited to receive this product. I received this product along with the True Cream Aqua Bomb and both have been added to my daily routine. I utilize the Moisturizing Bomb at night as my very last skincare step before I go to bed. Hoping to lock in moisture for as long as possible, I felt like using it at night made the most sense. I really like how this feels on the skin. It is smooth and not at all greasy, but leaves my skin looking very hydrated and glowing when I wake up! I think it is important to point out that the goal of this product is to provide moisture for UP TO 26 hours, not necessarily that it provides all users with 26 full hours of moisture. For me, and my dry skin, I don’t think that I would say it provides me with a full 26 hours of moisture with no need to use any other moisturizing products later, but I do feel like my skin overall feels MUCH more hydrated than it was before I was using this. I notice my foundation is laying better, I have way less flaky patches and my face no longer hurts from dryness. I really love this product, though I will say the size is really quite small for the price. To me, that would be my only downside. nan
