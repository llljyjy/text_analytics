This definitely has a light fragrance, so I would recommend people with sensitive skin note that. But if that doesn’t bother you in a cleanser, I think it has a lovely, lightweight texture and removes my sunscreen easily. I also found this usually gets lighter coverage foundations (both powder and liquid) off without issues, though I may go in for a second round if I want to make sure my face is completely cleansed. I don’t have any full coverage foundations to compare, but I think this could remove most foundations with two rounds of cleansing. I would definitely recommend this. Very gentle, lightweight cleanser
