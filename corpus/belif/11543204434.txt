I was dubious at first about trying it because the actual aqua bomb can be sometimes greasy on my skin. I actually love this sunscreen! I usually stick with more affordable sunscreens but in the future, I will definitely consider repurchasing. It smells great, is very slightly greasy but not bad at all, and it doesnâ€™t leave a white cast on my fairly tan skin. It blends in super quickly and I love it! Love it!
