In my opinion, this product is not worth 20 dollars.. I almost feel bad saying it but it just reminds me of Vaseline and that’s a lot cheaper. Call me frugal or maybe my lips are ridiculously dry it doesn’t do too much. It doesn’t have a taste or smell which is fine but you get a very small amount for the price nan
