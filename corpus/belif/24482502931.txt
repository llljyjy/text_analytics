Ive been using it for 2 days now. i would say it is a good moisturizer, very lightweight and not sticky. i dont have a problem with the scent as well. my face was getting better and have glowy skin but after changing my moisturizer i started getting pimples on my cheek and chin. i dont know if my face is just purging but im scared to keep using it. breaking out
