My best friend and I are obsessed I had 1 of each from this brand so I gave one to my friend to try and kept one my self. This on specifically is great for dry skin! Itâ€™s so moisturizing but not tacky or gross feeling when applied. It leaves the skin smooth and hydrated I love it and so does she! If you have dry skin this is a NEED.
