I was so impressed with this product! For being 50 SPF, it really did have a surprisingly mild sunscreen smell. It also is much lighter than I was expecting and did a great job at moisturizing. It also worked well for me, a few times when I wore it outside for extended periods I didnâ€™t get burnt. My only complaint would be that the bottle is tiny, but a little did go a long way.
