I am not a use fan of this product, mainly because I don’t think it’s right for me.The texture is light and almost gel like. It’s nice and refreshing in the summer but would not be good for anyone with dry skin who enjoys a little thicker texture. I did enjoy the subtle citrusy sent!I didn’t see any difference in the appearance of my skin which would be the main downfall for me.Overall, not bad but not for me just ok
