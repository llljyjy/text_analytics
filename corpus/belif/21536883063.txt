This like the rest of the Belif Bombs has a subtle citrus scent, this more than the others. It’s not as creamy and feels like it has more of a water feel in the skin. I didn’t find it to be as moisturizing as the others. As far as brightening goes I did see a slight difference but nothing crazy or mind blowing. I probably won’t buy after I finish the sample. This one in my opinion isn’t worth the forty something dollars. It’s Alright
