I love the Aqua Bomb Moisturizer, so I wanted to give this sunscreen a try! It goes on very nicely and blends out easily, left no white cast, and it left my skin feeling very hydrated. It also has a really nice light clean scent. My only problem is that it pills constantly within minutes of applying it, and it also left some of my face a bit greasy. If it didnâ€™t pill I would definitely love it and keep using it. I Wanted To Love It
