I really wanted to like this cream. It smells amazing it’s super lightweight and it absorbs quickly. I used it around my eyes for a week and I noticed some brightening. The only trouble is that I used it on my forehead and my chest and it broke me out. Maybe I’m just sensitive? The price is a little excessive also. Nice but..
