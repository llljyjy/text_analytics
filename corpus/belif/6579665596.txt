I’m picky with my SPFs, and let me tell you…This one by Belief is AMAZING. I’m 23 and have light-medium olive skin. I wear sunscreen on my face every day, so it’s really important to me that 1) there’s no white cast, 2) the sunscreen doesn’t sting my eyes, 3) doesn’t break me out because I have acne prone skin. This Belief sunscreen has SPF 50 and doesn’t leave a white cast on my skin tone and blends effortlessly into the skin. It’s a thin, lightweight formula. I’ve never had any issues with it getting into my eyes and stinging. It also works well under makeup and doesn’t pill. It’s also very hydrating on the skin and has never broken me out (I struggle with cystic acne). This is one of my new favorite SPFs, and I also LOVE Belief’s True Cream Aqua Bomb gel. I liked the sample so much that I went out and bought the full size. I highly recommend this line of product they are all amazing and worth every penny! One of my favorite SPFs!
