I emptied my sample tub in a week! I used this am & pm and I can say it performed greatly on my skin. It kind of has a subtle fresh scent if you are cautious of that. My skin has been drier after having a baby and worse in the wintertime but this cream hydrated and moisturized my skin. It doesnâ€™t feel heavy knowing it is a cream. Great for dry skin and not heavy!
