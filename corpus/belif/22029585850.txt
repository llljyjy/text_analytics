I think I’ve purchased this product three times already! Probably THE best toner I’ve ever used(and I’ve tried out a lot of toners)!! I really appreciate how this toner isn’t super watery bc it doesn’t drip when I put it in the palm of my hand. This toner really hydrates my skin and find that I don’t have to use as much moisturizer either as a result. It doesn’t feel uncomfortable or sticky and doesn’t break me out— i can actually feel it getting absorbed into my skin. The price might seem steep to some, but I still genuinely recommend this product because it lasts me a good 6-7 months(I use it twice a day), so it’s pretty good value. love this toner!! highly recommend!!
