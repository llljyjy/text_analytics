I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. All opinions are my own. This sunscreen is amazing. I have sensitive combination skin, and I live in Arizona so sunscreen is an absolute must. The Belif true cream aqua bomb sunscreen is moisturizing and the SPF has kept my face free of sunburn. I find it’s a great makeup base. My foundation sits on top of it really well. I’m so pleased with it that I’ll probably buy a full size product. New Staple
