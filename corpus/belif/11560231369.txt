With these winter months drying my skin out I’ve been really been relying on this product. The moisturizing balm I enjoy but I feel like you can easily find products that will perform similarly at a cheaper price.I am not a huge fan of the sent of these products however. They remind me of Vicks lotion. The sent doesn’t last long after applying thankfully.Overall I’d say it’s an ok product. nan
