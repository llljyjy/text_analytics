I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion… I really wanted to love this but there were some issues while using.. pros: this  has a thin consistency which allows for it to absorb really quick and nicely onto the skin. Does not leave a white cast, and I really love the fact that it’s SPF 50. Cons: this burned the crap out of eyes I had to wash it off the first time I used it. I apply sunscreen all over my face but I noticed with this one if I applied to closely to my eyes it will start to burn and make my eyes water… so from now on I will continue to use just not so closely to my eye area.. this could be due to me having extremely sensitive eyes  but if you aren’t sensitive this is a good option unfortunately for me it’s not the best option. Decent!
