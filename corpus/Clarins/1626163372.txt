I was unsure of how this product would work. But I am surprised and now sad because of the price point, but it works beautifully! Both in the evening and morning, it soaks in well and makes a visible difference underneath my eyes. It’s unique because it mixes the oil texture with the lotion texture. I’d recommend this for an under-eye treatment if it fits your budget. nan
