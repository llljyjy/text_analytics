With winter just around the corner, I noticed that my skin looks very dull and lacklustre.  I was lucky enough to be chosen by butterfly to try the double serum by Clarins.  I didn’t notice much difference on the first try but by the third night, my skin is glowing.  At the price point, I would definitely recommend this product if you’re in the mood to indulge and splurge on yourself. Wonderful Subtle Glow!!
