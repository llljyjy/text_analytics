I love that this product addresses not only your undereye area, but even more! Eyelids and the eye area as a whole needs love. The product may be expensive but I can tell that it will last a long time. It spreads super easily and you really only need a drop to cover all areas. The Total Eye Lift feels very hydrating when applied and absorbs quickly. It has a light scent that goes away quick. I can see results right after regarding plumpness and moisture, but it doesnâ€™t make my dark circles any better unfortunately (but I have really bad pigmentation). nan
