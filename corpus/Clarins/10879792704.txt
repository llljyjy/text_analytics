The eye cream comes in a glass bottle with a pump. One pump gives a generous amount of the eye cream that it can be even layered 2 times. The eye cream has very nourishing and rich texture, however it doesn’t feel greasy on my under eye. It doesn’t irritate my eyes either. The under eye looks and feels very moisturized and nourished with visible less wrinkles and fine lines. Nourishing, doesn't get into my eyes
