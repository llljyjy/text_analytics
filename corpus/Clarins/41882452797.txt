For all skin? I have a dry to normal skin. The serum was really smooth and smell amazing, but it let my skin a bit oily. So I wonder how well it Will go on a oily skin. But, other then that, I really saw a difference in the texture of my skin which seemed smoother and even. Not sure I would spend that much $ on this product but if you can afford it, I recommend it. All skin?
