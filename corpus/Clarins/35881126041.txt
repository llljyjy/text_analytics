I received a complimentary sample from Influenster in exchange for my personal review. A little bit about me..I am 30 and I have combination skin. I absolutely love this product. I will be purchasing it for myself. I applied every night after my shower to neck and chest for 7 straight nights. Pros: -I saw fast results. I actually used this on my neck and chest instead of my face. I have two distinct lines on my neck and chest and in the 7 days I used this product I could tell that they became less noticeable! -it left my skin so soft! -nice smell-non-drying to skin! Cons: Zero! Home-run product!
