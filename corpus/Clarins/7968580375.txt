After trying out the serum for a week my skin felt really vibrant and refreshed. This is exactly what I needed as someone with a busy schedule. I also really like that they included a 7 day sample of the product because it allows you to see if the product actually works. The consistency of the serum was interesting, it feels oily but doesnâ€™t dry that way on the skin. It leaves your skin feeling hydrated with out the sticky feel. The smell was not as overpowering as most products. Overall the serum was really good and I really enjoyed the way it made my skin feel. #DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare #gotitfree Clarins Double Serum
