I really enjoyed this serum. It seemed to really melt into my skin. I thought at first that it might leave my skin a bit greasy but I found it blended right in. It mixed well when I opened the pack and went on to my skin nicely. After the 7 day trial I noticed my skin was brighter. I am curious what long term use will bring. nan
