Been using this for two weeks and I’m loving how bright and clear my face looks after whenever I use this! The texture is thick and hydrating as well as doesn’t move around on my face. It feels like extremely nourishing and my face literally glows afterwords. I especially like how tight and invigorated my skin looks! It definitely depuffs so it’s perfect for the morning and the pores around my nose are less noticeable. Perfect for flawless skin
