I received a 7 day trial of Clarins Double Serum from ChickAdvisor, I was happy about this product as it is a good quantity to test whether it works or not. The packaging is nice in little packs, easy to follow instructions on the back. I fold the pack, squeeze it into my palm, and mix the water and oil together. It is a little messy on the hand feels a little bit oily, however, once it is applied to the face, it is not oily, it feels very light on the skin and it worked well with my oily/combination skin. It absorbed quickly, without leaving any residue. It has a very pleasant smell, like a floral/natural scent.  I have been using it for four days, and my skin feels refreshed and more smoothness after the use. I would recommend this product. nan
