Being in my mid-forties, I am starting to pay more attention to my neck area. I have been taking care of my face for 15+ years, but really neglected the neck area. This cream in fantastic. I have long used Clarins for skincare and they hit it out of the park with this neck cream. I love how it targets specifically the neck area and the concerns you have there. A must for anyone in their 40s
