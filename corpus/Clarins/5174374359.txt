Clarins has made the ultimate serum. This gorgeous golden serum has a watery texture but with a bit of weight from the oil. I use this am and pm in a circular motion over my face and neck. The scent is truly inviting and I end up having a mini spa experience during my routine! I’ve used this serum for 8 days and I have noticed my skin is smoother, brighter, clearer, but also has this healthy glow that it was previously lacking. Definitely check it out! I’m impressed
