Clarins Extra Firming Neck & Décolleté Cream ($92/2oz) is a luxurious hydrating neck cream with a light to medium thick consistency. I can see and feel my neck & décolletage get firmer and smoother with each use. I didn’t experience any irritation or breakouts with this lightweight formula made with:Sunflower to improve the skins firmness + elasticity Kangaroo Flower (a plant native to Australia) to firm, lift & smooth skinDesert Date to reduce  appearance of dark spots and helps to even skin tonePros:Visibly smooths & firms Formula is non-greasy or stickyValue, a little goes a long ways. Cream is easy to smooth & blend out and massage into neck & chestLove the packaging, a easy to twist top squeeze tube with fine tip means no mess to deal withCons:Does contain coconut oil, if you are allergic to this ingredientScented, though the fragrance is very faintI will admit this product is expensive at almost $100. If your neck can use some firming help, I say it is worth it to try at least once especially if you can get it with a Rouge or VIB promo Would recommend to try at least once and see if it works for you. I’ll surely be coming back to this product as I am in the 40+ bracket. it works!
