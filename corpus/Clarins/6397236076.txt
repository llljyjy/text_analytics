I’ve tried a couple samples of this but I think the sample packaging really limits how much product you get, and as a result I wasn’t able to see real effects on my face. I really bought the full size because I LOVE THE SCENT. Like, I’m addicted to this scent and I find is incredibly soothing and uplifting. So I was like, what the heck, just use it for the scent in the mornings, and then save my expensive Cle De Pea serum for evenings so I don’t go through it as quickly. Lo and behold, 3 days in, my face is brighter, smoother, and overall healthier looking from this Clarins serum. It is rich so I take the time massaging it in and patting it in. I’m not sure if it makes me breakout a little bit but even if it does, it’s worth the tradeoff! I’m starting to think I’m seeing way more result from this than my expensive Cle De Peau. I do think this is better for drier skin and maybe more aging skin. My skin switched from combination to dry after giving birth, and I haven’t been able to find anything that truly softens and hydrates it like a little shield until this bottle. Absolutely phenomenal. Best in class serum - effective almost immediately
