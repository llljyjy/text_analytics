I received a 7-day treatment of Clarins Double Serum courtesy of Butterly in exchange for my honest and unbiased review #gotitfree #freeproduct. The Clarins double serum states that it contains 21 potent plant extracts to boost the skinâ€™s 5 vital functions which are regeneration, nutrition,  oxygenation, hydration,  and protection.   The double serum is one of my favourite serum.   I have tried many but always come back to it.   It has a slight floral scent but does not irritate my skin.  The serum gets readily absorbed by the skin and does not leave it greasy.   Sometimes I use the serum alone without any moisturizer and it is enough to keep my skin hydrated.   Even though the serum is expensive a little goes a long way.   The Clarins double serum is definitely one of my fav and holy grail product.   I would definitely recommend it. Clarins double serum
