I really like what it does to my skin and facial contours after immediate application. Of course, they design these types of creams and potions to work only for the day and you have to reapply every day for the rest of your life, but that goes for all of them short of surgical interventions that can last longer. What I am trying to say is that my face is depuffed and youthful-looking right after the application in the morning, and as I go along with my day, the effects are reduced. By the time night rolls around, my face is puffy again. I do my night routine and go to bed. I use it again in the morning to benefit from the depuffing effects for the entire day. I personally love this mask a lot. Lovely Masque
