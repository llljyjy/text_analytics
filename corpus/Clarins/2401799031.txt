I loved this eye cream because it has a very light texture and feels very refreshing and tightening instantly when applied it, I gently press under my eyes, over the eyelids, and onto lashes. It hydrates the eye area perfectly, reducing dullness, and it absorbs quickly, leaving that delicate area brighter and revitalized. This is the perfect addition to my skincare routine. Phenomenal!
