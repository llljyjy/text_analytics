I got to try Clarins Double serum through butterly. I hot a seven day sample and I really do love the sample format of having a card you break to release the product and mix it. It makes it easy to take skincare with you anywhere. Over the summer I have spent  a lot of time in the sun so Iâ€™m looking for a product to help keep a healthy glow and combat some sun damage. This product is get to even skin tone and moisture the skin. great anti-aging product
