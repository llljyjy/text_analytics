This stuff is amazing. Half oil, half serum, it makes for a very rich and nourishing blend. Full of beneficial botanicals, it’s super moisturizing and in the warmer months, it completely replaces creams/heavier products for me - there’s just no need for them! There’s a slight yellow tint to it (thanks to the turmeric), so it might not be the best choice to wear under makeup, unless you like this effect. It’s subtly, almost undetectably scented and a little sticky when you first apply it, but it quickly melts into skin. My complexion is instantly glowy and plumped up. Love it! nan
