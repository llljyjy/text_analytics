This product combine with the double serum was a lovely added routine. I received the sample size so did not test packaging. The product itself has a unique but pleasant light fragrance. The products mix and blend nicely. It’s a light moisturizing serum that isn’t sticky. The price is the only thing that is the downside. nan
