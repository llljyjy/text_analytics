This stuff is amazing! I use it on my face. I put it on after exfoliating, it dried down nicely and within a few hours it developed. Left my skin feeling SUPER soft too.  and by the next morning I was glowing. I washed my face in the morning also and it was still tan! I have sensitive skin and I didnâ€™t break out from this like I did from the tan luxe stuff. This stuff smells soooo good too- nothing like tanner. Love this stuff!!! beautiful glow
