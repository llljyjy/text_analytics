Iâ€™m in my late 40s and am always looking for good eye creams. I loved the pump dispenser. In one pump, it dispensed the right amount to apply and prevented me from using too much. There was a light nice scent but disappeared quickly. The texture of this eye cream was lightweight and melted nicely into my skin. It did not irritate my eyes at all, did not leave any residue, and I could visibly see how well and how fast it tightened and smoothed out my fine lines. I saw immediate results as described. My eyes looked more awake and gave me a natural lift to my eye area. I was so impressed with my results that I have recommended this to my family and friends. Immediate results!!
