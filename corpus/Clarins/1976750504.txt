Clarins has been one of my favorite prestige brands for over a decade. I’ve tried many of their other skincare products and I’ve had a great experience. Historically there haven’t been many neck skincare products on the market so I’m happy to see Clarins has an option now. Yes it is pricey but if you look at other neck skincare products, the good ones are priced over $100. As compared to those, this one is a great option. As for the product itself, I’ve been using it for the past week and really enjoy this new addition to my morning and nighttime skincare routine. It’s lightweight and hydrating and makes me feel like just one more extra step will make a big difference in the overall appearance of my skin. Great Neck Cream
