I received this product free from chick advisor and this is butterly in exchange for an honest review. I tried the 7 day sample set. The two formulas are a great little idea. I’m the sample size there is directions on how to mix them. It’s simple enough to follow but the ratio feels a bit off as it’s hard to get all the product out.  The product itself applies very silky and my skin feels supple and hydrated after use. No breakouts after using and I love overall how light the formula is but at the same time how my skin feel soft and hydrated. Nice product
