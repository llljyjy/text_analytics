I have sensitive skin and it reduced fine lines a must have . I tried almost every skin care line out there and serum, but this one is a hands down the one. Yes it’s pricy but so are fillers and Botox if you don’t take care of your skin. It’s definitely an investment in my opinion. So I will be frank and tell it how it is. I am 36 and my skin is starting to loose collagen and show fine lines. Recently I went through months of crying due to the loss of a loved one and it left my skin so dry and thirsty. Tears make your skin so bad but it’s life. I couldn’t find anything to help me restore the suppleness I had just before everything. Well i was fighting severe dark circles where I never had this and many fine lines around my eyes. This serum literally saved my skin. I do a  complete clarines skin regiment which includes cleansing, toning, anti-aging serum and hydrating serum and a anti wrinkle night cream and day cream. Make sure to cleanse your skin well and massage the serum in, it might take a minute to absorb but when you wake up your skin will be happy. Thank you Clarines for never disappointing me. I am a valued customer since I am 21. Never had Botox or fillers thanks to this amazing stuff and obviously a good diet and ample water intake. I have very sensitive skin and it works wonders
