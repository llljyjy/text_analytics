My skin LOVES this serum. I have combo skin and this serum makes my skin soft and glowy the last morning after (I use it at night). My skin was in a bit of rough shape after just starting a rx retinoid and this healed my skin barrier quickly. Itâ€™s a classic product that I hope Clarins never changes! nan
