The Clarins Double Serum is a 2-in-1 serum for eyes, powered by plant extracts, including Turmeric.  I know about Turmeric’s health benefits, but have never tried it in my skincare until now.  I mix the serums together before applying to my eye area, gently tapping it in. It has a faint scent that didn’t bother me, and it feels nice as it absorbs. I was hoping to see some improvement in my dark circles, but I haven’t yet.  However, my eye area does seem a little brighter, and definitely smoother and more hydrated. Good Eye Serum
