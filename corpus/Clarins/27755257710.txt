was gifted Double Serum Firming & Smoothing Anti-Aging Concentrate by@thisisbutterly , @chickadvisor and @clarinscanada for an exchange of my honest opinion. I have received 7-days supply. I like that the box had introducing cards on many languages, including Russian, it was very nice. The sample size implies that you have to squeeze and mix it on your palm before applying. And it’s not very convenient. However, the full size is beautiful, it doesn’t require manual mixing, that’s cool. I like how the serum nourishes my skin. It’s a bit oily, and this one product is just enough. The smell is a bit overwhelming for my taste. I would recommend it to those who have a dry skin and who prefers a simple, minimalistic skincare routine.#DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare Oily, nourishes the skin
