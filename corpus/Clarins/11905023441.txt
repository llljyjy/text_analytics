The texture is like a balm. It does leave the eye area feeling replenished, rested, brighter, and smoother. I do like that my dark circles were less noticeable and this wears great under concealer as well. I will continue to have this in my daily regime. I want to see what a full container can do for me. Iâ€™m only a week in so far. A Favorite Eye Cream
