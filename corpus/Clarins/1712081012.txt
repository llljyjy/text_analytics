I’ve never used Clarins products before but after using this, I am highly impressed!The unique thing about this serum is that there are 2 serums mixed into 1. On one side there is an oil soluble serum and on the other side is a water soluble serum. When you dispense the pump, the 2 are combined. There is also a unique dial where you can adjust the amount that is dispensed.  There is a process to apply the serum for best results. I dispense the serum into my hands and I rub my hands together until the serum is warm. I then pat on my face and gently apply pressure to massage it in. The serum is absorbed instantly. Once absorbed, my face feels firmer. The texture of the serum is amazing. It feels  silky and satiny. It makes my face feel so soft!This feels a little more oily than my other serums but once absorbed I don’t feel oily. I feel hydrated and nourished. Love this serum!
