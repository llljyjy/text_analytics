Clarin’s Total Eye Lift has been a game changer! I have yet to find an eye cream that’s truly made a difference in my eye area. The texture of the cream is soft and smooth so it feels so good under the eye area, especially since it’s a more sensitive area. This is now my go-to eye cream. My new go-to eye cream!
