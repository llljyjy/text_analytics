I been noticing that I am starting to get dark spots under my eyes and just so happened to get selected to receive a free sample of this product from Influenster & Sephora, So was super excited when it arrived. These Serums smell incredible, I was a little hesitant at first because usually high fragrances mess with my skin because it’s very sensitive to a lot but this did not irritate me at all, I believe that it’s working because my dark spots seem to be going away. I’m very impressed seeing as this is the first eye Serum I have ever tried. And would like to purchase this in the near future. nan
