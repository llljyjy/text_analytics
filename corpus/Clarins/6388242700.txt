This serum has an impressive ingredients list so I was super excited to try it. And I have to say, it’s pretty amazing! I’ve been using it for over a week so far and my skin seems more plump and radiant. I like how it sinks into the skin, leaving it looking hydrated and brighter. Plus it has a nice smell, I really enjoy it. I’m really looking forward to continuing using this serum and seeing the difference in my skin. nan
