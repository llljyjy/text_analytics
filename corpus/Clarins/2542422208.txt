I was able to try the Clarins Double Serum through a convenient 7-day sample set. I like that one of the main plant extracts in the serum is turmeric because of the anti-aging properties and that it helps to bring out your skin’s natural glow! The formula is easy to apply and doesn’t leave my skin overly oily or tacky like other serums do. Although I think more time was needed to see and feel the long-term effects of the serum, my skin did feel very hydrated after each use, which is great because the winter months tend to dry out my skin. #DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare #GotItFree nan
