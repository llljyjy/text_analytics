I received this product as a free sample in exchange for an honest review and it came in a series of snap cards meant to last seven days. A little goes a long way with this product. It has a nice fragrance and feels refreshing when applied. I did notice a brightening effect and definitely a hydrating effect. I have fine wrinkles under my eyes and saw no change while using the product. I found this to be a good serum and would be worth the price point for someone who needs help with dark circles or hydration under the eyes. Nice serum
