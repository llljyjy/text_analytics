This under eye serum absorbed nicely in my skin. I didn’t notice a fragrance at all. The dark circles under my eyes seem to not be as obvious, along with any fine lines. I’m pleased with the results, but I don’t care for having to double up on the serum. Just really awkward to apply. The sample I received was too much for one application too so I felt like I was wasting a lot of product. nan
