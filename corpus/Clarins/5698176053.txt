Finding a great eye cream is really really difficult so I’ve been on the hunt for a while now. I read the reviews on this Clarins eye cream and had high high hopes for it. Right off the bat, I had issues with the packaging - the pump doesn’t like to work and malfunctions a lot :/ Eventually after pressing like 109 times each time, I get some product. It’s a creamy eye cream that does moisturize my under eye area. My dark circles do seem improved and I’m enjoying the product but I really hope they improve the packaging. nan
