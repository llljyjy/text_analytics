After 7 days of using Double Serum Eye, I’m pleased to say that this product delivered on its promise. Looking in the mirror, my eyes had visibly reduced puffiness, and the dark circles had started to soften. And yes, I’ll admit that while I have long been in denial about ageing, it is true that I had started to notice some minor creases around my eyes which thankfully this serum has taken care of!  To sum up, Clarins Double Serum Eye has left my eyes feeling hydrated, smoother, less fatigued and looking much brighter. I’m not a very patient person so the ease at which I can use this product, in combination with the quickly visible results, has given me more than enough reason to give this product a permanent place in my beauty cupboard. It works
