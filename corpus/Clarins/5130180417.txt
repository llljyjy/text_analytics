I really liked this eye serum! I have very sensitive skin that tends to get dried out with eye serums and surprisingly I did not have that problem with this product! The sample packages I received are kind of hard to dispense but the product inside mixes well, goes on smoothly and doesnâ€™t leave my eye area sticky or oily because it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated! I would definitely recommend trying it! Awesome for sensitivity prone eye areas!
