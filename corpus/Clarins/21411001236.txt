I had the opportunity to try Clarins Double Serum for free through Butterly. I tried it for a week as directed. I found that if I used the amount recommended, it left my face feeling greasy. It did leave my skin feeling hydrated and supple. After a week I noticed a slight difference in the wrinkles on my forehead, although it was negligible & Iâ€™m unsure if it was just time of day. I do feel as though it made a difference in my skin tone. It does not look as dull. Overall I would recommend this product. #gotitfree #doubleserum #clarinsskincare Brighter Skin, but oily
