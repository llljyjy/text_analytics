I have used several eye serums over the years and this one wasn’t bad. I have read other reviews with complaints of redness and reactions, but I did not experience any of that and I do have sensitive dry skin. I found that this did a good job of lightening the dark circles I get and softened the lines around my eyes. I didn’t see a huge difference but there was a small difference so I would like to continue use and see if it improves with longer use. nan
