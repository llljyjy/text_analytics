Let me start this review by saying this mask wasn’t made for me. It was specifically made for Asian people and I’m white so factor that into my review. I did experience some depuffing but I don’t know if that’s from rinsing with cool water and massaging the mask off or the mask itself. It’s whipped texture is nice. I’m 70/30 on this mask. nan
