I have been using this mask for 6 months now. Unsure about other people, for for me this mask does work. I usually leave it on for not less than 30-40 minutes, it absorbs well, and then I just wash it off. The mask is great, it leaves my skin hydrated, plumped, and fresh looking. I typically use this once or twice a week. I’d say it is a splurge as the mask is expensive (so, minus one star for that). It has a strong smell, so for sensitive people it could be a little overwhelming. I’d buy it again should the price be lower. Works well on me, but expensive
