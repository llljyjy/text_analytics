I have been very happy over the last week and a half of trying out this neck cream. My neck looks and feels softer, and my neck lines are less visible. It makes my skin look bright and radiant. I use it on my shoulders and chest too, and they look just as radiant. My neck is sensitive so I’m very happy to say it hasn’t broken me out at all. If anything, it looks healthier and more hydrated than it did before. I also like the packaging. It just squeezes out as opposed to scooping it out of a jar. I can definitely see this being a repurchase! My neck already looks younger!
