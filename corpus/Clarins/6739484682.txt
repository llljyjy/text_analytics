I tried a seven day trial of this Clarinsâ€™ double serum in exchange for my honest opinion from @thisisbutterly and @clarinscanada. It is the #1 selling Prestige serum in Canada and I love Clarins products, especially their restorative night creams. This serum has a unique presentation as there are two separate formulations that are mixed together just before applying the serum on your skin. The point of this is to provide maximum benefits to combat the signs of aging in your skin. The serum has a pleasant scent. Over my 7 day trial period, I felt my skin was revitalized and renewed; I would recommend this product to others interested in looking after their skin and not affected by scented products. Great Serum!
