I received this free to try from Clarins and Butterly. I used it for 5 days before my review. The scent was clinical smelling, and I did not notice a difference at all in my face. in fact, I felt my skin was a bit drier than normal (however, it was only for 5 days.) The price point is quite high and I feel I can get better results from more affordable options. Its Okay.
