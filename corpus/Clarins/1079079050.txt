I was kindly gifted this v-lifting mask by Clarins and it is one of the most unique masks I’ve ever used that has delivered results. I absolutely love the gorgeous texture and the way this feels as it’s working. The application is on the bottom half of your face and then you gently massage and hold upward. My skin feels very firm and looks mildly lifted after using. I am beginning to try more of their plant-based products and loving my results so far. Innovative and works!
