This serum was super light, smelled nice, and absorbed quickly so didn’t leave my combo skin feeling greasy. I did the 7 day challenge and although I can’t say much on it making my fine lines disappear I did notice that my skin felt more hydrated, firm and my complexion did look clearer/ more healthy after consistent use. Love that this is free of mineral oils too! I can’t really think of any negatives except for the price tag! Nice, lightweight serum
