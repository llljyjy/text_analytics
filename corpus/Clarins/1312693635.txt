I have been looking for a firming neck and chest cream for a while and have heard good things about this one. After only using for about 2 weeks I can totally tell a difference. I feel like I am seeing tightening of the area as well as a visible difference in hydration.  I am loving it to far! I will say at first the scent is a bit strong (floral) but it fades quickly. I am fairly sensitive to strong scents and it did not bother me at all. Super happy with this product. love it!
