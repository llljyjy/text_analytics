I am a creature of habit and I generally like only specific products that I keep reusing to death. I was really pleasantly surprised by this serum, and I greatly enjoy the mixing process and application. It has a very soft scent which I typically avoid but didn’t mind in this case. My partner and I both applied the serum and immediately had the same reaction - “Dude, this feels good.” Interestingly, I have bone-dry skin and he has incredibly oily skin, and even the following day both of us loved how our faces felt. The only thing that’s holding me back is the very steep price point. I feel like this is going to be one of those splurge products I’d buy once in a while, but I don’t know yet if I can justify the full price regularly. nan
