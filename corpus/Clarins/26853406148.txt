I received a sample size product to try. I have bad undereye circles and my skin at undereye area has become very thin. I started applying this serum as i received the product; it does have made my skin more supple and hydrated but it is difficult to say any solid result within a period of one week as my undereye area is needs more care and attention. I have used other undereye serums so i can say this will definitely bring change in my condition if i continue using it. Satisfied.! Good product.!
