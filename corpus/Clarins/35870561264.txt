I really enjoyed my week-long sample of Clarins Double Serum. I used this product in the morning on a clean face, and before moisturizing. Within a couple of days of use, I noticed much softer and more hydrated skin, especially in areas that require extra care [such as under the eyes]. I was happy to see that despite seemingly oily at first, the serum was absorbed in my skin and it did not leave any oily reside after. My partner even notice that my skin was softer after using this product. I definitely recommend! A new hydration secret
