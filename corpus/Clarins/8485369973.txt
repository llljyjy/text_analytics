This is my first time using a double serum. I found it interesting that it is two different serums that you mix together after squeezing them out of the packet. I liked that there was little to no scent. There was a little tackiness on my skin after applying but that did not bother me. It worked well with my moisturizer. After 7 days of use, I did feel my skin was soft and firm. I gave this product 4 stars because I did not feel like it outperformed other serums I have in my skincare routine. Good serum
