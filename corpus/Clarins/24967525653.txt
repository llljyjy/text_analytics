Clarins Double Serum is a two step Hydric + Lipidic System. Required to mix one clear serum with another orange turmeric serum that doesnâ€™t stain your skin. It actually brightens my skin tone with a glistening effect.  Which I felt it had an oily texture having intense hydration. After applying at night by morning my skin tone was supple smoothed out fine lines. With a glass shine finish. Using this product for 7 days my  skins appearance was refreshed with an even skin tone, I was very impressed with this Clarins Double Serum and I highly recommend this to everyone.
