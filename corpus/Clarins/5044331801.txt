This eye cream feels really rich and smoothing - ideal for me since I have drier skin and some fine lines I’m starting to see under my eyes that I am always trying to keep moisturized. While this product didn’t erase every fine line, it felt extremely hydrating and smoothing, and my undereye concealer went on over it without any pilling. The scent was sort of a generic “fresh“ smell but nothing too strong or long-lasting. I can definitely see this being my fall/winter undereye moisturizer for day or night and I imagine it will really keep my eye area looking more plump and reduce the lines over time. Very rich and hydrating
