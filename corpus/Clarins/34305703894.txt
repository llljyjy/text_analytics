While I enjoy the product, I’ve only had the opportunity to test rather than use it for an extended period of time. I’ve loved how the serum felt on my skin but have not seen any visible results though there has been no pilling with my skincare routine which I am happy to report. The price tag is also pretty hefty and if I have the opportunity to try this product for longer, I will update my review.#DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare Great Serum (Tested)
