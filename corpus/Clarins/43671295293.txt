I got this to try this product for free from @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor @clarinscanada in exchange for my review. I only received enough for one week, so I didn’t notice any drastic changes. I will say that it did leave my skin very smooth, and did tone down some of my redness, which I haven’t been able to do in the past. I have normally oily skin, and this serum did not add to it; it hydrated my skin without making it oily. I am somewhat sensitive to smell, but this serum actually smelled quite nice! I can’t say that I’ve noticed much difference in 7 days, so I wish I had the chance to try it longer before reviewing it, especially to see the effet on wrinkles. Overall, I was quite happy with it, just wish I could have fully tested its advertized benefits! nan
