I bought this to try as a replacement for Clarins’ “Gentle Foaming Cleanser with Shea Butter“ that I’ve been using for many years, but which has recently been discontinued.This new product has a stronger scent which I found too strong and really unpleasant. This cleanser also left my skin feeling dry. I was dissatisfied enough with this product that I returned it, but my disappointment lead me to try the Skinfix “Barrier+ Foaming Oil Hydrating Cleanser“ instead, and it’s awesome!!! I like it better than the original Clarins cleanser I’ve been using for so many years. Since Clarins also discontinued my favourite moisturizer (“Fluide Hydratant“ in a pump), I also tried the Skinfix “Barrier+ Triple Lipid-Peptide Lotion Moisturizer“ as a replacement, and am very, very happy with it too! The only downside is that the Skinfix lotion doesn’t have any SPF. I’m a new convert from Clarins to Skinfix though. Scent is too strong, and it left my skin too dry
