Got this finally in the mail. The anticipation has been driving me crazy since there were issues with the mail in our neighborhood arriving. So let’s start with what I thought of Clarins Double Serum Hydric + Lipidic System I got to try free. I received this as a set of 7 day samples to try once daily. The instructions were straight forward, and easy to follow. Just with a clean face, whether its day or night you apply it all over your face. I added it to my nightly routine.I usually have a combination of dry and oily on my skin. I found this was great for my face. At day 3 I noticed that my face was moisturized in my dry area. And areas like my nose that is usually greasy, weren’t even oily.  At the end of day 7 I felt my face was a lot more firm, while being smooth at the same time. The smell of the product is a little strong at first but I’m not sure of the turmeric in it. The smell does fade away though. Overall I’m happy with the results with the little work that is involved.
