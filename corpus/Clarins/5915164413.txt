I only received this as a deluxe sample to try out, so unfortunately I only had 7 days to see results which isnâ€™t the best for skincare. The things I noticed from that time periods were that it gave good hydration under my eyes and provided a nice extra boost for my eye cream. It has a slight smell, but it does disappear over time. This would be a good option for someone who wants to try out an eye serum especially if you want to help with fine lines due to dehydration. hydrating
