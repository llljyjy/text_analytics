I’m always so cautious to try new serums because my skin is quite picky and acne prone. I received these as a sample and at first I didn’t mind it. The sample packs have wasteful packaging though. The serum is a bit greasy feeling and it absorbed alright but my face did feel greasy for a while after using it. I feel like it may have helped with the fine lines on my forehead BUT I think it caused some breakouts :(  so maybe not the best for acne prone skin … the fragrance were a bit overwhelming at first but then I got used to it. At least it doesn’t smell like tumeric lol. I like the idea of the serum but I don’t think it works for me with my picky skin. An okay serum.
