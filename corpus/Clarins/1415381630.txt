This is a really very moisturizing eye cream.  The texture is creamy and smooth and it really helps to hydrate the delicate skin under my eyes.  My under eye area is very dry and this makes it look so much better! It’s not too greasy to wear in the morning either and actually helps my concealer go on smoother. I haven’t been using it enough to notice a lifting effect but in terms of hydration it is really helping to hydrate and plump up the fine lines under my eyes. Super hydrating
