Listen, I’m a puffy person. Sometimes I go to desperate measures to reduce my puffiness. After gua sha, jade rolling, limiting sodium and staying hydrated didn’t fully reduce my puffiness I decided to splurge on this. It’s a mystical $63 jar of magic toted as the holy grail of masques. I’ve used it a few times without noticing a huge difference, but it still softens my skin and helps a bit. I likely would not buy again, but the jury is still out. Jury is still out
