I received this product for free in exchange for reviewing it for Influenster. I liked this product, but I didn’t like getting it in a sample size. The packaging made it hard to accurately squeeze out the right amount of product.  I personally feel like 7 days isn’t long enough to really see a difference . It didn’t bother my skin so I’ll give that a bonus point . But other than that I can’t really say . nan
