I got to try some samples of this double serum and I thought the serum was able to moisturize while keeping the hydration locked in my skin. After an hour, I can feel that my skin is still very smooth and was not oily at all. I enjoy using this twice a day. After 7 days of use, I can visibly see my skin more brighter and produce a nice glow. Light to touch, results that last!
