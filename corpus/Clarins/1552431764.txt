This firming neck and décolleté cream from Clarins is very nice. The cream is lightweight and absorbs easily but hydrates like a much heavier cream. The fragrance is light and pleasant. Since using this product I haven’t noticed significant firming but the hydration of my neck has significantly increased therefore making my neck look younger.  Overall I think this is a lovely product. I’m docking one star as the price is higher than I feel a neck cream should Lovely product
