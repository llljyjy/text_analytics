I never used the original formula so I don’t have anything to compare to…that being said I’ve bought this twice now. Keeps acne under control for me, I ran out and my skin started acting up. it soothes my skin and I love the healthy, mattifying effect. It’s very thick so you only need a little. I rub it on dry skin like a mask then activate it with water really taking time to work it into my skin and rinse. Noticed a difference  when I used this after being out of it for a while. 2nd time purchasing
