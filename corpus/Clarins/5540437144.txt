Very different texture than most eye products I’ve used. Very thin but still moisturized. I got a week of sample packets and I just don’t think that is long enough for me to have any dramatic results but I thought the product was ok. Pretty high level of fragrance I wish wasn’t there but not a bad scent. I have to embarrassingly say I got this in my eye somehow I think every time I used it and it was very gentle(surprising due to to the fragrance especially)some products will irritate my eyes even when I haven’t actually got the product in my eye & god help you if you do(I always ask why would an eye product be made thats so harsh to the eyes,yes I know it’s my dumb fault for getting it in there but it’s made for use around the EYES be gentle lol),so this was a nice surprise. nan
