I received this from Butterly / Chickadvisor in exchange for my honest opinions (#gotitfree, #freesample, #DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare). I have been using this for over a week now and I have been using it as a a part of my daily night time routine. I use this after cleansing and toning instead of a serum. It doesnâ€™t leave my face feeling oily or greasy and has a nice soothing fragrance. I have extremely oily skin and therefore I dont layer this up with moisturizers or serums but it is more catered towards drier skin family. The skin feels well hydrated in the morning and I would recommend this to friends and family if you want to splurge a little. Feels well hydrated
