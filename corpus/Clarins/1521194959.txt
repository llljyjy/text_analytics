I have been using Clarins Double Serum for the past 5 days. I was pleasantly surprised at the great scent, as I was thinking it would smell more like herbs or turmeric, but quite the opposite! It goes on smooth and is not sticky at all. Iâ€™m not sure how long I need to use it to see results, but my skin already feels great. Smells amazing!
