I enjoy using this serum on a cleansed face, after I use a toner. It mixes nicely in my palm and feels amazing on my skin. It spreads easily and absorbs quickly without leaving me feeling sticky or tacky. I follow with a good moisturizer as well. This has been a nice addition to my skincare routine. Good serum
