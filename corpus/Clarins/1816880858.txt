Iâ€™m impressed with this eyecream the texture is lightweight,  It does provide a temporary eye lift most likely due to the caffeine ingredient in it.  I have undereye wrinkles I honestly skip eye cream due to sensitive skin but this eyecream is gentle I havent noticed any irritations and my undereye appear smoother also I noticed my skin is well hydrated so my concealer looks a lot better no more creepy undereyes! nan
