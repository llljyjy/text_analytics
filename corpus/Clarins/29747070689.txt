This product came with 7 packs so that you can use it once a day for a week. Even though this is my first time trying it, right away I notice a glow on my skin! This serum is VERY hydrating. I recommend this product during the dry winter months when your skin is not its best. This will definitely give your skin the boost it needs! There is a very light scent, almost like a clean soapy scent. I am in love with this serum and I already understand the hype üòç A Winter NEED
