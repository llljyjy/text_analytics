I honestly was a little weary about the serum that it would feel like honey on my face because to me it looks like honey in a jar. After trying it out I wasn’t thinking that any more. It went on smooth and left my face feeling pretty good. It’s not a serum that I was extremely impressed with but still liked it. I already had a bottle of this that I rarely reach for it before I received this sample from influenster. Just ok
