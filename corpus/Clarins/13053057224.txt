I received a free sample from influenster in exchange for my honest review. I do like this serum as it is very Hydrating and absorbs well. It has a nice consistency and after using, skin feels plump and healthy. I did notice small improvements in the look of the fine lines around my eyes and believe that with regular use, Iâ€™d get even better results. Functional and useful
