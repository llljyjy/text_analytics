Used it at night right after shower. It has a light pleasant floral scent and has a transparent light brown color. Upon application, it instantly made my skin become softer.

However, I was not able too see any improvements in fine lines, uneven texture and dark spots since there was only 7 days supply of samples provided by @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor @clarinscanada Softer skin
