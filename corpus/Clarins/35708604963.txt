It glides easily over the skin and has a very pleasant feeling.  It doesnâ€™t absorb right away.  The serum is absorbed by the skin gradually, at first there is a slight stickiness and moisture, it is comfortable, and completely disappears into the skin in about five minutes.  It does not cause unpleasant sensations, it just needs to be allowed to be absorbed completely.  Serum does not feel greasy.scent is very weak, it smells cosmetically very muffled. i liked it The best
