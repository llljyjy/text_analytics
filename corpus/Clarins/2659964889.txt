I recently tried the Clarins Double Serum in the trial plastic packages. I really loved how well the serum absorbed into my skin. I used it every night for a week so far and my skin in soft, hydrated and radiant. It makes my skin feel fantastic. The trial packages are a little hard to use and actually get the product out of . I think it would be much better in a jar with a pump or a dropper. Excited to keep using and see the changes in my skin, especially as we head to the dryer and colder seasons of fall and winter. Only negative so far is the price as itâ€™s not an inexpensive serum. nan
