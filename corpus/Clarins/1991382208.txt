This makes myskin glow,look refreshed and more radiant! It has a nice consistency, absorbs well into my skin, and has a really nice fragrance. Sometimes my skin can be sensitive but I had no negativereactions. I receiveda 7 day sample from @Butterly and have only been trying it for a few days and have noticed some improvement in firmness but I anticipate that if I was using it forlonger I would notice more improvement in fine lines.I appreciate how Clarins is a company that cares so much about sustainability and that,combined with the great result meansI will be purchasing it to keep these results going.#DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare #gotitfree Wonderfully radiant
