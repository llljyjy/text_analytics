This is a very nice serum where the skin feels awesome right away and the scent is lovely.The only thing is that I didn’t find the sample packaging very friendly, it was kind of hard to get the product out. 7 days isn’t enough to really tell the results but I personally like it so far. I would recommend the serum, I personally really liked it. Lovely scent, feels good
