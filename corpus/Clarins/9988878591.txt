I received this amazing new serum by Clarins from butterly for free in exchange for my honest opinion. I love how it smells soo amazing! I also love how we take it out and apply it on the skin by mixing the two phases together. I have felt visible differences in my skin. It looks brighter, hydrated, moisturized and more smooth. I think i will keep buying it to stay youthful with a beautiful healthy skin. Love it!
