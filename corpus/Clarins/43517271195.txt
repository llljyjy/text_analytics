I have to start off with saying that this serum has really made a huge difference in a lot of problem areas with my skin.  I’m hitting the age where signs of aging are just apart of life. Although growing isn’t a bad thing, I’d like to slow the visible process down. Lol.  I found after the first 3 days I was seeing results in skin tone being more even, my skin felt and looked hydrated, the fine lines around my eyes seemed to be slowly fading with the added bonus of it being a product I wanted to try but was hesitant. Now this will be my go to serum from now on. With these results who wouldn’t want this product in their life!Highly recommend. My Favorite Serum
