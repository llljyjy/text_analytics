This Double Serum definitely made my skin feel really smooth the day after. The only thing I wasnâ€™t a huge fan of was that when applying, the serum felt really sticky and the fragrance was a bit too strong. However, I loved the fact that I wake up with extremely soft skin for my extremely dry skin! Works well!
