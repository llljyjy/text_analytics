V-Facial Intensive Wrap mask comes in a rose gold jar and it looks beautiful on my vanity. I like that it only takes 10-minute to get rid of the puffiness and swelling. I experience lots of stress, heat, and hormonal changes. My skin is puffy most of the time. The formula of this luxurious mask is beautiful - it is whipped and has a mousse texture. It’s easy to apply and it also washes off easily with cool water. It has a very mild powdery scent that isn’t overpowering. I didn’t experience any irritation and I have somewhat sensitive skin. I like how soft and radiant my skin looks and feels after using this mask and recommend a face massage. Love it
