I was given a 7 day sample of Clarins Double Serum in exchange for my honest review.  The serum came individually packaged and had you crack a seam along the middle of the package to mix the two separate serum components.  I honestly found this a bit messy and hard to get everything out.  That being said, a full bottle of this product probably wouldn’t give the same issue. I used this product at night after cleansing my skin, when it was the most absorbent. The serum was a bit sticky and my skin tends to not absorb serums of this particular consistency.  This isn’t to say it wouldn’t be a good serum for others, just perhaps not me.  I loved the rich spicy scent of the product which smelled expensive but wasn’t overpowering.  My skin did look nice after using the product for a few days but again, my skin didn’t absorb it fully and felt a bit sticky afterwards.  I think this would be an amazing serum for those with very dry skin.  My skin is combination and fussy! A good serum, just maybe not quite right for me
