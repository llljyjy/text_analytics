I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.As far as serums go, Clarins Double Serum brings innovation to the table with its two-in-one formula, which you mix together in the sachet. The result is a mixture of a slightly oily emulsion that soothes the skin during application. Despite the serum’s consistency, the skin doesn’t feel greasy after treatment.It absorbs fairly quickly into the skin, so you don’t have to wait long to apply moisturizer on top. There is a slight floral scent, so those with scent sensitivities may wish to take this into consideration. But it doesn’t linger on the skin for long.The addition of turmeric helps to brighten up a dull complexion, while plant extracts assist to create a softly radiant base. After seven days of usage, I observed how soft my skin felt and how uniform it appeared, helping to create a youthful exterior. As far as anti-aging skin routines go, the Clarins Double Serum deserves a spot as a strong contender. nan
