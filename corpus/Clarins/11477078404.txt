I was so happy to be chosen to trial the Clarins Double Serum. This serum is lightly scented, non greasy/oily, not tacky and leaves your skin feeling refreshed. Honestly, after day 2 I could see a difference in my face. It looked hydrated, luminous, brightened & most definitely smoother. I feel that with long term use this would have a pretty major impact on the face. #GotItFree Definite must try
