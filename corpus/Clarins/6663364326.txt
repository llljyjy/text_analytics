I received this product free for review. I only received 7 Days worth of product. This review is based on a week of use. This comes out of the packet as a hydrolipidic white cream on one side and hydric clear oil on the other. They mixed well and applied easily. I didn’t like the style of the packet sample because it was hard to squeeze it out with one hand and catch the product with the other. It was hard to get all of the product out.  There was no irritation. It has the standard department store floral scent that eventually dissipated. I have a problem with some eye creams causing milia and had no issues. It’s a little greasy. Looks like there is more clear oil than white cream, so it is difficult to get the correct ratio of each side. It claims to firm, hydrate, and reduce wrinkles. The only difference I noticed was some hydration. I would only purchase this if it were on sale. nan
