I received this product as a week trial sample through influencer and exchange for my honest review. I enjoyed the product themselves however the sample package that it came in was not very effective at getting the mixed combination from the moisturizer and syrum sides of the product effectively out of the packaging. I did not see a very big difference in the creases around my eye area And I am also not certain that I got the intended ratio clarins markets.  This product is not economically priced, Given my experience with this week I donâ€™t know that I would purchase a full size. It did leave my eyes hydrated and this was a fun temporary addition to my night routine. Influenster promotion, problems with packaging
