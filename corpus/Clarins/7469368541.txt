So I really like this product and how it brightens and really moisturizes under my eyes. It helps keep my concealer looking fresh and even if I don’t wear makeup, my eyes look brighter and more refreshed. However, the bottle is kind of a pain. It pumps out way too much, especially for an eye cream and maybe my bottle is broken but it always flies out everywhere. I think the best way to apply it is to put it on the back of your hand and then mix it. It’s kind of hard to do it if you pump straight onto your finger like I normally do with eye creams. product is great! the bottle is a pain.
