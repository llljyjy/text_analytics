I was sent this product for testing purposes through Influenster. I really liked the scent and even with the sample packets, a little goes a long way so I’m sure a bottle of the eye serum would last quite a while. I also like that its  is made of 96% of ingredients of natural origin and contains ingredients like tumeric and wild chervil. I didn’t experience any sort of reaction or breakout from this serum which is always a plus and the skin under my eyes was more visibly smooth and hydrated. nan
