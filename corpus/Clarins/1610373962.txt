I had the opportunity to try a 7-day sample of Clarins Double serum for free thanks to Butterly. This serum applied evenly and felt very nice on my face. After only a few days of use, my skin felt very soft and hydrated.  I would highly recommend this serum to anyone struggling with dry or dull skin. Feels great on my skin!
