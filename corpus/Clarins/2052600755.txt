I’m really skeptical when it comes to eye creams but this had an amazing feeling when applied. It definitely had a slight lift to one eye but I wouldn’t say it’s super noticeable. I still love the ingredients and the way it feels when I put it in my skincare fridge so I do think it’s a great eye cream. My only con is the price is outrageous but I can understand due to the packaging. Love it!
