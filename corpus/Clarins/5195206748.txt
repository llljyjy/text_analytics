I have been loving the 7 day trial of @clarinscanada Double Serum that I got free from @thisisbutterly !!! The little packets were perfect for on the  go use as well. It’s a double formulation for anti-aging, hydration and nutrition! The regular product comes in a bottle with a bit of a high price tag - BUT you only use a tiny bit at a time! I can already tell after 7 days that it’s brightening up my face! It has a medium potency floral scent which at first was a bit overwhelming for me - but the scent fades pretty quickly!! Brightens your face
