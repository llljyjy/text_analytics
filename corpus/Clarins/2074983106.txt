I was  happy to try this product for free from Bitterly and Chick Advisor. I had been curious about Clarins products for a long time but hadnâ€™t had the chance to try them. This product is really nice, though the sampling packaging was really difficult to work worth as it was hard to get one of the products out. I assume this would not be the case on the full sized item. The product did make my face soft and gave it a refreshed look, I assume due to the tumeric. However, the main drawback is the cost. Skincare is more accessible these days and while I think the more luxe items like this will still draw people in I do think there is a way to get similar results with other products. Though, as I age this may become a staple item, time may tell! nice but pricey
