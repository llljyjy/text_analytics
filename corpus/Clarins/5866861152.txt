I wanted to love this but I can’t say that I did. I definitely liked the serum but there was nothing to love about it. My skin felt soft after using but aside from that I haven’t noticed any other results. Because of the cost, and the subpar results I probably wouldn’t buy this product again. Slightly disappointed. Just So So
