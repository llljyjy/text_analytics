The texture is similar to the double serum for face.  A little bit more watery though.  I can’t use it daily as it’s too much for my skin.  I broke out a bit around my eye which is common for myself while using eye creams/serums.  I was able to use it every few days to help with combating fine lines.  I like that’s it’s not too heavy around my eye area.  So it stays in place once applied and doesn’t move in towards my eye. Light weight comforting
