This is definitely a luxury product, both in the packaging and actual feeling of the product. The bi-phase texture texture is neat - it’s very thin, so layers well under other skincare steps, but feels very hydrating at the same time. I have yet to see long term effects of using this product, but it’s worked well for my skin so far in keeping it smooth and hydrated. Because it’s bi-phase, definitely recommend pumping into the palm, rubbing it between your hands, and then applying, so the two phases are equally distributed. The pump on this product is also very nice, to be able to do a large or small pump of product. I recommend this if you have the money, but it is very expensive and there are more affordable options on the market for good serums. nan
