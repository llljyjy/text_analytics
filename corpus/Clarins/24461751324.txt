It is a nice light serum but didn’t really live up to all of the promises on the packaging. I used this product after coming back from a vacation where I had lots of sun exposure. While I found it helped make my skin soft, I didn’t find it plumped my skin or helped with the lines around my eyes. I received this product as part of a beauty review campaign and was given enough to last me a week, I suppose if I was able to use it for several months I may feel differently. Overall, a fairly good product, but I’m not sure if it justifies the $170+ for 2.5 oz. Good serum but overpriced
