I was given this as a trial and I feel like it’s not long enough for me to see a noticeable difference yet. Supposed to make fine lines and pores better but not really seeing it yet. It did take a while to absorb into my skin after application. While it is drying it feels pretty oily and a little tacky feeling. However the smell is not too overpowering. It’s got a gentle floral smell which is nice. The serum did help in making my skin feel softer. Took a while to absorb to skin
