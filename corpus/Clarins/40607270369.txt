I tried the clarins double serum for 7 days after receiving a #freeproduct sample.This serum has a slightly oily texture to it, but absorbs into your skin quickly with a light feeling and no oily feeling once dried. I used this serum for 7 days and my face felt smoother, my complexion was a little brighter and my face definitely felt more hydrated. It also has a nice scent and is not overpowering. The only thing I didn’t like was the packaging is a bit awkward to deal with but with a full sized product that shouldn’t be an issue. Great serum!
