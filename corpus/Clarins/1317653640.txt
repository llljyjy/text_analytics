I recently had the opportunity to try @clarins  Double serum. Thanks to @butterly @chickadvisors and @clarinscanadaI have never have used a serum in my nightly routine, but after using Clarins Double Serum, I will probably change that!The serum is light weight and although itâ€™s oily, my skin absorbed it quickly. After a week of using the serum, I saw a small difference in the appearance. Which is definitely a plus for me!#DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare#gotitfree#faceserum#productreview #productreviewclub #gifted#luxuryskincare nan
