This is the only other serum that I would put against the Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery or Estée Lauder Night Repair. This makes a great pre-req for your nighttime moisturizer and I really enjoyed the feeling it gave my skin. It was a bit perfumey but that is something that I don’t mind. If you have sensitive skin or are sensitive to smell I would keep that in mind. A Great Serum
