I got to try #ClarinsSkinCare #DoubleSerum thanks to #Butterly #gotitfree.  @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor @clarinscanada.  The sample I was given was for 7 days.  You only need a little bit to spread across your face.  It made my skins feel soft and moisturized and smelled so good.  I love that it did not leave my face greasy and was good for layering other products.  My skin is sensitive, and it did not irritate me at all.  I love this product. I love Clarins Serum
