I got to try the Clarinds double serum for free in exchange for an honest review and Iâ€™m so glad because I absolutely love this serum! On my first application, I could feel my skin hydrated and it felt nice and soft. The mixture of oil and gel contains 21 plants and has a very nice floral yet fruity scent. The serum is very easy to apply and glides on the skin very nicely and evenly. My skin stayed hydrated until my next application. I didnt see a difference in aging signs since it was a 7 day application but I can image it doing a difference after a few weeks. nan
