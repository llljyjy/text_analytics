Was some what impressed but also disappointed with this product. I was disappointed because I felt like they tried to be unique and design a fun new package and way to dispense but wasnâ€™t impressed having to fold and squeeze and then mix together it was kind of hard for me to do one handed. Was impressed with the overall serum itself, left my face feeling good and not too oily and has a very pleasant but mild scent. Awesome
