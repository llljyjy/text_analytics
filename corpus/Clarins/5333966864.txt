Clarins is ahead of the game with this one. My under eyes are somewhat dark and always look so tired. With this product I’m able to see near immediate results. I apply in the am and pm, its’s nice to see my tired skin perk up after a long day or after a bad nights sleep. The texture is hydrating and creamy. I love that it’s formulated with 94% natural ingredients (Organic Harungana-as effective as retinol) and enhances lashes and brows among other great aspects. Blends in to the skin effortlessly leaving behind only a small amount of soak in time. Overall I enjoy and recommend! nan
