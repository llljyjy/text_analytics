in the past I had stopped using toner , because it made my skin dryer.  I was suggested this toner by a sephora employee. I am in my mid fifties and especially in fall and winter have very dry skin.   well I have found the holy grail of toners.  what a difference .makes me look forward to my facial routine. once I forgot it and after putting my night cream felt my skin tight. So this tells me it helps creams better do their purpose in making our skin  feel good. made me come back to putting on toner
