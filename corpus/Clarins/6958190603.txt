This serum concentrate smells so amazing. It absorbs into the skin well and a little goes a long way. I received 5 samples and used one each night for 5 days. I definitely saw a difference in my skin the morning after. My face looked glowing, felt soft, and I had less red in areas that I typically have redness. I have sensitive and dry skin. I didn’t have any breakouts while using this serum. I didn’t notice a difference in my fine lines but I’m sure that takes more use and time. I highly recommend for anyone trying to get a firmer and better complexion. nan
