I’m a huge fan of this double serum for youthful looking eyes.  I applied it as instructed and it went on flawlessly. I had double cleansed my face prior to application and moisturized after and my skin honestly felt like a dream; Dewey and light.  I loved how hydrating the formula was and kept my face looking smooth and bright. My skin felt revitalized and just looked healthy. This is definitely my top favorite eye serum I’ve tried and I’m so glad I discovered it. Def recommend. They nailed the formula for results and it it has a light pleasant scent. My new go-to!
