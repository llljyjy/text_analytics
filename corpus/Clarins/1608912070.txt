I really liked this product.  The texture was light and smooth, and didn’t leave my face feeling greasy or sticky.  It really does instantly give your tired face some life in the morning.  My face feels refreshed and smooth after applying.  I like the scent of the product, it’s in my opinion just right.  Definitely not too strong for those with sensitivity to smells.  I would definitely recommend! Great product!!
