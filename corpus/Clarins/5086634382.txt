I liked the application of the serum because it feels light and is not sticky. The scent is pleasant and not overpowering, which is nice for those who are sensitive to strong scents. For reference, I have combination skin and I used the serum day and night before applying moisturizer and felt that my skin felt smoother, plumped, and more hydrated. The only downside is the price of the serum, as it is quite expensive, but if it is within your budget, I would recommend trying it out! @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor @clarinscanada Smoothing serum
