I received this product as part of a sample campaign from Butterly. The scent is quite nice and not overpowering at all.  I’m almost in my mid-30’s and skin care has become more of a priority for me. After washing my face, I applied this to clean skin. My skin has been insanely dry around my T-zone because of winter and harsh winds. I did find it cleared up my dry skin and left it feeling pretty smooth after the week of samples. The price point is definitely keeping me away from buying this product.  #DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare #gotitfree Not bad, nice serum.
