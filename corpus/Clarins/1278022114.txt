I received the Clarins double serum to try for my review. At first I was a little skeptical because so many products claim to help with aging. It is not too bad, but it is hard to judge an anti aging product in a short period of time. I found this product to have a very strong smell. I usually go for products that are fragrance free because of my sensitive skin. I did find this serum very hydrating, my skin felt plump without being too oily. I donâ€™t think I would purchase this serum do to price. For a bottle of this it is over $100 with tax and that is a lot for what I usually spend on skincare products. Just another anti aging serum
