I received a sample of this product from Clarins and influencer. The sample cards were hard to get an even amount of product out of and I only had enough for a week so I can’t give a very detailed review. I liked that it didn’t mess with my contacts or make my eyes sensitive. The product helped smooth the skin and hydrate. It personally didn’t help with my dark circles. It’s a nice bonus product to use in your beauty routine. nan
