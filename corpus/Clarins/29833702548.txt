Iâ€™m totally loving the packaging on these Serum. I love how it is transparent and you can see the beautiful color and texture of the Serum. It reminds me so much of honey plus it looks great on display. It is not sticky or heavy bon the skin. My undereye area is left looking and feeling amazing. It feels super refreshing on the skin and really helps reduce any inflammation under the eye area. Love the packaging
