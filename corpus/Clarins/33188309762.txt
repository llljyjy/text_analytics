I received these products for free from Influenster and Clarins, and Sephora in exchange for my honest review. I received the sample product Double Serum. It was a bit messy to remove all the product and get a good amount of each to mix together. Hard to range if you are getting enough or doing it right. The scent is strong enough to sting your eyes at first. The double serum does leave your face feeling smooth just not sure about the firmness. Not a product I would recommend if I am having to mix it myself as I have no idea how much of each Iâ€™m actually getting. Messy Mess!
