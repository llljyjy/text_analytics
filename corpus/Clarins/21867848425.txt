@thisisbutterly @chickadvisor @clarinscanada I received these samples free as a Chick Advisor. I love how the samples to test were packaged. Perfect amount for each application with minimal waste, easy to apply leaving my skin feeling moisturized for many hours after. I did notice a slight difference after two days in my skins smoothness and radiance. There was no significant fragrance. I am unsure of price point but it gives a high end feel. At the right price point, I would purchase again. Love the Effect!
