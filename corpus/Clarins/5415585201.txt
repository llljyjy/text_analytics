Thanks to @chickadvisor @thisisbutterly for this #doubleserum 7 day sample from @clarinscanada to try in exchange for my honest opinion. #gotitfree #produitreçu #clarinsskincare I tried the product for 7 days as part of my nighttime routine, using 1 sachet every day. The “two-phase“ formula was easy to apply and wasn’t at all sticky. I started to notice that my skin looked brighter and nicer on day 6. My skin felt much smoother as well. Overall, it was a great product. I think it would be easier to use the full size with the pump. 🍂 My skin loved it.
