I tried this neck moisturizer bc I do have neck wrinkles but I didn’t see much of a difference. I normally bring all my products from my face down to my neck and I used this product for about 3 weeks once a day and I love how it feels but I don’t see much of a difference. The texture is super creamy and hydrating/moisturizing. I love the packaging, but to me not worth the price Not worth the price
