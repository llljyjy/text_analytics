I got this product to try for free from Butterly, and I can say this product is one of the best I have tried! Interesting package, there’s 2 kinds of serum coming out and you have to mix it. The first thing i noticed right away was the pleasant and gentle smell, that I liked right away. Next is the serum’s texture, it feels light but i could sense the hydrophilic and lipophilic characteristics of the serum which made me think oh, this is gonna cover my facial skin’s needs coz my face has a combination of dry and oily areas. And true enough while applying it to my face, my face felt supple and smooth in the sense that the texture felt even, with no dry spots and the normally oily spots felt hydrated equally as the usually dry spots, i think due to the serum’s light texture and combination. After application, my skin looked like it is glowing. I think this product is at par with those Japanese and Korean facial products, definitely will buy this product. My skin felt so soft and supply on first try!
