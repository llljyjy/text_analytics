I want to preface my review by saying I received a sample of this product to try, and was only able to use it once a day for seven days. Maybe I would see better results with more consistent use. The serum smells great, and is super lightweight on my skin. I like the way it feels going on, and it sits nicely under makeup or moisturizer without getting oily or greasy. I didn’t notice any difference in my skin’s appearance, which is why I’m giving it three stars out of five. nan
