* I love this New Clarins double eye serum. I have been using this New double eye serum every night, this serum is very lightweight and quickly absorbing. I can definitely see my results in few days. My under eyes skin looks less puffy and my skin feels tighter, smoother and moisturized. My fine lines around my eyes are less visible and even. * I love the natural ingredients with ginger, oat sugars, avocado, kiwi extract and turmeric. This serum has a fantastic luxurious light scent. I will definitely continue using it every day! Fantastic double eye serum
