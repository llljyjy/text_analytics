I received the double serum free to try from #thisisbutterly @chickadvisor @clarinscanada. I really enjoyed using this product. It was a new concept that I had not tried before. I feel like keeping the 2 separated and mixing them once using definitely made it more effective. It applied to my skin smoothly and left me with a bit of a glow. I would highly recommend! #DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare Perfect serum!
