I already love everything Clarins but I had yet to try this serum. The first thing I noticed was the wonderful smell, it wasn’t super intense of annoying, it was quite pleasant for a face product. The texture was also nice, though I wanted to suggest to maybe make it less oily/sticky, though that didn’t seem to be that much of a problem after it dried/got absorbed. I think I would need to try the full size for a longer period of time in order to be able to comment about results, but I did notice improvement after using it 7 days with these samples, my skin was definetly smoother and some imperfections started to vanish, plus it seemed to help with the oiliness on my face, so I believe this would work wonders long term. I would definetly buy the full size next time. I got this product for free in exchange for my review. The smell is wonderful
