I was lucky enough to be chosen by Butterly and Chickadvisor to try out the Clarins Double Serum for 7 days and give my thoughts on the product. Yes, I got it free! So here’s my honest review... Fresh out of the shower is when I prefer using this amazing serum! I apply it by warming the double serum in my hand and gently pressing it onto my face and neck. The serum is non-greasy and just melts into my skin instantly. My skin feels so silky smooth and hydrated afterwards. My face looks brighter and rejuvenated as well. I absolutely love the floral, fruity scent! It’s not at all overpowering and it smells so refreshing and pleasant. I like the fact that this formula combines 21 potent plant extracts to boost the skin and the design is eco-friendly. I’m sad that the 7-day samples are now over... but I’ll be sure to put this on my Christmas wish list and pass it on to my hubby! Fingers crossed that I’ll find it under the tree this year!!#DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare #gotitfree#thisisbutterly #chickadvisor #ClarinsCanada My skin is glowing and feels so hydrated!
