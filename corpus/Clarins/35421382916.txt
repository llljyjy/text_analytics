Clarins Double Serum is definitely a product worth trying. I think it is so neat that it has two separate formulas in one container that you mix in your hands. I have never seen that done before. It gets better though. The serums are made of 21 potent plant extracts that boost 5 functions great for turning back the hands of time for your skin. These are regeneration, oxygenation, nutrition, hydration, and protection. The majority of people who use this serum find that after only 7 days they have smoother, more radiant, and more beautiful skin. This is because it is formulated to help reduce wrinkles, fine lines, enlarged pores, and loss of radiance and firmness. Now, did I find that this was the case for me? Yes and no. Every day after washing my face using this Clarins serum, I noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin. My eyes looked less puffy, and the bags under my eyes seemed to subside. My skin looked more fresh and bright as well. That said, I felt that I was back at square one by the next day. I believe it would work better for me if I were to use it twice a day so it can continuously work on my skin. Also, I may need to do it longer than 7 days to get the results, due to the condition of my skin from chronic illness. I definitely want to buy it and use it for a much longer amount of time. I highly encourage you to try it for yourself, I donâ€™t think you can be disappointed. Even if it works the way it did with my skin, you still see a noticeable difference throughout the day, and I was very happy with that. And that was just after one time. The best part is that it is made for all ethnicities and skin types. So literally anybody can use it and get at least some benefits from it. My skin looked more fresh and bright
