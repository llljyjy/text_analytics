I was dying to try Double Serum Firming & Smoothing Anti-Aging Concentrate from Clarins, looking at its impressive ingredients list and also its high price point. After using it fora week, I feel like this product has both pros and cons for me.The concentrate consists of 2 formulas which you have to mix before applying: an orange oil phase and a transparent gel-like phase. The serum has a strong floral scent which is okay for me, but may be a bit overwhelming for those who prefer unscented products, it smells more like a perfume than skincare.After application, it doesn’t feel like a serum at all, it feels like a real face OIL. It absorbs quite slowly and feels tacky, so I wouldn’t recommend applying it under the makeup, unless you have a lot of time in the morning and are okay with a very dewy and light coverage, cause your foundation won’t stay in place for a long time on suchan oily base. Thus, I’d rather consider it as a night serum.As for the result, I feel like it definitely improved my skin tone. Although I don’t normally buy face oils and prefer much more lightweight face products, I enjoyed using it and liked how healthy and bright my skin looked after each application. I can definitely see those rich ingredients working and how they improved my skin condition by preventing breakouts and dryness.To summarize, I think this would work perfectly for more mature skin and those who love using face oils. I feel like the long-term results will be impressive. For myself, however, I would still prefer something more lightweight and affordable. Maybe I should buy it for my mom :)P.S. I received this product from This is Butterly in exchange for my honest review. Holy grail if you are into face oils
