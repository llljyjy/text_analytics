I absolutely loved this serum. First things with serums is texture and I really liked this. It’s not overly sticky which is my biggest thing. Jumping straight to the actual benefits, I can see the glow and radiance in my skin. It’s a little too soon to tell about the loss of firmness and elasticity stuff, but just overall, I think this is an effective serum and yes a little steep, but worth the cost Lovely serum
