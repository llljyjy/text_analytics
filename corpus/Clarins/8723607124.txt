This product in the sample pouch was VERY difficult to mix. One side of the serem would come out and the other side nothing would and I had to use scissors to get all the product out. After mixing the product it felt sticky and smelled like someone spayed perfume all over my face. I will say my under eyes felt smoother after using this, but after 7 days I didnâ€™t see noticable results. Too Scented and Sticky for me.
