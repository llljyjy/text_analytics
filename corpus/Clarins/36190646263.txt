//What it is/for: An age control serum for your eyes/ eye contour. (Intensive anti-aging eye treatment)Suitable for all ages, all skin types and all ethnicities, as well as sensitive eyes and contact lens wearers.//Claims: - more youthful-looking eye contour -smooths wrinkles, reduces puffiness and dark circles and strengthens the skin- AFTER 28 days of use: 90% wrinkles are reduced, smoother skin, revitalised skin, firmer skin and even skin//How I used it: I took 1 sample packet; folded it in half, pressed the inside and outside to get as much product out as possible, mixed the cream and oil products together in my hands, applied onto eyelids, under eye area to temples and lastly between my brows. I also used this product with my facial massager but I only used this product at night, along with a cleanser before and a serum and moisturiser after.//Scent: It honestly reminded me of when I had my hair box hair dyed in the 90s; kinda floral and kinda chemically? But this wasn’t a strong scent after applying and having it dry.//Consistency: The cream side appeared white and like a body lotion/ milky rich consistency while the opposite side was an orange coloured oil, when blended together it felt like a lightweight serum.//Improvements: packaging: this packaging is not meant for people with arthritis in their hands... I really wish it was 2 little perfume bottles to mix together.//Did it work?!: By the 4th night I did see improvement to my dark circles/ sunken eyes on the outermost side/temples. When I stopped using this product I noticed my skin wasn’t as hydrated around the eye area.#gotitfree #doubleserum #clarinskincare #thisisbutterly #butterly #chickadvisor #ProductReviewClub this actually worked for my dark circles!
