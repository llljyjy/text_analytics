I received a 7-day sample of Clarins Double Serum free to try in exchange for my honest review. Firstly, I’m so glad they actually sent a decent sample, no one can expect to notice a difference after using something once!The consistency is weird - they describe one half as a non-greasy oil, which is what it is - it feels kind of greasy but not actually? Either way it goes on nice and smells good without being overpowering. The samples were a generous quantity so I did go to bed with a good layer of product on. While I don’t think I miraculously look younger, I can say that my skin most definitely feels softer and more hydrated after using this for a week instead of my usual night cream. It’s been at least a few days since I finished my sample and my skin still feels good! Skin is so soft!
