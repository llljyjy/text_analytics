I have only tried a few products from Clarins and this is one of them. I am always interested in products that help to relieve fine lines and brighten up my under eye area. I do have to say that this product has helped me to diminish some fine lines and help to reduce puffiness after waking up. I only apply a small amount of this product because I feel that a little amount goes a long way. Brighter Under Eye!
