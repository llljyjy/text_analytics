I received a sample of the product for free in exchange for my honest review. I tried this sample every night for 1 week. Maybe I need to use it longer, but I really didn’t notice a difference. I didn’t like the gel consistency of the product. It made my skin feel tight and sticky. I wasn’t a fan and will stick to my current night cream. Just Ok
