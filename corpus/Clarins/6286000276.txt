CLARINS double serum is not a new skincare product to me. I have been using this serum for a long time and I love the results. It’s so good that even my mom uses this religiously. It’s been helping me with my fine lines and wrinkles around the forehead. This has also helped with overall texture of my skin. I would highly recommend this serum. nan
