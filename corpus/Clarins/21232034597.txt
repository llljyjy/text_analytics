Clarins Double Serum is a two phase formula catering to skinâ€™s needs for youth and beauty: regeneration, oxygenation, nutrition, hydration, and protection. After using this serum for just 7 days I noticed that my skin was radiant, smooth, and soft, and my pores appeared smaller. This product came in a snap pack, where you snap it in half, and the different ingredients of the serum dispense from either side, and you simply mix them together and apply on your face. It is very easy to do. The scent is slightly floral and very mild yet pleasant. It made my skin look and feel amazing!@thisisbutterly @chickadvisor @clarinscanada#DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare #gotitfree Luxurious!
