Very good serum. I really enjoyed it. The serum is lightweight, sinks into the skin nicely, and added a glow. It didn’t break me out,  or clog my pores. It was not irritating in any way. It did seem to make a difference to the overall tone of my skin. I wasn’t wowed by the results, but it was very good. Lightly scented, not sureif it’s added fragrance,  but it was definitely pleasant. Very good serum, will try more Clarins skincare!
