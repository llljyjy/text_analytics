It’s hard to review this as well as I’d like to. The sample packaging was awful trying to get product out, especially equal amounts. That being said the product is decent. I like the smell but others may not. I don’t know if I noticed much happen, maybe I need more time. However, it DID leave my skin feeling great, even if I didn’t SEE anything. So there’s that! I’d still probably recommend as a decent eye serum. Decent Eye Serum
