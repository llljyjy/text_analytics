Can I give it more stars?!?! This product is amazing to me. I finally found a serum that does 2 things for me: 1) does not break me out as I have super sensitive/picky skin; and 2) actually works and holds up to its claims. My skin was tighter and looked/felt much healthier. This serum went on nicely and soaked in well. I can’t say I actually noticed my dark circles diminishing mainly because I was so involved with how awesome the other serum was at shrinking pores. Makeup application or longevity wasn’t altered so that’s a plus. The absolutely only negative thing I can say about the sample I was given was the sample packs were such a pain in the butt to use. The snap open wasn’t the issue but trying to get the dual sided product out without creating a mess and actually getting the full amount out was awful. However, the sample packaging has nothing to do with the actual product— just worth mentioning. Pretty dang awesome
