I received a 7 day complimentary sample from Butterly to try in exchange for my honest review. I have drier skin (especially in the winter months) and I used the serum every morning before applying moisturizer.  My skin definitely felt smoother, and more hydrated using this product. With a 7 day sample I found it hard to notice any huge difference in my skin. I did find at first it felt a tiny bit greasy when applying but it did absorb into my skin nicely.  I think the only downside for me is the price of the serum, as it is more on the expensive side, otherwise I would recommend trying it out! @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor @clarinscanada Hydrates dry winter skin
