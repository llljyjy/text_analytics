I received a sample of this product, which consisted of 7 different packs, in exchange for my honest review. I did find that a little went a long way, so I would use 1 packet, twice a day, in the morning and at night. I found that it had a silky consistency and felt that it was easily applied. I enjoyed the feeling after it was applied, I felt that it had a soothing feeling once it was applied. The serum does have a scent to it, however, I found the scent to nice and not overbearing. It absorbed nicely and left that area feeling smooth afterwards and makeup was easily applied over it. After using the product for a week, I felt that my under eyes appeared to be less puffy, however, I didnâ€™t really notice a huge change in any other aging issues, but I feel that there would be more benefits observed, if using for a longer period of time, so this would be a product that I would purchase to be able to determine all benefits that would be seen by using long-term and it is a product that I would recommend to others. The one con that I had, was just the sample packets and feeling that they were harder to use and provided waste of some of the product and I think a better sample package, may have allowed for me to use for a longer time, allowing me to perhaps notice more benefits and not have such a hard time obtaining the product, from the packaging. However, overall I really enjoyed using this eye serum. Reviewed sample of eye serum
