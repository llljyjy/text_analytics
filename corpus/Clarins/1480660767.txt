The good: works well, leaves your skin feeling soft and refreshed, nicely scentedThe not good: incredibly thick (hard to squeeze out) which can make it more difficult to apply than other cleansers. As others have said, definitely not a replacement for the cottonseed cleanser (she will be missed!)Not bad. Not great. Not bad, not great.
