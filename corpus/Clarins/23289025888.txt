So this is my first time using anything from this brand and I must say that I am truly impressed with this product! It is a smooth, creamy luxurious texture that melts into my skin! I have been using it for a few days now and I definitely feel like my under eye area looks brighter and less puffy! Also I enjoy how it smellsâ€¦a very light and floral scent, not to strong at all. I am excited to continue using and seeing what the results can be! nan
