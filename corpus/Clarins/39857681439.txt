I’m all about taking care of my skin, so I was excited when I received a sample of Clarins Double Serum to try from Butterly. I have sensitive skin, so some products cause my skin to react. I’m happy to say that it didn’t happen with this serum. It went on easily and was absorbed into my skin within minutes. It left my skin feeling soft and hydrated. It’s definitely something that I would buy for myself in the future. nan
