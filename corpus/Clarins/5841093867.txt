I received a free 7 day sample in exchange for my review. The serum didn’t feel too oily burn being applied and seem to dry quickly enough. I didn’t notice that my sling felt try shortly afterwards but overall a great product. I would buy again if the price point was in my budget. Clarins  double serum
