This is an absolutely amazing mask! Itâ€™s like 8 hours of sleep in a jar. The texture is really creamy and it rinses off easily.  I use this twice a week and it makes my skin look so amazing!  It has ingredients like Beautyberry and Ginger extracts, and Escin from Horse Chestnut to give the best looking skin. nan
