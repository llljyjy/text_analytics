I absolutely L-O-V-E this oil. I have acne prone skin in my 30’s, and use this on top of my evening cream as a final moisture lock-in. Its smell is a spa-grade aromatherapy treatment that instantly relaxes me. I’ve had facial oil in my routine, previously Drunk Elephant, for years and swear by its wrinkle prevention qualities. Oily/acne prone skin can become dry out from the acids/treatments we use, and it’s important to put the moisture back in after its taken off to prevent skin from over-compensating throughout the day. The formula in Lotus does just that while keeping breakouts and pesky wrinkles away. The scent of this oil won me over and I look forward to it every evening as a final pampering. It doesn’t break me out, my skin glows after application, and one bottle lasts me at least 6 months. Just a few drops is all you need to cover the face, neck and décolleté.  If you’re on the fence, treat yourself and do it! A must have!
