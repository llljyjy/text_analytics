As I get older I can tell I am losing some firmness in my neck. I am also noticing some horizontal neck lines appearing.  The Extra Firming Neck and Decollete Cream by Clarins claims to help with anti-aging and visibly minimizes wrinkles, skin slackening and age-related dark spots.  It has a nice creamy texture that I squeeze onto my fingers, then gently rub into my palms to warm it up and next apply to my neck skin and decollete, massaging from the chin down. I use it  in the morning and evening after cleansing.  It is very hydrating and moisturizing to my skin. After several days of usage I cannot tell that it is firming my neck yet, but I am hopeful with continued use I will see results.  It has a perfumey fragrance. I typically prefer fragrance free.  The packaging has a twist nozzle which is convenient but it will not stand up.  You must lay it on the side unless you keep it in the box.  I prefer packaging that stands on its own. nan
