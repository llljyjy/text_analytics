I was super excited to try an Eye Serum. As someone who has recently gotten way more into my under-eye care, I was hyped for this product. The ingredient list is stellar, and the product applies easily and sinks into the skin really quickly. I wouldn’t say it is a huge hydration boost, because of course, it’s a serum and you still need a moisturizing cream on top, but it’s nice to be able to be so targeted and potent with my under-eye care. My biggest qualm... I don’t know if I fully understand the point of the two option pumps. It’s a nice feature, but a little goes a long way with the product, so even the small dose is more than enough to cover my under-eyes, eyelid, and a half-inch circle around that area. Potent product!
