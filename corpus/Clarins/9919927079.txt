I got selected to try Clarins Dounle Serum and was happy with how it worked on my skin. It feels oily but once applied to my skin it absorbed well and left my skin not feeling greasy! I noticed my skin feeling smooth and more moisturized. I have not yet noticed a huge difference in my fine lines but they do seem a little lighter. #DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare #gotitfree Works Well
