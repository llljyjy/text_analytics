This serum had been on wish list as I had heard so much about it, and it did not disappoint. Love that it is lightweight and hydrating on the skin and leaves it looking plump and glowy. I warm this up in my palms and just press it on my skin before my moisturizer.  My dry skin loves this anti-aging serum and I highly recommend it. Highly Recommend!
