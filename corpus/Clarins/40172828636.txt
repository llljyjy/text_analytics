I received the Clarins Double Serum sample from #Butterly to try for 7 days. The Double Serum was an interesting product because the 2 serums are kept separate and then when you’re ready to use it you mix them together and apply.  I found the serum mixed well, went on smooth and absorbed quickly. It left no sticky or oily residue.  I found the fragrance of the serum on the strong side. So, if you are sensitive to fragrance this probably isn’t for you. After the 7 days of use I did find my skin smoother, but I don’t think I would continue to use it in the future due to the strong fragrance.#DoubleSerum  #ClarinsSkinCare  #gotitfree Super Serum
