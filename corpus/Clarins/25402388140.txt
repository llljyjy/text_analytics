I purchased my first container 2 months ago. This mask has really helped with the sagging on my cheeks and gives a contour lift that is needed for my round face. It transforms my face to more of a heart/V shape. There were no instructions on this container in terms of how often it should be used. I initially didn’t have a clue of how often I should use it. I went from everyday to every other day but I realized that once a week makes a difference. I typically use it every Sunday evening or Monday morning to start the week right and I leave it on for about a hour. There is no smell to this. After washing it off with cool water, I see the difference automatically and it gives a moisturizing feel. It also makes a noticeable difference in the double chin area, but it is not tremendous change for me. Either way, it’s a great product that is eligible for repurchase. Great Product
