I’ve finally started taking care of my skin at age 34 (I don’t recommend waiting that long) and paying extra attention to my eye area. I chose to try this as a tiny sample packet before spending the money and I have to say I’m really enjoying it. I haven’t seen much visible change yet (only been using for a week) but I FEEL a huge difference. my area feels so hydrated and dewy after using this and still in the morning as well. I’m excited to continue using and seeing what visible results I get after a bit more time.I recommend for great hydration, but I can’t comment on visible results with lines and tightness yet. New to product -  very hydrating. Love it so far.
