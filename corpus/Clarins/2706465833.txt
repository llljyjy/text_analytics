I received a sample of this eye serum from Influenster in exchange for my review. I love a good eye serum because I am losing some volume and seeing a few fine lines showing up in my under eye area, so I was thrilled to try this. Very hydrating, smoothing, and firming, and I was very happy to find out that it can be used under makeup as well. I would recommend to anyone looking for something to use in combination with an eye cream for nighttime or for daytime use to plump up their eye contour. nan
