I recieved this as a free product, it was 7 day trial pack. it was gel oily kind of consistency but after application it absorbed pretty well. I had few rashes on my face from another product but this worked well and it helped me recover pretty well. Maybe if I had used it for long time I could say something about wrinkles but it hydrates well and leaves skin brighter. I love Clarins product. magic eraser
