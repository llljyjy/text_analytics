I received this samples from #butterly and Iâ€™ve been using it all.I really like Clarins products because they are all plant derived and very safe for the skin. I use them through my pregnancy. This one is half serum and half oil, mixed every time when I use it, I like the design. It keeps the product fresh, and i also like the fragrance, the second i feel my skin very shiny, and softer, it makes my tired skin become healthy Perfect serum for winter time
