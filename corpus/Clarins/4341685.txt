I used samples of this product for seven nights. It was incredibly moisturizing and perfect for cold, dry weather. It didnâ€™t cause my oily/combination skin to break out, which was a concern because this serum is pretty heavy. I felt like I saw an improvement in texture. I received this from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. Nice serum for dry skin/cold weather
