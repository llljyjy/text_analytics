This is such a unique dual-phase eye cream! The smell is nice but can be a little perfumey and overpowering for some. The formula is amazing though! Cooling and refreshing and hydrating for my under eyes without being sticky or heavy. It gets absorbed fast and I can feel that the area is smoother. For eye creams, I think the key is consistent use; Iâ€™m excited to keep using it to see long term effects! nan
