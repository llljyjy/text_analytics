I received this  @clarinscanada double serum from @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor as a #freeproduct to test in exchange of my honest review.I really liked this serum because I have dry sensitive skin and this serum is super hydrating and suitable for sensitive skin too and itâ€™s super lightweight and absorbs really quick and nicely too and I can see a big difference in my fine lines and my skin looks more firmer and plumped and healthy also really like the scent which is light and fresh. Perfect for dry/sensitive skin
