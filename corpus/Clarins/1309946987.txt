I liked this Clarins eye serum better than their face serum. However, it may be better suited for other people than it is for me because I have sensitive skin. This formula is very strong and while my skin accepts it, it doesn’t slurp it up like it does with some other eye serums. I can see how many people would like or could benefit from this but it’s just not for me Great for others but not for me
