Talk about replenishing brightening and hydrating the whole eye area this is just hands-down the best I have product Iâ€™ve ever used. It literally makes my creases lines and wrinkles look diminished and keeps my eye area looking fresh. I use this after cleansing my face I apply this first let it dry for about a minute and then apply the rest of my hydration skin care products. This works so well under make up by the way. New Eyes!
