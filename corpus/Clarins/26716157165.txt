I started using this in the night exactly how the tutorial explains to use it. I applied a little in my hands, warmed it and it’s not a very heavy texture. Slowly applied to my neck and chest area and massaged in circular motion like i usually do with my other serums too. I’ve seen the skin become a little tightened but I’m hoping for even better results in the next few days. Doesn’t leave my skin greasy and it looks promising for sure! Looks very promising
