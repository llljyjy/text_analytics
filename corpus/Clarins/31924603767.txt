I’ve been such a fan of this product and am already on my second bottle! It’s got a creamy, hydrating texture that instantly revives my eyes while fighting texture and wrinkles over time. Since using I’ve found that my under eyes are smoother, more hydrated, and makeup application has drastically improved as well. Can’t recommend this one enough- it actually works! Worth it!
