I was selected to try and test out Clarins double serum. I really enjoyed using this product, I used it for 7 days after my morning cleansing routine. I noticed my pores were less visible and my face felt tighter. The smell of the oil was great & it was light weight. I feel like it gave me a sunkissed glow and I will be buying this product! It’s a little pricy to be honest but I think it’s worth it if you want to invest in a good product. nan
