I received a sample of this product complete momentary from Influenster for my honest review, and here it is: this was not a great experience. The sample boiled down to one week’s worth of individual packets that were incredibly finicky to open, and frustrating to mix. With only seven days worth of product I was not able to find any noticeable change or improvement to my skin. Didn’t see results.
