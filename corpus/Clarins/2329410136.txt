I feel the same way about this product that I do for the original Double Serum. It’s nice, but for me, it’s not worth the money. The product goes on smoothly and leaves the under eyes feeling nice, but a lot of products can achieve this for less than have the cost. The other thing worth noting is that it’s highly fragranced. I enjoyed the scent, but if you have sensitive skin this could be an issue. nan
