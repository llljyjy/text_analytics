So happy I got to test out a week’s worth of Double Serum sample sachets! This is my mum’s favourite serum, and now I can see why! The product is actually composed of two separate formulas, a non-greasy oil andmelting gel, from two different vials that you mix together before application. They blend and absorb into the skin very well. After a couple days of applying it at night my skin looks and feels so soft, silky, and smooth. I have that ‘lit from within’ radiant glowy look to my face. My complexion definitely looks brighter. Nice scent too - serum is very fragrant but not too overpowering. Caveat: I don’t think a 7-day sample is enough time to see any dramatic anti-ageing results myself. But my mum has amazing skin and she says it is due to using Double Serum consistently, so I can’t wait to see the effects after longer use. I definitely plan to purchase a bottle of my own now. * I received this #freeproduct thanks to @chickadvisor and @thisisbutterly in exchange for my honest opinion* Radiant glowing skin!
