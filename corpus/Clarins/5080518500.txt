I like how this serum mixes two different products into one. I wouldnâ€™t say it has a strong scent but you can definitely smell it. I like to warm the serum in between my hands or fingertips and apply to area where 11 lines usually appear as well as my orbital eye area. I do like that it makes my skin feel hydrated and not sticky. nan
