I’ve been using this Extra firming neck cream by Clarins and I’ve been enjoying it a lot so far, I love the consistency of it and how fast it absorbs into my skin leaving my neck super hydrated and soft, I love that’s specially formulated for the skin on the neck since we tend to forget about that are when applying our skincare, im excited to see more results in the near future; I really like it I would definitely recommend it My new favorite neck cream
