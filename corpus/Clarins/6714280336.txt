After using this product for sometime, I found my skin to overall feel a lot smoother and hold in moisture a bit better, as well as have general spottiness reduced. My favourite thing about this product was it’s light, fresh scent that left me feeling healthy and like my skin was being rewarded. It almost felt like my skin also had a bit more bounce to it after the end of the trial week. I also really enjoyed that you don’t need to use a lot of the product at all to cover your face or see results, so if this came in a medium to large sized bottle, it would last a very long time. Applying after the shower in the morning would leave my skin feeling refreshed until the end of the night and also allowed for a smoother application of my makeup after it. Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone looking to treat their skin with something light that helps you feel good and would add this to my daily roaster of products should I have the extra funds to spend on it, but I wouldn’t consider it an essential for my lifestyle. Leaves skin feeling fresh and rejuvenated
