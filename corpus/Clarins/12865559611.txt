I received this 7 day #gotitfree sample from @Chickadvisor and @Butterly to try  - I do think this is a really nice serum,  it absorbs nicely and isn’t overly fragranced.     With Serums it’s hard to tell from a 7 day supply if it really did anything however for me my face did start to get itchy after using it for a few days  -  I kept all my other skincare routine the same, only difference was this serum and as soon as I stopped using it the itchiness went away. For the above reason I would not re-purchase for myself however I would recommend it for anything that doesn’t have overly sensitive skin as it was really nice to use. Nice!  But not for me
