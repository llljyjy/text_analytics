I had the opportunity to try Clarins Double Serum as a free product for review, and so far, I am pleased with the results. Iâ€™ve been using it for a week and have noticed that my skin feels more hydrated. I liked that it left my skin looking fresh and dewy. However, I preferred applying it at night, as I felt that it was a bit oily with my makeup application. Overall, a great serum. Nice serum!
