I tried out a 7 day sample of this Double Serum, and it’s easy to apply and my skin felt very hydrated after each use, without an oily or tacky feeling. I like that the scent isn’t overpowering as well! In the 7 days I can’t say I’ve noticed any benefit from the anti-aging properties but I do find it quick and easy to fit into my daily skincare routine. nan
