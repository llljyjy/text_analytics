It seems like no one is pointing out that this mask states it is “specifically formulated for asian women” on the box. So perhaps that’s why it didn’t work for me. The texture is beautiful and whipped and I like that it comes with an applicator. My skin looked a bit brighter after using it and I enjoyed the process, but i didn’t see any significant difference after using this. I saw a lot of people mentioning that this de-puffed their skin instantly so i was mainly paying attention to that as  typically get really puffy when I wake up, but I didn’t see much of a difference there unfortunately. Maybe with prolonged use? Didn’t do much / not for non-asian women?
