I received these samples of Clarins Double Serum from @thisisbutterly & @chickadvisor in exchange for my honest review. This serum is a beautiful product, I applied with the palms of my hand and I massaged it in a bit with my gua sha tool. The scent was light and not overpowering. My skin soaked it up, there’s nothing like good hydration. My skin felt so good, it’s was like silk! I am very pleased with this serum and definitely recommend!! @clarinscanada #doubleserum #clarinsskincare #gotitfree Soft Like Silk
