I love this eye serum, especially paired with my moisturizer. Iâ€™ve used a lot of eye serums and creams in the past and never really felt like they did anything. This one felt like it actually sank into my skin and reduced the puffiness that I get in the morning on my under eyes. I love the concept of a double serum, and I feel like it was really effective in getting rid of any fine lines that I might have. nan
