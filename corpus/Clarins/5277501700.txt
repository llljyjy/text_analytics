I have actually purchased this eye cream twice before. It is one of my favorites!  It’s so hydrating without feeling heavy or greasy. Doesn’t irritate my eyes or cause milia. Has the slightest tightening to it. I wouldn’t call it “lifting”, but I do notice when I haven’t been using this in my skincare routine. nan
