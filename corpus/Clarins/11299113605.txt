I was pretty surprised with this serum. I wasn’t really a fan of the packaging. It’s kind of hard to get all the product out with one hand. When I first put it on my skin, I found that it was really oily and it took a while to soak in. Once it soaked in, I loved the soft feeling it left on my skin. Double serum
