I received a 7-Day trial for and exchange for my opinion. I personally loved this product, it worked wonders for my skin. My face was hydrated and smooth in the morning and I found my makeup was even easier to apply. This formula is housed in two separate vials therefore when mixed together it creates magic. It provides nutrition hydration regeneration and protects my skin all while leaving it non-greasy. I loved the fruity floral scent it had it did not last long but left my face very fresh smelling. This anti-aging products is a luxury for me it is very expensive therefore only will be purchased once in awhile. I do however recommend it Clarins for the win!! Luxury item
