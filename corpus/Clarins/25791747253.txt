I am 43 and starting to get fine lines on my forehead. After using this product for a week every night before bed, I didn’t notice diminished fine lines anywhere on my face and my skin didn’t seem more radiant or firm. It did feel slightly softer and slightly more even toned  but not as much as i was expecting for a powerful serum like this. I am still on the fence as the effects may take weeks to achieve. Doesn’t pack a punch
