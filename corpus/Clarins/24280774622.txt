I received a 7-day supply of the double serum eye to sample. I have stubborn dark under eye circles so was glad to give this a try. My dark circles are still there but my skin felt immediately more moisturized when I applied this product. I added it to my nighttime routine as it felt rich and I liked to give it time to work overnight. It made my undereye skin feel pampered. Double Serum Eye
