I love this so much! It smells like raspberries and shortcake but it doesn’t have a taste at all thankfully! I use this in the daytime instead of lip balms, lip gloss and lipstick and it’s amazing. In the night I use the laneige lip mask. These two products helped my lips go from chapped and crusty to so smooth and soft! holy grail
