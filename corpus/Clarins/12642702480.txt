I overall really like this product. It’s relatively light, hydrating, and brightened my under eyes area.  I have decently hereditary dark under eyes and this does make a difference more than other products I’ve tried.  It’s very easy to use I just regulate the intensity of a liquid and tup it to under the eye in circle motions. fast absorbing. good
