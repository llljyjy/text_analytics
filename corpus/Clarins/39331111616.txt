I received this as a 7 day trial product to review.I found the product to lean too heavily to the oily side. I have dehydrated combination skin. The trial packaging was not convenient for me to use as I would always have to wring out the pouch to get any of the “water“ phase since all the oil would come out effortlessly. Even if I wanted to use less of it because I have a smaller face or I need a smaller amount to disperse the oil better, the trial size cracks down the centre so you’re forced to use the entire package or it will dry out/get contaminated.I don’t like scented products and I find this to be fairly heavily scented. After an hour, the oil was still sitting on top of my skin and my face reeked of that old lady floral scent. I looked incredibly greasy and was still smearing oil off to the touch. It wasn’t a “glow“ or a “sheen“, it was just straight up greasy looking and feeling. I was not able to use any other part of my skincare routine after the serum because the oil would block it all off, and there is no way I could wait several hours between steps or before going to bed to wait for everything to absorb (I doubt it would have ever entirely absorbed). It would absolutely transfer to hair, pillow cases, blankets, etc. and make a greasy mess of them. It feels like all this product would do is trap sebum under it and cause breakouts. This needs to be marketed as a face OIL, not a serum. Super oily and strong scent
