This is my favorite cleanser and staple for ~5 years. It is a superb value, in my opinion. I always have one in use and 1 as a back up. I have aging, combo skin. Leaves my face feeling cleansed with no residue or drying. It really is a gentle exfoliator and smells divine. One detail I love is the packaging. The dispenser is flush with the lid so there is no gooey residue buildup causing the cap to not “click” closed. Very thoughtful. nan
