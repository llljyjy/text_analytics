I was recently sent a free 7 day trial of the Clarins Double Serum from Clarins and Butterly to try in exchange for my honest review.The product  claims that it is able to boost the skin’s function to provide younger looking sign as well as reduce the appearance of wrinkles, fine lines, enlarged pores and to tighten and firm up the skin. The product is a mix of a two different liquids in which you mix together and then apply and there is a very pleasant scent to this product which I find quite relaxing. It doesn’t leave the skin sticky nor greasy and absorbs really quickly into the skin.As this was only a one week trial, I wasn’t able to see the long term effects of this product, but I did notice that my skin most definitely did feel more hydrated with this addition into my daily skincare routine.#DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare #gotitfree Luxurious serum
