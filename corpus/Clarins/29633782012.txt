The Clarins Total Eye Lift is suitable for most skin types and is effective enough for stubborn fine lines/dark circles (e.g. MINE) & has the clinical results & awards to back it up. It glides on super smooth with plenty of slip so I generally use it to give myself a bit of a massage around the orbital bone & eyebrows, which helps with drainage & sinus pressure. I can see results within a minute; my fine lines and wrinkles look less severe, the eye area appears more plump, and my severely dark under eye circles look brighter. My eye area can be rather sensitive (I have had to return many an eye cream because it irritated the skin or made my eyes water) and I have had no issues with the Total Eye Lift. It wears really well all day under foundation/concealer, which is an absolute must for me! This cream is everything I could want and more, with effective plant-based ingredients that WORK. If you want an eye cream with actual results, this is it. Not to mention, that gorgeous red packaging is perfect for Christmas! The Perfect Eye Cream?
