I received a 7-day sample of Clarins Double Serum in exchange for my honest review. This serum boasts an impressive formula consisting of 21 potent plant extracts which aim to target signs of aging. I applied this serum nightly for a week as part of my skincare routine. It is an oil-based serum that absorbs nicely into the skin without leaving an oily or heavy feeling. I also especially liked itâ€™s floral scent which smells very nice. Added to my list of serums to repurchase. Impressive formula
