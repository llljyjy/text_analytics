The eye serum has a unique dual phase formula that is dispensed simultaneously. The packaging has a pump that delivers the perfect amount for both eyes and it dispenses both formulas perfectly. I just rub the product between my fingers to mix the two formulas and I apply it. If feels instantly hydrating but isn’t heavy or greasy. I am prone to clogged pores and milia around my eye area and this formula doesn’t cause me to develop these little bumps round my eyes! The formula is so nourishing, hydrating, and delivers a potent anti-aging treatment. I noticed results after one use! My eye area was smoother, softer, and the lines looked plumper out! I am very picky when it comes to eye cream and I was skeptical but after trying it, I’m so impressed with the incredible results! This is a formula that I have been constantly reaching for over my other eye creams and one that I definitely repurchase when I’m done with my current bottle! Smoother and Softer Under Eyes
