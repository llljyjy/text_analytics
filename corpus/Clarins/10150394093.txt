The serum is medium weight, fast-absorbing, It gives my skin a healthy glow without any irritation or abrasion. The texture is oily, though I find it good to use as a primer, as it seems to have great gripping abilities. The scent may be somewhat overwhelming and I am not fond of the price point, however, the product is unique. It did nothing to my wrinkles, though moisturized and made my skin look radiant with a healthy glow. nan
