I was fortunate enough to receive this product to try for free in exchange for my hones opinion. This clarins eye serum was a great option however I like my current eye serum a bit better to switch. I tried this product for 2 weeks and saw notable results. My skin felt more dewy plump and hydrated. Fine lines and dark spots also improved slightly. I think that if I continued use, results would continue as well. I do love my current serum and would consider switching once I run out. A great product for sure! Great serum!
