Thank you @butterly for choosing me to review the Clarins double serum. I found this product gave my skin the desired results. After  6 days (todayâ€™s day 7) my skin is smoother and giving off a healthy glow. I love that combats those fine lines thar are sneaking in.  I like the packaging and that each amount is separated in a way that is easy to combine. I noticed great results and will add this to my fav list of serums. #gotitfree Good serum
