Great for dry skin! I used to always wake up with dry patches and crusty lips but haven’t had to deal with either since using the Double Serum. I’ve been using this and the Total Eye Lift exclusively for the last two weeks and feel like my skin feels well hydrated. My only negative is that this serum has a scent that some may not prefer. I personally do not mind the smell but my partner always mentions he can smell it, especially when I wash my face and apply before bed. Great for Dry Skin!
