I was gifted a seven-day supply of samples from Butterfly and Clarins in exchange for my honest opinion. I was happy to use it since my skin needed a little TLC after the heat we had this summer. The serum didn’t make my skin oily, and it absorbed very quickly .I have used it daily for the one week after I washed my face, before moisturizer. Regarding the packaging: fold the package to open, press for the product to come out and then mix in your palms before applying to your face and neck. The serum is more like an emulsion : a combination of a non-greasy oil and melting gel. It adsorbs quickly , no sticky residue left over. My face was  soft and moisturized after use. It’s slightly scented ( fruity smell) but it didn’t bother me.  The claims are bold ( anti-aging) but I didn’t have enough product to confirm that. @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor @clarinscanada#DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare #gotitfree Nice addition to my routine
