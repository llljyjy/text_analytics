I tried clarins double serum for a week (I received this as a free product in exchange for my honest review) and I found it to be a good option for the winter as it does have a slightly oily texture at first (more gel like though), which in this dry weather is nice. I found the serum dried light and not oily at all which was good. My skin felt a little moisturized. The sample packaging is annoying to use but the bottle wouldnâ€™t be an issue. Overall great seasonal serum in my opinion. I also liked the scent. Good all around serum.
