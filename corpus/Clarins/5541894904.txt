I will say, I was expecting this to be very heavy after trying the other Clarins double serum but I was pleasantly surprised! The eye serum is light as air while smoothing and plumping at the same time, this was wonderful under concealer which is important to me as I like to use most products day and night. It does have a signature Clarins scent (think elevated spa) but it does not linger and didnâ€™t bother me. I really liked this, and a little goes a very long way so be sure to use less than half a pump! A great overall eye serum
