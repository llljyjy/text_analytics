This is the best eye serum I’ve ever tried!!! I am very skeptical with what I use with my eyes because they are so sentive and I do have problems with baggy tired eyes so I only the brands that I know I can trust and rely with. I’ve never encountered any skin irritation when using product, no buring or itchyness. It doesn’t have a smell and feels light and subtle. It absorbs pretty quick. I love every bit of it. Definitely a must have!!! Love every bit!!
