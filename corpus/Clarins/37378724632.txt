I have received this as a #freeproduct from #butterly. I was so excited about knowing I will be able to try it. I have been using face cream for years, so using serum isn’t new to me, it’s just a regular routine. However, it’s my time to try the brand #Clarins, and I am impressed. I love the smell of it, how gentle it is to my skin and I love that it’s not sticky once absorbed, just the way I like it. First Time with Clarins
