As I’ve aged and with the beginning of “tech neck“ forming, my neck has become an insecurity of mine. I am so glad I have this firming and lifting neck cream in my routine. It absorbs perfectly and doesn’t pill my other products and so far so good. I do feel a slight tightening when use but for full effects, I’ll need to use the whole bottle. I do have high hopes tho, haven’t met a Clarins product that hasn’t worked its magic! Love It!!
