The Clarins eye serum was quite unique as it consists of two different serums that you have to mix together. One serum is more of a milky consistency and the other one is more watery in appearance, and they mix really well together. the product feels nice and light and doesn’t feel sticky at all which I like. It’s really easy to glide around on the skin as well. And a little goes a long way. Nice
