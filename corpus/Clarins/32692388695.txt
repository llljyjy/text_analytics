I have incorporated this Extra-Firming Neck & Décolleté Cream in my morning and evening skincare routine. Upon application the skin feels hydrated and smooth. The cream melts into my skin and there is no oily residue. The cream feels lightweight and did not break me out. I have sensitive skin. It has a fragrance, which does not bother me. My neck area does look smoother and brighter so I am going to continue using this and see the long term benefits. Hydrating!
