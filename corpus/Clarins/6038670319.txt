I’ll write here what I wrote about the regular serum. This is nice and it goes on smoothly. It didn’t irritate my sensitive skin which was awesome! I’m just not sure it did a whole lot for me personally and not sure it’s worth the cost. But I think it would recommend for older people or people with troublesome under eyes. It’s okay!
