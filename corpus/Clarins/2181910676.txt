Clarins Double Serum really works! I received a 7 day sample and I liked how it wasnâ€™t greasy and blended easily into my lotion. It has a luxurious smell and within 7 days, my skin is a lot smoother, reducing redness and lightening some of the dark age spots on my face. Taking away one of the stars only because my skin did react a bit the first two days where I developed an itchy hive on one small area on my face, but after day 3, no reaction! Clarins Double Serum really works!!!
