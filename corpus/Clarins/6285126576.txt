I tried the Clarins Double Serum 7 day system and found that it went on smoothly and gave my skin a nice glow and hydrated it well. I did feel that it left my skin a bit heavy/oily compared to my regular serum, but overall it still worked great.@thisisbutterly @chickadvisor @clarinscanada #DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare #gotitfree Great Serum
