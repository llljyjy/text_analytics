This product is very gentle on skin.. It doesn’t sting or no burning sensation.. I have seasonal allergies and it makes my eye area more sensitive, dry, tired and wrinkled.. Im using eye cream to keep my eye areas hydrated and atleast minimize the looks of dry, tired and wrinkled looks of skin around my eyes and some of my eye creams really sting but not this one.. This Clarins Total Eye lift hydrates my eye area without sting and any discomfort.. It also lessen the looks of tired and dark under eye.. Lift, smooth and relax the wrinkled skin around my eyes due to allergies.. Im so glad to discover this clarins my new favorite eye cream.. A rich, thick and creamy texture that doesn’t feel greasy, sticky or oily.. It doesn’t feel heavy and fragrance-free.. My new favorite eye cream!
