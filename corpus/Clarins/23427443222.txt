I really love the colour of this lip oil! The tint is really nice, and the smell reminds me of those early 2000s scented Strawberry Shortcake dolls (but it isn’t too strong). The texture is thicker than the other lip oils I’ve tried, but it isn’t sticky. I really recommend this product! Really lovely lip oil
