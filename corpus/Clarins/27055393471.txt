I received Double Serum Wave 3 & 4 for free from @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor and @clarinscanada to try it and give my honest review. I got 7 samples, which is enough for one week. This product is very hydrating, and it is packed with lots of amazing ingredients that are good for hydration, firmness, and elasticity. With its unique blend of ingredients, this serum can provide a long-lasting moisture that you can definitely feel it on your skin, and it also helps your skinâ€™s moisture barrier strengthen. Your skin will look plump and healthy and feel so smooth. The serum is not heavy on the face, and it will be absorbed into the skin very quickly, while the smell is not overpowering. The serum is suitable for all skin types, and I would highly recommend it to people who are looking for deep hydration, for a product that is nourishing, that is able to restore back your skin from being dry, and that is good for anti-aging. #DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare #gotitfree It is packed with lots of amazing ingredients
