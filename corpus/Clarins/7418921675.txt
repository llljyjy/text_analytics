I’ve been using this product for a 5 days and its very hydrating! It has a mild but refreshing scent and applies very well on the skin without leaving any sticky residue. However, I haven’t felt enough of a change to my skin tone/dark spots, but I will continue to use it to find results over time. I #gotitfree with Butterly and am looking forward to trying it for a longer period of time. nan
