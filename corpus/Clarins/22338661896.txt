I really love this product from Clarins. This masque is incredible and comes with an applicator. It is really fluffy and it depuffed my under eyes like it says it does.  Right away I knew this was a special product and something I can stick with for a very long time. I left it on my face for 10 minutes and neck.  My skin is so dry, and this product made my skin look refreshed. It even wiped off good. If I had to pick one product on Earth it would be this. This mousse is incredible and really rich. Now I see why my friends brag about this brand. Love it! Perfect Masque
