When I first received this mask, I have to admit I was a little intimidated my the product and instructions. The directions were new to me so I had to Google and YouTube how others used the product. Luckily I came across the YouTube video provided by Clarins that demonstrates exactly how to use and how to place your chin on your palm. I am not Asian but I am post party’s and dealing with a lot of fluid retention and hormonal changes. I applied this mask starting at the bottom of my eye bags and down to my upper neck area. The hardest part was knowing if I did the chin exercises correctly but iverall I am impressed with the results of this mask. I won’t always have the ten minutes to apply but this will be great for the morning after a long weekend or when I have an event coming up. It really helps define my face and makes it appear less fluffy. Effective
