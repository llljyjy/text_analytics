I received the Clarins Double Serum 7 day trial from Butterly in exchange for my honest review. The instructions were simple enough but the packaging was a little tough to push out all the product. However, once it was out, it was easy to mix and apply all over my skin. I felt immediate results as my skin felt moisturized, hydrated, and so soft! It also smelled really nice. My skin stayed moisturized throughout the day and I was actually looking forward to applying it after I would wash my face. It doesn’t feel oily although I can feel the product on my face sometime after it’s applied. I definitely recommend this product! Immediate results!
