Thank you, Butterly @thisisbutterly and Chick Advisor @chickadvisor, for selecting me for Wave 2 of @clarinscanada Clarins Double Serum campaign. I received a complimentary 7-day treatment sample of Clarins Paris Double Serum (Hydric + Lipidic System) Complete Age Control Concentrate to test and review.This unique anti-aging two-phase serum contains 21 different beneficial plant extracts, including turmeric, to help fight skin aging plus other botanicals to help firm, smooth, and boost the radiance of your skin. I gave this product a try for a week. Not sure if I see a difference in my fine lines yet, but my combination skin does feel smooth and is relatively hydrated. I used it once a day, mostly at night, after cleansing my face. You mix both phases of the serum together, before applying to your face. It felt refreshing on my face, perhaps a bit tingly which worried me. Clarins Double Serum “universal texture” claims to be suitable for “all ages, all ethnicities and all skin types”, including my sensitive skin. I didn’t break out after using this product, but the fragrance, although pleasant smelling, was a bit strong for my skin. I may purchase this product again if I got it on sale. I would recommend Clarins Double Serum to those looking for a luxe anti-aging serum.  #DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare #gotitfree #cadeau #ChickAdvisor #ProductReviewClub #thisisbutterly #clarinscanada #clarinsdoubleserum #Sephora Smoothing Serum
