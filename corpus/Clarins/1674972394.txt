As someone with a dry skin type, serums are a really important step in my routine. Especially around this time of year my skin tends to get drier and I was pleasantly surprised by how much moisture this serum gave me. The impacts were long lasting and the sample provided enough for me to take down onto my neck and chest which was great. The scent was subtle and slightly nutty, and absorption was quick. I really enjoyed using this. nan
