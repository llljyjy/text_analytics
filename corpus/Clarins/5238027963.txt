This two-phase serum is so enjoyable to use. The texture feels light and sinks into the skin immediately. My skin feels and looks more hydrated and plump. 1 pump is all I need in my nighttime routine. I had no irritations and I havenâ€™t had any breakouts. There is a notable scent (I prefer un scented products or very light scents) but it is nice and light. Very nice Serum!
