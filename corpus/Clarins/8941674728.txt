This is a really nice mask. I like to use clay masks like these 2 times a week or when my skin needs it, and I like to use this one in the morning since it is also depuffing. The texture is very creamy and does not dry out my skin at all. I love all the puffiness minimizing ingredients like horse chestnut and beautyberry, and the white clay is perfect for reducing imperfections and breakouts. I immediately see brightening results after washing it off and the puffiness is clearly diminished. This is such a great mask for great results even from the first time you use it! Great for depuffing in the morning!
