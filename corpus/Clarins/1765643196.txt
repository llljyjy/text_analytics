I received this product free to try from butterly. I enjoyed using the 7 day trial. The texture is light and not sticky feeing on my skin. I loved the scent. Itâ€™s not too strong but very fresh smelling which I enjoyed. This product left my skin hydrated and feeling smooth after just one use. It is a bit pricey but I would recommend this product as it does work well. nan
