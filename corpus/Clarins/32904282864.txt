I’ve been using serums for years and had a few that were quite good and some not so. Clarins double serums is definitely one of the best ones. I’ve been only using this serum for 7 days so I can’t tell how it will work when I’d use it for a month or two but so far it’s great. It’s not greasy and smells amazing. My skin feels smoother, moisturized and more radiant.Thanks you @chickadvisor @thisisbutterly for this #doubleserum 7 day sample from @clarinscanada to try in exchange for my honest opinion #gotitfree One of the best serums
