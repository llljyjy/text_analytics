I received a trial of Clarins Double Serum from ChickAdvisor and I was very happy with this product. It felt very light on my skin, itâ€™s fast absorbing with no oily or sticky residue and it had a very pleasant but not overwhelming smell. After using this product, even the first time, my skin felt good. It gave me a subtle glow and an evenness(after several uses). I would definitely recommend this product as over time, I really noticed a difference. I will say it was not a major difference of course, but it made me feel good about my skin. A definite thumbs up!
