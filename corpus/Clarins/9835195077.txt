I  just turned 30 and I love a good anti aging serum. This Double Serum from Clarins is just awesome, from the super sleek and sturdy packaging to the very efficient non wasteful dispense pump. I love how this serum feels on my skin, its aborbs very well and doesnt leave my face oily or greasy. My skin already feels smoother and more hydrated, I cant wait to see the long term results from ym winter damaged skin. The only thing I would say that may be a negative is that the scent may be too strong to those sensitive to fragrance in skincare. Great serum, Strong scent
