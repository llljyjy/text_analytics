I received this as a promo to test for a week. As most of us women know it takes longer than a week to be able to provide a real good review. What I know after using this for a week my complexion appeared brighter and I felt like it hydrated my skin well. Did it get rid of my fine lines - no, did I expect it to? No. It would take months of using this to notice any sort of results. I liked the ease of use, did not like the packaging it came in. I felt it needed to be more environmentally friendly. Would I buy this to use again? Probably not as I find my current serum for half the price does the same job this did. Do I recommend it? Yes, Iâ€™m sure after more long term use I would notice more benefits but the price and my current skin care regime are keeping me from purchasing this 3 1/2 star double serum
