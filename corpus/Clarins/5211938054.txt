Recieved free 7 day sample for review. I found this product to be a bit too oily for my combo skin as a day serum, so I started using it at night. I did find it very hydrating but I didn’t notice any change in my pore size or any ’youthful radiance’ after 7 days of use. I also found the smell a bit strong, the addition of fragrance is never necessary for a facial product so I was disappointed to see it listed in the ingredients.Perhaps this product would provide a more drastic result on drier, aged, more dull skin. I consider myself lucky to still have *pretty* youthful skin so I wouldn’t completely write this off if you are looking for a good anti-aging serum! Oily but hydrating!
