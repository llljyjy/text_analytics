This serum is just *chefs kiss* <3I’m starting to show signs of age, and it’s important for me to use products that are regenerating and preventative. Upon applying, the Clarins Double Serum is so silky and easy to apply. I love how fast absorbing the gel and oil is, so there’s no greasy feeling. I’m also one of those people that DO like nice scents for my products, but I’m very picky because anything too heavy will give me a migraine. The serum’s scent wasn’t overpowering and had a very faint sweet, floral/fruity scent. My skin already feels so much more supple after going through a few packs of the samples I got. Would definitely recommend it for people that don’t like heavy and tacky serums. Soaks right in
