Overall, I really like this serum and will buy it again. It goes on nice, I like the smell (unlike most serums). I find it a little sticky after applying (stickier than some other serums I have used), so I usually wait to apply any makeup until the serum completely absorbs. It does not immediately absorb, but does not take too long. Does not leave any residue or film on face. Overall, its reasonably priced and a good serum to help with ant aging. I recommend. Got it for free, but will definitely purchase!
