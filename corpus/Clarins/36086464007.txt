I received a 7-day sample of this product for an honest review. Honestly, this product did not impress me. Although the serum feels nice in the hand, it didn’t produce enough of an effect on the under eye to make it worth the price. I didn’t notice any hydrating brightening or reduction of fine lines. That could be because it takes longer than 7 days. However, I have other products that have a lower price point that have worked much faster and produce better results. Just okay, not worth the price
