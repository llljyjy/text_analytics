I received a sample of Clarins double eye serum in exchange of my honest review from Influenster.First I got almost a week worth of sample so I cannot be a good judge on this product true effects, specially since in case of an eye serum you need at least 3 week of consistent use to see some visible improvements. So please keep in mind that I just used this product for a week. First the texture is brilliant smooth and definitely not sticky and truly what you expect from a serum more liquid than gel. What I did expect to show up even after one time use, to see reducing puffiness and it does not help me with that, I’ll say 1 out of 5. I specially wore this at a night with full puffiness in my eyes and I woke up to the same puffs! Hydrating wise though it does a fair job, I noticed though that using the serum without my eye cream doesn’t leave me with the desired hydration that I expected, 3 out of 5. In regards of dark circles I can’t really comment other than on few days I had better and brighter under eye comparing to others but it was random. And in the highlights it mentions that it’s good for dryness I believe it is, in general if you consistently use it base on the texture I say give you smooth skin. But in overall considering its price I would not invest in this eye serum, it does a fair job but I could find just as good as a serum for better price. Does fair job but nothing impressive
