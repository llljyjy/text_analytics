One of my all time favourite lip oils. It’s extremely hydrating and glossy on the lips. It’s also very sheer in terms of colour (which I really like as I find it looks more natural), yet gives the lips a slight pinkish hue that’s absolutely stunning. It smells pleasantly sweet like fruity candy, which I really adore, however I would beware if you’re sensitive to scents or looking for something unscented, and is very thin in consistency. The texture isn’t bothersome or even that detectable when it’s on, and it looks absolutely stunning without feeling too heavy. It truly is one of my favourite products. Amazing
