I received this as a 7-day sample trial so I don’t know if that’s long enough to really see results. However, from the week that  I have used it, I can tell you that it feels very nice going on, has a very pleasant scent and it did leave my skin feeling soft and hydrated.  It was a bit messy mixing the two products together prior to applying, but I think that has more to do with the sample packs than the product.  I thought it would be a bit oily, but it really didn’t feel that way when applying and it absorbed well.  I love that this product is made up of plant extracts, without any sulphates or mineral oil, but I’m not sure if the benefits are enough to justify the price versus other products. Feels great with a pleasant scent
