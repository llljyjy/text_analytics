I received this serum for free from @thisisbutterly for my honest opinion. This was a 7 day trial that I was given and to be honest I didn’t notice any difference to my skin. Yes, my skin did feel soft and hydrated but that was pretty much it. I did like that there is no scent to the serum, application was easy, there was some tackiness to the product once it was applied to the skin but it went away after a few minutes. I personally like to test out a product for several weeks before I can decide if it’s beneficial for my skin or not. it's okay
