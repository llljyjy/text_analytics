I enjoy trying new serums so I was happy to test this one out from influenster. I can’t speak to its effects because the samples sent weren’t large and the packets didn’t last long enough to see results (or not). I appreciate some of the ingredients in this serum (squalane, caffeine, etc.), but fragrance/parfum is high up on the ingredient listing and boy can you tell. The serum has a daily pleasant scent, but I tend to lean towards fragrance-free skincare (especially around the eyes) so this serum made me feel like I was wearing perfume to bed! There are so many better eye serums or creams for your eye-area in my opinion. I would not pay the high price tag for this product. Not Worth the High Price Tag
