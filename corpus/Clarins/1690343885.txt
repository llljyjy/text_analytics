I received a one week sample of Clarins Double Serum to test out in exchange for my honest review.  The consistency of the serum was nice it wasn’t too thin that is tan and it wasn’t too thick that it doesn’t come out.  It went on nicely and rubbed right into my skin. The smell was light and non irritating.  I could feel the moisture in my skin after using. Moisturizing!
