I received a small sample from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. For skincare I think you need a full size in order to try it longer than a few days and get a better understanding of the product. This eye serum helped smooth fine lines and my under eyes felt less puffy. I think I need more of a cream because my under eyes are on the drier side. Iâ€™m not sure if I would purchase this because it is so expensive for less than 1oz. Serum Texture
