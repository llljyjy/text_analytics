This face mask is a really lovely texture- it feels like a whipped clay mask! The scent is also wonderful. The application was easy, though I wasn’t really sure how much product constituted a “thick” layer. I feel like I used too much because at the amount I went through per mask, this jar wouldn’t last me very long. I didn’t really see any change in the contours of my face, but my skin felt and looked nice afterwards. nan
