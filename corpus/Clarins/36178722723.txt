I get to try this product from “Butterly influencer” program in exchange of my honest review. I got to try this product for 7 days and tbh the things which I really love about this product: 1. Loved the refreshing and pleasant  fragrance 2. My skin is dry so it made my skin feel super soft and hydrated I see some glow but the sample is not enough for me to see huge difference. But for the 7 days sample I was really happy with the result I felt on my skin My skin feels hydrated
