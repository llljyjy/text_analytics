I received this product for free from Butterly in exchange for my honest feedback. I got a weekâ€™s worth of serum to try and the consistency and spreadability of the serum is quite good. It was easily absorbed and did not leave an oily sheen on my skin. It was definitely moisturizing but I will not replace my current brand for it. Awesome Serum
