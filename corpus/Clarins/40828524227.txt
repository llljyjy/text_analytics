Thank you @ClarinsCanada @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor for sending me Clarins Double Serum. I applied it to my face & neck in the morning & evening after cleansing. I loved the feeling of the Clarins Double Serum on my skin. It feels so hydrating and not sticky. Has a nice fruity and floral light scent. So great that it has 21 potent plant extracts that will help hydrate & reduce signs of aging.#DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare #thisisbutterly #chickadvisor Love the feeling on my skin
