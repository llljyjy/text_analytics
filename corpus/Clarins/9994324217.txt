I received this product in exchange for my honest review. This product is only okay to me. I was not a huge fan of it. In all honesty it made one of my undereyes break out & I had an annoying pimple. I looked at the ingredients and it had fragrance added into it which I donâ€™t like. I always find them to hurt my skin. Overall it did feel smooth and had a nice feel to it, but I would not buy. Only okay
