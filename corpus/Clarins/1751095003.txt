I received a 7 day sample from @thisisbutterly, @chickadvisor, @clarinscanada to try out in exchange for my honest review. Each packet contains 2 separate contents. I applied contents both of them in the morning and in the evening. It didnâ€™t cause any acne and melted into my skin quickly. Did not feel sticky or greasy. Skin is instantly hydrated with each use. After 7 days I did notice that my skin is smoother and less dry. Formula contains 21 potent plant extracts which targets wrinkles, firming, radiance, eveness, and reduces pores. Have already purchased the full sized product and am looking forward to seeing the anti-aging properties with continuous use. #thisisbutterly#chickadvisor#DoubleSerum#ClarinsSkinCare#gotitfree Amazing anti-aging serum
