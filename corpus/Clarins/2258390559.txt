ReviewI received this complimentary from butterly! This serum is non-greasy and melts into the skin very nicely. I’ve been using this for 7 days now and so far I have seen my skin more hydrated and brightened some dark spots. It’s too early to tell if it is beneficial for addressing signs of aging. It has a nice scenery- citrus and floral!  @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor @clarinscanada #doubleserum #ClarinsSkinCare nan
