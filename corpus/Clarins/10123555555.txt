This is a super creamy yet light formula. It leaves you hydrated but not greasy at all. I actually love the way it feels. I haven’t seen any significant difference but I do feel the area looks a lot healthier from the hydration alone. I have a good feeling I’m going to see a decrease in the lines I have from looking at my phone. It does have a very light scent that dissipates when fully absorbed. It’s also a really big bottle. Great addition
