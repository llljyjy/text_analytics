I received a week’s worth of travel size products in exchange for my review. I will first say that I’m not sure one week is enough to see much of a difference from any product. I did not notice a difference in my skin.

That being said, sometimes when I stray from my normal routine, I notice a decline in the appearance of my skin, and this product did not make that happen. If you’re looking for a new skincare routine, I would give this a try. Didn’t use long enough to see a difference
