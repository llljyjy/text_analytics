First, I must say that I am the biggest Clarins fan. With that being said, once again, their formula hasnâ€™t let me down! I am 41, and my Mother has always told me to take care of my neck just as much as I do my face! When I saw that Clarins had a product for my latest concern, I was absolutely on board! I have Sensitive Skin, and I have not recieved any sort of irritation! I love that the ingredients they have left out have allowed me to have a more firm, smooth and lifting appearance to my newly self conscious area. I enjoy the scent, and I also loving the powerful ingredients such as Kangaroo Flower, Organic Desert Date, Organic Oat Sugars. I have been applying day and night, and I will continue doing so as this is exactly what I was hoping for! I highly recommend this product for anyone! Yes, A MUST!!
