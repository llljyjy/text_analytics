I love my new Clarin’s Total Eye Lift Cream. It’s an all-in-one anti-aging eye cream. I love the lightness and smoothness. It causes no reaction with skin. I’ve tried many an eye cream and this feels so good under my eyes. Specifically, the lightness of the formula and the lack of a reaction with my skin. I feel like I wake up in the morning with less crow’s feet and more moisturization. Love it!
