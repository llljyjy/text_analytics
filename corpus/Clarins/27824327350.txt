I was sent a seven day sample for free to try in exchange for my honest opinion. I have used it daily for the past week after I washed my face but before I applied my moisturizer. It was a simple process- fold the package to open, press for the product to come out and then mix in your palms before applying to your face and neck. It adsorbed quickly and didnâ€™t leave any tackiness. It left my face feeling soft and hydrated. I did find it to be heavily scented. overall, great product. I can see it helping with anti-aging with continuous use. Clarins Double Serum
