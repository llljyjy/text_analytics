I have loved this product for years, and it is so crazy to see everyone going nuts over it all of a sudden.  For years I had the honey colour and I loved wearing it as a nude lip. I recently bought Pitaya to try, and it is such a beautiful colour!! Formulation is obviously the same, and it does stain the lips slightly, which I actually like because even when the oil has worked it’s way off the lip, it doesn’t leave you with nothing there until reapplication.  I do find this has decent staying power, but I would have to reapply several times a day.  I find with the applicator that a lot of the product doesn’t come out on there, so you do have to dip it back in several times. It feels amazing on the lips - not sticky or goopy, just smooth and beautiful and feels moisturizing (although I’m not sure if there are any ingredients in there to support that).  If you love lip oils, this is absolutely going to be a win for you. I also love that they fixed the packaging on this product, because I used to find oil used to get on the outside of the container somehow (so the outside was always oily), but not any more!! Have used this lip oil forever!!
