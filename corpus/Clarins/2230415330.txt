Absolutely love how this product is dispensed because you can adjust the amount dispensed to your liking (small drop vs large drop). It helps with using just the right amount of product. This serum comes two in one with one being oil based and the other cream based and you use your fingers to mix it together! It smells lovely, like a light rose scent and has helped revive my dull eyes from being in front of a screen all day. It has firmed up my eye bags and have reduced the darkness as well. A power drop is all you need!
