It is an excellent eye cream for any time of the year.  The texture is fantastic, with no greasy residue.  It feels refreshing.⁣ It has a wonderful light consistency and stays moist around the eye, which I like, it’s not sticky, just moisturizing.  This is an excellent eye cream to use day and night.  And it also makes my eye concealer smoother. ⁣ Love it!⁣
