I have rosacea so very sensitive, combo toward dry skin and this worked great. I only received 7 days worth of product and it was a little hard to mix only bc it was in samples, but I liked it so much, I purchased 2 full size bottles! It is so easy to use from the full size pump. There is a fragrance but didn’t bother my sensitive skin at all. I can’t speak to any anti-aging claims due to only 7 days worth, but I do feel it helped with redness, dryness, and I had an immediate glow. I obviously will rebuy since I already did. haha Immediate Difference-TBD On Anti-Aging Claims
