I really like that this neck cream isn’t in a tub, but in a more hygienic packaging. A little does go along way, however, it is still quite expensive for my budget. It has a nice light fragrance if you don’t mind fragrances, and it absorbs quickly in the skin. I’ve only been using it for a few weeks, so I can’t really comment on effectiveness of it yet. nan
