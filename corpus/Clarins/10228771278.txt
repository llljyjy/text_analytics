I received a seven-day trial of this serum and overall, I really loved it. The scent especially was pleasant, and I loved how smoothly it went onto my skin and how quickly it absorbed. It left my skin feeling soft and nourished. I will say that the sample packs were pretty awkward to use and not my favorite. Assuming the serum is in an actual bottle, itâ€™s a great product. Really Nice Serum with a Great Scent
