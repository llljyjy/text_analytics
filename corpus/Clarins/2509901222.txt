Honey tastes and smells like candy, in my opinion, like a blue raspberry flavoured sour candy. It’s okay in terms of moisturizing, last slightly longer than a lip balm, but in my opinion not worth buying over a lip balm unless you’re trying to put something glossier than a balm on (I tend to opt for an oil to act as a balm during events because it doubles as a gloss). Is it worth CA$32? No. Do I enjoy it? Yeah, sure. I’m not mad at it. Not a must have, okay if you want a glossy balm
