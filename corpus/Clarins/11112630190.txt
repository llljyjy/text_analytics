This clarnis eye cream is now a new part of my skincare routine. The packaging is sleek and I love the bright red color but my all time favorite thing is once you dispense this cream is so soft. This eye cream applies nicely under your eye & doesnâ€™t leave a white residue at all. Once I used it you could see a difference with the puffiness under my eyes.
