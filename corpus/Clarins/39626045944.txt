I was so lucky to receive the amazing @clarinscanada #DoubleSerum to try from @chickadvisor and @thisisbutterly in exchange for my honest review.This serum really does what it says. I can feel the obvious improvement of my skin condition after using this serum for a couple of days. My skin feels softer and firmer. The dull skin tone becomes radiant. I like the mild floral fragrance, which is lovely to me. The texture of the serum is a bit oily at first. But it absorbs into the skin quickly and without greasy feeling soon after. The serum is a bit pricy but itâ€™s worth every penny. Great product ! Love it
