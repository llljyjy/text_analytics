The serum wasn’t oily, mixed easily, absorbed well without leaving my skin feeling greasy and was quite hydrating.While I can’t claim visible changes in my complexion in the given timeframe, I can understand why so many people rave about this product.Would I go out of my way to purchase it? No. It’s a very fragrant product which I didn’t mind, but I also didn’t enjoy. Great product but not for me....
