I love this eye cream. I have noticed a difference in the overall appearance of my under eyes. As a long time contact wearer I can use all the help I can get for my under eyes. My fine lines are less noticeable and my skin feels more firm.  It also helps with the appearance of my dark circle. It sits beautifully under make up too. Lovely!
