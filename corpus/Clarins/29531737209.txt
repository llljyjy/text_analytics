This has been a great eye cream for me! The packaging is beautiful and I like that it has a pump. It has a nice creamy texture but feels lightweight when applied. It absorbed well and quickly. I used it day and night, and it worked well under my makeup. I definitely noticed my dark circles were reduced and the area around my eyes just looked more firm. nan
