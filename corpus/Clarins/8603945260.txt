Gel like serum that’s easy to apply. It has a slight floral scent to it but not overpowering. Apply to eye area after cleansing your face. Very moisturizing and good for all skin types. I have oily to combination and have not had any issues. It is 2 power packed serums in 1. It has 13 plant extracts and turmeric. I would recommend. It’s worth the money in my opinion. Nice eye serum
