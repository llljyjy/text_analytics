After using the Clarins Double Serum for a week I have nothing but love for this product. After a couple days I noticed my skin felt less textured, smoother and more hydrated. The formula is lightweight, non greasy and a little goes a long way! The scent is also very nice and not strong at all. Lovely serum!
