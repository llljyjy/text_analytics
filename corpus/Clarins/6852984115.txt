I’m in my 40’s and I’m always looking for creams/serums for the eye area, this one have a great texture and it absorbs pretty quick into the skin, which I love because  I don’t have to wait for to apply my next product. I didn’t notice a lift effect, but I have to say that feel really nice.I love the packaging as well. Great product.
