What a beautiful and unique mask! It has a whipped clay mask texture but does not dry down hard on your face. It seems to lock in some hydration and leave your skin glowing when you remove it! I loved the whole experience and it felt very spa-like and special. I would definitely love to use this one before a special occasion. My skin felt and looked great after. Wonderful mask!
