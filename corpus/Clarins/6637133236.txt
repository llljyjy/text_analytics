I received a seven-day sample supply of this product from Influenster and Clarins for my honest review. The samples were very hard to press out an even amount of product out of. The sample product needed to be pressed out of the package and then mixed together. However, it was quite difficult to get even amounts of each component out of the package. I only received a sample size that was for a week’s trial,  so I don’t feel I used this product enough to give a very detailed review.  The serum did apply well and gives a nice smooth glow. I believe it has helped smooth the skin under my eye.  It’s a nice product to put into your beauty routine but might need to have others in your daily routine, especially for the price point. Perhaps receiving more of the product to try out may be beneficial in the future. It is likely that I’ll purchase this product in the future. nan
