*I received these products complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review*I instantly fell in love with the new Clarins Double Eye Serum just as I did the original Double Serum! The Double Serum leaves my face with firmer, smoother, more radiant skin while this new Double Eye Serum is more suited for the thin skin under your eyes. The skin around my eyes immediately feels more hydrated & refreshed after gently tapping it into the skin on & all around my eyes. I haven’t experienced any irritation or stinging of my eyes & I put it directly on my lids, too. It’s smoothing & firming as it absorbs, and it does fully absorb leaving my skin feeling so moisturized with zero residue or greasiness! Nothing!  It also leaves this long lasting cooling effect, maybe due to how hydrating it is? Long after application, I feel this refreshing, hydrating, cooling effect and I love it. This 2 in 1 serum is packed with 13 potent plant extracts and leaves my eye area feeling revitalized & just plain good. I’ve never experienced anything like it before! My eye area looks years younger after less than a week of using it however, the comfortable feeling it gives my skin is my favorite part! Feels Amazing!
