This is literally a double serum. The bottle has an inner cylinder separated from the outer one, and when dispensing the product you’ll see a mix of white and honey gold coming out together.I’m sensitive to fragrance and this scent while sweet like honey, smells a bit strong. The dispenser has an option for higher volume or lower dispensing. Cool in idea but it squirts so hard I keep losing product regardless of which either one I try. Texture is medium weight goopy serum types and absorbs into skin quick and well. It doesn’t have the artificially brightened look which I’m grateful for. Feels great on my skin. As far as first impressions go, I really like the serum itself. Just wish the dispenser didn’t have its issue and fragrance was lighter. nan
