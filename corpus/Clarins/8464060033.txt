I really enjoy this serum. It has a nice light consistency and it glides on the skin smoothly. It sinks in well and works well with my other skincare. It also feels great on the skin and hydrates and preps for other skincare. The packaging is nice and luxe the only downside is the smell. It has a strong perfume scent. If you are sensitive to scents steer clear of this. Great Serum!
