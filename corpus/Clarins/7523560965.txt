I was very skeptical about this eye cream and it’s claim to see instant results.  I don’t get a lot of sleep and I always have dark circles, a little puffiness and a few fine lines.  After my 1st use, I saw a significant improvement of my dark circles and a little improvement of puffiness.  That was within the first few minutes.  I have started to notice my fine lines are not as prominent either but that took a little longer to see. I use 2x a day and it’s now been 2 weeks.  I am very happy with this eye cream. It is a lightweight cream but dries quickly like a balm. I also noticed a very light floral fragrance.  It was very gentle too.  I am looking forward to seeing continued results. Definitely Lives Up To Its Claims
