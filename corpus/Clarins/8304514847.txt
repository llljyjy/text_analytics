I love how the texture is super lightweight and not oily. When applied on to the face, it gives a nice healthy glow and is absorbed into the skin within 5 min. I pair the product with another Hydrating serum and finish with a lotion. I have sensitive, combo dry skin and this product didn’t irritate me nor give me break out. I tend I avoid using products containing high amounts of fragrance, but I actually do like its smell and the fragrance didn’t cause any skin problem after one week of use. By the end of the week I did notice my skin is more supple in the morning. To make your skin glow in the morning, try this!
