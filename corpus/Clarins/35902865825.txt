I really like this serum it’s lightweight and my skin really loves it it just soaks it all up lol, not instantly but it definitely does not feel heavy or greasy. I have noticed a difference my eye are is more hydrated and tight. Plus it gives you this beautiful glow! It smells so good it’s hard to describe but I know it’s good for your skin because of all of the amazing ingredients in it. I would buy it on a splurge. Top notch serum
