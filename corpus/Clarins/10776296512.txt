This is my new holy grail.  I just turned 44 and my neck is starting to show it.  I don’t have the full wobble under there, but its a little loose.  Lines are starting to form on my neck tic tac toe board.  Eek.  I’m so glad I found this.  In a week I could notice the difference. That little wobble, gone.  That tic tac toe board,  fading!  Seriously I was amazed.   It was also very nice on my neck.  My skin tends to be more sensitive there but this did not break me out at all.  I absolutely love this one. No more tic tac toe
