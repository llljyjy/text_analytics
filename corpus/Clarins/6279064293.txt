This is a wonderful morning time mask. It reduces puffiness and enhances radiance. It has a nice white creamy/mousse texture and a little goes a long way. The packaging is beautiful in a rose gold jar. This mask wasnâ€™t drying and left me feeling smooth. I enjoy the very subtle fresh scent. Overall this is a nice mask that will prep your skin for the day to come. Clarins is easily becoming one of my favorite brands. Plumping and refreshed brighter skin
