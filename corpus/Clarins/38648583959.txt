I was sent this product for free to try and review. @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor The double serum is nothing short of amazing. It has a beautiful scent that doesnâ€™t smell artificial, and while initially the separateness of two ingredients seems strange, they blend perfectly together once dispensed. Non greasy and just sinks into my skin, leaving it soft and silky. Amazing, worth the price
