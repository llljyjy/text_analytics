i got this product at the perfect time. i’ve had multiple long nights this week so i haven’t gotten much sleep. i’ve been using this in the morning after i tone my face with my microcurrent device and i’ve noticed that it helps minimize puffiness. it has a nice thick creamy texture and is relatively easy to rinse off. i’m definitely adding this to my routine on days i need the extra help. nan
