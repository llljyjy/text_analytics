I liked this product overall. My skin felt softer after using for 7 days and I feel like my micro wrinkles were smoother. My skin felt hydrated after. The product had a light scent, not overbearing. The serum is a combination of a light orange serum and a white serum. Iâ€™d be interested to see how my skin reacted after a month of use. I would recommend this product. Hydrated eyes
