i received a 7 day sample of this from @ChickAdvisor/ @thisisbutterly in exchange for my honest opinion. i won’t go into the ingredients etc because you can read it above. My experience- I found this serum to be quite oily and sticky. My hair kept sticking to my face after I used. By morning there wasn’t an oily There wasn’t equal amounts of the 2 serums- I don’t know if that had anything to with it. You had to snap the sample card in half ,empty and then mix in your hand. it was hard to mix such a small amount up in your hand. After 7 days, I didn’t see any noticeable difference but a week isn’t a long time to see a result so possibly with longer use. I think this would be great for someone with dry skin. I’m not counting this completely  out- I would try it again in a bottle form but sample where the product’s supposed to be mixed are tricky. Clarins Double Serum
