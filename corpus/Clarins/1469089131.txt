My biggest impression was how it reduced the morning puffiness and the overall brightening effect it had under my eyes. I suffer with allergies so I’m always concerned about scent. But I loved the scent, it was soft and subtle and it did not aggravate my allergies. It is a lightweight cream and absorbs quickly. I did not see a difference with the fine lines but I’m looking forward to the long term effects. I did have quite a bit of trouble with the pump. Reduce Pufiness
