First off I like the precision applicator which makes getting it in quick and easy. Much better than scooping out of tub. It’s not tacky so my clothes and hair don’t stick to it. It has a nice scent that is not overwhelming. I don’t notice an immediate lifting but the texture is incredibly smooth and silky. This makes my neck looks a bit plumper since it adds so much moisture to the delicate skin. It takes time, consistency and of course patience but it does give the neck a more youthful appearance over time. With patience it gives neck a youthful appearance
