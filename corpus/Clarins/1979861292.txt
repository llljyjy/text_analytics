I wanted to love this product but I donâ€™t. My lips start pealing and feel grainy after having this on for an hour. Could be an allergic reaction but I use LOTS of lip products and never had this issue. The product smells great, nice colour and pretty shine. If you have sensitive skin like me just beware. nan
