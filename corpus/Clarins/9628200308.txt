Thank you @clarinscanada @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor for sending me a sample of Clarins Double Serum in exchange for my honest review! Overall, I really liked this product but I don’t think it’s a repurchase for me.✅21 different plant extracts to help with skin nutrition, oxygenation, hydration, regeneration and protection -- really combating signs of aging. This product has SO many good-for-you ingredients. I’m talking oat, turmeric, mango and so much more. I loved looking through all of the items on their website to get an idea as to what was in the formula.✅Unique double texture is suited for all skin types.✅Claim most people saw a noticeable change (more beautiful, smoother, hydrated skin) within 7 days and actually gave out a 7 day trial -- thank you! Major plus for testing.❎Noticeable floral scent to this product -- I like a nice fragrance as my skin can handle it but I know many try to avoid it! Keep this in mind if you’re considering splurging.❎Speaking of... the price tag on this product may be difficult to swallow! This product retails for almost $140 for a 50mL bottle on their official website.My experience:I really enjoyed testing this product. I found that there was plenty of product to mix together (and I loved the aspect of two textures!). My skin really liked this and I did feel like I had more noticeable hydration and my skin seemed to really soak the product in. I generally don’t like to use facial oils but this wasn’t greasy at all and worked nicely in my night time routine. This is definitely a luxury product and I’m sure my skin will be sad to see it no longer in the routine but because of the cost, it’s a really hard justification for me. In addition, Clarins official policy is that they do not test on animals, however, they sell in parts of the world that require it. I have a few Clarins products that I’ve purchased and truly love but I am trying to be more conscious of how I spend and hope Clarins considers a change soon. nan
