I love Clarins body products and this one didn’t disappoint. I love the tube with the twist off cap and pointed applicator. It allows me to use a precise amount of product and I like not having to stick a finger/spatula on a jar.I used this on my neck and chest and the skin was considerably more hydrated, soft and firm after using this for two weeks.  The product spreads easily so I didn’t have to use a large amount of product to cover neck and chest. It works!
