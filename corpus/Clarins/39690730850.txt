Clarins double serum is the perfect thing for dry skin as we head into the winter! I prefer the oil-based over the cream-based products, and notice an immediate difference with this product. I also find it lasts; my skin feels good from dawn until dusk. It is somewhat scented, but not too much. I haven’t been using it long enough to see if it has an impact on the growing number of wrinkles I’m getting, but I would still recommend it just for the restorative feeling it provides. Perfect serum for the shoulder season
