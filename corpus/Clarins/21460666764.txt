I really wanted to love it since it becomes viral previously, and as the advertisement, it supposes to repair the lips. I had a high expectation for this product as much as my demand. However, after putting it on my lips, it dries out within 10 minutes and leaves my lips flaky. I had to return it right away. Still, the color looks natural and that’s the only thing I love about this product. I prefer the one that just has been launched by Patricia is better and the price is comparable. even though the color is lovely, it’s a no!
