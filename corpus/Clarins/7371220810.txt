The best serum so far is Clarins double serum. This age control concentrate contains 20 plant extracts to regenerate, hydrate, protect your skin and fill it with nutritions. This serum has very light nice fragrance and doesnâ€™t make my skin sticky. After 7 days of using it I already see how my skin glow and my wrinkles were visibly reduced. I received a sample size for free to try and review Amazing serum
