I received this product sample free from Butterly and Clarins to review. I want to start by saying that 7 days is difficult to submit a proper review. I did like that I saw an immediate difference in how smooth my skin was. It does have a bit of an oily consistency which I like, I also found it very moisturizing. There is a small crease on my forehead that was definitely less visible after using for a few days which was great as well. There is a scent to it but it’s more floral and not very strong so I actually like it. I know a lot of people prefer scent-free products though so I can see it being a negative for some. The two major cons are price and lasting effectiveness. Once I stopped using it I found the crease started showing again and my skin wasn’t as smooth. For the hefty price and for how quickly it will get used up it may be hard to continue purchasing. Pricey, but it seems to work
