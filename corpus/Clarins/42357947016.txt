this serum has been ok so far. Ive used it for 7 days in a free sample and have not noticed any visible differences. It feels a bit greasier on my skin than my regular serum though, but I like that it has turmeric in it. It is more expensive that my normal serum so I will probably not be buying this anytime soon. just ok
