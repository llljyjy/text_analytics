I honestly didn’t think this serum did anything until I looked at the before and after photos. The difference is subtle but still noticeable and keep in mind I only received a 7 day trial to test. The application is lightweight, absorbs well and doesn’t tug at your skin. It also has a wonderful scent. I highly recommend Clarins Double Serum Eye. I received this product for free from Influenster and Sephora in exchange for my honest review Noticeable difference
