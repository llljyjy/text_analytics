I am a huge Clarins fan and I have to say I was looking forward to trying this Eye serum product by them. First, i really love the packaging and concept. With the double chamber you get a mixture of two products that give you the perfect dosage for each use. As for the product itself, I love both the consistency and fragrance. The scent is very lightweight and floral. The consistency is like any classic serum but I love that it quickly absorbs into the skin and doesnâ€™t leave a greasy residue. Given I received a sample size I wish I could have used it a bit longer but in the 5 days of using it so far I feel like my undereyes look brighter and my fine lines look softer. Great product so far!
