I love this serum - it absorbs faster than any other serum I tried, leaves no weird film, only a scent of well nourished skin. I also like the scent, mild, but pleasant. I got a sample, so it was hard to squeeze out the two parts, but I am sure it isn’t a problem from the full size packaging. It’s hard to say how well it is working after using it for a week but in general I have only good things to say about it. I highly recommend it. super absorbable
