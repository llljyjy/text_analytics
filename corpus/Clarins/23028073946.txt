I received a 7 day sample to try from Butterly in exchange for my honest review.I will say, I love the floral scent of this serum - but it is awfully strong. If you’re not someone who likes scented products then my advice would be to skip this one. Although it is a lovely scent, it’s a strong one.The samples require you to bend the package in half to release the samples and then mix both sides together. This was easy to do and I really do enjoy the serum.Not too thick or runny, just perfect. I’ve  not seen a HUGE difference, especially for the price tag that the actual bottle comes with, but it is a nice product that did leave my skin feeling great.I wouldn’t say this was a must have for me personally but I also didn’t dislike it. Meh.
