The Fruit-Tox Resurfacing Facial Remedy mask is one of the best masks I have used! I use this mask 2-3 times weekly. My skin always feels exceptionally smooth after using the product. One of the things I like about this mask is that it doesnâ€™t dry my skin out; it leaves you with a fresh, hydrated feeling. I highly recommend incorporating this mask into your skin care routine! Exceptional, Quality Resurfacing Mask
