I received this in exchange for review. All thoughts and opinions expressed are my own. I’d say this is a dang decent serum. Since it’s been rather hot lately, I’ve been using this in place of a traditional moisturizer to avoid feeling heavy or greasy. It leaves my face feeling smooth and hydrated. Fine lines and wrinkles aren’t my main concern, but I did notice that the serum decreases the appearance of what I do have. My skins radiance also improved directly after application and several hours afterwards.This does have a noticeable rose scent to it, which I was at first apprehensive of, but it doesn’t linger longer than a few minutes.
