This face scrub works so well, but is incredibly messy. I really do love how smooth my skin is after using the fruit-tox resurfacing remedy, it feels so clean and soft! The only problem is how bright orange the product is, it turns everything it touches a slight orange color so the only place I feel comfortable using it is in the shower otherwise my sink and counters are a mess. nan
