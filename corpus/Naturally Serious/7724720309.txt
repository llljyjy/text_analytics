I have tried so many eye creams from so many different brands and I have some favorites but after trying this one it is now my new fave because it is truly the best eye cream that I have tried. It does wonders to under eye area. It reduces puffiness and dark circles also it is very hydrating. All you need a very small amount. I also love the ingredients and you can for sure see results right away which I love. Highly recommend. A must have eye cream!
