I tried this cream for a few days and WOW , My skin just glows after I use it , my skin fully hydrated and feeling fresh through the day , Very herbal smell when you’re rubbing it in but the smell doesn’t linger afterwards for me wasn’t a problem , the smell is very citrus-y and fresh / clean , honestly I love those kinda smells in my skincare products , The consistency is thicker than most , so a few dabs is enough to get your face cover with it , It’s extremely moisturizing and a little goes a long way. I will continue to use this product , definitely I’d recommend trying this out.This product was gifted from Skin Warrior . Good moisturizer & smells amazing!
