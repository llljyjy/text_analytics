I was intrigued by this product being called and anti-fatigue power serum. I love that it is a clean and natural formula  made without all the bad stuff like preservatives, mineral oil, sulfates, silicones, drying alcohols... the list goes on!! It is also naturally fragranced which is great since my skin can sometimes be sensitive to fragrance.  It does smell great too, a mix of rose and lavender. The serum gives my skin a beautiful glow, even with foundation applied after. My skin feels soft and smooth as well. It clams to also help with wrinkles, fine lines and texture for a youthful look but I cant attest to that since that is not my skin type.  Overall, I love the feel to my skin, the beautiful glow it leaves and I feel good using it since its a clean product. I received Illumi-nationâ„¢ Anti-Fatigue Power Serum from Naturally Serious in exchange for my honest review. gorgeous glow
