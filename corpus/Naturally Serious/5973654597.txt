Love the balance of smoothing and hydrating this provided my skin. Alot of times when I use masks that help clarify skin they make my skin feel tight, but I love the combination of kaolin clay and soothing ingredients in this.  Love this brand overall for being cruelty free, been a fan of their products for awhile Works well on Sensitive Skin!
