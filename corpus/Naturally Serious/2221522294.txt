Really nice to treat myself to a mini spa treatment while in the shower.  Be prepared for some “red“ on your fingers or even the towel but otherwise the skin felt refreshed after the facial massage. I have been using a few times a week for about a month. Definitely nice way to hydrate and provide extra love during the winter. nan
