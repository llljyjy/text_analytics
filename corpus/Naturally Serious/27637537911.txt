Really easy to use pad! There is a textured side and a smoother side for the pad. It comes and HR form and comes with quite a bit of pads. The pads hold the solution really well and I really easy to use without being overly harsh on my skin. The solution to take a bit of time to get used to since it made my skin slightly tingly during the beginning but now my skin has gotten used to it. nan
