There are both pros and cons to this SPF. I’ll start by saying that mineral sunscreen is tricky. Almost all of them leave a white cast and give flashback in photos. This one is ‘skin’ tinted so there was no white cast but the color was a little off for me - I have very fair skin. And I feel like it would be very very off for someone with dark or deep skin. It’s also very thick and kind of hard to blend out. But with that it’s very moisturizing and makes my skin feel nice. nan
