I love toner pads and was so very excited to try these. These didn’t disappoint me either. I love that they don’t smell wrong like some toner pads do. I found myself enjoying the cooling effect I felt after using the pad. It made me skin feel and look refreshed. It did burn slightly on some of my tiny breakouts I have. But it went away within seconds. I’m excited to keep using these! These are good!
