Hands down one of the best exfoliating pads I have ever used. I have extremely sensitive skin and typically these types of products leave my skin irritated and dry. I love the cold application and leaves my skin feeling refreshed. I do have to wait until itâ€™s completely dry before finishing my skincare routine to avoid my skin burning. I have been using these for a week and notice my skin is brighter and tone is more even. I use this everyday and can see a huge difference. Great for sensitive skin
