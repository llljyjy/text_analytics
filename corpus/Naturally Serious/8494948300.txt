I have mixed feelings about this. First, I loved it when I applied it with a damp beauty blender. I feel like it gave a dewy glow. I then tried putting it on like normal moisturizer/sunscreen with my fingers and I hated it. The texture was awful and I immediately had to get it off of my face. So I prefer to apply it with a beauty blender. There is also a slight lemon smell which is fine, but I donâ€™t love having my makeup products super fragrant. Not my fav
