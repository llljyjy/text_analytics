This mask made my skin feel so amazing after just 1 use! The red clay, pumice, and AHAs really get off all that bad skin and reveal an amazing glow to the skin! I love that it only takes 2 minutes so itâ€™s perfect for anyone in a rush. It is very vibrant orange so be careful with what you touch and wear, but other than that I absolutely recommend this product!! So good!
