So happy I’m getting to try this! Light pink color of this serum so pretty and seem to bright up my skin complexion. Favorite part it’s weightless, skin drank it in seconds and no residue of any sort was left behind. It gives a non greasy dewy skin finish and made my skin look more even toned and healthy. It mixed well with other serums that I layered it with. Works excellent under makeup and makes my tiny wrinkles look so much smoother. Silky skin
