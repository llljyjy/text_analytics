It’s so difficult for me to find a mineral sunscreen that doesn’t leave a white cast, but thankfully this brand is one of few thats found a way! I enjoy the, of course, natural ingredients such as shea butter, green tea, and goji berry as well. Great natural sunscreen for these upcoming summer months! nan
