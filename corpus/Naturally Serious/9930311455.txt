When I first applied this, I thought I was going to hate it FORREAL!! It stained my hands a bit but by the time I got out the shower it was gone. Yes, I applied this in the shower because if not, it will be a mess. But when I tell you my face was soft as a babies bottom when I washed it off!!!! Buy this! Run to the store and bumpy this. Donâ€™t be alarmed with how orange it is. The beads are very fine which I love compared to my old one from a different brand. The smell is very earthy and clay like. Whewww! This is my new favorite! Read the instructions. Leave it on for a few minutes before washing off. And your skin will thank you!! Run to the store and get this
