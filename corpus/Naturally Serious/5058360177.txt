This stuff is magic for my skin, but the key is to be gentle. The pigmentation worried me initially since I’m not used to skincare being so... bright and opaque-ish. This has a clay like texture with a bit of grainy feel to it. It’s not super abrasive, but I can see it being too abrasive if you have a heavy hand and massage it in too roughly. Once I rinsed off, my skin was super smooth, soft and felt amazing. Love This Treatment
