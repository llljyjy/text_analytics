I liked this sunscreen a lot as it doesn’t contain any ingredients but it did leave a little bit of a white cast like most mineral sunscreens do on me.  The texture is a bit on the thicker side so I feel like I could also use this tube on my body as well.  Not my favorite sunscreen but a pretty good option if you can’t handle chemical. nan
