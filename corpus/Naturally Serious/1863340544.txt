I have use many brands of peel pads and these are on par or better! They are so gentle on the skin and do no irritate or dry the skin out like some do. There is minimal smell associated with them. I love how it removes make up left on after washing your face to make it extra clean.  My skin is def brighter after using.  The texture was smooth on my skin and felt refreshing. The Pomegranate Enzyme really helps my uneven texture. nan
