This stuff is seriously amazinggg! I use it twice a week as a deep cleanser/exfoliant/mask and it literally leaves my skin feeling the most fresh and clean that it’s ever felt. It’s made with red clay which is really great for exfoliating especially and is great for clearing pores! Skin feels so fresh and clean!
