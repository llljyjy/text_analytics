This facial remedy is amazing! I’m so happy I found it. I use it twice a week and my skin looks so polished and smooth. I always leave it for longer than two minutes to get all the benefits from the red clay and then I rub it in and around my skin on my face and chest area. Loving the results it gives me. I’d definitely recommend it. Amazing results!
