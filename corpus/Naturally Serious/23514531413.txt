I am a huge fan of peel exfoliating pads! I have heard amazing things about these so decided to try them out. I’m hoping these start to grow on me because as of now they are just okay. They feel great and calming but the scent is VERY overpowering which I’m not a huge fan of. There are plenty of other alternatives to these that I prefer to use. I’m slightly sad :( nan
