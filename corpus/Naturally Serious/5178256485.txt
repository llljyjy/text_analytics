I lovee peel pads because they are super convenient in my skincare routine. I especially love these ones because of the clean formula and the effectiveness. I think it’s really cool that it has pomegranate enzyme in it because that really helps with uneven skin texture and tone, which is my biggest skincare concern right now. It feels super nice and refreshing when I use it on my skin and I love how it’s not too harsh! I’ve been seeing great results and am super happy with these. So good!
