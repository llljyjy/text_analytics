I have been using this product for more than one week now. At the beginning I wasn’t sure about the texture.. it has a very thick texture and for my brown skin I didn’t like the white finish tone but I noticed that my skin absorbs the product real quick and the white color fades away. I like the smell of this product too and my skin feels protected. Skin protected
