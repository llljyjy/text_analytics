I received the Illumi-Nation anti-fatigue power serum from Naturally Serious as a gift in exchange for my honest thoughts. This gel serum is so luxurious and I really like that it is very lightweight and doesn’t just sit on the skin,it absorbs quickly,and doesn’t leave any sticky residue. This serum does have a scent to it,but I can’t really describe it,it is a faint scent and does go away as it dries. This creamy serum has Persian silk tree and Mediterranean lavender in it which help to reduce the fine lines,look of stress,wrinkles,and uneven skin tone for a younger,brighter,healthier looking skin. I like when a product has coconut oil in it as it really helps to hydrate the skin. What is really unique about this product is that this serums natural blush color illuminates the skin and helps in enhancing it,giving it a nicely radiant look. I really enjoy using this,and will continue to from here on in. luxurious gel serum
