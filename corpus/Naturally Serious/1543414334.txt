At first I wasn’t sure how gentle this exfoliating scrub was going to be on my sensitive skin, but I’m happy to report back that it was super gentle and very effective. I applied a thin layer and let it sit for 2 mins before washing off. My skin looked noticeably brighter and my pores were definitely minimized. Love this product! Loved it!!
