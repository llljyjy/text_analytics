Yes, as mentioned in the product description, this sunscreen is definitely on the thicker side. A little too thick for me but it performs nicely nontheless. The universal tint adapted well to my skin tone. I have to warm up a pea size amount on my fingers before applying so it doesn’t go on as thick. Otherwise, it feels like I am pulling all my skincare under it off while applying. It also has a grainy feel to it. I’m not sure if that’s normal but the grains are not rough and do not cause a problem when applying the cream. This sunscreen has a very light scent. It does feel a bit uncomfortable to apply on my face with how thick it is but I still use it specially for my neck area and sometimes I use it on some other areas of my body too. We know how important sunscreen is to prevent aging from sun exposure and other environmental agressors and this one does the job while also keeping the skin well hydrated. Thick consistency but works well on my combo skin
