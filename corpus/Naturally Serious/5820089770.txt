This moisturizer is great, it has a ton of amazing ingredients (squalane, vitamin e and colloidal oatmeal to name a few) and none of the nasty stuff(parabens, pthalates, etc). A little goes a long way and it soaks up into the skin very quickly leaving a very rich moisturized feeling. An added bonus is it smells really lovely, very fresh and botanical. I would recommend to everyone especially anyone whose skin is on the drier side. I received this product complimentary from Naturally Serious in exchange for my honest opinion. Very hydrating and smells amazing!
