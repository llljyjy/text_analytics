I was really surprised by how moist these pads were! They definitely did not skimp on any product which I have experienced with other pads in the past, so I appreciated that. I felt a slight tingle after using it but that was over an already sensitive area of my skin. But overall it felt great on my skin. Thereâ€™s a lot of pads in this product, so I will be using it for a long time! nan
