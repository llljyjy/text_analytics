This Illumi-nation Anti-Fatigue Power Serum it’s really nice. The packaging is glass like and I love how it has a pump it has a luxurious feeling and weight to it I love how much is you did out of the pumper just enough when using this product the color of the serum is a light pink which kind of Fades into the skin I love how it’s like a gel-like serum and it makes your skin feel so luminous and hydrated but not leaving a Dewey or greasy feeling and when it comes to the smell it has a lavender or botanical like smell with it overall I would say after using this Illumi-nation Anti-Fatigue Power Serum for only a couple days I see a big Improvement in My Skin I’m In Love With This highly recommend Very nice
