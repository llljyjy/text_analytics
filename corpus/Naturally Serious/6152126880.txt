Love love love this mask! I really like how this mask contains colloidal oatmeal, as it really helps hydrate my skin that gets easily dehydrated. I have an oily, acne-prone t-zone and I definitely noticed this helps makes me skin look less oily and congested, as this contains kaolin clay.  All in all, this is a great all around mask! Complimentary from Naturally serious. All around great mask!
