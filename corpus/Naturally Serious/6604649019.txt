The red-orange clay dispense easily from the.  Its texture is grainy and doesnâ€™t feel abrasive on my skin at all.  Massaging it on my damp skin makes me feel my skin is getting nice a scrub removing all the dead surface skin.  After wash off, I notice my skin looking brighter and a shade lighter!  Not only that it leaves my skin feeling extremely soft.  AMAZING!!! nan
