I received this complimentary from Naturally Serious for my review. This moisture rescue cream is a nice light moisturizer. It absorbs quickly into my skin and leaves it very moisturized and hydrated. It has a nice scent which reminds me of a clean and lemongrass scent. The scent does fade away so it should be fine for sensitive prone. This is good for all skin types.  Itâ€™s cruelty free and contains natural ingredients. Works Great
