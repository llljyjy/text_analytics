Complimentary from naturally seriousIn the beginning I felt very excited that it’s a tinted sunscreen. It applies easily. But the finish that it gives is too greasy and oily for my combo skin. The shade is fine. Not too brown or orange. I cannot wear this sunscreen on a daily basis. I would wear it probably by the pool. The scent is too strong for me as well. It’s too minty and spicy. Oily greasy finish not for oily skin & combo skin
