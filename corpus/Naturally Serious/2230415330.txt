I received this product for free from  in exchange for my honest review. Initial thought, I was worried that the tint would be too light for my complexion but it blended in perfectly and did not leave a white cast. The texture is thick and a little sandy feeling (that I didnâ€™t mind). My face was oily prior to applying and it removed the shine and left a dewy yet matte look on my face. I loved the scent, it reminded me of a lemon cake. If the texture was a little easier to spread then it would be the absolute perfect product! Soft glow, smells like lemon cake!
