I have enjoyed using this product but probably would not purchase again. I definitely only use in the shower because of the color. I put it on first, leave for a few minutes and then use my regular face wash after to make sure I have removed all of the darkly pigmented product. I have sensitive skin so I am very gentle with application but in reality it is a little harsh for my skin. nan
