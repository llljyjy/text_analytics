I can actually feel Naturally Serious After-Dark Sleeping Cream firming and tightening after applying it. It does smooth out some fine lines and is a nice night cream. It is a medium thickness but glides on and spreads so not much is needed. I dab a bit in different areas and then work it in and spreading it out. It is nice using a product that is formulated without so many nasty ingredients or ones that dry out skin.  It is formulated with a mix of familiar ones like ceramide and vitamin E and some I havenâ€™t used before like apple and celery seed extracts.  This cruelty-free cream does what it says. can feel it firming
