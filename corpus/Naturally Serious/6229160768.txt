This serum has a subtle botanical scent and is a fun pink color. It’s easy to spread but takes a minute to completely absorb. It feels completely lightweight once absorbed. I use one pump for my face and another for my neck.The bottle is made out of glass. It has a luxe feel which is expected at this price point. Everything about this product is high quality including the ingredients.I haven’t experienced the long-term benefits yet. In saying that, my impressions so far are positive. nan
