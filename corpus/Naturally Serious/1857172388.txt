First off, when I opened the bottle it was half full. You’re literally getting 2oz instead of 4oz. It’s says natural all over the bottle and has vegetable oil in it. VEGETABLE OIL!!!! It claims to have natural lemon scent but it smells like you’re rubbing toilet cleaner all over your face. 10/10 would not recommend. DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY
