What a lovely product! If you have dry or skin in need of a quick pick-me-up, this just might be it. Gorgeous whipped like texture that envelops skin in a rich, nourishing layer that works it’s magic over night. You wake up to skin that is more hydrated, supple, even toned, and soft.It’s my first experience with the brand and I’m pretty happy with how well my sensitive skin is responding. Only drawback I can think of is the smell. It’s not artificial, but it does linger for a little while before going away, so just keep that in mind. Other than that, this is fab! Quick pick-Me-Up!
