Such an amazing and versatile serum!! I’ve been using this in the mornings as a stand alone moisturizer and it’s perfect to add hydration and glow for days I don’t wear makeup. It’s also wonderful when wearing makeup to help create a flawless canvas! Also great in the evenings after I’ve done aha/bha treatments since it’s so gentle but hydrating and doesn’t cause any irritation. Can’t say enough good things!! So good
