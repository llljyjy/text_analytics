I really enjoy using this mask. I apply it for 10 minutes in the morning to prep my skin for the day and let it slightly harden (only slightly, it still stays pretty damp but the kaolin clay does dry it). After 10 minutes I rinse it off and I do notice my skin looking brighter, pores more refined and skin overall more clarified. I do have pretty dry skin nowadays, so after rinsing off I still had to follow up with the moisturizer so it wasn’t necessarily super hydrating. But I do still like this a lot, it doesn’t break me out or irritate my skin, and I enjoy the concept. Nice and calming
