I received the  Mineral Sun Defense Moisturizer Sunscreen as a gifted by Naturally Serious. For me, sunscreen is a very important step and I am always looking for good sunscreens that my dry skin will accept and enjoy. This sunscreen works excellent for me, its consistency is thick but it blends very well, also helping to prepare the skin for makeup. It has a citrus scent and has a slight color that disappears when blended, I really like that it is tinted because it doesnâ€™t leave a white cast at all. nan
