As much as I love facial masks I need something quick because I’m always on the go. This helped me up my skin care game in less than a minute. I had to get ready for an event and I massaged it into my skin for 30 secs and rinsed it off. Not only my skin looked brighter but it also helped improved my skin texture but my makeup to go on smooth after that. I can’t wait to see what results I get when I keep it on for longer next use. I love anything brightening and this is def going to be incorporated into my weekly self-care routine. Brighter skin in 30 secs
