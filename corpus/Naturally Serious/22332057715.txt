I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. This product is great if you have dry skin or combo skin. It’s super thick for a serum. It’s not clear and definitely seems more like an actual moisturizer versus a serum that can be thin and clear. Comes in a pump bottle to assure you get the correct amount, but I couldn’t get the pump to work. I suspect that the product and it’s consistency has something to do with that, but perhaps I just received a defective one. Antioxidants I’m always on board with when it comes to summer and being in the sun all the time. Great if you may be outdoor a lot. I combined this with the Supergoop unseen sunscreen and it was perfect under makeup. No problems. super hydrating
