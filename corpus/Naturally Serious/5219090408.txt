I really enjoy this product! It is gentle enough to use every night after cleansing, and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. Like most products I’ve tried from this brand, it is fragranced, so if you’re very sensitive to fragrance I might skip this one - that said, it doesn’t irritate me, and I’m very sensitive to fragrance products. Well done! nice chemical exfoliator
