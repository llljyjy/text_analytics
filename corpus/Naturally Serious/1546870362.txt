It’s always hard to find a mineral sunscreen that doesn’t leave a white cast on the skin, which is why this one is such a gem! I have a medium skin tone and I’m super picky about my sunscreens because I hate the white cast that some give. This formula has a subtle tint to it that helps balance out any white cast that may occur , making it perfectly blend into your skin tone! This sunscreen is lightweight and totally undetectable! It just feels nice and doesn’t have a greasy texture to it. You wear it alone or under makeup. It feels hydrating and very comfortable on the skin. I love the high protection factor and the natural ingredients. This a phenomenal formula and definitely one worth trying! No White Cast
