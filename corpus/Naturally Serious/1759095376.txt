This Supercharge Anti-Oxidant Moisture Serum has become of my my new favorite beauty routine products. First off, I love the smell.  It’s a light natural citrusy smell. The serum is a little thicker than some other serums but it’s goes on so smooth and absorbs quickly. I apply it at night and by the morning my skin is so moisturized and refreshed. I would highly recommend this if you need some hydration. Gifted by Naturally Serious. Loving this serum
