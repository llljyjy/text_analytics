I have had allergic reactions to other sunscreens  and I’m glad to say I did not have any negative reactions to this product. I use SPF daily on my face so finding something that will not irritate my skin I very important. It has a very thick almost grainy consistency so I does not leave my face greasy or shiny. It is also tinted so you don’t get that awful white cast. And it has a priming effect which makes my makeup look great. Overall I am pleased with this sunscreen and would recommend Primer Effect
