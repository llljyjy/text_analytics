This moisturizer rescue cream is not that heavy what I think, and I like it after trying. The cream helps my skin to feel more hydrated. It absorbs quick after applying. Itâ€™s my first time to try this brand, and honestly I like it. One thing want to mention is that I am not a fan of this smell. nan
