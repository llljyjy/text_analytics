Ok, I tried it multiple times and I just think that is not for my face, that being said I would like to share my experience using the product in my body (knees, elbows). The product is really good to exfoliate, it gives your skin a glow look after applying it.I highly recommend to test the product in your neck or your wrist to check if your skin accepts the product. Good
