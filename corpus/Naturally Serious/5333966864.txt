This Mask-imum works to help soothe the look of dry & dehydrated skin, provide moisture, dissolve excess oil & impurities. A fun mask to try! I have combination skin, however, because of the winter weather I am mostly dry. While I already had redness prior to use, this did make my face even more red and it wasn’t from washing it off as I was very gentle. I’m unsure if it irritated my skin or the reaction was meant to happen. Not a downside because I still really enjoy the product. Left my face feeling very moisturized and even helped some of my flakiness go away. I slough moisturizer on and still have flakiness so I’m pretty impressed! Has a slight smell but I can’t put my finger on it, maybe citrus? Overall I like that this has Colloidal Oatmeal, Hyaluronic Acid, Shea Butter and Kaolin Clay (among other ingredients) as I feel like these truly make a difference! Highly recommend and suggest.
