I can’t speak for the anti-aging effects because I wasn’t able to use it long enough. It did provide nice moisture, my skin definitely felt more hydrated. But the fragrance…it smells botanical like rose or something but doesn’t list the ingredients of the fragrance so I’m not exactly sure. Either way, the product smells too strong and made me break out. So if you don’t have a sensitivity to fragrance, I would definitely give this a try. I’ve been looking for years for a hydrating product that actually works and this definitely serves that purpose. nan
