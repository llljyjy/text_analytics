I really like these! I use them after I take off my makeup & wash my face. My skin feels super refreshed and soft. It’s gentle enough to use everyday which I like. It has a light scent which I like. I don’t think these are a magical product BUT I like it for using throughout the week & I do a more intense exfoliator once a week. Good product!
