This is my first time using any Naturally Serious products, and I must say I’m impressed! The moisturizing serum is very rich and hydrating (moisturizes like a cream, but smoothly applies like a serum). It absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving any greasiness behind. While it doesn’t feel heavy at all, it was thicker than many of the serums I’ve used before. The opaque pump bottle is both practical and beautiful as well. The only drawback to me is the herbal, citrusy fragrance; however, that dissipates quickly. After my experience with this serum, I intend to purchase this (and other) products by Naturally Serious.
