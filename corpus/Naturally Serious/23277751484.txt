I’m really enjoying it, my skin feels brighter and healthier.  It is a very creamy moisturizer and has a pearly color, it makes you want to eat it.  I don’t really love the smell but I think it’s worth it because the brand’s products are good (I have other Naturally Serious products and they have the same characteristic smell).  I tend to have sensitive skin but I didn’t have any problems with this moisturizer. nan
