I’ve been searching for a mineral sunscreen that doesn’t leave a white cast. Since this is tinted, it blends in well with my light-med skin tone. It is very thick and leaves a very dewy finish. Would not recommend for those with oily skin. I will probably save this for the colder months as well. nan
