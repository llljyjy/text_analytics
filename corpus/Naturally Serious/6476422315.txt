This mask felt really nice on my skin and I didn’t notice any irritation or other issues, but I also do not have sensitive skin and can only speak to what it accomplished for my combo-dry skin. It did feel like it made my face a little bit more hydrated and less tight-feeling, but I’m actually not really sure it did anything that a regular moisturizer wouldn’t do?? Didn’t notice any fragrance. Not sure I would purchase this as I don’t think it really does anything special, even if it does feel nice. nan
