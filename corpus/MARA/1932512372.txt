This cleansing oil is super gentle yet exfoliating and does a good job of leaving skin soft and clean. It has a lightweight texture to it with a slightly thicker than average consistency that glides over skin. After using this my skin felt soft and still hydrated but well cleansed. I loved the gentle exfoliation and skin softening benefits. nan
