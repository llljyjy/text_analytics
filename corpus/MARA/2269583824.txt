I consider myself somewhat of an expert on cleansing oils and balms. I prefer cleansing oils such as this product from Mara due to their mess free nature and ease of use with the pump applicator. I have tried many brands of cleansing oils and itâ€™s very rare that I find one that blows me a way. The packaging is absolutely perfect, I look for glass containers such as this one when buying skincare. Glass is sturdier, nicer looking, and does not interact with the product inside like plastic does over time. I shake the bottle before each use and pump 1-2 pumps into my hand. I apply it to my face after a long day of wearing makeup and massage it in a circular motion. Then I introduce water and continue to massage my skin. Afterwards I follow up with double cleansing (as I typically do after removing makeup) and then follow up with the rest of my skincare routine. My makeup glides off so easily with this product. This is a new favorite for sure, I have been loving this brand so far! Best cleansing oil on the market
