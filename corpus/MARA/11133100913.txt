This oil cleanser is magical. A friend of mine told me about it and I just had to try it out for myself. I have dry skin so I’m always worried about washing my face too often. I’ve used this cleanser in my morning routine and, wow! My skin felt so soft and smooth. I didn’t feel the need to slather my face in moisturizers. If you can get your hands on it, you must!
