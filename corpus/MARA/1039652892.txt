This oil cleanser is so nice - I use it as a first cleanse to remove my makeup then follow up with a water-based cleanser. It does a great job of removing makeup but what I love most about this is the feel of it! Itâ€™s super luxurious and moisturizing. My skin is super dry and feels nourished after using. Luxurious
