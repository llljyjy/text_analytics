I’ve wanted to try Mara Beauty for so long, and I’m so happy to have their new Universal face oil with algae & moringa. I love first that this is 100% natural, becuser i try to only use clean beauty and skincare products. This hydrated my oily-combo face, especially during this time of year, but without a greasy mess. I have used it during the day with a very light application, and it works nicely with my very matte foundation for a dewy finish. I also use it at night with my Solawave device. It smells so uplifting, I get hits of the algae and seaweed but not fishy at all, just like a pleasant ocean scent that smells very fresh. This is one I will keep tucked away for special spa days because I really love it and don’t want to go through it quickly! Delicious oil
