I received this Algae Enzyme Cleansing Oil from Mara in exchange for my honest review. I have dry combination skin that tends to be very dry during fall and winter months. This cleansing oil feels gentle on my skin and cleanses it completely without leaving behind any residue. I have been using it as a single cleanse if not wearing makeup or as the first step in a double cleanse when I have been wearing makeup. It has a lightweight texture and light scent. My skin feels silky and cleansed after using and I have had fewer dry and flaky patches while using this cleansing oil. I will definitely keep this as part of my regular skincare rotation. nan
