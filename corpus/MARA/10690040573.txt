I just love the luxurious look of the packaging. I love using this oil for my combination to dry skin. It really makes my dry skin feel softer, smoother and hydrated. It gives my skin a nice glowing finish. After cleaning and toning my skin, I just use a few drops of the oil to cover my whole face and neck and massage it into my skin. It goes on so smoothly and it removes my makeup and any dirt effortlessly. It makes my skin feel silky soft and feels very lightweight on my skin without leaving a greasy residue. A beautiful non greasy oil that adds a nice boost of hydration to my skin. Feels so hydrating
