This cleansing oil is great. It was able to remove my full face of makeup I wore for my office holiday party, with waterproof mascara involved. It does a good job with just a few pumps, so no need to do a second round. My skin felt really clean and  soft after, only needed to use a drop of my face wash to complete the cleansing routine Removes stubborn makeup well
