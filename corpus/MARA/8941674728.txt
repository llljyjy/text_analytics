This is a beautiful facial oil. I love a good oil as the last step in my night time skincare routine for achieving glowy, plump skin.This oil absorbs quickly and doesnâ€™t leave a greasy residue. It leaves my skin soft, nourished, dewy and healthier looking overall. It also works great right before a facial massage! I have been using this product every night and I highly recommend it!Also, the bottle is beautifully designed, feels and looks high quality and looks great on my vanity! The dropper works really well to dispense the right amount of product (2-3 drops are enough) Glowy and plump skin!
