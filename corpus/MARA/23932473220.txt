I have been using the Sea Kale Sunscreen Serum by MARA. I usually apply vitamin C prior to putting on sunscreen since that has added benefits, so when I saw that this serum already contains vitamin C I was happy to skip this step in my routine. It also contains other beneficial and clean ingredients which is great. Initially it smells like a green juice and I was surprised at first, but I didn’t mind it is since was an invigorating scent and faded anyway. It goes on like a light oil serum and once I patted it on, there wasn’t white cast. I was left with very hydrated skin that had a natural looking dewiness. This is perfect for the winter months. I don’t need to apply a moisturizer with it. With this one product I have a moisturizer, vitamin c serum and an spf! nan
