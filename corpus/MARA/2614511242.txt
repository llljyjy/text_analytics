THE BEST CLEANSING OIL EVER!! Seriously! It removes makeup, sunscreen, dirt really well. I love how soft my skin feels after because of the gentle exfoliation. It is also hydrating on the skin. It really will remove all the gunk off your face and actually clean your face. I donâ€™t feel any irritation and love how this cleansing oil made my skin feel. It feels so luxurious, so good! nan
