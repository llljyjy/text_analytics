This Mara brand is new to me and was excited to try this acid serum out. I’m not new to acids and actually love the effects of it on my skin. This Mara flower acid algae serum was effective at smoothing out my textures. It didn’t irritate my skin even with 11% acid. I love that it also has anti-aging effects and helps with dullness. The price is a little on the high side for a serum. Great acid serum
