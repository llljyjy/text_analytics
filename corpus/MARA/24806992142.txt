I usually apply this oil in my PM routine, it is quickly absorbs and greasiness disappears in the first minutes after application. In the morning, when I look at myself in the mirror, my mood instantly rises from the result - the skin is tender, with a slight glow and perfectly hydrated!And also, I use this facial oil for “guasha“ massage. It has a pleasant natural smell, without chemicals, as for me, this fragrance promotes relaxation. I am very glad that I got acquainted with the MARA brand and its wonderful universal facial oil! I’m in love!!
