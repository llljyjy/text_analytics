This cleansing oil has been the gift that keeps in giving. It’s the easiest way to remove my makeup, it’s not harsh, plus it’s like a two in one, it completely removed all my makeup and also served as a cleanser that left my skin feeling and looking clean and hydrated, you can see the glow. Another thing that I loved was the ingredients that are in here, it’s got fruit enzymes, my favorite being chia and moringa-which is so good for the skin! I’m definitely obsessed! The only way to effectively remove makeup!
