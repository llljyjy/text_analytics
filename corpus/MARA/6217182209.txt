This is the creamiest clay mask that I have ever used. Also the first one to leave my face feeling so soft, moisturized and not dry.Unlike other clay masks, this one doesn’t fully dry out and crack like other masks do, so I consider it a gentle clay mask… gentle enough for sensitive skin types.After about 15 minutes or so, I removed  it with warm water without any difficulty whatsoever.I put on makeup after and wow, my skin looked amazing and i know that this mask contributed to that result. Definitely recommend trying it out for yourself nan
