Honestly, I’m very impressed with results after starting to use Mara serum. I’m mom of two little kids and unfortunately I don’t have time to take care of myself as I would like to. But Mara’s serum really surprised me. It makes my skin hydrated , smoother and brighter. I have like a baby  skin after I apply it. Serum absorbs very fast, no sticky feelings, and it doesn’t clog pores , enough one drop for all face, so it’s very economical using. I love natural ingredients in it, (and it’s vegan!) Very lovely bottle design. Definitely my new favorite serum now Mara serum just amazing
