This is my first time trying this brand and I am really IMPRESSED! The packaging is beautiful and luxurious! The cleansing oil itself is amazing and it did removed all my makeup leaving my skin feel so soft and hydrated. It isnâ€™t sticky or oily but gel like cleanser and melts away every thing, I am obsessed with this and buying again ofcourse. So good!
