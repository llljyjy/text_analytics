This is a fan favorite for a reason! I love this cleansing oil so much - it really does the trick! I’ve never tried a cleansing oil or even doubled cleansed and I think that really is key to having clear skin! Mara’s cleansing oil is gentle on the skin but really does melt away dirt and takes off makeup so much easier. WOW! Well Worth The Money!
