I wasn’t sure how well an oil could clean my skin and remove ALL my makeup at the same time, but I was pleasantly surprised! Not only did it do that, it did it effortlessly and left my skin softer and over time, more hydrated than any other cleanser I’ve used. My skin definitely has a glow about it, all thanks to this gorgeous gem! On top of being a superior cleanser and gentle exfoliator, it is also a clean product which means it’s safe for me and my entire family too. Job well done MARA!! Absolutely Superb!
