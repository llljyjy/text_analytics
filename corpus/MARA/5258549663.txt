I am SO impressed with this cleansing oil. Packaging and formula are absolutely stunning. It’s such a lightweight oil that seamlessly removed my makeup without needing vigorous rubbing. As someone with dry skin, I appreciated how this didn’t strip my skin after it removed my makeup. It just took everything off leaving my skin super smooth for the rest of my skincare routine! Highly recommend! nan
