This cleansing oil is so incredibly luxurious and it is honestly one of best ones I have ever tried! I have tried many cleaning oils and it is my makeup remover and cleanser of choice but the texture and effectiveness of this formula is superior! First of all, it had a very lightweight texture and you don’t need that much of it. It’s very gentle and works very quickly to breakdown stubborn makeup, like mascara. I find that unlike other ones I’ve tried, this one actually doesn’t leave any remnants of makeup or a residue on the skin. I still like to cleanse afterwards but I feel like this oil gets every little bit off my face! It doesn’t smell funny and it doesn’t clog my skin. This is honestly the ideal cleansing oil and it definitely one I’ll be buying I’ve rand over in the future! Best cleansing oil I’ve tried!
