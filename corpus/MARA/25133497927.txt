I recently received the MARA Algae Retinol Face Oil, and I am absolutely loving it! It has a beautiful, lightweight texture that glides on my skin and absorbs quickly. I love the fact that it is vegan, cruelty-free and the packaging is recyclable. After using it for a few days, I can already see a noticeable difference in my skinâ€™s texture and tone. Highly recommend! nan
