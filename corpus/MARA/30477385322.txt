First off, I do want to point out that this product is an OIL. I didn’t realize that at first, as the name just indicates that it’s a serum. Though the description does state that it’s an oil SPF. I don’t dislike that it’s an oil, but I use it much differently than I would use a serum. For me, oils do not work under makeup, so this is definitely more of a bare/fresh-faced product like for going to the beach. I love that it is reef safe and has some lovely skincare ingredients like blue sea kale, algae, and moringa. The packaging is beautiful, but the product is such a thin liquid that it flies all over if you don’t cover the top with your finger while shaking the bottle. It has a really light scent that smells fresh, almost cucumber-y. nan
