This is a must have facial oil. I like how my skin looks glowy, dewy and hydrated. The formula feels really nice on the skin, a small amount goes a long way and it applies effortlessly. I apply it day and night and i also like adding a few drops on my foundation on makeup days and my makeup just looks so good and beautiful. I would recommend it for its performance and results. Love
