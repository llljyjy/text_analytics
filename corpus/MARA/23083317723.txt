I love this serum! I canâ€™t believe how it is transforming my skin. At first I did experience a few breakouts but my skin has adjusted nicely to this product. The overall texture of my skin is better and a touch more youthful looking. Dark spots that I thought I would have to live with forever are actually lightening--I even have one that is just barely visible now. The dark shadows under my eyes are slowly improving some. It is so nice and reassuring to see the changes taking place and that I can have improvements like this. I did receive my first bottle as a gift from Mara and TheGoodFaceProject to review after seeing how good it works this is a product I will purchase and continue to use on a regular basis. I am actually seeing results
