First, the most beautiful packaging that I have ever seen. So perfectly detailed makes me want to go to the beach right away. I’ve been using fit for a little while and already love how it makes my skin feel. It has given a natural glow that I never get during the winter and reduced the redness that insist to appear at this time of the year. Since it’s an oil-based serum, it has been the perfect addition for deep hydration. nan
