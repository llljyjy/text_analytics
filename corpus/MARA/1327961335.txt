My skin has been so sensitive and dry lately that exfoliating  cleansers have actually been making my skin hurt, but this cleansing is so so gentle! I really like to put it on my dry skin and let it sit while I brush my teeth before I rinse it off, and my face feels so clean and soft.  The texture of the oil feels so lux and I love the powerhouse ingredient list.  Iâ€™ve been looking forward to trying this skincare line for some time now, and it lives up to the hype.  Soooo lovely! Great for sensitive skin
