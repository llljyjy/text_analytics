Truly the most luxurious vitamin c I’ve ever tried and with reason! Packaging is stunning, the product melts beautifully on my skin and leave a nice glow. Works well with my other skincare products and doesn’t leave my skin feeling oily. Now the price is a bit up there but honestly I do love it! Woahh
