I am really into oil cleansers lately but I still need an exfoliator from time to time and I love that this cleanser does both! it comes in a dark, elegant glass bottle and uses a fruit enzyme blend to brighten and smooth baby smooth your skin. This cleanser also includes Chia to help hydrate,  moringa, which is a miracle superfood with over 90 nutrients, and 46 antioxidants, and almost all of the alphabet and vitamins, as well as Spirina + kelp to help cleanse the way dirt from the day. This has to be one of my car orbite cleansers of the moment. Favorite cleanser
