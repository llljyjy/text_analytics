This Sunscreen serum is more of an oil than a serum. It settles into the skin pretty easily and doesnâ€™t leave a sticky finish. However, it is so liquidy that it gets everywhere.  There is no whitecast or pilling even under makeup. It has a slight scent but nothing too strong. The finish of this is glowy without looking too heavy. nan
