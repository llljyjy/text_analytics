Wow! I’m super impressed with the Algae Retinol Oil! It has fermented green tea, wild Algae and 1.2% retinol which helps my skin look and feel super soft and nourished. It transformed my dull dry skin to radiant, glowing skin! This oil is a powerhouse of antioxidants! Even with high percent of retinol it is perfectly gentle enough even for beginners! Can’t wait to see my long term results Fantastic retinol oil
