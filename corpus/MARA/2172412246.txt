I used to be so hesitant about all of the different oil cleansers out there because growing up putting oil on your face was always a bad idea. However, after going to the dermatologist and learning that you need to actually double wash your skin because most cleansers, don’t get everything off of your face, except for oil cleansers I became obsessed with this product! I love how the product doesn’t actually strip your skin, and it actually nourishes your skin well also removing all of the impurities and makeup you’ve added to your skin throughout the day. I highly recommend this product! nan
