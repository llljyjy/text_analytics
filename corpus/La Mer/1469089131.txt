This a great base for my skincare. The watery lotion absorbs quickly into my skin. My skin feels hydrated and looks plump. It is a great prep for my makeup routine. I use it in the morning after my shower or after cleansing before I put any other skincare. It feels fresh and cool on my skin and has a subtle clean scent. I would definitely recommend this lotion.
