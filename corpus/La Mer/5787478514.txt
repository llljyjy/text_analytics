Wow! This eye cream is so amazing!!!! The formula is so great. A little goes a LONG way! It’s like a medium thickness and absorbs into skin immediately. It smells lightly of cucumbers (it smells so good). I’ve been testing it out for 2 weeks and I’ve already noticed an improvement with my dark circles. My new favorite eye cream!
