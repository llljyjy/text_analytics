Thank you very much for this present. I’ve enjoyed using and testing this product. The packaging is beautiful, with a velvet pouch included, and the product has left my skin feeling smooth and glowing. This product is absolutely worth it because I’ve seen results in my skin barrier improving and my acne clearing up. This is a pricey item, but it is well worth it. nan
