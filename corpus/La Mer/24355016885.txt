Love this so much. I use it after I cleanse and before my moisturizer. The consistency when you first apply it is kind of sticky but as soon as it absorbs it feels like you have nothing on your face but your skin feels so soft and hydrated. I get tons of compliments on my skin since I started using it. My skin loves it
