The La Mer treatment lotion is a must in my beauty regimen. I use it after cleansing morning and night in place of a toner. The texture is smooth and not runny so it goes on easily without losing product. I apply it directly onto my finger tips and then pat it around my face, especially the areas where I see the most signs of aging (pillow wrinkles are my nemesis). I donâ€™t know what kind of magic is in this little bottle, but after only 2 weeks of use I am already seeing those lines diminished in the mornings when I would notice them most! Hydrates, plumps, and reduces wrinkles!
