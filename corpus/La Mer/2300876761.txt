I was shocked by the consistency of this product. It’s really light weight and thin. That isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it does make it easier to waste product so you just have to be careful. A little goes a long way. Overall, this eye cream if amazing though and hydrates my under eyes like no other. The price is insane so I’m not sure if it’s something I will purchase, but I’ll enjoy it while it lasts. Lives up to the hype
