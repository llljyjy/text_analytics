I have oily combination skin. Recieved this as a generous gift and really wanted to love it but I broke out every single time I used it and had to use differin in it right away. It has that silicone texture and I feel like it just clogged my pores and didnâ€™t let it breath. Would not suggest for oily skin. Bad for acne prone skin
