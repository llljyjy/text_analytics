So this serum is so beautiful! Love the consistency of this it’s so light weight and smells nice! It leaves my skin smooth and hydrated! I wake up to a glowy skin! But i only received i sample size to try so I didn’t see any difference in my skin appearance as I believe skincare products should be tested longer! Overall I love it even if it’s so pricey but i am tempted to buy this Beautiful serum
