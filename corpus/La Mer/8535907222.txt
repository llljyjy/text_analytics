Got this in the mail today. I usually don’t get my LM from Sephora as it tends to arrive frozen, however with the spring weather and sale I took a chance. It arrived 2 days after ordering, very quick. My only grip, which isn’t Sephoras fault, is that this set didn’t come with the spatulas the La Mer creams normally do - nota huge issue I can just buy some but for $475 La Mer I expect spatulas. nan
