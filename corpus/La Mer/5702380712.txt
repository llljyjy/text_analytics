To me the con isn’t a price. You are getting what you’re paying for with this one. And you’re not buying this unless you have the $$$ to spare so Im not taking stars off for it being expensive. Luxury packaging, luxury brand,  and a great product. My lips feel hydrated for about 48 hours after the smallest dab of this on the lips, and it has a pleasant tingling sensation as well. The best lip balm, feels like a mask
