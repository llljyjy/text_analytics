I was kinda disappointed seeing how small the jar is but upon application I saw how little product you actually need.  A little bit of product goes a VERY long way. I took the tiniest amount and it covered not just my undereyes but also my eyelids, inner corners, and outer corners for both eyes. So one jar will last you FOREVER. Product feels nice and smooth. Only thing is it smells funny, but that’s good that there’s no fragrance. Only time will tell with long term results. nan
