I love a good matte lotion especially in the summer when my t zone gets real oily. This is great product does exactly what it says it does. It doesn’t vreak my sensitive acne prone skin out. Now would I repurchase this product no way. It’s very overpriced. U cab get the same results from a product thats way cheaper. Not worth the price
