This is my first lotion from LaMer and I must say that its absolutely wonderful. It feels sooooo good that make me feel better about the price. LOL. The skin looks so hidrated after the firts use that its practically magic. it absorves really fast and you can continue with your make up almost inmediately. The texture is also fantastic. I use it after cleansing and after my serum. Really worth it. soooo fabulous
