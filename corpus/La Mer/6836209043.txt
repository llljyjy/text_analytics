This product retains a watery texture that has a slight oily feeling…making  it feels more like a toner.  It is non greasy, absorbs quickly, controls the oily areas,  and is delicately scented. I’ve some dry patches and blemishes on my chin due hormonal acne and it completely hydrated them!!I got a matte finish that was also radiant!!I love the packaging as it is quite stunning in its presentation.  And yes, I’m also stoked that it  comes with a cute little velvet bag. I was kindly gifted with a sample of the product in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using this product for only two weeks so I couldn’t evaluate any long term results. However, I found it to be an excellent light hydrating lotion and definitely worth the hype. I got a matte finish that was also radiant!!
