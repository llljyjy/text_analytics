This product hands down is the best!  I used this in my 20’s, at that time I really did not need it, it’s very rich and moisturizing cream.  I purchased it again about a month ago, tried so many different night creams that did not help.  I have combo skin and it’s very sensitive this is the best, when I wake up my skin is so soft, no redness, I also have rosacea.  I sleep on my side and always woke up creases around that eye, no longer have that!  It’s expensive but I’ve spent so much on others that did not help. The best for night use
