Oh how I love La mer products. Been a fan for many, many years and for me I think the hefty price tag is definitely worth it. This lotion is meant to be used right after cleansing and before any serums and I love using it this way. It has a watery consistency but goes on very smoothly dries down fast and it never feels tacky on the skin. I have definitely noticed that my skin is less irritated and the redness is almost gone after using this product regularly. I know itâ€™s a hefty price tag but a little bit goes a long way and this will last a long time. I will be re-purchasing the full size. La Mer never disappoints
