I tried out the La Mer Treatment Lotion directly after cleansing.  It has the luxurious La Mer fragrance that reminds me of a high end department store, and the texture it so nice and thin, it sinks right into the skin.  My skin drinks this product right up, and I love that I can continue on with the next skincare product in my nightly routine without having to wait.  My skin feels plumped and hydrated instantly! A luxury plumping and hydrating treatment
