I found the texture to be much lighter than expected - which for me (having oily skin) is a good thing, as I often end up getting ’milia’ under my eyes with rich or heavy eye creams. I loved the sensation of applying with the applicator each morning as it felt cooling (especially if left in the refrigerator for a few minutes prior). The ingredients list reads like a who’s who of the botanical world, as do practically all LM products, and being an eye cream I found little to no discernable fragrance in it. Did I notice any difference during my time of applying this? Not really. There was a definite increase in hydration, especially directly under my eyes, but not much in terms of brightening or fine line reduction over time. I liked this as an adequate/average eye cream but it’s not something I would go out and re-purchase.~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~(My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)1.
