La Mer Treatment Lotion was my go to before Iâ€™ve shared skincare in social media. I had oily acne prone skin and for years, I had tried many acne products until I started using this treatment lotion. It is very watery and its well known Miracle Broth that is super soothing and hydrating.  I have used many bottles and happy to receive this little sample size. it is so cute and I am saving it for my next trip. La Mer Treatment Lotion
