I loveeeeeeee this moisturizer. I have oily and acne prone skin, and this moisturizer is simply amazing! I have been using this moisturizer for about 2-3 months, and lately, I have been getting so many compliments that my face looks so much clearer and even younger. Its definitely more hydrated (and I never previously liked moisturizers because I have oily skin and I felt like all moisturizers made me break out so I always avoided them). I bought the small one only to see if I’ll like it because it is a bit pricy, but with the results I am getting, it’s definitely worth it! The moisturizer not only smells amazing but also feels so refreshing! Definitely purchasing the large bottle next time! Also, a little goes a long way! I love this!
