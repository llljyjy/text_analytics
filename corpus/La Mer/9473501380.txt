I absolutely LOVE La Mer products. The Treatment Lotion isnâ€™t truly a lotion though. It is more of an essence. It preps skin for serum and moisturizer. It is lightweight and not greasy at all. It does have the trademark La Mer scent to it which I really enjoy. I definitely recommend this. My skin just feels better when I use it. I feel like my products absorb better. nan
