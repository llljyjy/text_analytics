This was a unexpected, but nice lotion. It feels Davy, silky and luxurious. I didn’t expect it to be so watery, but it felt good on my skin and a little went a long way which I appreciate because this is a pricey product! If I wasn’t sent this to review I probably wouldn’t buy it myself only because of the price tag, not the lotion. A nice consistency
