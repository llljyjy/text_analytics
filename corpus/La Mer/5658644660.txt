Iâ€™ve always struggled with finding matte moisturizers suitable for my combo skin, as I either find them not moisturizing enough or not matte enough. This product erased both of those concerns. It is moisturizing but keeps the oil around my tzone at bay. While I do need to reapply powder after 6 or so hours, I definitely notice it keeps my tzone matte for much longer than other comparable products I have tested in the past. Perfectly matte and combo skin friendly
