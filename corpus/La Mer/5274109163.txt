La mera gave me for free a sample of the treatment lotion. Love it’s it’s super lightweight. Overall has no type of scent but does feel fresh and smells like you showed if it makes sense. It does feel sticky at first but it goes away once melted into the skin. I love it!! My skin feels super hydrated. Love it
