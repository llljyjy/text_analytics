Was skeptical, weary of the price point, but read 1 Review which especially caught me eye. Having a particular health issue which causes excessive eye puffiness, I purchased based on someone elseâ€™s comment that nothing really helped her in the past, except this one. This product most definitely has helped me, and I was spending about the same amount in other eye products. This does dry me out somewhat, having to add back additional hyaluronic acid, however the puffiness is greatly reduced. Helps with certain health issues
