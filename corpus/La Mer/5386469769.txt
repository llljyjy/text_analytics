I was NOT expecting to love this moisturizer as much as I do. I received Creme de la Mer as a special holiday gift from my parents, since they know my skincare tastes are typically more budget friendly. I have normal to combo skin with the occasional breakout, but I love a glowy, moisturized base. Even though I will feel the pain of repurchasing it, I’m going to do it because my skin has never looked more glowy and healthy than when I use this creme. If you do choose to purchase this creme, PLEASE read the directions! This is a really thick creme that needs to be activated in your fingertips before applying. Once you activate the creme, it literally melts into your skin, giving you a fantastic glow. I’m only giving this product 4/5 stars just because the price is absolutely ridiculous... even though I’m going to pay it because of the results! Heaven for glowy normal to combo skin
