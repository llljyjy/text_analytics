Iâ€™ve always wanted to try their product. I finally decided to use their sample set that I received for rouge. The cream is very thick and it does feel very moisturizing so I was very hopeful. Much time my surprise the next day my face felt and looked so dry that I had to put moisturizer on just to do my morning routine before I got ready for my day. Very disappointing. Glad I got to try it out before I made the purchase. dried me out in the morning
