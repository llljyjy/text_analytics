This lotion feels very luxurious in texture and has a lovely scent that isn’t overpowering. It absorbs into the skin beautifully but does leave a dewy shine to the skin after application. I found that for my combination skin, it didn’t provide enough hydration to last me through the entire day. This might be better for skin types who lean more oily. I also personally could never justify spending this much money on a moisturizer when there are so many cheaper alternatives. Not impressed for the price
