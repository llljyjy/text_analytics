I was really hoping this lotion was just extremely overpriced moisturizer but it’s actually amazing for my oily skin. It even accounts for any facial oils in my skincare routine and, without looking dry, leaves me with perfectly matte skin all day/night. Has a very light scent. I’d say it’s worth it if you can afford to incorporate it into your daily routine. If not, I wouldn’t break the bank for it; although it is also perfect for special occasions applying it feels SO good
