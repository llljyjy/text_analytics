The quality you would expect from La Mer. Silky consistency, absorbs instantly, looks beautiful under your moisturizer and under your makeup. I received a deluxe sample so I can’t comment about the full size packaging, but the sample had an open lid that I disliked because it doesn’t allow you to easily control how much your pour and therefore product is wasted. This product was easy to incorporate into my skincare regime; I use it directly after cleansing. La Mer Quality
