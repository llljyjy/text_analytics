This moisturizing matte lotion from La Mer is super lightweight and is great for my combination skin. I tend to get oily in the t zone, so that’s where I concentrated this product when I applied it underneath makeup. While it’s definitely on the pricier side, a little does go a very long way, so I think this can last you for a long time! nan
