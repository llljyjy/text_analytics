I have used La mer products before and This treatment lotion is another great product which makes my skin so hydrated and soft ! I use it after washing my face and then apply moisturizer on top of it! A little goes a long way, this lotion is not watery its thicker in consistency and gets absorbed without any sticky or oily feel ! hydrating and moisturizing
