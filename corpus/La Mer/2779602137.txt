I had used the La Mer cream once years before, when I worked at Nordstrom because I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Unfortunately it was too heavy, and made my skin break out. So I was interested to see if the new matte lotion was going to be a better option for my oily-combo skin. It was! I was super surprised how nice the texture was, with the signature La Mer scent. (The fragrance may also have been what broke my skin out, but it didn’t affect my skin at all with the lotion.) The matte lotion absorbs so easily and quickly, and left my skin so soft. No breakouts or irritated skin, so if you’re a fan of La Mer or have the money, it’s a great option for oiler types! The tiniest amount is all you need!
