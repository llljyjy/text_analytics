This physical exfoliant is one of the most underrated products on the market. I have a love-hate relationship with how amazing La Mer skincare is—obv because of the price. This product is the key to baby soft skin and is worth every penny. It’s gentle and nourishing on my sensitive skin, replenishing my skin with those delicious oils while polishing the upper layers. A little goes a long way. I just turned 30 and this is not something I would have used or enjoyed in my 20s; however, I know this is going to be a staple in my routine going forward as moisture and cell renewal becomes more important as my skin matures. If you’re on the fence, try a sample on your hand in-store and feel how incredible your hand feels for the rest of the day… now imagine that for your face! You’re welcome. Buyer beware: the scent isn’t pleasant, but it’s also not bad. It’s a natural, herbaceous kind of smell. Also, the tube will most likely leak on your first use, so be ready to catch those precious golden oils ;) Why doesn’t this product have more hype?!
