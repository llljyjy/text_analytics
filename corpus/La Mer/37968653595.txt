I received this product complimentary from La Mer in exchange for my honest review. I have some fine lines and dark circles around my eyes. This eye cream does make the skin around my eyes appear to be smoother. The texture is pretty lightweight, and I would say a little goes a long way. I use my ring fingers to pat around until it is fully absorbed. It does give the skin a quick hydration. Hydration is the key for anti-aging. I hope with longer usage of this eye cream, it will prevent my fine lines continue to spread out. I see a little bit of improvement to my dark circles, it may take some time to see more of the brightening effect. So far so good
