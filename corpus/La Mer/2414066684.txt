Now that the weather is beginning to get warmer here in Texas, my skincare products start to change too. I have very dry skin so I need a product that will deliver hydration to jumpstart my skincare routine. I have been using the New Treatment Lotion by La Mer after I cleanse my face. I use a dropper to apply a few drops into my hand and gently press into the skin. You can also use a cotton round. It feels like a very thin serum, almost water like, yet it has a velvety feel to it when applied and massaged into the skin. I follow up with eye cream, serums, and moisturizer which leaves my skin plump and hydrated. It’s the perfect base for when I apply makeup or for the days I don’t wear any. Perfect Base for Dry Skin
