I was extremely skeptical of this it really does look like water but has some what it a serum feel to it I donâ€™t know how to explain it but it was hydrating and felt nice I used this during the day, I noticed that applying any other skincare item on top make it all crumbly ar least in my case my fave also felt wired after that This is something I would probably use at night before I go to bed due to using less skincare products Interesting product
