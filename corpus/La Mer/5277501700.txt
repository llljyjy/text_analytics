I have recently added the La Mer The Lotion into my nightly skincare routine.  I cleanser, apply The Lotion & then warm the Cr√®me de La Mer moisturizer cream between my hands & press into my skin.  The Lotion feels lightweight, but very hydrating. Sinks into the skin & gives it a nice glow. Add the moisturizing cream, and you a a great moisturizer duo!  Of course La Mer products are very expensive. But if you have the disposable income, they are lovely. High end skincare that works
