Iâ€™m very picky when it comes to moisturizers. My skin is usually stripped dry due to the weather, the retinols I use and as we age our skin gets dryer. I did like this moisturizer, it was very stain like, smooth to touch and the smell of it was amazing (but not good for your skin). My skin felt hydrated and normal but although I did love the fragrance as an Esthetician I do not care for harsh fragrances and alcohols. It's okay but not worth the splurge
