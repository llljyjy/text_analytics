Love this eye cream! So rich and creamy and luxurious. A little does go a long way - just a rice grain size is enough for both eyes - just tap your two fingers together and apply! I haven’t noticed dark circles disappearing but that may be because I don’t particularly suffer from very dark under eye circles. nan
