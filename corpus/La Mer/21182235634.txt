I am in love with this location! I received it as a sample but I love it so much that I purchased the full size lotion and their serum. After only three uses I could see the difference - my face was so soft and hydrated, honestly it is expensive but I think it is worth it. The consistency is great not too oily but enough that hydrated your skin and absorbs very well. My skin feels great using this product and it will definitely be part of my skincare routine. Absolutely amazing lotion!
