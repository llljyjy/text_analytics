This lotion from La Mer is my new favorite. The consistency is quite watery so I would describe it more of an “essence”, which is less watery than a toner but not quite a serum either, an in-between step of sorts. Anyways, the texture is rich and luxuriously silky. I feel that I get ample hydration and moisture using this as one of my first skincare steps after cleansing. Pair it with a nice serum and moisturizer and you’re good to go! nan
