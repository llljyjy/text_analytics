This is one of my favorite La Mer products! My skincare routine is not complete without this! Applied before serum and moisturizer, it preps my skin so it can absorb other products better. It’s lightweight and not greasy at all. It keeps my skin hydrated. It’s pricey but definitely worth it! Must have!
