Love this product even though the price tag is hefty. This is a liquid and I use this before I put on serums and moisturizers and I feel like this product did such a nice job prepping my skin and helps make the rest of my skincare feel more effective. My skin does feel plumper and softer after about a week of use. Beautiful Product
