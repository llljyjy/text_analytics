It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and leaves you feeling like there’s nothing there. And after only about 3 days of use, I was shocked to see a lasting difference in the appearance of my laugh lines and crow’s feet; the skin looks smoother, plumper and less dried-out.Previous moisturizers either hydrated but made me break out, or just didn’t hydrate enough. But one does it all!Highly recommend. nan
