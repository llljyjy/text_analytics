This product definitely surprised me due to the way it looks & the consistency which looks like water. It melts away on your skin like water.  Could definitely feel the glycerin lingering in a good way, leaving a smooth, satin finish. Skin feels hydrated & plump.! Could definitely do a version without the fragrance, it was a little heavy handed for me personally. Will definitely surprise you.!
