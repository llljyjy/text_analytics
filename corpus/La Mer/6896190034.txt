I have been using the La Mer Treatment Lotion after cleansing for a week now. It has a watery toner like texture. I apply a few drops and pat it into my skin. It then provides a smooth canvas for my serums and moisturizer. I feel it adds a touch of hydration to my skin other than that I havenâ€™t noticed any change as compared to my regular toner. It feels good on the skin but am not yet convinced to get the full size. Hydrating
