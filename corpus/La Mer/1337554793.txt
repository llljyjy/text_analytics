Years ago, I tried the La Mer eye concentrate. I broke out in a bumpy rash under my eyes and never used it again. I’ve used the Creme and cushion compact makeup with no issue, but the Concentrate caused a severe allergic reaction the night before last. It’s worth noting that I’ve never had an allergic reaction to any skin product other than the Eye Concentrate and this Concentrate. It started with the tiny bumps around my eyelids during the day, then I woke up in the middle of the night to my eyes nearly swollen shut, face swollen, and a red rash of tiny bumps all over my face. Yesterday I was swollen, red, and my skin hurt to the touch. I’ve read other reviews of this happening to people with this product, due to a preservative that’s used and a known common allergen. Please beware if trying this product for the first time. I was afraid I needed to go to the ER, I’ve never had a reaction like this in my life. My swelling is better today but my face is still covered in a rash, I’ve been popping Benadryl every few hours, icing my painful face, and applying hydrocortisone. If this product works for you, great, but be aware that it’s full of chemical ingredients that are known to be harmful. Bad Allergic Reaction
