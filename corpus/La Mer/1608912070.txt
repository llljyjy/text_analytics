I love this brand overall.  The scent is so nice and light, smells so good.  Super light lotion that makes my skin feel really soft, and has a nice matting so that I can still use makeup over it.  Doesn’t feel greasy or tacky like other have.  Love it, but I don’t know if I could afford to keep purchasing. Good but pricey!
