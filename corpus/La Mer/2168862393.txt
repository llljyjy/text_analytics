Of all of La Mer’s products I’ve tried so far, this was my favorite. I used this like an essence treatment to prep my skin for absorbing my products. By itself it made my skin feel a little tight, so if you have dry skin, use it as an essence. If you have oily skin, this would likely be very balancing for sebum and may even be enough moisture on its’ own. I also have extremely sensitized skin, so this mostly passed my sensitive skin test but not completely. If you have normal or slightly sensitive skin this is a winner! Definitely seemed to help my skin barrier and deceased my sensitivity over time. Overall I really liked this product and would get again to use as an essence. If I were using it as a moisturizer I think it’d be too expensive since I would need more product. This little bottle will last me forever! We’ll worth the price tag. Great essence for dry skin
