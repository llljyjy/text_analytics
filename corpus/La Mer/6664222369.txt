Love at first use.  I have been using La Mer Treatment Lotion for years and was so excited to try the new formula.   La Mer took what was great and made it better.  The new formula feels slightly thicker and more hydrating.  I absolutely love this new formula, it is so nice.  I use this morning and night right after my toner.  I add my serums and moisturizer on top and I have never had a problem.  It works well with other skincare products.  Iâ€™m so happy I was able to try this. Love the new formula!!
