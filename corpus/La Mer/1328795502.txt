I love this so much! I use this right after cleansing my face as a two in one for toner & essence/ serum and it leaves my face feeling so hydrated! It is so silky smoothing and you only need the tiniest amount on your face.  As for other benefits such a fine lines/ wrinkles, I think you would have to go through an entire full sized bottle to see a difference. This is a really nice product, but the price tag is very steep Love this treatment lotion
