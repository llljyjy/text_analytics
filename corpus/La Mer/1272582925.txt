I’m a fan of La Mer products.  I’ve tried this product several different ways based on the reviews.  I found using it night and leaving it on worked best for me.  It didn’t lift and firm my face or neck, but skin was soft and moisturized without being greasy.  If you don’t like the regular la mer cream due to it being too greasy…. I would recommend this product in lieu of and simply use this as an over night moisturizer. Better as a moisturizer than a lifting mask.
