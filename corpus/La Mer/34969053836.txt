I was thrilled to find this treatment lotion in a smaller size to sample - I’ve long wanted to try La Mer to see how it compares to my favorite Kbeauty toners. As a toner “addict” (I own over a hundred, believe it or not), I have tried many different kinds, & this does rate in the top tier. Here’s why:Despite the watery texture, this provides a deep hydration that’s more comparable to a thicker essence or serum. I normally follow the Korean 7-skin method, patting in 7 layers of toner right after each other, but using this, I only needed 2 layers to achieve the same level of hydration & plumpness I normally get from 7 layers of hydrating toner. I love that it contains algae & other marine extracts, which are so good for the skin. Would I repurchase? Probably not, due only to the high price. If money were no object, absolutely I’d repurchase. However, I do have other toners that achieve a comparable result for a much lower cost. It is definitely worth a try, especially if you get pleasure out of owning a luxury product. Excellent toner for deep hydration
