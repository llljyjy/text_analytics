I’ve been using this treatment lotion for the past few days as my second step after cleansing my face. It has a light watery-lotion like texture which I really enjoy. My skin is oily yet dehydrated so my skin drinks this right up! As much as I love the sound of the key ingredients and how hydrated it has been leaving my skin, I’m just not yet convinced if I would splurge on this in the full size. I do like it, but I’m not so sure I love it enough to justify the price point yet-especially when there are others I’ve liked more for less. Undecided, like it but not in love
