This is the second La Mer product I  have  ever used and I  LOVE! I La Mer is a brand that has some great products and product reviews but I am still always skeptical. First thing, I immediately fell in love with the consistency of the LaMer Treatment Lotion. Its not thick or greasy. It is a super lightweight cream that quickly absorbs and treats. Since using this, my skin texture and elasticity has  improved, and even the redness from my rosace has diminished and faded a bit more. I feel that my skin texture has improved  and honestly,  I would love to see the results while using maybe their Soft Cream. I use my La Mer Treatment  Lotion after cleansing and toning  my skin and before  makeup. As I  said, the texture is so silky smooth....it glides on.  This wears great under makeup, and actually helps my makeup look better. Highly Recommende My Second La Mer Product and I am convinced!
