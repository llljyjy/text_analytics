I’ve always heard such great things about this eye cream, and it definitely lives up to the hype and I can see why it’s so luxurious. A little goes a long way with this, as it’s so creamy and spreads well. So you can really make the small jar last a while. With usage, I felt that this was great at targeting my dark circles and keeping my under eyes hydrated to reduce the appearance of fine lines. I’ll admit the price tag is off putting but if you’re looking to make an investment for your skin this is a good one! nan
