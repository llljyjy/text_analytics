I’ve been using this product for about a week and I am blown away. There is no real scent which is nice and I love the texture. It’s light, but not watery, gel like but not heavy. This allows the products to stick to skin + penetrate. I use morning + night after cleansing and have noticed how my products that follow absorb so much better. My skin feels very hydrated after and I noticed more suppleness. There’s also been a difference in my pores as well as firmness. Overall I would definitely buy this product and continue to use in my skincare regimen. If you’ve been on the fence, I would take the plunge and make the investment. Your skin will thank you .
