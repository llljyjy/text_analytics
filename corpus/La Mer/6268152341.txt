This has a very light serum/lotion hybrid texture. The floral scent is lovely and not too strong and it delivers a nice shot of moisture to my skin. I received a small sample bottle to test so I canâ€™t comment on the long term results but the application feels very luxe and it sinks into my skin well! nan
