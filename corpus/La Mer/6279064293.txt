This moisturizer is very light weight! A watery cream consistency. Very lightly scented. It has a slightly fresh powdery smell. Itâ€™s mattifying when my skin is oily but also hydrating. A little product covers the surface area of my face. Approximately a pea sized drop on each check and forehead does the trick. No sticky or greasy finish! Great for oily skin!
