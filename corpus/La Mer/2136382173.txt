I love the smooth texture and you only need a small amount to cover your target area. It smells OK…I actually expected more of a scent from La Mer but it’s a barely there powdery-lime. I didn’t notice any cooling effect besides on first application—which many gels can do. It just isn’t a ‘gel’ as you’re expecting, it’s rich and creamy. It definitely is NOT a day cream for me. It pills under makeup and I’m not sure what ingredients do this but it is better as a night cream…I even use it in my under eye area and it’s comfortable. I notice a nice glow, but this feels like a weak serum rather than a gel or cream to me. It’s totally La Mer, so you’re paying for the price. I would rather stick to the OG cream. I don’t have a need for cooling in my routine..it’s a spa/night time vibe. Creamy Cool
