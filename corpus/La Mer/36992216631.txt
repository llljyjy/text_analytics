This product definitely looks expensive but I am not sure if it will deliver on diminishing dark circles and lines. When I applied it, it had a great cooling feeling on my skin. A little bit of the product went a long way so I’m sure it will last long. My skin felt very moisturized after using it and continued to feel that way for the few days I used it. This product should help with dark circles but I’m sure continued use is needed to see results there. I only used it for a few days. nan
