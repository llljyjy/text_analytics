This moisturizer is very luxurious. It has a nice lightweight  texture, its very hydrating, and goes on well . It makes my face feel soft and moisturized. I canâ€™t say if its worth the crazy price though, as you can get similar results with another good moisturizer. Overall, a little goes a long way and it does keep your skin soft and hydrated so if you can afford it, this would be a good choice as a winter moisturizer! Feels nice but pricey
