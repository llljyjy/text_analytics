After cleansing, I apply this before any serums and moisturizers. I cannot stress enough how this lotion is NOT a substitute for your moisturizer. It is very light weight, and non-greasy. It’s sort of ‘preps’ your skin to be able to better react to moisturizers and serum s, than just applying them alone. I apply this to a soft cotton pad, and pat it all over my face, then let my skin air dry for a good 10 to 15 minutes before applying any further moisturizing products. ￼￼ this lotion has a very fresh, light fragrance, which I appreciate in a skin care product. Definitely recommend. ￼ nan
