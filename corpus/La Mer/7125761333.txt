I absolutely loved this La Mair Treatment Lotion! I use this right after my shower as the first part of my skin care routine. It smells very relaxing and lovely yet not overpowering. I love how soft it makes my skin feel. The texture is rich yet not greasy, which is important for my oily skin! Highly recommend! Hydrating without being greasy!
