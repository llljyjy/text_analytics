The texture of this feels more like an algae-based serum than a lotion (very slick). I have been applying this after cleansing before a moisturizer, and definitely notice more hydrated/plump-looking skin when compared to using my moisturizer alone, however I just cannot get over the smell of the added fragrance - it is just far too strong for my personal taste (almost like putting perfume on your face). I can’t say I’ll even be finishing this product simply for that reason alone. The price of this is also incredibly high for basically being a toner/essence. Beautiful packaging though!
