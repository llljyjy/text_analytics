I love the emerald green packaging with a velvet pouch included inside! It’s a little watery, so I use a reusable cotton pad to apply it. It doesn’t leave my skin feeling sticky at all and the scent is very light. It feels very pampering to the skin and helps absorb cream moisturizers. I used this after washing my face before applying my night cream and my skin felt so smooth the next morning. I am highly considering on getting the bigger size once I run out of the sample size. Pampering and extra hydrating!
