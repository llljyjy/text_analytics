I’m not a big red lip person but this red is so good ! The formula is so velvety. Goes on so smooth on the lips. The color pigment is so rich. You have to let it dry down completely so it doesn’t transfers. It’s not drying on the lips. The color last almost all day for me. I drink a lot of water all day. I definitely would love to try more colors. The packaging is so cute. Pairs great with other products
