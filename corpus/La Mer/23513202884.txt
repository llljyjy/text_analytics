I was expecting a lot from this moisturizer factoring the price and the reputation of the company. Happy I got the small jar in Sephora favorites but after trying it didnâ€™t find anything special about it. Very thick cream reminds of old blue Nivea cream with same smell and consistency. It is greasy and very hard to apply. It does moisturize like any other moisturizer but does nothing else. save your money! not worth it
