I have to admit, this product got a fast pass into my daily routine. It’s unfortunate that you won’t see the results it’s capable of with a small sample, though, because it really is amazing.I was lucky enough to come across several samples of this serum so that I was able to use it for two months straight. I’m 37 and have four deep wrinkles on my forehead and prominent laugh lines. I also have pronounced wrinkles under my eyes, but no crow’s feet. After using up two of the samples, I started to notice that all of my wrinkles were softened, so much so that people were asking if I went under the needle. With continued use, my wrinkles softened even more and the redness in my skin began to disappear, which was a welcomed surprise. I live with chronic eczema (and receive Dupixent treatments) and this serum didn’t irritate my skin whatsoever. Now that my wrinkles are softened, my foundation and concealer applies nicely--no more sinking into my wrinkles and searching for a miracle primer. For reference, I only use this serum in the morning under my (Farmacy Honey Halo) moisturizer.This product costs an absolute fortune for many of us, but that won’t stop me from incorporating it into my full-time routine. It’s the real deal. The real deal.
