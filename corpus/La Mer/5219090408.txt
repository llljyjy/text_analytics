I have mixed feelings about this product. On the one hand, it works fairly well as a toner, and Iâ€™ve had no issues with it thus far. I like the texture of it - not too watery or greasy - and I enjoy some of the call out ingredients in this in general, including several different oils and algae extracts. I do not enjoy the fragrance AT ALL (why put fragrance win anything, and why make it smell like an 80s bath splash?), nor do I think this is AT ALL worth the price tag. not worth it
