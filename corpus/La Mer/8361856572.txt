I mean La Mer is legendary, and it needs no introduction. I was so excited to try their Eye Concentrate. The texture is slightly more gel-like than their legendary cream, so itâ€™s easy to apply to delicate under eyes. Because of its concentrated formula, a little goes a long way. It seems to soften my lines and reduce the look of dark circles. I will continuously incorporate this into my routine to see more improvements in my eyes. A little goes a long way
