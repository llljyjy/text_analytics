What’s not to love about any La Mer product – this one was no exception! First of all, I love the scent because it makes me feel so calm. The lotion is like a thicker watery consistency, so it’s super easy to absorb into my skin without feeling sticky or heavy. I have acne prone skin and this seems to not leave it irritated which is awesome. I’m excited to keep using this longer as I have a feeling I’ll continue to see great results! nan
