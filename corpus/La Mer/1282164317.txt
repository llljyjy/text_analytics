I was so excited to try this product because I heard such good things about La Mer.  I was a more watery consistency, very different from a typical lotion.  Itâ€™s essentially like a toner, I apply it right after I wash my face.  I have combination/oily skin, so it worked well on me. I added another moisturizer on more dry days. nan
