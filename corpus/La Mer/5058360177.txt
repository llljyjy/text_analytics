I was really hoping not to love this product due to the price tag - but sadly for my wallet - that’s not the case. My skin hasn’t looked this good in a long time. I just turned 40 and just 2 weeks of use has given my skin a more plump, youthful look (I still don’t look like I’m in my 20’s but I don’t look older than my actual age)The consistency is watery without being too runny and I put a little on after cleansing and exfoliating.Will I repurchase? Probably not, it’s just not in the budget. If it was - I would though. Not in the Budget - But a Good Product
