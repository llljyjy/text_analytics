The LaMer Treatment Lotion has been a staple in my skincare routine for years. I like most everything about it, except the price but a steep price tag is to be expected with LaMer products across the brand. Overall: I very much appreciate the consistency of this lotion, it is not too runny, it has a bit of body to it, with a neutral/fresh scent, and, very importantly, it doesnâ€™t leave a sticky residue. It seems to soothe and calm my dry skin after cleansing. I use this lotion prior to applying serum in the evening, just like a toner although it is not marketed as such by the brand it does a fine job. Staple for sure
