Skincare is an amazing way to show yourself self care. La Mer products have always worked well for my skin so I was happy to try out the Treatment Lotion. For one I love the sleek, lux packaging. The lotion is a watery, liquid texture, but provides lots of hydration. It feels light weight on the skin and over uses I’ve noticed improvements in my skin’s appearance. My skin feels hydrated, fresh and youthful! Lux, Lightweight Moisture
