Lightweight, soothing and packaging gives a luxurious feel. I tried the mini size and feel it’s not large enough to say whether or not this is a good product--my skin is dehydrated, so I tend to use a lot of this in order to get enough hydration. May be good if you already know you like the product and need a travel size, otherwise, I’d get the full size for normal use. nan
