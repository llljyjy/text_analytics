I use it as a lotion after washing my face. In combination with Lamer foaming cleanser, it is absorbed easily and has a better effect than estee lauder’s sakura lotion. Been a long time fan. When I can’t afford anything else in the la mer line I always make sure I’m stocked with the treatment lotion. It’s a year round staple that always hydrates and nourishes my skin. Whether in the summer when my skin is oilier or winter time when it’s drier, the treatment lotion delivers the relief I need. A staple. nan
