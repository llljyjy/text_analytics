I had a sample of this and after I burned my cheek with my hair straightener, I massaged a bit of this on the burn.  Within two days, the line on my face was gone!  I had to buy a bottle.  This also smells like a spa in a bottle.  I just wish it wasnâ€™t so expensive but I really love it. Very pricey but effective.
