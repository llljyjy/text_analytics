First off, face oil is really not my thing. I used to love the Guerlain oil but after using the 2nd bottle it burnt my face. I stopped using any face oil since then. Until I got sample of the La Mer renew oil, my life has changed. I use this oil before the La Mer moisturizer and it makes my skin smooth, even tone and reduce blemishes. That’s why I decided to buy a full size though it is very pricey, but It’s worth every penny. You only need to use 3 drops each time, so 0.5z will last use at least 6 month if you use it 2 times per day. I only use it at night cause I have combination skin so I don’t want to apply oil before makeup. I would recommend this product for everyone. Life changer!
