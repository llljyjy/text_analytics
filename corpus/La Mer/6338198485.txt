This is a really nice product to use between cleansing and serums/lotions. It has a very thin, watery texture, so be careful when pouring out of the bottle! I invert the bottle into my palm a few times to get the product out, then gently pat onto my face. A cotton round would also work, but would soak up the valuable product! Because this is so thin, it works amazingly under other skincare products and doesn’t cause pilling. I don’t think I would purchase this myself given the hefty price tag - just not in my typical budget - so I have a hard time recommending this for someone else to purchase, but it is a nice product in itself if you have the budget Nice product, but so expensive
