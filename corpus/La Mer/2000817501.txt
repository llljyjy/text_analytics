I have been wanting to try this cream for so long! I have combination skin but a mainly oily on the T zone and dry on the outer areas of my face. One thing to know is a tiny bit goes a long way with this cream. The scent is so beautiful, the formula is light weight and melts into your skin yet it is so hydrating! I continued with a primer and light makeup for a quick put together look. So far I love how soft my skin looks and not greasy. I tried this also as a night cream, it is the perfect addition! My skin looked so dewy and healthy the next morning! So luxurious
