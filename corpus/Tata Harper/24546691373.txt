the refill aspect is nice, but it’s one of those things where I don’t actually know how much of an effect it has or if it’s just the brand wanting to seem more sustainable. the cream itself feels very luxurious, but I haven’t noticed any effects that make it worth the price tag for me personally. this was gifted by tata harper skincare. nan
