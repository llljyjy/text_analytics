Tata Harper gifted me their resurfacing mask and I love it!! It’s a gel-like texture with a tint of orange. It has a lite fragrance which I personally loved! It dries clear and a little tight. I didn’t notice any tingling but I’m used to products like this so my skin might just be used to it! After 20 min I washed it off with warm water. My skin is noticeably more brighter and is super soft! I really enjoyed this mask! My go-to!
