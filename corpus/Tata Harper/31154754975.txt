My skin is extremely dry with large visible pores. I can’t use foundation makeup because of that. I tried Tata water lick moisturizer and was pleasantly surprised. First of all you can barely feel it on your face but you do feel it’s hydrating your skin! Second - it doesn’t give me any allergies or redness. Third - Amazon scent and texture. I am so glad I was gifted by Tata Harper Skincare  in exchange of my honest opinion Really hydrating
