This was given to me complimentary from Tata Harper! The texture of this exfoliant is a gel. I’m pretty experienced with acids so I thought that this was a great and gentle exfoliant! I personally did not experience any tingling. But when I rises the mask off after twenty minutes my face was significantly softer! I applied the rest of my routine (holi frog toner, peach and lily essence, yttp hyaluronic acid serum, and the Ameon moisturizer) and my skin this morning is so plump and bright!!! It’s actually insane. I think it’s best to do a hydrating routine following the use of this mask. My only compliant is the size!!! I know that there is a demographic who can afford this but $65 for one fluid ounce is out of reach for most beauty lovers. I really enjoyed this mask but the size and price tag did dampen the experience. Great, but tiny!
