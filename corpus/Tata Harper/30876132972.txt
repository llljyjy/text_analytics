I received Tata Harper Water-Lock Moisturizer complimentary, from Tata Harper, in exchange for my honest review.This is my first time trying a Tata Harper product, and I have fallen in love. I have combination skin and the moisturizer did not make my skin oily, greasy, or shiny. It did make my skin extremely soft and wonderfully smooth. It has a somewhat thick consistency and absored quickly into my skin. I used this under my foundation, and my skin felt and looked like a smooth canvas after I applied my foundation.Extremely happy and I believe you will be too! Silk in a Bottle
