I have used a lot of eye creams, serums, etc., in the past trying to find one with the right active ingredients that will help the early signs of aging as I just turned 31. When I started using Restorative Anti-Aging Eye Cream, I immediately knew I found my next holy grail from Tata Harper! This is an extraordinary treatment that helps firm, depuff, brighten, hydrate, and smooth fine lines and wrinkles after just 1 use. I noticed my skin feels brighter and more awake. The texture of the eye cr√®me is very soothing and delicate. I use it in the morning and at night. I pat it onto my skin around the entire eye area, in a gentle circular motion with my ring finger. Its overall formula is so gentle and absorbs seamlessly around my eyes and they look and feel more hydrated while I feel a tingle from it firming. My eyebags have significantly reduced and my dark circles have really started to diminish making my eyes look brighter. My fine lines have started to slowly fade. I use this twice a day, in the AM and PM,  and have no irritation or sensitivity. With makeup, I wait one minute to fully absorb before applying. My makeup then goes on flawlessly without any pilling because my eye is smooth. A little product goes a long way so the pump really helps with applying too much! Ultimately, this has given me a brighter, healthier, energized, looking glow under my eyes and I am enthusiastic about continuing to use this to see ongoing results! Instantly Depuffing Eye Cream!
