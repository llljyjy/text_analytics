I love this moisturizer! I have combination skin and my skin is smoother. I like wearing it under makeup because it keeps my skin hydrated. I like that it feels lightweight on my skin. I love that it absorbs quickly. It has a wonderful scent. It smells like oranges, but it is not overpowering. I love the packaging because it has a recyclable refill pod. I recommend it!
