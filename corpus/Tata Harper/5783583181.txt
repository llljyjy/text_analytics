I received the Water-Lock Moisturizer complimentary from Tata Harper Skincare. My review is honest and based on my experience using this product. Can we take a moment to appreciate the packaging of this moisturizer? That green is life, not to mention it has a sustainable refill system. I enjoy using this cream, I use it mostly at my night time routine. The moisturizer has a thicker formula, but goes into the skin beautifully leaving it hydrated and smooth. I have sensitive combination skin and all I can say is that this cream itâ€™s a winner in my book. I am really enjoying this one
