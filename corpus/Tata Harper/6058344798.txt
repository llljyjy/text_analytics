One of the best cleansers I’ve used! It has very small exfoliating particles that are gentle enough for the cleanser to be used everyday, and it evens out my skin tone and makes my skin more radiant. Doesn’t dry out my skin at all. It also does a great job at removing any traces of makeup or sunscreen. Very beautiful packaging as well! nan
