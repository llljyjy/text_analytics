I was gifted by Taya Harper Skincare for an honest review. had been incredibly excited to use It because of the raving reviews and it didnt disappoint. I’m in 30s with hormonal acne that has erupted now. I’ve been trying to use products that have Salic acid and BHAs that can help with acne. Also needed something to clear the skin and blemishes! I’m so glad I found all of those in one product. Love the citrusy smell! I end my routine in the morning with a light serum and skin feels hydrated and bright all day! Skin is smooth, and a little clear after a few washes! Great results!
