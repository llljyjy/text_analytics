Gifted by Tata Harper skincare. First of all I Love the concept of refill bottle. I love trying out new eye creams and this one is good. It’s so hydrating and absorbs easily in the skin, doesn’t feel heavy and I love that I am seeing some results in just few days, definitely worth buying and trying. Good!
