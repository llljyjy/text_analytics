The regenerating cleanser gifted by Tata Harper looks absolutely regal. The packaging is sustainable, and the pump feature of the bottle is really helpful. My skin felt really soft after the first wash. The exfoliating ingredients helped give me a clear look. What I love the most about this cleanser is that tangy lemony fragrance. I really love the scent. Love the scent
