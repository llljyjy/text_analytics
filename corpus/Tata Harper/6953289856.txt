I was gifted by Tata Harper Skincare in exchange for my honest review. To start I will say this is a beautiful jar. The green Tata Harper packaging is stunning, I love the pump so it is hygienic, and I love that it is refillable in a non complicated way. The moisturizer itself works extremely well. I like the slight citrus natural scent to it and it does an amazing job as my night moisturizer. This claims to have water locking technology for the outermost layers of skin. Idk how that works really, but my skin is very supple while using this and I love the way it appears. I wish the refill was more affordable and then I would definitely repurchase, but this is a luxury brand of course. It appears to be worth it! Very hydrating
