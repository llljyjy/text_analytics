Complimentary from Tata Harper skincare. This resurfacing mask has been a  godsend! I have acne prone skin that happens to be very sensitive too; the level of exfoliation has been great because it never flared up my skin and I feel comfortable using this 2-3 times per week. I am left with a clear and bright complexion the next day. I think that with consistent use of this mask I will be able to brighten up my skin and keep my pores clear. You need to try it!
