Tata Harper gifted me the Restorative Anti-Aging Eye Cream in exchange for my opinion.  The eye cream comes in the signature Tara Harper packaging with 100% recyclable outer carton and glass casing. The product has a serum consistency and is white in color. It melted quickly into my entire eye area and instantly hydrated. It has an earthy scent and I really like how it feels after application.
