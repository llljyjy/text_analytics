I bought this cleanser since I had a sephora credit and the green bottles do look pretty luxe on a vanity.  It arrived separated and I could see it was full of OIL.  My fault for not looking at the ingredients beforehand, but given it is described as clarifying, I figured I’d try it on my acne prone skin.  BAD IDEA.  I had the worst breakouts ever! Whiteheads all over.  Some acne prone people can handle oil in their skincare.  I can not.  I moved over to a $9 cleanser to the Inkey List and my skin is back to normal.  The other Tata Harper cleanser also (the regenerating one) gave me acne.  I’ve tried most Tata Products and please, save your money unless the green fits in with your decor.
