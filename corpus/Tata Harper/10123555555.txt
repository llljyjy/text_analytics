I love the way this feels on the skin and how it makes my skin feel. It has two of my favorite ingredients, peptides and HA. It’s very hydration while remaining lightweight. It doesn’t feel like it sits on the skin at all and has a short absorption time. This also wears nicely with or without makeup. Gifted by Tata Harper skincare. Nice moisturizer
