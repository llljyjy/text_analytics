I have been using the Resurfacing Mask gifted by Tata Harper a couple of times a week. The texture has a rich, jelly that feels lovely against skin. Even though this has exfoliating properties, it is smooth and doesn’t feel at all rough. It feels cooling on skin and smells really good.  I leave on for 20 minutes during which time it dries down and it is pretty easy to rinse off. I’m left with softer skin that looks more radiant. I think this helps purge my skin when I need it because I felt a bump on my chin that hurt as if a large pimple was forming and after using this, the next morning it had a small white head which allowed the pimple to disappear faster. Most of my face is on the dry side and this didn’t make my skin feel tight at all and seemed very gentle. Would recommend! nan
