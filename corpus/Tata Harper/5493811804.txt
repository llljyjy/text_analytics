I loved this moisturizer so much!!!! It was gifted by Tata Harper Skincare and it’s wonderful! It’s so lightweight and sits so comfortably on my skin! HOWEVER there was a bit of a learning curve for me since I’m used to putting a lot of moisturizer on I learned that for this product a little goes a long way!! Another aspect of this product that I love is the sustainable packaging!!! The overall component is so easy to use as well. So far it does seem to sit nicely underneath makeup however I make sure that it is sitting on my skin for a few minutes before putting makeup on it. Overall it’s a great product and I highly recommend it! nan
