Gifted by Tata Harper Skincare, I got a chance to try this wonderful product. First, it is so neat that more brands are opting on being more eco-friendly. This eye cream comes with refillable packaging. It is very luxurious and its formula was impressive. The application took a few times to master,  and the best application for me was to pad the product onto my under-eye area. It felt comfortable and did not irritate my skin. This product does have a scent but it is not overpowering at all. I did not mind it, which says a lot, as I do not like scented skincare. Even after one week of use, I can see that my eyes can and will continue to benefit from the use of the product, they feel nourished and my fine lines are filled in with plumpness. The only downside to this product would be the price. It is definitely luxurious and if it were in your budget, I would recommend trying this eye serum. elegant formula
