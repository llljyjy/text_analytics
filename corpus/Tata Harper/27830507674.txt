I received this complimentary from Tara Harper Skincare for review. I prefer moisturizers free of silicone like this formula, and I love how lightweight this feels and how smooth it is to apply without feeling sticky. It absorbs into my skin quickly and makeup applied on top has a flawless finish without caking or pilling. nan
