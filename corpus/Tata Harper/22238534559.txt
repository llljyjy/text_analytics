I received this product complimentary from Tata Harper Skincare in exchange for my honest review. This moisturizer works well on my sensitive and combo skin! It successfully hydrates my skin without leaving that awful tacky feeling. I love that this product allows you to easily reuse the packaging, and that the moisturizer doesnâ€™t contain a bunch of crappy ingredients in it. This product is amazing!! nan
