This is the first time i try this brand. It’s supposed to be a light, fragrance free face wash. I have extremely sensitive skin, and seem to break out to EVERYTHING. This product has never irritated my skin, and contains such minimal ingredients that I’m very comfortable with using.Gifted by Tata Harper Skincare nan
