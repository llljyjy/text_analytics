This just wasn’t for me. I got a sample of this and it was oddly drying (and I have oily skin!). I also agree with people who say this smells like pinesol or some other cleaner. I suspect it’s the Chlorella, but I can’t say for sure. I usually appreciate natural-smelling skincare, but this is horrible. I don’t even like it lingering on my hands. nan
