This cleanser was gifted to me by Tata Harper Skincare. This cleanser is amazing! Has small exfoliators in it that helps my face feel so soft after applying. It has a scent, which I wasn’t sure I would enjoy because I usually get unscented products, but I ended up liking the smell and it didn’t irritate my sensitive skin. nan
