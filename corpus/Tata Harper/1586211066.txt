The most nourishing skin benefitting moisturizer. Its actually quite light, so I mix in argan oil or a thicker miosturizer in the winter. I really love this. Its like food for my skin. No silicones so it fully absorbs. Makes my skin look very plump, hydrated, nourished, and healthy. The packaging is not great, but its the best moisturizer so doesnt matter lol Super nourishing. Like food for skin.
