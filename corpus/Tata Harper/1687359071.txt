I received this product complimentary from Tata Harper Skincare and am so glad I did because this moisturizer is incredible.  The gel-like texture is thick yet  lightweight and goes on really thick…at first. As soon as the moisturizer hit my skin it melted and sank right in. My normal, leaning more towards the oiler side of combination, skin drank this right up and looked dewy, fresh and healthy almost immediately. This moisturizer has an almost blurring/primer effect on the skin and pairs well with all of my other skincare and makeup  products.  The push top and refillable packaging is a huge bonus especially since the jar itself is so beautiful and durable. I don’t need to worry about contamination or feel guilty about throwing the jar away when it’s empty since all that gets tossed is the smaller jar housing the product. I’d recommend this moisturizer to anyone, young and old. It’s versatile and effective! Perfect
