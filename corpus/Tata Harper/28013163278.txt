I have combination skin and hormone acne, and have really been loving this moisturizer so far. While I enjoy using it on the days I’m not wearing makeup because it gives me a soft hydrated glow (love Hyaluronic acid) I’ve found it works really well under my foundation as well! I used it while at the beach under my makeup AND a sunscreen, and my makeup didn’t budge all day. nan
