It’s lightweight and easy to apply. My skin absorbed it very fast, leaving non-sticky feelings. The ingredient list has a lot of natural extracts. However, I don’t think natural means safe. So I personally don’t look for products that claim all natural. This product does a good job of moisturizing without causing any irritations. But I think it’s overpriced. nan
