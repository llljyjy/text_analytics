I wanted to love this cream but I’ve had better. The scent of the eye cream is unpleasant but it is all natural, I will say once applied the scent goes away after a few minutes. As far as consistency and working power of the product, it didn’t meet my standards. When applied it absorbs into the skin fast with little hydration and throughout the day your under eyes will feel dry again. I haven’t seen an improvement in the fine lines or dark circles, it actually caused me to get little bumps while using this for a few weeks. Tata products always have beautiful packaging, and I usually love their products but this just didn’t work for me. So, Overall if you’re looking for something all natural and you have no under eye problems than this will work for you. nan
