This is everything I’ve ever wanted in a moisturizer and more! I love that it doesn’t contain silicones, which always break my sensitive skin out, and it works beautifully under makeup—it almost has a primer like effect & really smooths my skin making the perfect base for foundation. This is such a natural and gentle moisturizer, and it leaves my skin feeling so soft, calm, and hydrated. I think the packaging is brilliant too, I love that with the refill system it helps keep plastics out of the landfill, there’s nothing I don’t love about this Water-Lock Moisturizer, it’s a total dream for my dry skin type! I received this complimentary from Tata Harper Skincare. nan
