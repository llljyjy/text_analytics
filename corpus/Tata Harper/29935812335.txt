I received this complimentary from Tata Harper for my honest review. The packaging is A+ , so very luxe! The moisturizer feels good on my face and feels very hydrating.  It absorbs well and quickly. Iâ€™m not sure why the added fragrance is in their products. I find the citrus scent to be a bit much.  Otherwise, a good product. nan
