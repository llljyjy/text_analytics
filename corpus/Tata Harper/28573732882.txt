This is my first Tata Harper purchase. I’ve been wanting to them and was in the Sephora store and decided to check them out. I sprayed the essence and was immediately loving it…this smells absolutely divine! To me it smells a little like honey and apricots with a tiny bit of rose. I immediately put it in my basket and was sold. However, looking at the price I was a little shocked by how much you get for the price. But I bought it anyways because I loved the way it smelled. The bottle is beautiful and the sprayer is probably the best I’ve ever used, it’s a very fine mist. Much better than others I’ve tried. My big drawback is the price. I would say if you want a special treat or have the money to buy it. Also, I don’t feel like it really does much for my skin in a therapeutic sense. Smells lovely
