Okay cleanser nothing special. I personally found it doesn’t wash off all that easily. The smell is pleasant if a bit strong. It’s very herbal/essential oil scent similar to aveda products. My big complaint however is that the scent lingers. You can’t get rid of it off either your face or hands. I eventually had to wash repeatedly with strong hand soap to remove the clinging smell. So if you like a scent that lasts on your face and hands all day this face wash is for you.  Otherwise steer clear. strong smell.
