The regenerating exfoliant cleanser was gifted to me by Tata Harper skincare and let me tell you its very good! The price point is very high for a cleanser but it works amazing. Its like getting two amazing features in one where it cleanses and also exfoliates at the same time. The bottle is super pretty and looks very nice. I have sensitive skin and so far I have been loving it Great for sensitive skin
