This was gifted by Tata Harper in exchange for my honest review. Iâ€™ve always been a huge fan of the packaging from this brand and this one is no exception! I love the gorgeous green and weight of the product. My skin felt softer and looked glowy after using the mask. Overall, I enjoyed my experience. good, but pricey!
