I’ve come back to this twice! It’s very potent, which I like. Results are so fast. I tried Skin Fix and didn’t find it as effective as this. Love applying to dry skin, activating with water, then leaving it on for 2 mins before rinsing off. Glow, refreshed, and acne is treated. Skin will definitely “purge” when you first use this but don’t give up! It’ll clear up gorgeously. It’s also very concentrated so it lasts forever you only need a little back for more!
