This is a really nice cleanser I use when my skin feels like it needs a really deep cleanse- my skin feels so soft and literally squeaky clean after using! It doesn’t dry out my skin either, which is a miracle for my skin! Also I love the citrus scent of this product, it’s bright and light/not overwhelming but makes a nice spa-like moment! I was gifted by Tata Harper Skincare to try this cleanser and this is a great product!! The perfect deep cleanse
