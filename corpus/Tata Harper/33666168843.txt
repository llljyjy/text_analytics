Amazing eye cream for dry skin. I absolutely love its texture, it’s rich and creamy, glides on very well, but at the same time it doesn’t feel heavy at all. I use it every morning and every night and it absorbs very fast, leaving my skin feeling moisturized and nourished. And I also noticed that my under eye area looks lifted and brighter. This cream definitely gets A+ from me. nan
