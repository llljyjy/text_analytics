I like this eye cream a lot. It takes only a little bit for both eyes, so I see the bottle lasting quite awhile. The scent is acceptable and dissipates shortly after application. This blends into my eye area without being greasy. After about a week, my eye bags are diminished significantly. I am not sure if the eye area feels firmer, but it looks like the area is. Although pricey, it seems to be doing a great job. nan
