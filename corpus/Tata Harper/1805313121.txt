This mask is so hydrating. It diminishes the fine lines around my eyes. My skin tends to be a bit dry due to using retinol products and this mask weekly really counteracts the drying. I have really been blown away by just how hydrating it is and I havenâ€™t tried it overnight. I am deducting a star for amount of product for the price. I was shocked by how small the bottle is and the floral smell is very strong to me. nan
