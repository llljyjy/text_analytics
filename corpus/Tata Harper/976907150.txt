I was surprised to see that the bottle arrives assembled, no need to peel off a seal. Less waste for the environment! The refillable pod was already screwed onto the pump, so I left it as is. The refillable pods are very easy to replace, but stay snug in place once screwed in. The eye cream itself is divine! It’s nice and rich, smells citrusy and refreshing, and brightens my undereye bags.  My skin feels firmer and plumper every time I apply. It feels like I’m at a spa when I apply this. So luxurious! I really appreciate the refillable pods. I hope all brands do this! Complimentary from Tata Harper Skincare. love the refillable system
