I’m so obsessed! My skin requires a deep clean and regular exfoliation to stay smooth and clear. This mask delivers! Yes, it’s pricey, but less expensive than a facial and I see instant results. I use it about every 5-6 days. Sometimes my skin is a little red afterward from the exfoliation with the quartz crystals, but I follow it with my nighttime moisturizer and the redness is held at bay. The next day, my skin is visibly brighter and smoother. I no longer have dry skin or red bumps or an uneven skin tone. Delivers the deep clean my skin needs!
