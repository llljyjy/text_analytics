The texture of this is like a very thin clay, with extremely light/small grains of sand throughout. There is a significantly higher clay to sand ratio, so it does not feel abrasive on your skin at all. I have dry and sensitive skin, and this is the first exfoliator I have used with physical grains that did not bother my skin (I only used 1-2 times a week). Removing one point because I simply can not get past the fact that this smells exactly like a bowl of fruit loops! (Not necessarily a bad smell, just not something I want to use on my face.... plus it always made me crave them lol). Gentle Exfoliant
