I have dry skin and when I was picking up this cleanser I had no clue it was best use on oily or combination skin. Today is the day I’ve decided that after my 30 days of owning the product that I will be returning it but here’s what I thought of it so far:The first day I use it I fell in love with it because it just left my skin feeling clean, baby soft like, cotton or silk.I absolutely love the cooling sensation I get when using this product and I actually enjoy the scent despite the fact that I see a lot of people don’t. I love the feeling of luxury when I use this product.I really love how this product cleans the pores. all you need is one pump.The price is a bit expensive for some thing that isn’t made directed towards my skin and I don’t need my skin feeling dry this winter. For the value and price I can find some thing that is made for my skin and that will help my skin. so that’s my whole reason of returning it. If I had a oily skin I would keep it and I would continue to purchase this product. Black girl with a dry skin here￼
