A beautiful exfoliating mask! I feel like it cleans my pores and all of the dirt and old skin really well. I have been trying to keep away blackheads, keep my poles clean and small. I love how clean and natural of a product it us. It feels gentle enough on the skin and I like that unlike some exfoliating products it’s not too harsh on the skin. I think this is the perfect mask to do once a week after I’ve worn lots of makeup and can my feel congested and clogged. After using it, my skin feels much better. It’s my first product by Tata Harper I’ve tried and I can’t wait to try more. I was gifted by Tata Harper. nan
