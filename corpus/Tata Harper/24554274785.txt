First, I have to say that I loved the jar because it’s very fancy and hygienic. It has a cream/gel texture which is why the skin absorbs it very well.  I liked it from the first application. It’s very nutritious and leaves my skin smooth. I think it’s a great nourishing day cream. Great day anti-aging gel/cream
