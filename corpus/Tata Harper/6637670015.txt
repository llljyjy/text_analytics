I was gifted by Tata Harper Skincare this water-lock moisturizer for my honest review. I like the moisturizer very much: it is clean and safe for pregnancy. During summer time usage, I donâ€™t feel greasy or oiliness after applying it because of the lightweight texture. The bottle is clean and can be refilled. nan
