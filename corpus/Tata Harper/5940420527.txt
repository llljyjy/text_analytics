Got excited to open it and try this 6 step skincare, felt luxurious. BUT then, I put it on my face and it smells god awful. I have asthma and I was not expecting it to be this strong. Smells like burning wood mixed with tobacco. Please do not buy this if you are sensitive to scents or it affects your breathing or sinuses. The smell is heavily strong. BE CAREFUL OF SCENT PLEASE
