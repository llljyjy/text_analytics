I received this complimentary from Tata Harper Skincare for my honest review. I love the sustainable refill system for less waste on our planet, as well as the pump lid so the product doesnt get contamination everytime you want to use it. The product itself it smoothing, hydrating and long lasting. It left my dry skin feeling plump and healthy from the moisture lock. There is a slight scent, on the citrus side but nothing overwhelming or displeasing. All and all this is a great moisturizer. A good moisturizer
