What a beautiful moisturizer! If you’re looking for a lighter cream for warm weather that won’t compromise on nourishment: this is it!It’s lightweight yet still packs a good punch and leaves my combo skin with a light natural glow. So gorgeous!It also comes in a refillable container with a nice dispenser as well. I was gifted by Tara Harper Skincare. So beautiful and natural
