The only downside to this product is it’s very high price tag. Other than that, it is a perfect addition to my skincare. I have super oily skin (like getting oily mid-makeup application) and this stuff has helped balance that. I know it’s this product specifically because I only introduce one new product in my routine at a time (which is every month or so). The bottle is heavy and feels very luxurious. I would recommend if you have the dough to spend! Why is this so good
