my skin type: oily and acne prone with rednessliteral holy grail product, i’ve tried dupes for this essence and nothing comes close. the essence gets rid of so much of my redness and texture it’s insane. the cleanser makes my skin feel immediately soft after just one use and a little bit goes a long way since it suds up! the air milky lotion is extremely moisturizing without feeling heavy or leaving my face looking greasy, the lotion does have a bit of a strong fragrance but i strangely find it relaxing lol. ugh this is one of those bundle products that i only splurge on once in a while when there’s a sale since it is pricy and only lasts me around a month and a half (since i use the products both in the am and pm, if you use it only once a day you could get away with it lasting longer).if i had the money these would be the only products in my everyday skincare routine lol. i recommend everyone buy it at least once (preferably during a sephora sale) just to see how it works for you! every time i buy and solely use this bundle for my routine, my skin clears up and brightens <3 treat yourself
