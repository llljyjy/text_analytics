Waste!  I couldn’t agree more with the previous reviewers of this product.  I spent $150.00 for the large version of this which was a big mistake.  It’s too late to return.  I have kept using this product, enduring the hideous smell, thinking something might happen.  Nope.  It’s placebo effect to these buyers...because of the price point that are convincing themselves they didn’t make a mistake.  I say, admit it does nothing, and vow not to be duped again. BIG MISTAKE!
