SK-II, let’s talk about it. So I just got the trial size, and so far I have noticed a big difference in skin texture and the fungal acne (or little bumps that wouldn’t every go away on forehead). I think the brightening was due to a vitamin C serum (from Sephora) I started. I have combo to dry skin, which I just figured out. Honestly makes a huge difference now that I’m moisturizing way more. So anyway, that’s what I’ve noticed over a few days, but that could change. It is a very watery formula, but the product comes out in droplets so you typically aren’t wasting. I just drop a few droplets on my hand, spread out on hand, and then dab into my skin. To me, it doesn’t smell and isn’t sticky or anything. Again, to me, it feels like nothing on my face. I use it pm and am, and I’ve barely made a dent in the trial size. Is it worth 235? Not unless you makin big bank. But I’ve had no adverse effects, and I really think it’s made a difference. I have zero complaints and if I wAs a RiCh gUrL, I would definitely buy. Also, their origin story is worth reading into. Love the Product, Hate the Price
