My skin is very dry and I have mature skin. I started to use this about 2 months ago daily. I use it in the morning before my serum. This is the only change I have made in almost a year. My skin is so soft now, soft and moisturized. I am in love with the product. You do have to use it a while to see results, I didnt start seeing the results until about 2 weeks ago, so 6 weeks of product use. But when you do see them, if you have mature skin that is dry, you will be thrilled. I doubt this product is for people with oily skin or younger skin. Yes its expensive but it lasts a long time since you dont need to much. Must have for mature dry skin!
