(Un?)fortunately these products live up to the hype! I’ve not tried the toner as it conflicts with other exfoliating products in my routine, but I highly recommend getting this kit if you’re wanting to experiment with the essence & mask. A bottle of essence alone is still $99. The value is certainly here.The essence is the star product here and oh man, it works, and it worked fast on me. Your mileage may vary of course. However, I’d been struggling with redness for some time and I’ve tried many things. Hydrating toners. Moisturizers. Soothing oils (not essential oils.) Varying ingredients like oat, aloe, green tea, etc. The essence was the trick. Within 2 days of using it, I was noticeably less red. On top of that, it appears to be slowly smoothing out some texture, and it was like the final touch my routine needed for glass skin. This is never leaving my routine. The mask truly surprised me though! I’m not stranger to sheet masks. I’ve been given many in my Korean beauty hauls and I buy some regularly, though none of them have this hefty price tag. I decided to try it on New Years Eve, and ring in the New Year fancy like. At first I wasn’t super impressed. It felt good; the quality of the fabric certainly sturdier than most. Usually I leave masks on for 25 minutes, but after 15 this one had mostly dried up. However the next day? My skin was glowing! It’s now day 2 since I used it and my skin still looks amazing. I don’t think this will be a staple because the price tag feels so ridiculous, but it’s not a bad mask to have around for special occasions. I’m going to be looking into products in the future with Saccharomycopsis Ferment Filtrate, as that as well as Pitera seems to be the star ingredients. Wow.
