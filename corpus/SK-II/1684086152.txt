I used a sample of the essence a year ago and loved it! It lasted two weeks and made my skin more even toned and softer. I was finally able to buy this set and I don’t know if something changed, but this set did not play nice with my combo skin. The face wash was very over drying. This set made my skin clogged up - I had more bumps/blackheads on my lower cheeks and had break outs on my forehead where I never get breakouts. I am looking for a new skin care line to replace Amore Pacific and this isn’t it. nan
