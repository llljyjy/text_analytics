I stopped using during lock down , right who cares rn I thought ,,, but I just purchased because my skin just looks like ish and 4 days using this, back to the glow and smooth looking make up , no lie , but right everyone needs different skin needs . So maybe not for everyone . yes itâ€™s expensive. But worth it to me . expensive but Great.
