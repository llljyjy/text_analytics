I’m impressed…it took a bit for my skin to get used to this cleanser, and I not only like it, my skin does too. It’s easy to use, and it cleans my skin without stripping it or feeling dry.  I’ve used it with a whole lineup of skincare, and it partners great with my routine. I’ve used it alone with a moisturizer, and my skin stills feel refreshed and ready for the day. I’ll be purchasing again. My Chanel cleanser is on the back shelf now. I keep reaching for this one
