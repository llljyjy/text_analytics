I didnâ€™t notice any significant difference. However, once I kept using it, my skin started to sting, which was super disappointing. I bought it because the ingredient list seemed quite tame, but unfortunately it hurt to put on. If your moisture barrier is compromised, this will not help you. Eventually, I ended up using the rest of the bottle on my body...and my body skin showed/felt no difference either. -1 star for being nothing out of the ordinary-1 star for being extremely expensive (I would have been okay paying $50-70, but $100 is pushing it) -1 star for stinging my skin nan
