I’m not sure what kind of Voo doo this is but I saw Overnight results! Redness better, Pores smaller, horrible constant hormonal acne healing! I gave it a few days and saw HUGE Improvement so I bought more. My only regret with this brand is that they don’t seem to have a moisturizer that’s Unscented. That’s another reason I LOVE this! NO scent! The Voo doo is; It’s like water you gently pat on your face That’s it. The Mask was nice but I was getting a huge difference with just the other 2 items. You might as well buy the kit it the most economical way to try this. Today is the first time in like 18 years I couldn’t find ANYTHING on my face to conceal. I also have been home so no makeup recently. Several days recently I have only washed my face 1X a day and still no breakouts! I’m absolutely in Awe.. Ive used every brand at sephora ( with little to no scent and NOTHING compares. I’m afraid to use moisturizer since Everything breaks me out so far. I’ve used them all! Youth to the people PTR Drunk elephant, even Khiels baby lotion. If you are SUPER dry I would only used the smaller bottle 1x - every other day. Praying Pitera will make a fragrance free Moisturizer for those of use that get headaches from fragrance. Don’t hesitate! I highly recommend this!! A Must For Mature Skin! Huge difference in Days!!!
