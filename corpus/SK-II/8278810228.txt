This is definitely an expensive splurge, but if you get it on sale it’s worth it. I couldn’t say exactly how the essence works, but I notice how hydrated, smooth, and glass-like my skin is when using it. On days I skip it, I can tell because my skin gets tight and dull. The toner works wonderfully well with the essence, noticeably steps up the hydration.  A little goes a long way, and it’s something I’ll definitely buy again on the next sale. I’ll Buy Again
