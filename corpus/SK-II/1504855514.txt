I bought these after watching a Harper’s BAZAAR “Go to Bed with Me” with Chriselle Lim.  Her skin is amazing!  These definitely did not disappoint.  They were super hydrating. I loved her tip to use the excess treatment at the bottom of the bag to rub all over the neck.  Perfect for the cold/windy winters in the north east! nan
