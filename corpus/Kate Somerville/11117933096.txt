This is the best eye cream I’ve ever used! The bottle is horrible though that you can’t open it, my husband busted it open because there is no warning that its going out, however it did last 6 months. This is really expensive to not be able to open the bottle, every customer deserves that right to dig the last bit out if they want. Not to mention it looks like there was a lot left in the bottle, how wasteful to not be able to full use it. This company needs to think about that. Awesome product, can't open bottle
