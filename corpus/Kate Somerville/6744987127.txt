gifted by Kate Somerville: Overall, not a bad cleanser for acne prone skin! It’s got the right ingredients, isn’t overly drying to the skin, and it works decently. I would say for the price you could find a similar product that works the same, so based on price alone, I’m giving it just 4 stars. But overall solid product! Solid Product, Price Could be Better
