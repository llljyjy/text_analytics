This really does soothe skin and relieve tightness just as the description reads. I don’t use this as an every day moisturizer, but rather, I save it for times when my skin is truly stressed.... and that’s not just for when the weather is extremely dry outside, but also after I’ve spent an afternoon doing house renovations and getting covered in things like drywall dust or wood shavings that suck everything good out of my skin (because gorgeous gorgeous girls can do renovations on their own, and gorgeous gorgeous girls can still moisturize and tone). The product itself is extremely thick but melts into your skin as soon as you apply the warmth of your fingertips - think of a butter that’s still cold and slightly hard, but spreads perfectly melting into a freshly toasted piece of bread. Truly calms stressed skin
