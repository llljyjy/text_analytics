Kate Somerville has done it again with another standout product. This gel does work! It helps to prevent breakouts, help fade acne marks, and helps restore your skin barrier. I use this at night after cleansing on spots that need help. It absorbs easily into my skin too which is a nice plus. My acne marks have significantly gotten lighter and Iâ€™m happy with the results. Gifted by Kate Somerville. Awesome Gel!
