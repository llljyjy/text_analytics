I place a dot on a pimple and leave it overnight, it works it’s magic and the next day it’s not red nor inflamed. I sometimes need to apply it 2-3 night in a row on the same spot for it to completely take the pimple away but I do see improvement after the first application. I apply it with a cotton swab. My go to spot treatment!
