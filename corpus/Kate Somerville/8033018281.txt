I love kate sommervilles product and this one is also a absolute love of mine. Amazing moisturizer for those who loves a thick moisturizer, have dry skin during winter, needs that soothing and cocooning effect on the skin without a greasy film. I have acne prone skin and I enjoy this so so so much. I mainly use this at night or in the day during winter. Definitely a dream for dry, sensitive skin ty’e or anyone who wants an amazing thick cream without grease ☺️ dream come true
