I haven’t used much from this brand but was familiar with it, this product is good enough but it didn’t blow my mind . I like the pump top in the jar but I also don’t love not being able to see how much product is left. It made my skin feel moisturized but I have used better and more affordable gel moisturizers before. Good but not out of this world
