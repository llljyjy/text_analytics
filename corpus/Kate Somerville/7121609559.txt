I’ve been on the lookout for a good cleanser that won’t entirely strip out my natural oils, and leave me with this super tight feeling. I have tried popular cleansers that people would rave about but it was no match for my dry skin. It would always leave me with this squeaky,tight clean feeling. Sometimes it would leave me with flaky skin due to its strong cleansing agents. I purchased the Goat Milk cleanser hoping that it would repair my skin barrier. On the first use I was surprised at how supple it left my skin. It has this nice velvety texture that leaves the skin moisturized and hydrated. No tight skin feeling. No flaky skin. Just clean and moisturized skin. Most importantly it does not leave any redness on my skin! I have extremely sensitive skin which makes it hard to find a good cleanser that won’t irritate my skin. Once I switched to this cleanser I started to notice the redness disappear from my previous cleanser. I highly recommend this product if you suffer from very dry, sensitive skin! It’s worth every dollar! A Must Have for Dry, Sensitive Skin
