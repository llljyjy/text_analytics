I received this in my Boxycharm and I’m so happy I did!! This product is amazing, I love how lightweight this formula is. It’s watery enough to where it melts right into my skin and doesn’t sit on top like most moisturizers do. It leaves a nice dewy glow on my face without feeling like there’s any heavy products on my skin. I feel as though this moisturizer has smoothed out my acne-scarring texture and residual redness. I’m conflicted on whether or not to repurchase because of the high price tag. If I do, it’ll certainly have to be during a sale. If you want to treat your skin, I highly recommend! The Best Moisturizer but with a Painful Price-tag
