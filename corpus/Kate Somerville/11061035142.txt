okay so first i got this in boxycharm. i didn’t have the “pump” im not sure what to call that it was just the cream in the container. however this isn’t worth the money! i have dry and sensitive skin. this was in NO WAY moisturizing enough for my skin. it’s super lightweight and would be better for someone with a more oily skin type. however even then i don’t think the price is worth it. i use it on my chest so i don’t waste the product. id recommended FAB ultra repair cream or the Skinfix Cream for dry skin people looking for an intense moisturizer. nan
