I have oily skin and have been on the hunt for a moisturizer that is lightweight, but still moisturizing, and this product does just that. It absorbs into the skin quickly and layers with my sunscreen really well so I donâ€™t get any pilling. This is honestly the perfect daytime moisturizer for my skin type. nan
