gifted by Kate Somerville, my reviews are completely my own |  I have sensitive skin with some acne scars on my cheeks and this definitely helped fade some of them! I was soo excited to see the results and canâ€™t wait to see more with continued use!! This comes in a pump with gel-like consistency and a little goes a long way. It did not feel sticky or greasy to me and I would recommend this. Though expensive, I will be adding this to my skincare routine. Faded
