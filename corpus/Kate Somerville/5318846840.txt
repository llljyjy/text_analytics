I was gifted this cream in exchange for my honest review, and let me tell you this moisturizer really is amazing! First of, I’m a huge fan of the overall packaging. The container has a push down pump applicator which is great because you don’t dip your fingers into the actual container to prevent any product contamination. The moisturizer itself has a water-like consistency and absorbs very easily into the skin and doesn’t feel greasy. There is a light floral fragrance to it but it’s very pleasant and it doesn’t linger on the skin. After using this cream for over a week now, my skin looks transformed, it glowing and plump! Just the recharge my skin needed! Recharge your skin!
