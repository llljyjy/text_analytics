I tend to have hormonal acne , and this gel cleanser has helped with it. The cleanser also doesn’t seem to dry out my skin like most do. Although the product does say to use am and pm, I’ve used it only at night adding it to my routine, and it fits in perfectly.  I was gifted by Kate Somerville. nan
