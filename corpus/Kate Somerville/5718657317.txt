I was very skeptical about this one but I had a huge acne scar left after a really bad pimple that I picked at so I was desperate. This improved the look of the scar drastically and Iâ€™m hoping with further use it will disappear entirely. The scar was super deep like a crater but it evened out now after less than a week of using it and the color is improving too. Really happy I bought this. miracle worker
