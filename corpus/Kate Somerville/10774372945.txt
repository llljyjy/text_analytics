Stressed, red skin - exactly what this is geared towards however this didn’t do much. I noticed a difference for the first week of use and then after I guess my skin adjusted or something. After a week it was like I was using just any ole product from the drug store. I wouldn’t recommend for the price. Box feels heavy but that’s not the cream the jar is made of metal btw. it’s just okay at best
