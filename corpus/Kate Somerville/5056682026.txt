I love Kate Somerville products, but this one in particular did absolutely nothing to help my acne. I tried it on several different spots on my face, as a spot treatment, as a preventative, etc. and saw no real results. The sulfur spot treatment from Kate works 10x better for me. IMO, this is a total waste of money. The only reason for 2 stars is that it didnâ€™t worsen my breakouts, just did nothing at all to help them. Sadly Did Nothing For Me
