I was gifted by Kate Somevillie this EradiKate Ache Mark Fading Gel and it definitely shows results. I started it Saturday night (1/15) and today (1/19) I can see the redness going down and different ache marks have become more calm and less visible. I have noticed since we had to start wearing a mask my face has been more Susceptible to more ache and leaves marks all over my face, fortunately this has help to make less noticeable. Also my face feel smoother and softer almost lighter. nan
