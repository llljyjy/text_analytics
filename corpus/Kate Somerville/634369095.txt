I am loving this acne mark fading gel.  I have combination skin with oily and dry patches as well as acne flare ups.  I have issues with long lasting acne leaving spots on my face.  I am thrilled that this gel helps with my current acne and gets rid of marks from the past.  The salicylic acid isn’t too strong and that with niacinamide are the perfect combination of ingredients for making my complexion look healthier.  The formula is a creamy gel that isn’t drying. The scent is a little strong for me but that fades.  I find the pump bottle very easy to use. It helps me dispense the perfect amount of product.  This is my new favorite skincare item for making my face look its best.  Complimentary from Kate Somerville. nan
