I’ve been looking for something to treat hyperpigmentation and bumps on my forehead. Ever since 35 I’ve dealt with skin issues I’ve never had before. These sizes were perfect to sample for 30 days to get a sense of whether it would work for my face. Within a week I could tell my skin was smoother and brighter. It has a clean scent and rinses clear despite the substantial suds. There was a very very mild burning sensation with each product, but it wasn’t painful or uncomfortable, just noticeable. If you have sensitive skin it might be problematic for you. Will be purchasing the full sized bottles of these products. Great for hyperpigmentation.
