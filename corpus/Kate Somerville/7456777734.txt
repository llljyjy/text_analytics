I managed to nab this from Marshall’s for $12 and was excited to try this with all the rave reviews. I find it cumbersome and the flaking from the product is a bit much even for being a night-time product. It also stinks to high heavens. It didn’t dry my acne any more than a drugstore spot treatment. I keep it around for bug bites as it helps calm and reduce itching but it doesn’t do anything noteworthy for my pimples. nan
