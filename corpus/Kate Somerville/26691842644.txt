Has a beautiful packaging and looks tempting..  The serum is white, milky and a little bit watery.. It feels nice, smooth and silky.. Skin feels hydrated instantly after applying it.. It is lightweight, not sticky and not greasy.. It has pleasant smell, I like it and it doesn’t bother me.. The smell doesn’t stay that long, it goes away after it absorbs.. It also makesy skin plumped and soft.. I just don’t use it much coz it sting a little bit.. I dont know why but it does sting a little bit
