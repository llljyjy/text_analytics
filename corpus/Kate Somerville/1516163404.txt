I’m not sure how people are applying this in order to get a tacky feeling, but I’ve never had that happen. I use a cotton pad as per instructions to apply this, and it’s made a DRAMATIC improvement in my scars and discoloration. The clarity of my skin is unbelievable and I only used the smaller bottle. I went and purchased this large one today. I love it so much. Game changer
