Funny how all the great reviews are from people that received this product for free. I purchased this at my local sephora and it has done nothing, and I mean nothing to my acne or blemishes. If anything, I got more acne. I’ve been using this product for a little over 2 months. Don’t waste your money on this, not worth it in my unbiased opinion not worth it!!!
