Skincare influencers always say don’t waste money on cleansers. But with this product, I can 100% it’s WORTH the money. I have incredibly dry skin that is also prone to hormonal acne and this product cleanses the skin without stripping it but doesn’t leave a oil cleanser like film. It’s perfection. 1000% worth the money!
