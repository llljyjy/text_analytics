I received this as a complimentary from Kate Somerville sample to try out in exchange of my honest review. I can tell an obvious difference in how my acne is healing and in the disappearance of the rash like section of pimples on my chin. My skin does not feel overly dry or irritated which was a concern I had .Now, I still have occasional breakouts when Iâ€™m near my period but my skin has dramatically improved. I now focus primarily on scarring. I have pretty sensitive skin and at first I was using this everyday and it did dry my chin out. So now I just use it when needed or every other day during my period and have no issues with drying anymore. works as  expected
