Hydrakate’s Recharging Water Cream provides so much hydration that I’ve decided to use it during the fall and winter months when my skin needs that extra moisture. My face feels and looks more smooth and plump. I use it before my sunscreen and it feels light without having too much on at once. So much moisture!
