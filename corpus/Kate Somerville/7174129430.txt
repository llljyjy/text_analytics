I have been using this for a few weeks now on my acne prone skin. The consistency is light weight and absorbs into the skin nicely. I haven’t seen a significant change in my dark spots or scarring but it has helped to brighten my skin without over drying or causing more breakouts. Maybe with continued use I might see a bigger change, but definitely worth a try if you want something that won’t irritate your skin. Worth a try
