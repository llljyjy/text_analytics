I received this complimentary free gift from Kate Somerville for purposes of reviewing. I really have liked this treatment serum. It goes on smooth and has a gel like consistency and left my face feeling nice, it absorbed quickly as well.  I haven’t yet seen any changes of my skin but I just barely started using it could be why. Overall I’m pleased with this product, I also loved the smiley face under the box top cute added extra. Thank you again for my complimentary free  product for review. So far so good
