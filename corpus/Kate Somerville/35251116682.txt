As someone who typically has pretty clear skin, my face completely broke out last year - Iâ€™m not sure what it stemmed from, but with it being my first year of college, I think it was just a change in environment, weather, food, etc. After reading tons of reviews, I bought this cleanser with high hopes it would help, but it just made my skin more irritated and spread the breakout along the lower half of my face. Honestly had to just stop using any products for a while, which was the only thing that helped, and now thankfully skin is clear... might have worked for other people, but def not for me :( had high hopes, but made breakout worse
