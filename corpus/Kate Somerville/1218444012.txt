I use this in my AM skincare routine after I clean and dry my face. It says to use 2-3 pumps but I actually needed 4 to cover my whole face. It has a lovely clean fragrance to it and does a really nice job of hydrating my face. The fact that it is a Blue light activated Peptide serum is somewhat fascinating to me. I like it for my dark spots and for that instant radiance! clean scent
