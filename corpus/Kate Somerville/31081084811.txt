I love it.  It has a nice smell, it’s soft, it doesn’t leave my skin very dry.  It doesn’t irritate me, I’ve only been using it for a short time so I haven’t seen such amazing results yet, but I think it will work.  My skin is combination. Gifted by Kate Summerville in exchange for my honest review. love it
