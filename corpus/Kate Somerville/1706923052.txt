I really like this cleanser, gifted by Kate Somerville. I noticed a mild mini breakout about to happen, immediately started using this cleanser and was able to control the flare up. It works great! It has a lovely thick, clear consistency and lathers up nicely. It also has a fairly strong basil/ herbaceous scent, thought not too overpowering for me. I look forward to seeing improvements from continued use. nan
