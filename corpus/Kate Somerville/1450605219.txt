I got this as a free sample, and I wanted to love it but unfortunately it was just not for me. The consistency was great, kept my skin moisturized but unfortunately, I had a reaction and periodically would get tiny red itchy bumps on my face. Along with that, this would pill on my skin.I do think this would work for most people though, my skin type (dry/dehydrated/sensitive) was not the best fit nan
