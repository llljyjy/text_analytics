I was gifted  by Kate Somerville the EradiKateâ„¢ Clarifying Acne Gel Cleanser with Salicylic Acid. If you are not used to a gel cleanser then this will take a bit to get used to. The consistency of the product felt a little sticky. Once I added water the gel created a lather that made my face feel clean without stripping or dying. There is a smell to the gel cleanser but I thought it smelled fresh and not overpowering or like perfume.  This is perfect for individuals like me with oily skin and it has the added benefit of fighting acne and tightening your pores. Gelly
