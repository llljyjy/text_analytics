I am so happy to have been able to try this! As someone who has acne prone skin and am currently dealing with after acne scars, this seem to have helped lighten them. I’ve used this for about a week now and I can see improvements in my skin. I definitely am excited to share and talk about this after a month and see how my after acne pimple heals. So far I definitely recommend checking it out! I think it’s worth the shot and money.*Complimentary from Kate Somerville but all opinions my own. LOVE THE INGREDIENTS AND IT SEEMS TO WORK!
