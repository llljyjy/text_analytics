This is a great every day cleanser! I get breakouts every now and then, and this is my go to cleanser to help cleanse my skin without stripping of its natural oils and drying out my skin. This formula helps to maintain a balance and even skin complexion. It contains salicylic acid and prebiotic complex. I use it at night to give my skin a good cleansing before applying my nighttime lotion. After about a week of using this product, I noticed that it has exfoliate my skin and has left my face feeling soft and clear. I love this product! Noticed results after a week!
