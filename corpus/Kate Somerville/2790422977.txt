I used to suffer from really bad acne before finally biting the bullet and suffering through a course of Accutane, followed by a prescription for Spironolactone (seriously, ladies, if you suffer from persistent acne, ask your doctor about spiro! You wonâ€™t regret it!! My acne is completely cured.) Before my acne was cured, this product really helped. In fact, it was one of the only cleansers I could use that would successfully tamp down breakouts without irritating my skin. nan
