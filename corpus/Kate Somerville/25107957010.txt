I soooo wish I had before and after photos since using this product daily.  I suffer from hormonal acne, and patches of redness that looks like acne but there aren’t any raised bumps.  My pores have also become more noticeable as I’ve aged (I’m 36).  When I tell you I’ve tried nearly every acne cleanser out there I mean I HAVE TRIED THEM ALL.  The only one that ever made a difference is the original Proactive cleanser but I’ve stopped using products that contain parabens and it wasn’t working for me like it used to anyways.  I’ve found that salycic acid cleansers don’t work for me and neither does benzoyl peroxide, although it used to.  I picked this up during Ulta’s 21 days of beauty sale figuring I had nothing to lose and within a week my skin had completely cleared up for the first time in over a year.  I started reading about the benefits of sulfur for acne prone skin and wish I’d had known about it so much sooner!  I’ve been using this cleanser for over a month now and still get the occasional pimple around that time of the month but it’s a night and day difference from before.  I can actually leave the house without foundation and feel comfortable in my skin.  If you’ve tried salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide cleansers and they haven’t worked for you pleeeaaase give this a shot.  The only downside is that it has a very mild scent (to be expected with any product containing sulfur), but it’s not at all overbearing and dissipates once you wash it off.  But if you’re super sensitive to scents, maybe get it when it’s on sale or buy a mini first.  So happy I found a product that works for me!!! This actually keeps my skin clear!
