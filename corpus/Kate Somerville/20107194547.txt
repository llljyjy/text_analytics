I’ve been using the new Kate Somerville HydraKate Recharging Serum for the last week or so.. and oh my gawsh, I’m absolutely in love! This serum is so amazing. The formula, the way it hydrates & nourishes the skin, and how well it performs with the other products in my routine is just incredible. I love how healthy-looking, dewy, plump, & radiant my skin looks & feels after using it. It truly does seem like it awakens and recharges the skin. I would absolutely recommend giving this one a try. Awakens, hydrates, & recharges the skin!!
