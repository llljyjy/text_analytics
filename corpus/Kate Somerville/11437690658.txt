I like this gel a lot. I have oily scars with acne and acne scars on both cheeks. It not only helps with fading the acne marks, it also helps with acne.  The packaging had a warning that said that this gel might dry out skin but it didnâ€™t. This is my favorite skincare find the past and current years and now I understand why people talk so highly of KS products* This gel was gifted by Kate Somerville nan
