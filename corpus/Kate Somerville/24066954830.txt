I received the EradiKate Acne Mark fading gel complimentary from Kate Somerville. This product does seem to clarify and brighten up acne spots! It comes in a blue glass bottle and has a pump. I’ve been using it for a couple of days now and I really love how it leaves my face feeling moisturized, and looking bright. This product is a gel, and is non sticky! The only thing I dislike about the product is the smell! To me it smells very strong like Oregano. Not sure if it’s because it’s boosted with Thyme and Pine Oil overall I like the results Brightens
