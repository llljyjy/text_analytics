i just bought this cleanser to try it out and i’ve also seen so many good reviews on it.. i can honestly say, it’s amazing for dry, sensitive and acne prone skin (which i have). the consistency of this cleanser is stunning because it’s so smooth and hydrating. i also love the smell of it because it’s very light weight and not too overbearing. it also doesn’t leave my face feeling tight after. honestly, i can’t recommend this enough. definitely my go to cleanser now :) honestly the best
