* I received this product complimentary from Kate Somerville. My opinions are my own*I have been looking for a better cleanser for my face. One that lathered well, made my skin feel clean, and didn’t make my skin feel tight. This product is wonderful. The packaging looks professional and really sleek. The cleanser is nice and thick which I love. I feel the thicker the product is,  I can dispense as much or little easier. The smell is nice and almost herbal. Very relaxing. It lathers well and my skin is left feeling fresh and clean. I feel no residue and my skin isn’t tight feeling at all. I love this and I’m so happy I found something that cooperates with my skin. Definitely recommend Awesome
