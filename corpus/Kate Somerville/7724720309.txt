I have a sensitive dry skin and always for the look for good hydrating serum. I tried this serum for a few weeks now and I can say that it got to be one of my favorite serums that I have tried so far. It has a silky texture and get absorbed into the skin so fast. My skin feels hydrated and plumped.  Will continue using it. Highly recommended if you are looking for a new serum. I received this product as a free sample but this is my honest opinion after personally using it. A very hydrating serum!
