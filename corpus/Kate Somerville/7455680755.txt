I was skeptical buying this since the price is so steep, but after using it for a little less than a month I can confidently say it’s worth the price. I have dry yet acne prone skin, so it’s difficult to find a treatment that will clear my blemished without drying me out too much. This is the holy grail, but of course remember to use moisturizer after and spf if you’re wearing it during the day. It clears but current breakouts along with the scars. My skin has honestly never looked so clear. Worth the money
