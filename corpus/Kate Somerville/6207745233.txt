Like other reviewers have said, this product is heavily fragranced and despite the high price tag, there is nothing spectacular about it. Texture is like any other standard moisturizer (lotiony) and I saw no improvement in my skin after using for 1.5 months. I have combination skin and struggle with texture and dehydration. Pass
