Really like the formula of this and if I am wearing more heavy coverage makeup, this is a must after my cleansing balm. As someone who enjoys mildly/moderately products in general, I do not like this scent at all. It smells very medicine-y and is extremely strong. My actual rating is a 3.5 but since we canâ€™t do that here, I rounded it up to 4. Good Product But Scent Is Too Strong For Me!
