Kate Somervilles EradiKate Clarifying Acne Gel Cleanser is a salicylic acid acne treatment gel. It works wonders on my thick, combination skin. It’s a gentle, clarifying gel and I really enjoy the clean, earthy scent of this product. It’s gentle enough to use both morning and night and I’ve really enjoyed seeing the results incorporating it into my daily routine. It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and provides a gentle glow. Just like other Kate Somerville products, this one did not disappoint. Facial Gel Cleanser
