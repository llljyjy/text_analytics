I love this! I bought this mainly for the spot treatment, my Mario Badescu one ran out and I wanted to convert to Kate because the talc in MB’s? Immediately no. This was expensive (+$10 compared to MB) but seemed like a much better deal with the wash and moisturizer, but I didn’t have huge expectations. However, this felt amazing on my skin! I love that the line is fragrance-free, oil-free and actually has acne-fighting properties and I saw my skin doing better immediately. The lotion also felt incredible. I plan to repurchase and ditch my current CeraVe wash/moisturizer when I’m done with it. Of course, the spot tratment also worked like I expected it to (MB’s works great on my skin and they have nearly the same ingredients) but this one gave me the peace of mind that I wasn’t putting anything directly harmful on my skin and it dried out my spots very well. Whole set exceeded expectations
