Kate Somerville products have been game changers with my oily/acne prone skin. I use the liquid exfoliant, the exfoliating scrub, and the exfolikate treatment already. I decided to give this a try since it’s new and has ingredients my skin likes. I used it as a spot treatment for recent breakouts, within 3 days the breakouts were reduced in size, within a week they were gone. I’ve seen a decrease in discoloration and minimal evidence there were even breakouts. Thank you Kate Somerville! Another reason I’m loyal to KS
