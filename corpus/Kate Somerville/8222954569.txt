This cleaner is honestly one of the best cleansers i’ve ever used (and i’ve tried tons). It genuinely does everything it claims. It moisturizes,  cleans your face without stripping your face of its natural oils and leaving it dry, is extremely gentle on the skin so it’s great for sensitive skin as well, and lathers really well! One thing i liked about it as well was that a little goes a long way! I just wish it wasn’t so pricey, but honestly 5 stars! One of the best moisturizing cleansers i’ve used
