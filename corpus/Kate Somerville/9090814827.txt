I have been struggling with trying to lighten my dark spots from acne since the summer of 2021. I’ve always had the same skincare routine which is just a gentle cleanser and moisturizer, and sometimes a toner. I’ve added this product into my routine for one week now and already see huge changes in my dark spots that are 6 months old. It’s crazy how much they’ve lightened in such a short amount of time and I don’t feel the need to cover up with concealer anymore. You barely need any, I use about 2 small pumps each time so this product will last a while. I can’t wait to see more progress as I continue using it. Don't hesitate purchasing!
