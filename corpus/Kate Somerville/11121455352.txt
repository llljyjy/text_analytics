Kate Somerville gifted me the Eradikate Acne Mark Fading Gel Acne Treatment with Salicylic Acid, prebiotic and niacinamide, and I love how well it works at stopping acne breakouts and diminishing the look of older acne marks! Within the first few days I noticed that the redness disappeared and my skin looked and felt healthier and smoother, color and texture started becoming more evenly and I like that the gel texture makes it easy to apply and a little bit definitely goes a long way! This product is excellent and definitely worth trying if you have been suffering from acne breakouts like me and have been looking for an effective product to not only stop breakouts but also fading existing acne scars and nourishing the skinâ€™s natural microbiome back to normal and healthy. I love it and highly recommend it! Excellent acne control and fading gel!
