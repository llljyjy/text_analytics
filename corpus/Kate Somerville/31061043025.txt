I’ve been using this treatment for several weeks already and let me say it really works! The amount of skin blemishes has decreased and my acne scars are fading gradually. I love gel like texture! It feels very lightweight and isn’t sticky or oily. It is a bit drying so I apply thicker moisturizer on top of it to keep the balance. The only downside so far is pretty strong herbaceous scent but actually I don’t care as the results overweight! I’ll definitely be buying more from this brand. I’m very impressed!
