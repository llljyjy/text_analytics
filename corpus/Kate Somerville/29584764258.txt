Love the product, but disappointed that it isn’t as good as her what now seems to be discontinued version Moisturizer that was in the blue/green container just like this. That went on much easier, as to this new oil free product seems thick and doesn’t cover my face in one pump the way the old one did. So I have to use more product... and it doesn’t seem as hydrating either. I miss the old Moisturizer
