This product was gifted by Kate Somerville in exchange for my honest review. Super thankful since my acne started to really pop up quite a bit. Review: This cleanser helps get rid of my sporadic acne without drying out my face. It comes out like a very thick gel. Almost gelatinous. It starts to bubble and suds very well on the skin and is not irritating at all. I can be sensitive to acids causing redness, but this cleanser does not do that. Cleanser started to clear up my acne (not small either) in a matter of days. They just started drying up and I haven’t had any new breakouts so I’m very pleased. I would recommend for any skin type. I have dry and it works for me without making my dry skin worse like most acne cleansers. Got rid of my hormonal acne
