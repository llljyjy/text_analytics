I received this and it seems to be very old or expired... a bad batch. First time trying it, but I was able to tell right away this is not the ingredients every one is hyping up. It wasnt “whipped“ it was more like a jello and would not transfer to my finger if I were to dip my finger into the jar. Also, smells old if that makes any sense lol Expired?
