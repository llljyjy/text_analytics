I’ve literally got so much to say about this moisturiser! It layers well over serums, it’s super hydrating, it has a push down pump system so you’re not putting your fingers into the product AND it’s so lightweight. I have dry acne-prone skin and this is one of the best moisturisers I’ve tried! It sinks into the skin quickly and leaves no residue AND softens the skin too! RECHARGE, THAT'S RIGHT!
