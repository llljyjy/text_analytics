For how mediocre this is, I find this to be rather overpriced. This does foam up nicely and is non-drying, which is great, especially during winter months. It smells fine, like soap, not exciting, but not terrible. I just find that this does nothing for my pores or for giving me “smoother skin“. I just definitely wouldn’t rely on cleanser alone for exfoliation needs. For that I would use a good strong toner or exfoliating mask. I do use Kate’s exfoliating treatment mask, which is also pricey, but at least it’s effective. Pricey and just fine
