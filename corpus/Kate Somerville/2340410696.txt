This has helped me clear up stubborn acne on my cheeks. After moving to a humid climate I started breaking out and nothing seemed to work… Until this! I apply this on all my spots at night and wake up with clearer skin. I apply nightly until all bumps disappear. The smell is strong but it’s worth it imo for clear skin! patience is a virtue!
