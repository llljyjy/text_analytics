I received this in my boxycharm and I almost chucked it out because I’m in love with my farmacy honey halo moisturizer. But lately, my normal moisturizer is getting too thick with the warmer weather coming in. This moisturizer is SO good. Initially I was overwhelmed by the scent because it’s heavily fragranced and I’m just not into that for skincare. However, this has my skin feeling plump, hydrated, and glass like. I would give 5 stars if it weren’t for the scent. I will be purchasing this once I run out. wow!
