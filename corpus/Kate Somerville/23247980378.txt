as much as I Love Kate Somerville as this cream a bit disappointing to me. its more towards oily skin folks coz it has this matte finish and kinda oil free. I donâ€™t  see sooo much of a hydration on my skin but again its probably coz this is not for my skin type. overall signature quality ingredients and great stylish jar. better for oily skin
