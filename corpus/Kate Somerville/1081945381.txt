I’ve been using the EradiKate Clarifying Acne Gel Cleanser 2x a day for the past week, and I’ve noticed my acne has started to clear up. Once this current breakout subsides, I’ll move down to maybe just 1x a day or even 3x a week, but for an active breakout, 2x a day has been working great. The gel is a bit thicker than most gel cleansers, which I thought was a bit odd, but it doesn’t leave my skin feeling tight and dry so whatever! I’m excited to see how it performs with my usual scarring after a breakout. I received this product complimentary from Kate Somerville. nan
