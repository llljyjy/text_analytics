This was gifted by the brand, in exchange for my honest review. My interest was piqued for this product, when I heard the claims. I have dry skin and so I usually donâ€™t go for a water cream, but this one is amazing on dry and dehydrated skin! It really is like a drink of water for my skin, plus the packaging is a 10/10! ahhh-mazing!
