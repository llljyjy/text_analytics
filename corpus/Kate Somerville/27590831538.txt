I received this complimentary from Kate Somerville in exchange for my honest review. I get occasional breakouts on my forehead. I love that this gel cleanser works great without being too harsh on my skin like some other acne cleansers. It also clears the pores well. It doesnâ€™t feel like the face is dried out or stripped afterwards. nan
