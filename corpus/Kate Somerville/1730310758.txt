My boyfriend actually got me into this cleanser. I never really thought I needed to spend on a cleanser (I’ve always just used drugstore or The Inky List) but after trying this one I’m hooked! Almost done with my first bottle (a little goes a long way, so it is long lasting) Adding to my subscriptions!!! The consistency is rich/creamy and foams nicely without feeling too heavy. I have oily adult acne prone skin, and this cleanser soaks up the excess oils on my skin without stripping it. I’m left with bright, glowy skin. I’m ready to try the Glow Moisturizer to add to my skincare routine! Brightening cleanser!!!
