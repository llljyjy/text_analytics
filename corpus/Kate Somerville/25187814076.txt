I love the new HydraKate Recharging Serum with Hyaluronic Acid! Hyaluronic acid is one of my favorite hydrating ingredients and this serum has plenty of it. The texture is milky and watery and fast-absorbing. It has a freshly cut grass scent, but itâ€™s not overpowering. I love that it has the Blue Light-Activated Algae Extract that protects the skin against digital aging. My skin feels simple and hydrated after applying this serum, it also layers well with my other skincare products. Great hydrating serum
