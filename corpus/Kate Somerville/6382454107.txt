Okay I am absolutely in love with this water cream! I have combination skin that gets drier in the winter and is prone to congestion. This cream is calming and soothing and while it feels very lightweight on the skin, it’s ultra moisturizing! I have been using it for 2 weeks straight under makeup and without and it makes my skin look and feel SO smooth. My only con is the price. I do enjoy the airless pump packaging too, so you’re not digging into a jar spreading bacteria! A must have!!
