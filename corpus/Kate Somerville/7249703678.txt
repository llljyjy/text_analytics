This is my first time ever trying a Kate Somerville skincare product and I have got to say I’m pretty impressed. This serum is lightweight, very hydrating and plumps skin upon application. As we’re headed into the colder months, this serum paired with a thick moisturizer will be my go to for my incredibly dry skin! nan
