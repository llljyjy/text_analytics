I received this EradiKate Clarifying Acne Gel Cleanser complimentary from Kate Somerville. The cleanser came in a nice looking convinient tube. It is very easy to use and storage. I use it in the morning and before going to bed. I have dry skin. The cleanser is gentle on my skin and doesnâ€™t dry it. After using it I have noticed how my skin tone was improved.I would definitely buy other products by Kate Somerville to help my skin prevent future acne. Like how it works
