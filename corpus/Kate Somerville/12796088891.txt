I purchased this in a BoxyCharm drop shop sale for $10 and highly recommend it for anyone who’s struggling with dryness especially when using retinoids or retinol products. If you’re acne prone it however does contain coconut oil, which can cause clogged pores. I would not pay full price for this cream it’s just too expensive but it’s absolutely wonderful for my mature combination skin. Wears well under foundation if you let it absorb for about 10-15 minutes prior to applying. Too bad it’s retail price is outrageous! Love it, but hate the price tag!
