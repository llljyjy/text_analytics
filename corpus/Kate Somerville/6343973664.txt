*Honest review not incentivized*This is by far my favourite face wash, I use it daily and have noticed a big difference in skin texture, and clarity. I have oily acne-prone skin, and it helps to reduce the oil in my pores. I have recommended this face wash to friends and family, and I’ve bought about 4 tubes of it myself. I suggest using it consistently, because you aren’t going to see results overnight, but you will notice an immediate softness in your skin after using it.After trying this, it encouraged me to try other Kate Somerville products.
