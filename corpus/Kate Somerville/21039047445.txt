I use products with salicylic acid to keep my skin clear from breakouts and clogged pores, this gel is helping me to achieve that goal.  I use it a few times a week without any adverse reaction, no irritation, allergies, etc., so I can tell it is safe for sensitive skin using it moderately.  Looking forward to see more results in a long term. nan
