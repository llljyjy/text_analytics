I just bought this sunscreen and worn it alone and on top of three different light weight moisturizers and also on top of just a serum. It pills up and rolls into balls so much as if I wiped my face with toilet paper! I have combo leaning more towards dry skin and felt this was heavy and felt waxy on. I’m a rouge member and spend a lot of money at Sephora…This is my first Sephora review I felt compelled to write. nan
