I’ve always taken care of my skin since my 20s, but as I entered my 50’s there was just something missing. I have lots of exfoliation and retinoids in my routine, yet my skin was still kind of dull. I decided to get this KS peptide serum during the last sale, they had a really good deal on it. I didn’t have much in the way of peptides in my routine, so why not try adding some and see how it goes.     I am speechless at how much and how quickly this serum transformed my skin. It’s firmer, more plump, the texture appears refined and my skin is glowing. The crazy part is that it all happened after about a week of twice daily use. I’m very serious when I say this, it’s not an exaggeration. This serum has a light texture and sinks very quickly into the skin. I use it directly on clean skin, or after SKII essence or the Kate Somerville Dermal Quench hydration treatment. Then I apply my Stri-Vectin vitamin C + Retinol serum, a moisturizer and my sunscreen. At night I use it as a first layer before tretinoin and my moisturizer. It’s pricey for sure, I was lucky to grab it during a sale. But now I cannot be without this peptide serum in my routine, it’s truly the missing piece of the puzzle. I wasn’t very familiar with KS before, but now with this peptide serum and the dermal quench hydration treatment I’m just so impressed with her products, they really deliver on their promises. Transformative skincare, just wow
