great exfoliant for oily skin! I have noticed a significant reduction in oil production in my T zone 2-3 days following the use. (I use it once a week FYI) makes my face smooth and the make up application the next day is dream come truehowever, if you have sensitive skin please patch test first because it does sting because of the heavy AHA BHA concentrations one star deducted because the price is ridiculous. Wishful enzyme scrub gives the exact same result for fraction of the price face smooth like a baby's butt lol
