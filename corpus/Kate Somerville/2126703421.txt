Well this isn’t my favorite acne cleanser on my counter. The smell is just so odd and pungent. The smell stayed on my face even after I cleaned it off. If you’re sensitive to scents I would definitely pass on this one. I get these nasty headaches from the smell. I did feel that this dried out my nasty pimples I get from when my period comes. I get some bad acne during that hormonal shift and it did dry them out quickly. I made sure to moisturize well afterwards so I didn’t get dry skin or peeling. The product works on the nasty acne but If you used this daily I think it would dry you out. So be careful, a little goes a long way. Gifted by Kate Somerville Smells bad
