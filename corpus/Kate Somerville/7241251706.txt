It leaves a little white cast, but I’d rather that than something that slips and slides or leaves a silicone like feeling all day. Also, if you mix it into a moisturizer the white cast is negligible. It stays put ALL day in 100 degree humidity, even with my extremely oily skin… no flaking, fading, or sliding—it honest to god makes my makeup look better. No breakouts, irritations, or any problems at all, and I’ve been wearing it it almost every day for 2 years. Genuinely don’t get peoples’ complaints about it…what else could you possibly want for an actually effective sunscreen! best on the market for oily, acne prone skin
