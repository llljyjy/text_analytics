okay so for the past few weeks that I’ve been using it, this has been amazing!  Didn’t realize it didn’t come with an applicator though, so I’ve been using a q-tip BUT 95% of the time, I put some of this on a zit before bed and boom, gone in the morning/significantly smaller!  It’s a reactive product (put on zits you’ve got already) so it’s not proactive but definitely so glad I bought this!!! why didn't I know about this product sooner????
