Eradikate clarifying acne gel cleanser worked very well with my skin. My skin was not dried out like other products that contain Salicylic Acid. I used this product several times and i feel like it is working well and containing any breakouts that I may have experienced before. i received this complimentary from Kate Somerville great product
