Complimentary from Kate Somerville. This comes in a super cute baby blue glass bottle. There is no fragrance, but the smell of it kinda reminds of those Listerine cool mint breath strips, but with no sharp mintiness to it. The consistency is pretty thick, like a gel cream almost. The funny thing about this is that it dries down pretty quick, but has a matte finish, which is a bit weird and unsettling to me. Therefore, I’d recommend this to people with oily skin since it dries down matte, but for those with dry skin, it might increase flakiness. Overall, can’t say if this has worked really well or not since I haven’t used it for a long time, but it’s okay so far. nan
