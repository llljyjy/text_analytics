I received this as a free sample. A little goes a long way. Best exfoliating treatment Iâ€™ve ever used! It is very strong so not ideal for sensitive skin. After I washed the treatment off and did the rest of my skincare routine all my pores and texture on my nose was gone. Only reason giving 4/5 stars is because if stubborn acne on my chin and waiting a couple of days to hopefully see a difference Must Have!
