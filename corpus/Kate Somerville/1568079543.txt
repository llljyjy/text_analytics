I have problem skin and breakout easy.  After using a new moisturizer for a couple weeks, it broke me out causing deep nodules or blind pimples which are painful.  I have to be honest, I did pick at these pimples and they caused dark marks on my face as they attempted to heal.  I’ve tried everything to get these marks to go away.  Nothing worked until d-scar, it changed my life.  Overnight I saw a difference in the pigmentation of the pimple scars and marks.  I’ve been using it now for 2 weeks and see a dramatic difference.  A MUST TRY!!! It changed my life
