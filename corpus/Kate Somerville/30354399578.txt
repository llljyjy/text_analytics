This cleanser was very gentle on the skin. It left my skin feeling very smooth and didn’t feel dry. The scent reminded me of vapor rub and was also minty. Once you rinse it off it doesn’t leave your face smelling minty. It helped clear my skin and didn’t irritate it. I can’t wait to continue using it. This was gifted by Kate Somerville. Good Cleanser
