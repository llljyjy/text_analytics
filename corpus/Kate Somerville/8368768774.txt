Definitely a great serum lightweight and really calms the skin however, I tend to only wear it at night and if im staying home during the day. It has a tendency to pill quite a bit and is a bit high maintenance when youre out and about wearing a mask so I usually safe it for nighttime routine or if im working from home. Definiely calms redness and hydrates but not sure if its worth the near $100 price tage. Works well slight pilling
