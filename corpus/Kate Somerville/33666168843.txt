This gel is a godsend for my skin. I never had acne, but every time I have even the smallest breakout, it leaves a scar and a dark spot. No matter what I do, it’s always the case. So I was eager to get this product a try, its promises sound like a dream come true for me.First of all, I like the texture of this gel, it’s thin and absorbs within seconds. It feels very comfortable on the skin, without causing any irritations. And it works perfectly well with my other skincare products. But the best part is that I noticed the improvements after the first application. I applied it in the evening, following the instruction, not hoping to see any immediate results. But the next morning I noticed that my dark spots faded a little! I think I’ll need to keep using it for a couple of months to see the best results possible, but it’s super encouraging that I can see small improvements every single day.I received this product complimentary from Kate Somerville. nan
