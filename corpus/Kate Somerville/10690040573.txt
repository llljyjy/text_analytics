I received this cleanser complimentary from Kate Somerville.My combination to dry skin is prone to hormonal breakouts and it is often difficult to find skincare that treats acne and blemishes without drying out and stripping the skin. This cleanser is gentle enough for the skin and deep cleans pores and prevents sebum buildup with a nice lather. I only need a small amount of the cleanser and massage it onto my wet skin in circular motions. It has a beautiful lather and a fresh clean scent. This cleanser with salicylic acid is very gentle and effective in minimizing pores and excess sebum and clears up my occasional breakouts gently. This cleanser calms down my skin instantly while deep cleaning my skin. My skin feels smooth, soft without any tightness or dryness.  It feels very gentle on my skin and is the perfect cleanser for soothing and calming down my irritated skin and for keeping my skin looking clean and clear. Gentle cleanser
