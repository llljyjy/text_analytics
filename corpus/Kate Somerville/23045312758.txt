I received this product gifted by Kate Somerville. To start off I was so happy to read the ingredients of the product itself. It was exactly what I needed for my skin. The consistency of this cleanser is more like a gel like itâ€™s different from others. I felt like it dried out my skin a little when I had applied it. The scent smells fresh and minty. After I washed off the cleanser, my face felt smooth and hydrated! Great Cleanser
