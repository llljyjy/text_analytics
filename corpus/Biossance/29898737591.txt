I love this toner! I have tried so many toners bc my mom is always telling me to always use toner first. I was into a lot of Korean ones since my mom is Korean & puts me on a lot of KBeauty products but I wanted to try this one since itâ€™s supposed to minimize pores. This has helped with my pores but it also helps my products after to sink in well in my skin. I love this toner so much that I went ahead and purchased the lactic acid that Biossance has; hoping that will work as well as this toner does!!! My face is in love!
