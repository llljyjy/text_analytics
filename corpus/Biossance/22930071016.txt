This moisturizer smells like feet. It reeks. Yes, it goes away quickly, but you shouldn’t have to hold your breath when putting a product on your face. I’ve worked my way through some of it but I can’t see any noticeable difference from other products I’ve used, and some of my acne has returned. I don’t know if that’s a coincidence, but it doesn’t matter - it’s nothing special, and this needs to really be a miracle product for the smell to be worth it. I wish I could get a refund because it’s totally unusable for me. The smell is unbearable
