I don’t know why I had such high hope for this. But it’s just another lip balm that doesn’t do much. I have dry very sensitive lips that don’t react well to most lip balms. But if I don’t use anything they get cracked to the point if hurting and bleeding.This balm dit prevent the extremes to where my lips can get but nothing more. It even leaves my lips in a constant state of chappyness and ruffness. I do feel «luxurious using a 20$ balm. It just doesn’t do much! Just lip balm
