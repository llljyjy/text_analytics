Honestly let’s just face it eye creams are a waste of your time money, get Botox HOWEVER I am very surprised and pleased with the results that this eye cream gave me, it is tinted so almost acts like concealer without the creasing, honestly the only eye cream id recommend to anyone, great for dark circles, 1 star off cause it’s still an eye cram best eye cream I’ve ever used
