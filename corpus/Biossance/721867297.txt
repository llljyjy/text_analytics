This is the my first step in the morning, and the last step at night as part of my beauty routine! I’m totally and completely hooked. I’ve repurchased this cleanser several times, and I even put a little water in the bottle to get the last drop. It is so gentle, doesn’t burn my eyes, doesn’t leave my skin feeling tight, and skin feel’s moisturized. nan
