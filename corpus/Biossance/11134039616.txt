I wasn’t sure what to expect with this serum and wasn’t really seeking one out, but decided to try it. I am so glad I did! I had some acne scarring around my lip area and thought figured I had nothing to lose by trying it. As you can see, my acne scarring has reduced significantly and is almost gone after nearly 4 months of regular use. I still have a solid amount of product left too and know this will last me a while, so I am happy to pay the price for a long lasting and effective product. I would absolutely recommend this product and can’t wait to continue to use it! Acne Scars Be Gone!
