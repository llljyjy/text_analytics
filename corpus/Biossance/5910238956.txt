The cream is very hydrating! When I woke up the next morning, I felt like my skin had gotten softer. Be warned that it does have a strong smell to it but it does go away quite quickly after you apply the moisturizer. I have combo and sensitive skin and this worked well for me! Disclosure: I did receive this free item via influenster. nan
