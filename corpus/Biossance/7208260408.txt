I revived this product complimentary for an honest review. I will post another review after I’ve had more time with the product. So far the cream feels very nice and dewy on my skin (and bonus points for the beautiful packaging!). My only negative is the smell is quite off putting for me. I’ll let you know how it works in a few weeks Feels nice - smells ehh
