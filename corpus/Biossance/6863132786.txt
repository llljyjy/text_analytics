It is lightweight and does make my skin feel silky smooth but I wish they would improve the formula. There was a few issues biossance needs to improve for me to love this moisturizer: 1. It peels and doesn’t layer well under makeup. 2. Sometimes it has a burning sensation. 3. The hydrating effect it has on my skin doesn’t last long. Formula needs improvement
