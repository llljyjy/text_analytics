The only face oil I’ve ever liked!! If you’re like me and  you’ve been put off by face oils because they’re thick and greasy feeling then this is the oil for you!! it’s none of those things! it’s so lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin and leaves it feeling soft and nourished. I used 3 little drops and it  was enough for my entire face. I applied the oil after my moisturizer as part of my nighttime routine and my skin has never felt better! Yes it’s pricey, but a little goes a long way and the mini size would most likely last a good while. Most definitely worth trying! Not your average face oil!!
