Really wanted to like this sunscreen. Doesn’t leave a white cast on my tan/brown skin. It doesn’t burn my eyes either, and doesn’t smell strong. However, it’s causing me to break out. I’ve combination skin, and I’ve noticed break outs in the oily regions. This may be better suited for people with dry skin. Sadly, I’ll be returning this. Wish It Worked for Me
