This serum was nice in the fact that it’s not sticky and absorbs quickly.. and it has a cool blue tint! I really wanted to love it but i didn’t find it too hydrating. I expect hydrating serums to give me dewy skin but was unable to achieve that with this one. The biggest con for me was that it broke me out quite bad… which is surprising because I don’t have sensitive skin and not much breaks me out. *i received this product complimentary of influenster* Meh..
