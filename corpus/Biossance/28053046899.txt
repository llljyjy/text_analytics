received this product complimentary of an Influenster VoxBox campaign. I really like the packaging that this serum came the presentation It’s really eye catcher! The serum looks really beautiful with this blue fulcolor. The serum looks good but once I tried it my face didn’t really feel hydrate. When it dries up it feels like nothing was applied to the face so for me this is a no ! I would not recommend it because it does not fulfills it’s purpose. Not like it!!
