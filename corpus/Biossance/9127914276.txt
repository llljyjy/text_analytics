This is, hands down, the best moisturizer I have ever used. It surpasses Annemarie Borlind, Dr.Hauschka and a whole bunch of others I have tried. Reason being, it fully moisturizes and doesn’t leave a sticky or greasy feeling or look. It feels 100% replenishing and I no longer have dry bits or in any way aware of my skin during the day. For reference, I am early 50’s, red hair, freckled and love the sun. My skin tends to be on the drier side. I couldn’t recommend this more. Perfection.
