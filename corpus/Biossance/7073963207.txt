short-term benefits donâ€™t mean longterm results. as soon as i stopped using it daily to save some of the expensive product, it dried my skin out and broke me out -- red flags of cheap ingredients and quick-fix products that create a dependency on their specific products. definitely meets the mediocre standards, but for almost $100 i kind of expected longterm benefits more than short term bandaids to issues with my skin i never had before i used this stuff. quick fix, not longterm
