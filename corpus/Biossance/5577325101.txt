I received this product for free from Influenster and Biossance, but all opinions are my own. First things first, I LOVE this face cream. I have sensitive skin so I’m always a little skeptical about adding new things to my skin care routine, but this one was awesome. I’m 32 and have some fine lines and my skin is super dull in the morning, but as soon as I apply this - well minutes later - I notice fuller, more vibrant skin, and less fine lines. Like everyone else, the only weird thing about this product is the smell when you first apply it. It reminds me of wet dog, but it’s honestly tolerable and lasts for seconds. And the results it gives overrides any weirdness. I love this product and would totally recommend it! Great results fast!
