Disappointed. The sephora staff member said this left no white cast. Iâ€™m what south asians call wheatish so not impossible to believe I would be fine, but no. I look so ashy and grey with this on. Very oily, not so much a glow like shiseido. I had to find a replacement because shiseido burns my eyes but I left no white cast. Guess I am still hunting for that perfect spf. Grey cast
