It’s a great moisturizer and I wanted to like it SO bad, but I can’t get past the smell. I realize it’s considered fragrance free, but it was not a good smell. I will most likely keep using it, as I don’t ever like wasting a good product. I do think everything else about it is wonderful, just dislike the smell. nan
