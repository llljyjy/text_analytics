I love how the texture of this cream is rich and nourishing without feeling heavy. It gives a moisture boost to my skin leaving it plump and supple and leaves no sticky/greasy residue. There’s some herbaceous scent to it, which I don’t mind. And the most important thing is my combo skin absolutely loves this formula! Despite being on the thicker side it didn’t clogged my pores or give me any breakouts. Acne-prone approved! nan
