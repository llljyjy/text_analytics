I received this complimentary from Influenster for my review. This repair moisturizer comes in a nice glass container. It is a thicker moisturizer but it’s not heavy on my skin. It moisturized my face really well but didn’t leave it feeling oily or greasy. My only complaint like others is the scent. It does have an off putting scent but I will say it dissipates quickly at least. Good Moisturizer-Bad Scent
