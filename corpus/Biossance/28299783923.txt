BUY IT! I have struggled with hormonal acne as a young adult and have tried every product possible when it comes to cleansers. I am the type of person who will scroll through all the reviews and comments before buying a product and I truly love this product. Some cleansers can make your skin oily or super dry but this cleanser is a happy medium. It makes my skin feel clean and soft. I use it in the morning and at night and I love the gel like consistency. It has not only helped clear my acne but as well as helped with acne scars. A must have!! Look No Further !!
