Been using biossance for a few years now and my skin only continues to improve in appearance and the feel of it. I LOVE the lactic acid serum. At first it was intimidating because I had never used any sort of product like this before, but the results I get make it all worth it. The eye cream is a favorite of mine and helps with my puffy, tired eyes. I became a fan of biossance because of the repair cream and Iâ€™ll always love using it. It has helped my dry, flaky skin become so hydrated. The rose oil just brings this nice glow to your face. I get so many compliments on my skin. 10/10 recommend! Get it!
