I did try this out as a sample and splurged on the bottle. However, after a few weeks I went back to the Farmacy plumping serum. It’s way more affordable and delivers the same, if not better plumping action, in my opinion.   I do love this brand and I have used it with their Vit C Rose Oil, but no longer wow’d by the results for the price point. Eh. other products at a better price point
