I purchased this oil a couple of weeks ago. I already use the Biossance eye cream and face cream - and love both products. I have never used a “face oil”, just the idea of putting oil on my face was somewhat repugnant. This oil is a dream! I only use it at night (innisfree foam cleanser, Baha de Cos niacinamide 5% toner, Inkey List Retinol serum, Biossance Squalane + Omega Moisturizer, Biossance Rose Oil). I wake up with radiant, dewey & smooth hydrated skin. Love it. wonderful
