I received a small sample so I could not use it over a long period of time but I enjoyed this product because it is pretty lightweight and non sticky.  After applying it, my skin burns a little bit but I don’t get any irritation and it doesn’t make my skin feel dry. Although the product feels nice on my skin, it smells so bad so if you are sensitive to smell i do not recommend. nan
