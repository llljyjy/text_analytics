I received this product complementary in exchange for my honest review. I used it for about three weeks before I decided to write about it and I am so obsessed I purchased the larger size! I have combination skin but it’s mostly dry and red. This moisturizer absorbs instantly and doesn’t leave a weird film on my face. The smell is a little unpleasant but it’s nothing unbearable and it doesn’t last very long. This is the only moisturizer that has worked for me in a long time. I will forever buy! Obsessed!
