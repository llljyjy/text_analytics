I received this product in my Trendmood Box and I can honestly say that if I hadn’t received it in my Trendmood Box I probably wouldn’t have never tried it and I’m so glad that I was introduced to this product.I have overall very dry skin with an oily T-zone and this moisturizer worked very well for my skin. I particularly have been using it at night after I wash my face because I noticed that that’s when it’s the most drying. The texture is thick and there’s not much of a scent at all so I appreciate that. A very small amount of product goes a long way which I also like. I did also use this as a make up prep base and it worked very well. I recommend this product Elise obtaining a sample to see if you like it! Gem!
