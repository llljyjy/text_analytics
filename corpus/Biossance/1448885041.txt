I am giving this a try on my neck and chest.  I have many years of mild sun damage from skipping my sunscreen.  I am impressed at how gentle it is on my skin.  I am feeling really hopeful about results.  So far, my skin seems just a bit brighter from being moisturized with this product.  I do not expect the sun damage to be erased but I really think this will blur it. I do love this brand. nan
