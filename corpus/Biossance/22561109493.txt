I received this product for free for my honest review. I’ve been using this product for about 3 weeks now, every other night as I have somewhat sensitive skin and this is a retinol based product. I haven’t noticed any significant changes in fine lines in this timeframe, but my skin does feel somewhat “tighter”. Overall, the serum is hydrating and I don’t need a heavy moisturizer after use. I like that the ingredients are natural, but for the price I probably wouldn’t purchase in the future. Good but not great
