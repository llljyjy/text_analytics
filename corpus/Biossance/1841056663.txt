I received this Squalene + Omega Repair Cream complimentary from Biossance and Influenster in exchange for my honest review.  This is a really rich face cream that was made for dry skin like mine.  It has a thick creamy texture that takes a bit to absorb.  Although it’s fragrance free, there’s a weird scent from the natural ingredients, but that does dissipate after applying.  My skin felt very hydrated, and after a few weeks I noticed diminished fine lines.  However, for me this moisturizer is too heavy for the summer months, and I would most likely use it during the drier winter months when my skin really needs it. Deep Hydration
