This moisturizer has a lightweight, creamy texture like I’ve never felt before. I love the way it feels on my skin - not at all greasy or heavy - and it has created a noticeable difference in my skin. The only reason for 4 stars from me is that I’m not particularly fond of the smell. It’s not terrible or anything, just strikes me as very odd. I received this as a complimentary gift as part of an Influenster campaign in exchange for my honest review. nan
