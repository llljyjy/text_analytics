I found a mini of this at Marshall’s and decided to give it a try. It is AMAZING as a first cleanse. It removes all of my makeup with ease and hasn’t caused any breakouts. Make sure to use warm water to emulsify it, then there won’t be a film left behind. I’ll definitely be buying the full size when I run out! amazing
