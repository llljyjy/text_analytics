i was iffy on buying this because of the reviews about the smell but i really needed something that would help moisturize my skin as it was very dry and flakey so i ended up getting the smaller one to test it. the smell personally doesn’t bother me, it’s not as bad as some people make it out to be. if you’re not hyper sensitive to scents and really just want something to hydrate very dry skin i think it’s worth trying! nan
