Ok I am suuuper impressed with this cream! My face tends to be more on the oily side so I typically stay away from creams that are very rich, however this one somehow moisturizes your skin deeply and itâ€™s able to to dry without leaving your skin feeling oily at all. Definitely one of my new favorite moisturizers! Amazing even on my oily skin!
