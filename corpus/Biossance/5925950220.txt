This is gentle enough on my very sensitive skin to not give it irritation that can bother me when yo use new products. So far I’ve used it twice with a day in between and it’s not caused me any problems. I love how easy it is to put on, it’s very creamy and green!!!  It doesn’t have a scent either which I really appreciate. Standard sensitive skin friendly retinol
