This was great to get after the winter we had. My skin was left super dry and I had a hard time finding anything the would deeply moisturize and bring my skin back to life. This did that! This does have a weird smell as other have said, but it’s because it has no added fragrances (which I prefer). I would recommend this to someone who suffers with dry skin and dry patches. For me, I think this is more of a seasonal product for when I go through bouts of dry skin during the winter. I don’t think it’s an every day, year round moisturizer. Great seasonal moisturizer
