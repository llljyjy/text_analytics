I will not lie, this is an expensive product. I originally got the product in a bundle so I was able to check it out without the full price the first time around. I have acne scars and texture on my face. I don’t apply this every night, so my results are not crazy but I have noticed a huge improvement with my skin when I do apply this product. My skin becomes much clearer and has helped get rid of any oncoming acne. However, I do find this product is a bit drying. I don’t know much about skin care or what not but I believe that is just part of the products ingredients. You can easily counteract this with some moisturizer (I usually wear an overnight cream mask when I use this). Only other thing I have noticed with this product is to check if you are really empty when the pump does not work. Usually there is still some product left over. I just pull the top off and grab a q-tip or something to get what is left (this stuff is pricey so best not to waste any). However, I truly believe that this is worth the money and it makes a noticable difference in my skin. I need it...sadly
