I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I was SO happy to be selected for this campaign because I love Biossance products! I have been using this cream for over a week now and I have noticed extreme hydration in my skin. I have noticed if I use too much I will break out, but I quickly figured out the right amount for my dry skin. This is especially amazing to use at night as a night cream, but if you don’t have oily skin it’s also great for morning as well. A little goes a long way. I love that it has ingredients like Omega and naturally derived squalene. I have already noticed great results and will be definitely purchasing once I run out. I highly recommend this cream especially for people suffering with dry skin. Amazing, hydrating cream! A little goes a long way
