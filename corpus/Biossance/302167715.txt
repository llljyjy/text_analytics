I bought this after seeing Dr Shah (@dermdoctor) on TikTok. He mentioned the “...little bumps on your forehead...“ which are exactly what I’ve been trying to find a solution for. I purchased this and with one use, I saw over a 50% reduction. I do not use it every day. Maybe 3x a week o my forehead and 1x on my entire face, followed by a moisturizer. Game changer!
