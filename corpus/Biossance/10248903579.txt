The texture is interesting, it’s a cream but feels dry. Almost like a face sunscreen feel. Kind of chalky. But it laid flat and moved smoothly across my skin. It smelled like dried mushrooms. Kind of stale and old cheese. But very earthy. You get used to it, it’s not bad. I do wonder if since it is vegan and plant derived I got an expired one? Not sure how that works. I like it
