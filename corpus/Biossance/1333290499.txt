I have extremely dry skin thanks to retinol and other products. This moisturizer is hydrating and moisturizing, however, I don’t think it’s worth the price. The smell is also a bit overwhelming at first, but you eventually get used to it. Overall, it’s a fine moisturizer, but not something I would buy again. nan
