I received Biossance Squalane + Vitamin C Rose Moisturizer complimentary for my honest review. And I honestly really, really like it! I received it just in time for the dry winter weather. When I got it I was starting to have painfully dry skin and was already considering what moisturizer to get - and this has worked wonderfully! In addition to no more dry skin, my skin is now also extra soft and supple. I also like that this product has Rose in it. It is not overpowerfully scented and there is definitely a monthâ€™s worth in the container when used twice a day. Just in time for dry winter weather
