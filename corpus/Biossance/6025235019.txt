I have combination skin. I like to apply it to the dry parts of my face. I suffer from Eczema and I find that the cream didn’t irritate my skin. The texture is thick and best suited from cold dry weather. I didn’t really see any improvements with fine lines or texture of my skin. Maybe because prior to using this cream I’m already using a cream with Tocopherol. It’s feel of fragrance and essential oils, so it great for sensitive skin. However, the natural aroma of the cream is not pleasant. For that reason definitely try out the mini size first. Eczema Friendly Moisturizing Cream
