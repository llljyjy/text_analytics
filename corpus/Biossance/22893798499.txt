I miss the cleanser that came in a tube. I really like this one and how it doesnâ€™t dry my skin which most cleansers do, however - I find it takes a lot of product to wash my face so the bottle goes quickly. The old formula used to last me way longer. I find this jelly like formula also slips off my face before I can even foam it up so I loose a lot of product as well. Please bring back the old cleanser!!!!! That was my ultimate #1 favourite, zero complaints about that one! nan
