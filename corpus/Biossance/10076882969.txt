This is my first time using retinol. Started off using at the recommended every other day. This was too much for my skin though and I soon started seeing dry patches.

I think the packaging is very nice and easy to use, however, I did find the lid to be a bit of a snug fit. I was sent this product to try for my review. My First Retinol
