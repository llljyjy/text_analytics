I have been using Boissance products for several years and continue to be impressed by them. As usual this product is both effective and gentle. This is a great introduction to retinol and would be excellent for sensitive skin. The serum left my skin feeling moisturized and soft. Itâ€™s hard to tell tIf the retinol is working for long term, but I did think my skin looked radiant and glowing after use and my face has looked very clear and bright since use. I also appreciate the affordable price point.  I would recommend this product. Gentle and effective
