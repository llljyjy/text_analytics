I absolutely love this product and that it is sustainable with no harmful ingredients yet still effective, great texture, no smell. My only problem is that the cap is super delicate. I travelled with the cream and it broke pretty quickly â€” be careful and gentle when you travel with it. LOVE but be careful with the container
