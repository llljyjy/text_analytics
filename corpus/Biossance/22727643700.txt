Received this product complementary from Influencer and Biossance for my honest opinion.Iâ€™ve never tried a retinol night serum so I was super excited to try this, specially this brand! Nothing but good feedback! Love the light scent. It absorbs within seconds, not greasy or sticky feeling. Left my face feeling hydrated and skin looks amazing! Definitely recommend Worth the price!
