I have super dry skin and some unevenness and this moisturizer is amazing! The texture is more of a cream than a gel but it melts right into the skin and a little goes a long way! My skin feels so smooth and hydrated when I put it on at night and I can still feel the moisturizer on my skin when I wake up in the morning which I love! I highly recommend if you have dry, dehydrated, or textured skin. nan
