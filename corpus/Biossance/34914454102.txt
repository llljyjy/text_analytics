Started off with 15 ml trial size. Instantly fell in love with it. My sensitive skin just loved it. It may seem thick but absorbs well and doesn’t leave a film behind. Has a mild scent but weird enough I don’t mind it at all and infact like it lol. One and only con is the quantity you receive. When I bought the 1.7 oz bottle, there was a big air pocket in there. To me that seems like a shady tactic. Other than this, I really recommend it. exceptional but the quantity is lacking
