I was really wowed by this moisturizer. I needed something hydrating that wouldn’t irritate my skin or cause breakouts. This is it. I haven’t had any reactions while using this moisturizer and it keeps my skin hydrated. I’ve noticed that I’m not as oily in the middle of the day as I was before using this. The only con is that it has an odd natural scent to it when applying, but it doesn’t linger so it’s really not an issue. I will definitely be repurchasing this product. Great moisturizer!
