I bought this after careful consideration and speaking to the Sephora sales associate. I hesitate to buy a product due to having dry, rosacea, sensitive, hormonal acne, and textured skin. At first glance, the feel of the cream is a nice consistency. That is the only positive thing I can say about it. As for the efficacy of the moisturizer, it did not provide any moisture. It left an oily feel on the skin that doesnâ€™t go away, even after a full day of it on the skin. Several times,  when I put the product on my face, I would get small white-head comedones on my face the next day. The smell is just disgusting. It smells like spoiled milk. After several months of reluctantly using this bottle to finish the product (used on hands, arms, feet).  I will never buy this product again. Not for dry sensitive acne skin
