I wanted to love this product after trying it in the store and seeing how instantly bright it made my under eyes, but after a week of using it I had to give it away. Prior to using this, I never had a noticeably bumpy texture underneath my eyes and my dark circles weren’t horrible, but this morning I noticed how visible the bumps underneath my eyes were and my left eye has such a dark/red spot under it. I immediately came to read reviews and saw that I wasn’t the only one having this issue with this product.Super bummed because the employee who helped me said he was able to see I have a little bit of sensitivity in my skin and recommended this product and now I have to wait for this to go away to try out something else. nan
