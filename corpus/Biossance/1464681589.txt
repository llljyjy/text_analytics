I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. So far I’ve been using this product consistently for the past three weeks. For reference, I have dehydrated and acne-prone skin. I have LOVED this serum. It is super hydrating and calming on my skin and I love the added peptides for collagen and elastic production. I have really felt that my skin has looked bouncier and more hydrated over these weeks. It also has not caused any breakouts and in reality my skin has been looking more clear. As far as anti-aging results, only with long-term use would I be able to tell, but what I can say is that this a serum that seamlessly entered my routine and I can’t go a day without applying. I would gladly continue use over and over because I enjoy it that much and that’s the ultimate goal when I try a new product! I also want to note that this serum is 1.7 oz which is much larger than the typical 1oz serums so you actually get pretty good value for the serum. I will definitely repurchase! Can’t stop using!!
