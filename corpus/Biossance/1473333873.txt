I’m very picky about moisturizer’s as I have dry combination skin, which is hard to please. Most are too greasy or too dry and this is just right. I love Biossance for it’s clean effective ingredients. This cream is the perfect balance of soothing moisture without being overdone. It absorbs nicely and doesn’t sit on top of my skin. It contains only natural ingredients and is fragrance free. The texture is whipped and creamy but not too thick. It really is the holy grail moisturizer for me. I can’t get enough! My skin is always soft and content after applying this. It has plant derived squalane and omega to repair the skin barrier. I can’t say enough about this cream. I will continue to purchase in the future! I’m going for the jumbo next time. I received this complimentary in exchange for my honest review. My favorite!
