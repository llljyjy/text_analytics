It took me forever to finish this bottle because about two pumps takes my entire face of makeup off. I have acne prone skin but I like to try new stuff. I use all kinds of caudalie products and I love but then I switched to their oil to remove makeup and got so many pimples. For some reason this oil is the only one I can use. Going back to the good stuff Let it go and always go back for this!
