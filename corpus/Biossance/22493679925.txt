I love this oil so much!!! Only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is the price. I wish they would make a smaller size so I could afford to keep this on my shelf. I’ve gone through a couple mini sizes but I don’t want to buy a set with other products just to have this one (although I am tempted lol but I have enough moisturizers and stuff right now). Instead I incorporate squalene in my oil cleanse, vitamin c in a serum, and rose oil all on its own in my skin care routine. I would recommend buying a minis set but not the full product to anyone I know, they would look at me like I’m crazy for suggesting something of this price! nan
