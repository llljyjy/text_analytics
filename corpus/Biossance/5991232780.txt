The face- a crucial area to moisturize as the years pass by. I received this product for free from Influenster and Biossance in exchange for my honest review. The Biossance Squalane + Omega Repair Cream was an interesting switch-up as I’ve been using a moisturizing sun screen in my daily routine. This cream is definitely on the thicker side, but yet it feels like it soaks in fairly quick. It’s Clean + Planet Positive, which makes you just feel good about what you’re applying to your body. My only issue is while this product claims to be fragrant free, I cannot get over the smell. Especially because it’s going directly on your face, you get a full helping of the scent every time. nan
