I received this product as a free sample for my honest review. I love this product so far. I have some spots on my face that can get extremely dry and sensitive and needs all the moisture it can get. A little goes a long way and you don’t have to reapply throughout the day. It really changes the texture of your skin, in a good way. It doesn’t irritate my skin or make it oily. It’s the consistency of a balm so when it warms up to your skin, it soaks it right up and gives you natural finish! I love the fact that it has no fragrance especially since it’s going on the face. Fragrance usually dries the skin, which would defeat the purpose of it nourishing your skin. Love it!
