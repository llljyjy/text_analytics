I originally bought this cream before it was sold in Sephora and when it was $50. It does wonders for my dry skin especially since I live in the desert. I was hesitant to buy when the price went up so I tried other moisturizers and even tried samples of La Mer Crème Radiance and thought I was going to be a La Mer convert because of the experience from the samples… but La Mer was not hydrating enough for me in this dry spring weather so I turned to this again and fell in love all over. It does have a scent of raw sugar which I can see some people not liking, but I have never experienced the smell of feet while using this. Try buying directly from Biossance for this cream in particular! Buy from Biossance site!
