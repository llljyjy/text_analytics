This cream was part of the “unstoppable glow“ kit. I got it for myself since I’ve read a lot of good thing about it. I really wanted to love this product, but the scent is unbearable. I tried it a few more time to get used to it, but I just could not. It was even worst with the serum! It is really moisturizing tho. I tried it on a few different moment:- I have a combined skin type and thin skin. Honestly, for me, it made me more oily. That was during the beginning of winter.- Recently, my skin had been going toward a more dry skin type with the colder weather, and so this cream actually didn’t create that oily film! This is why I am giving this product a 3/5... as I can see how this work well on really dry skin - during winter. I still won’t use it unless I really need to. :/ nan
