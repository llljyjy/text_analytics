This travel size set was really good and helped me try out the products before I bought the full-size version. I ended up buying the full-size version of the Omega repair cream. And once the eye cream runs out I will also buy the full-size version of the eye cream. I have also kept the small jar and now when I travel I take a bit from the full-size jar and put it in the smaller jar to make it more convenient to travel with. Really good products
