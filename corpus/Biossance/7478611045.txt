I really like this product. It’s the only products that always has my lips feeling moisturized & looking great. The only thing I don’t love about this product the taste which is honestly unavoidable. Due to this products runny texture, I often find that some of it gets on the inside of my lip and it really does taste gross. I know this product wasn’t made for taste, but I wish it was formulated to be more subtle. Nonetheless, I’ll just have to bear with this minor inconvenience because cause I will definitely be repurchasing this product. nan
