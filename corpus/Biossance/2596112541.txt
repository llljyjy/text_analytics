This cream is “clean” and very moisturizing without being greasy. It is quite heavy however so I only use it at night. It says fragrance free but it does have a slightly unpleasant odor- it reminds me of the health food co-op. It does however make my face feel soft and hydrated so it’s worth it. Heavy and Hydrating
