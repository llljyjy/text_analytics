This brand new moisturizer came to me free of charge courtesy of Influenster and Biossance, in return for my honest opinion. I love everything vitamin C, so I was excited to give this product a try, and it did not disappoint. Vitamin C, however, is just one of the power ingredients in this cream. It also contains squalane, lemon skin ferment, glycerin, and rose extract. I have been using the Biossance rose oil for a long time, and this moisturizer has the same soothing and softening properties, but in a lightweight gel-cream that sinks in quickly, and leaves nothing but softness behind. I also like the light, barely there scent (same as their rose oil).#skincare #selfcare #cosmetics #beauty #hygge #beautycontent #skincareenthusiast #skincareinfluencer #review #influencer #producttester #pr #collabs #honestreview #glowyskin #antiaging #glassskin #nofilter #BrightByBiossance #GlowByBiossance #complimentary @Biossance @Influenster #Biossance #Influenster #vitaminC #squalene #moisturizer Great lightweight moisturizer
