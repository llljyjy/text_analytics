I got a sample of this from an order and decided to try it a few days after getting a vampire facial to help with peeling. OMG the smell was awful, I thought it was rancid. Luckily, nothing happened to my skin except some slight burning but then I totally forgot about the smell (bc you donâ€™t notice it until its too late and on your face) and applied it again the next day. Straight into the garbage. Smells terrible
