So I was using this serum for a while and I got halfway through the bottle before I got robbed. I was naturally upset cause it’s pretty expensive so I didn’t end up buying a new one. Boy was that a mistake! I didn’t realize how much this serum was doing for my skin until I wasn’t using it! It’s also just so luxurious and moisturizing it really makes a morning routine. I recommend. You'll miss it when it's gone!
