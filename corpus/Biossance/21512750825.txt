I use this in tandem with the Shiseido Cleansing Oil for my double-cleanse routine, and I love it! The smell is nice, a little mix of floral and medicinal. The consistency is a loose gel, so I think this would be a great option for anyone with oily skin. It lathers up well without being overwhelming, and one pump with water goes a very long way. I’m able to wash my face, décolletage, and ears with one pump, so I think it’s very effective. I have pretty sensitive skin with acne, and it has not negatively affected me at all with this past month of usage. Great for sensitive skin!
