For me, this is the Best oil for facial massage and gua sha ritual that I have used so far.  The inclusion of the ingredient from the evergreen mastic tree that is only harvested in one location in the Mediterranean must be the secret.  A bit of research was very revealing.  I find that I keep teaching for my Biossance products before others.  My skin loves this oil! Perfect!
