As a cream-based product, it will feel slightly heavy at first but after a few minutes, itâ€™ll absorb and the skin will feel softer. It goes decently well under makeup, as you will see in the photo below. The one major downside to the product is the scent. I am aware they did not add any fragrance to it but from the glass container it smells fermented or like some type of alcohol. Thankfully, that scent fades away in less than a minute. I personally like a lighter moisturizer as I have combo-oily skin, and this product is heavier than what I am used to. This product is better used in the evening. I received this product in exchange for my honest review. Decent Product, Unpleasant Scent
