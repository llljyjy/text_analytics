This came in the Sunshine Set of Reese Witherspoon’s favorites. Although I wasn’t particularly excited about it in comparison to the sunscreen and rose oil, this silly lip balm ended up being my favorite item! It feels great on the lips and gives a nice shine, like a gloss - but nourishing and not too sticky. I’ll put it on before bed as well as running out the door to work. It seems to last significantly longer on my lips than a chapstick type item, and once worn off my lips feel much more hydrated. Favorite lip balm
