I’ve been using for a month and have not seen any difference in my skin for $70+. I usually use The Ordinary 100% rose hip oil for $10 to seal in my moisturizer at night and though the Biossance locks the moisture in too, it’s insanely expensive for not contributing otherwise. Invest in the Biossance resurfacing serum (it has next day amazing results) but save your money and buy a more affordable oil. Expensive, try Ordinary instead
