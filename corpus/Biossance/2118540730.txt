I really enjoy this moisturizer for my dry skin. I use it at night since it’s been extra humid during the day. While this company claims there is no scent many agree with me there is an odd smell to this moisturizer. That’s the only thing that sucks when using it. You can’t smell it once on but there is a scent when applying. Great Moisturizer
