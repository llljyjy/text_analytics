Disclaimer that I received this product from Influenster to review!I was excited to try something from Biossance, I didn’t have experience with this brand before but only heard good things about their other products. The plumping serum honestly wasn’t anything too special in my two weeks of use. My skin type is oily. I used it on its own, layered under my normal skincare, at night and in the morning, but didn’t notice any significant differences in my skin. What I will say is that it is lightweight and absorbs quickly -- no stickiness or residue remains. It does hydrate skin, but not longer than anything else I have. Wouldn’t recommend purchasing, it’s very “eh“ on my book. If you have an essence or a serum you already like, just stick with that. nan
