Ansolutely loving this cream from Biossance.  I am already of a fan of their squalane, so I was amped to try it in a cream.  The rose scent is mild and doesnt linger. It absorbs quickly and I have found it to work great under makeup in this cold, dry weather as well as a night cream.  My skin is loving it and it has defintely improved its tone.
