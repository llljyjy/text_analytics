I see the biggest difference in my skin when I’m using this product. For those of you that don’t know retinol is great for cell turnover and unclogging and pores. The cell turnover is exfoliating skin which is what it’s making people look younger because as we get older our skin does it less and less. However, use this every other night to start because if you start using it every night it can cause your skin to dry out. I was loving how my skin looks so much that I started using it every night and my skin started to just look flaky. I dialed back how much I used it and the situation fixed itself. My major problem was milia. This product helped resolve the majority of it Love it, but be careful
