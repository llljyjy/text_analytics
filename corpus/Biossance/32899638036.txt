I’ve seen this product get a lot of hype but honestly was hesitant to purchase this in full size due to the fact that I have super sensitive skin and rosacea. I got this as a sample and LOVE IT! So far I have had no reactions and my skin is so hydrated and smooth. I believe the slight hue helps cover darkness under the eyes too (at least for me). Once I am through the mini I will be purchasing in the full size! Definitely worth the splurge ☺️ Love it!
