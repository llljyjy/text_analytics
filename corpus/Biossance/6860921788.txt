I thought I was overreacting about the smell until my husband, (who has NEVER complained about a smell), asked me to please wash whatever was on my face off after kissing me. I thought mine just went bad, but after reading the comments clearly Iâ€™m not the only one that thought it smelled profusely of feet. Maybe it works well, but even though you get used to the smell on your face, others might not... Couldn't get past the smell
