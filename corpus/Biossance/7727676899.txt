I haven’t been using this very long but when I wake up my skin feels so smooth and plump! I use it on one my off days from tretinoin (I have spent almost a year working up to this tolerance) it doesn’t cause my skin to be dry or irritated in anyway. It’s a very pleasant experience added into my simple skincare routine. Great for sensitive skin!
