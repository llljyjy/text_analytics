Okay no joke, first time purchaser and now forever buyer. I bought this on a whim because it was on sale and seemed to get good reviews. Not a big oil person but thought I’ll use it on my body and hair. I have been lightly using this on my face for a week now, and my skin is thee softest, clearest, most balanced it has been in a long time. My rosacea is so calmed, it’s barely noticeable. My skin SOFT AS A BABY - I have barely worn a skin tint and my skin looks amazing and radiant. Can’t say enough good things about this oil. Only buy if you want the softest skin on earth
