Gifted by Biosance. Love the mission of Biossance- vegan, cruelty free, often receive great reviews (sponsored) from Dermatologists I follow. I love that their squalane saves sharks!! That said, I think it is a solid choice of retinol for those who ascribe to “the experience“ and gravitate towards medium to high end skin care. It does what is supposed to and the added bonus is the squalane combo which definitely helps with hydration. Downside- we don’t know the percentage of retinol and I am not very likely to spend $70+ on an unknown percentage of retinol. Probably will not buy, unless it happens to go on major sale at the same time that I  need to restock my retinol. Normal to combo skin, 28. Ethical, just fine
