I really enjoyed this product! The reviews are correct in saying it has a strange scent, because it does. You can’t smell it in the jar, but for about 10 seconds after you put it on you can. It dissipates quickly though. The moisturizer itself is really nice. I love that it’s plant based! It’s a medium texture I think. It’s not be the heavy and doesn’t make me feel like a slick ball outside in humid Texas weather. The smell goes away fast, worth a try!
