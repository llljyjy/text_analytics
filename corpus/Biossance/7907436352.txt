So, my skin LOVES lactic acid. I’ve used Amlactin body lotion religiously since my teens but until now, I had not found the perfect lactic acid formulation for my face. Well, this is it!!! This serum mixes & layers well with my nighttime moisturizer and other serums. The product is more of a thin lotion versus the watery consistency of other serums I use. It is hydrating and has not irritated my skin at all (although I don’t have sensitive skin and tolerate acids well). I’ve only used this for a few weeks so it’s hard to fully judge the resurfacing ability but I can tell I’ve had some textural improvements and my skin is so hydrated and glowy all the time now. Just make sure to be good about sunscreen if you’re using lactic acid. For context, I am mid-20s, fair-skinned, East Asian, with combination skin. New staple in my skincare routine!
