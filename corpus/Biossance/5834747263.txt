Just thinking about skincare used to give me tension headaches until I found Biossance, and I’m super excited to see these four holy grail products bundled together. I’ve shared these very ones with friends over the years, of all different ages and skin types and routine tolerances, and by some miracle they always seems to fit, “Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants“-style? The Vitamin C Rose Oil is so versatile and light; a drop or two to foundation makes for a really natural finish. The Marine Algae Eye Cream and Lactic Acid Resurfacing Night Serum are my evening go-tos (but note: the latter is POTENT so I like to alternate it with the Phyto-Retinol Serum). And the Omega Repair Cream is magic. There are no artificial fragrances in any of the products which can be surprising at first, particularly with the Omega, but I’ve actually come to really appreciate it as I try to go cleaner with routine. Amazingly versatile set
