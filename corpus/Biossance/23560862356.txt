This is my absolute must have lip product. It is the ONLY lip product that doesnâ€™t irritate my extremely sensitive lips. It is super hydrating, has a beautiful shine that makes my lips looks super healthy and stays on well with infrequent reapplications. I love that it is plumping without making my lips feel like they are going to go up in flames. This is the Holy Grail lip balm. While I wish it were a little less expensive, it is worth every penny. The packaging is functional and pretty and you can easily get out every last drop of product. I put this on first thing in the morning and right before bed and a couple of times in between. I purchase this gloss as gifts for EVERYONE because I want everyone to fall in love with it like I have! nan
