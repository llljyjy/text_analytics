Dries my skin. When I use it it dries my skin and makes it uncomfortable, I stopped taking it and I only use moisturized cream and feels great. Maybe is only for my type of skinny, in the winter my skin is drier than in warmer season and I thought that the serum will helpful but unfortunately it made it worse. So itâ€™s just a bunch of money that I spent. It was better if they were selling samples. Dried and uncomfortable skin unfortunately :(
