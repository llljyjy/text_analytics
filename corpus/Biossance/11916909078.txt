Actually a tiny bit disappointed - I’ve heard amazing things about Biossance products so was excited when Influenster sent me this product to test. It’s moisturizing and did not break me out which is great, but I hate the scent. It’s sort of dusty or perfumey... not your typical clean simple skincare scent. I may use up the rest of the jar on my legs because I didn’t love the scent on my face. It’s a nice thick cream, I may try Biossance oils but not repurchase this. Weird scent, nice thick cream
