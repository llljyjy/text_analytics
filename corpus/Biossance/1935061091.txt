A solid choice for a moisturizer. Slightly whipped texture that very easily blends into the skin. Definitely great for skin thatâ€™s in need of some serious hydration - would be an ideal choice for a winter cream when skin is more dry. I prefer to use this as a night cream since it is a little on the heavier side. nan
