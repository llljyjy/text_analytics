I received this cream from Influenster for my review and I really, really wanted to love it.  It is incredibly hydrating and for my combo/ oily skin, it is a great overnight cream. Daytime, not so much. I love the texture and the skin care benefits that I can clearly notice. BUT the smell is too strong and too pungent. Think seaweed. I have to hold my breath when applying it and it is a bit of a deterrent for me, unfortunately. And Iâ€™m not someone who is sensitive to fragrance or scents. nan
