Love this cream. Super thick and a little goes a long way so it will last for a long time. Keeps my skin hydrated all night long. Only problem is the smell - I can’t quite pinpoint what it smells like (dirty mushrooms?), but I don’t like it. It’s almost bad enough to make me want to stop using the product, but I love the way it feels and the scent dissipates quickly. Maybe I’m just sensitive ha. I recommend but we wary if you’re sensitive to smells. Perfect cream besides the scent
