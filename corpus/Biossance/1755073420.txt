Fantastic medium thickness serum that goes well over other water and oil based thinner serums. Almost applies like a lotion.  Can feel a slight tingle once applied and absorbed into skin.  I canâ€™t detect any noticeable scent. Love that I wake up to soft, smoother supple skin! Definitely a staple ! Non-sticky, easily absorbed, effective
