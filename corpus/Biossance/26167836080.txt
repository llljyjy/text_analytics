This sunblock does not rub in well. If you are a women or man of color I do not recommend. I have people constantly saying they see white streaks on my face no matter how long I rub it in. The white cast takes away from my natural color making me look washed out and sickly. I also have received comments about looking sweaty. It is not a nice dewy finish. It looks oily.
