I have gotten a couple of minis of this and I love it. The consistency is perfect for my combo skin as a night moisturizer. It softens without being greasy and my skin drinks this up. Really helps my barrier because I use actives and tretinoin. It does have the smelly feet smell but I don’t mind it. Goes away quickly and I know it’s from the natural ingredients. My only issue is I wish they would package this in a tube and it is pricey, but it works. Barrier savior
