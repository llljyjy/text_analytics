I love Biossance for its high quality products, natural ingredients and environmental friendly. I like this product very much but not loving it comparing to some other products they offer. I love how it leaves my skin clean looking, absorbs entirely and the skin feels super comfortable. What I donâ€™t like is that sleepers application and it needs extra time to absorb (all comparing to their other products ). I do recommend the product and the brand for its results. This is an honest review even though I did get it complimentary via @influenster Great serum
