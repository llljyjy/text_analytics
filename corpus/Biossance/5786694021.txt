I love this product for the first step in a double cleanse. It gets off every last bit of stubborn makeup without harsh rubbing. And unlike other cleansing balms and oils I’ve tried in the past, it doesn’t leave behind a film that I feel like I have to wash off before I can go in with my cleanser. I will continue to use it for as long as I can. Amazing for double cleanse
