I looooooove the omega repair cream!! It’s so creamy and luxurious! I have super dry skin and use Tretinoin so my skin is always flaking. I was using other heavy creams/moisturizers and nothing helped until the omega repair cream. I pair it with the Vichy 89 serum and it’s like magic. My skin is moisturized, healthy and glowing! I do acknowledge the smell that other people commenting about but it has never bothered me. I don’t get moldy feet vibes from it. It’s not like a sweet smelling product, but I personally don’t hate it. I love this cream and will definitely repurchase when it goes on sale on the Biossance website :) Love love love!
