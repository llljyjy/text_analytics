Love this moisturizer - thick and feels great going on. I use it at night, but would be fine for a day cream. I sometimes mix it with the Rose Oil. I donâ€™t notice any bad odor that some mention. Smells mild to me and does not linger. Also, I love the heavy glass bottle. It works well for repurposing too - for paper clips, travel pill case. Feels great going on.
