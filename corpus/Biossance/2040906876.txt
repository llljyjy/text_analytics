When I bought this cleanser about 4 months ago, I had been dealing with acne for 15+ years; had been on accutane 3 times; and was still dealing with clogged/problematic skin. I also became sensitive to certain ingredients in cleansers after my last round of accutane (developed contact dermatitis around my eyes after prolonged use of the cerave cleanser). I’ve tried so many cleansers throughout the years - mostly sticking to “clean“ cleansers. This cleanser did not irritate my eyes, and my pores are so much cleaner since using this. I also don’t get as oily as I used to. My skin feels very slightly tight after using this but not completely stripped. The ingredients list is pretty great, except for the last 3; citral, citronellol, linalool (fragrances). Will be buying this again! Saved My Skin
