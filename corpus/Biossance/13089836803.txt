I received a jar of this Squalane + Omega Repair Cream for free from Influenster. I had been wanting to try Biossance products I’ve heard great things about their products and now I know why. I absolutely love this cream. The only thing I didn’t really like was the smell of it, but other than that it’s a great cream. It’s a rich and very moisturizing face cream, it absorbs quickly on the skin. My skin felt so soft and hydrated, I use it morning and night. It has squalane, omega fatty acids, ceramides and plant sterols that deeply moisturize dry skin. I definitely want to try out other products, I recommend this face cream. Love this face cream
