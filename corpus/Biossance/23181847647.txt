I got this as part of an order as a sample with purchase :) I like the ingredients and so far it hasn’t broken me out! The smell tho is bad. Like when I apply it I can smell the weird, slightly rancid smell. It’s not cute and I won’t be buying a full size bc of it. Fragrance and smelly products don’t usually bother me, but this one is BAD :( there’s other thick moisturizers that are great and don’t smell terrible. Maybe I got a weird batch the smell omg
