Such a bummer. I purchased this instead of a similar product at the recommendation of a Sephora employee, and I regret listening. It’s a lovely formula that feels nice on the skin, I used the whole bottle religiously and even took before and after pics - no change. Totally not worth the price since it doesn’t do anything. Doesn't work :(
