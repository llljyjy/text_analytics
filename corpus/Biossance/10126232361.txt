I was a little disappointed with this product. I live in hot climate with high humidity and my combination skin can get oily and shiny. I would say this product is more suited to oily skin. I have found that it’s dried my skin and feels quite tight after 3 weeks of use. Rather than use it every day  I’ll probably change to a couple of times a week. I have given it 3 stars though because my skin is looking great as it’s reduced redness and left it smooth. Disappointed
