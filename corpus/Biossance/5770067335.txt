I received this product free from Influenster and biossanceIn exchange for my honest review. I’m not fond of the scent but this moisturizer spreads easily and moisturizes sufficiently. I like that they’re saving sharks as well. That’s a great feature and the natural squalene is much healthier for earth than killing sbarks so I’m glad it’s got that. nan
