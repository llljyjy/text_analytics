Really moisturizing with great ingredients! Has a kinda funky smell so I only give it four stars but otherwise itâ€™s it amazing! It provides long lasting hydrations and I love the soft texture of the formula. Overall I would definitely purchase again and if looking forward to trying their other products. Great Bang for your Buck!
