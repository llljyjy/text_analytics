Added this to my skincare routine after moisturizer when I started doing gua sha. It’s perfect for gua sha and it makes my skin feel so soft and look so glowy. I have oily skin, so I was worried about making it worse, but that hasn’t been a problem at all. Love it :) Great skin care routine addition!
