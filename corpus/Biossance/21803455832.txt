I went through an entire jar of this moisturizer because I absolutely loved it, but I swear the next one I purchased is a different formula. It now leaves my skin extremely greasy feeling and looking no matter how little I use. I will unfortunately be hunting for a new moisturizer now and returning this one. It used to be lightweight, soak right in and it was great but now itâ€™s almost like it just sits in top of your skin... I loved it before what a shame. Wondering if they changed this...
