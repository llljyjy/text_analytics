I received this from Influenster and Biossance in exchange for an honest review of the product. I have dry, sensitive skin, so I’m always a little cautious when it comes to retinol products, but this product is very gentle and did not irritate my skin other than the normal peeling that comes with starting retinol products. The only negative thing I have to say is that it is a little expensive. If you’re ok with the price, then I totally recommend this. Nice formula, a little pricey.
