When I initially tried this sunscreen last year, I loved it, so I bought 2 bottles of it. Most of the summer I’ve been inside but when I went on vacation recently, I noticed that this sunscreen sweats off immediately in humid/hot environments. I thought I wasn’t rubbing it in long enough or that i didn’t let it absorb into my skin long enough but it didn’t matter, it would be dripping down my face in a matter of minutes. I use a different sunscreen on my body and I would never experience this. I just went on a walk in hot Houston and again, it sweated off immediately and was all over my headphones, sunglasses and hat. Its like going outside after a fresh shower and you immediately begin melting. If you’re going to be in a cooler environment, its generally okay. It is on the dewy side and I think it gets kinda sticky until it has fully absorbed into your skin. I would only stick to cool environments but I wont be repurchasing. Black Girl - Humid Conditions
