The Biossance lactic acid serum is overall the best that I’ve tried. Even though the results are similar to others, I recommend it because its the only one that isn’t sticky and doesn’t pill. Its actually very hydrating and has more of a creamy consistency, and best of all it layers beautifully with other products! (especially when used with their omega moisturizer - which is also a great product) No pilling! :)
