I’m 34, and I want to do all I can to look my age (or even better, younger!) and I’m pretty sure this will be the ticket to that goal! There is not a scent to the cream, it’s very neutral smelling, which is great for those with sensitive skin! I’ve been putting it on and then doing gua shua, and because it is so soft and silky, the stone glides right over my skin. I can’t wait to see the long term results! Woohoo
