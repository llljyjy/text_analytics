This product does the job.  It removes my eye and face makeup without to much rubbing.  However, it does sting your eyes so make sure to keep them closed when using.  I didn’t find it hydrating, which is surprising because it has squalane in it.  However, it didn’t leave me dry.  One bottle lasted about 3 months.  I prefer the Amore  Pacific Cleansing oil over this.  Its much more hydrating, but it does have fragrance. Does the job, but nothing special
