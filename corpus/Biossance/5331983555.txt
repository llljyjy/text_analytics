Not sure if i got a bad batch, but this lip balm was extremely gritty. I had to still rub it in on my lips after applying, or I’d still have these little “grains” in my lips. Not a cute look. I also didn’t notice that it helped much with keeping my lips moisturized. I tried giving the formula time to properly mix/dissolve but I ended up tossing it half-empty. ingredients don’t mix
