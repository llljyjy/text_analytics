I received this complimentary product in exchange for my honest review. This product is nice! It sinks into skin REALLY well. It left my skin feeling very soft and supple, but I don’t know how much of a plumping effect it had. I enjoy this product as part of my routine, but I’m unsure if I’ll purchase it in the future. Nice, but nothing amazing
