I received this free from Biossance and Influenster to try. I’m more of a gel moisturizer person, because creams tend to be a bit thick for my face. This does tend to be on the thicker side, so I only use it at night. It does a great job on my drier areas, but does feel a bit oily on the areas where I don’t need as much moisture. I’m sure this will be amazing to use in the winter. Great for winter
