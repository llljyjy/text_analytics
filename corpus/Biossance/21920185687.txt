My usual serum was discontinued so I had really hoped this could be a good replacement given the reasonable size and price. Unfortunately, I really dislike it. The texture is thick and slimy, it does not give off a glow like my old serum did and generally does not appear to be of benefit to my skin. In fact, my skin has never looked so dull. Will finish this bottle and then will be on the hunt for a new one. Disappointing
