Nice moisturizer for dry skin, my skin is mostly normal but I wanted to try the brand, I think I’ve made a mistake since it was too much for a normal skin. It was too heavy for the slight dryness I was experiencing when I bought it.I saw many reviews talking about a bad smell, mine was fine, texture wise was good as well.I’ll try more products from this brand Nice moisturizer for dry/very dry skin
