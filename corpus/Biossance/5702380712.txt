I received this product as a free sample from biossance and Influenster  in exchange for my unbiased review. I tried this moisturizer and while it’s nice that it’s unscented from a fragrance standpoint the smell is off-putting to me. The cream texture of the moisturizer felt nice going on but I didn’t notice any lasting improvement to the moisture in my skin. Lastly it separated foundations and makeup that I never have issues with under thicker moisturizers Not great for very dry skin or under makeup
