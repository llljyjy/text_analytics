I have normal skin- equal parts dry and oily. This cream is lovely. It feels like silk and how’s on so nicely. It doesn’t feel heavy but still gives my skin the moisture it needs. This would he great for all skin types. The smell I fresh but very faint. I received this product to try in exchange for my honest opinion. Luxury in a jar!
