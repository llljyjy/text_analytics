This stuff is amazing! My skin had been looking dull and lackluster with some dark spots appearing along my jawline and some chin acne, especially near the corners of my mouth. Within days of staring this, I noticed a HUGE improvement. My skin looked brighter and more hydrated and my skin tone evened out. Now, about 4 months later, my dark spots have significantly receded, and my chin acne is completely gone. When I initially received the product, I added a few drops to both my morning moisturizer and my night cream, which was very effective. After about a month, my skin was so hydrated I only use it in my night cream at this point, adding 3 drops every night and mixing them together before I apply. I couldnâ€™t recommend this product highly enough and I was shocked by how dramatically my skin improved. This Oil is a Gamechanger!
