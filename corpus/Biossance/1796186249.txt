I have wanted to try this line for months. I finally made it into the store and found this perfect “let’s try it“ pack. When I opened it the next morning, I couldn’t tell the difference between the two tubs of cream, but time was tight, so I used some oil and one cream. When I returned home and had a moment to investigate, I found I had two face creams and no eye cream... I did love how great this product was on my sensitive skin and would love to continue using it... but I won’t make it back to the store soon, and online customer service said that they couldn’t help. Is the eye cream worth waiting for? I would love to hear feedback from other Rapid Radiance Set users. Great but no eye cream
