I was told great things about this product and it lived up to the hype. The product feels good on my skin and keeps it hydrated. I do use it as a serum though, so I add moisturizer on top (mostly because winter months dry out my skin). I haven’t really noticed any plumping but I’ve only been using it a few weeks. Overall, it’s a great product and I can’t wait to try other Biossance products! Great product!
