just for reference, I have super dry acne prone skin and I am obsessed with this formula! I struggle with some mineral sunscreenâ€˜s being too thick and drying down to a matte finish which only exaggerates my dryness. This light gel like consistency gives you the most beautiful glow and dew that sits beautifully under make up. I will say the way, I prefer to distribute on my fingers first and then press it into my entire face. I find that applying in any sort of rubbing way picks up my dry patches where as pressing lets the product absorb. cant recommend enough!!! best mineral sunscreen ever!!!
