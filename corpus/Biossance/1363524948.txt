I really love the texture of this moisturizer. It’s rich and hydrating, but not too thick. My skin is dry and sensitive, and this cream made my skin so soft! I’ve been using this morning and night and my face is hydrated and smooth. The only downside is the smell. It really stinks… like feet. Luckily the smell doesn’t linger but I could see that being a deal breaker for some people. I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. nan
