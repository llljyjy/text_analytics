I purchased this after reading the positive reviews for rosacea and acne. At first I found it to be a good cleanser in terms of removing my makeup, and calming the redness across my t-zone. Sadly, I found twice daily use to be very drying over the long term. Especially in the winter, my skin was left feeling pretty tight afterwards, so I had to switch to using this once a day only. A little annoying to have to have two cleansers in my bathroom, but will finish the bottle. Will continue to look for a cleanser that has cleansing, calming, and non-drying properties. Effective but drying
