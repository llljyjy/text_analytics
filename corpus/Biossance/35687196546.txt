Just like the copper peptide serum by biossance, this is one of those expensive products that actually delivers and makes it a worthwhile purchase. Smoothed, firmed, and moisturizes my under eyes.  Lovely smooth and buttery but lightweight texture, I swear I can feel this drawing the moisture into my skin. So good
