This is the best gel moisturizer I’ve yet to use!! It’s super light weight perfect for day time and really works well with my combination skin! My skin gets super congested so it’s a must that I use something super light in the am under my spf. Not only is it super light it’s also super hydrating, calming, and refreshing! Love love love! Hydrating, Calming, And Refreshing! Natural Glow
