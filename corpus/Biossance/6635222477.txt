This is a very thick moisturizer, so definitely more of a nighttime cream. It does feel very moisturizing and nice on the skin. I’m on the drier side, and this feels nice and non-irritating. It’s not scented with anything, so it does have a bit of natural scent to it, but it’s not bad. Overall, I wasn’t blown away by it, but I like it as a night cream. nan
