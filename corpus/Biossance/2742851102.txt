I’m a big fan of Biossance’s products and this is no exception; it’s quickly become my favorite moisturizer. It’s hydrating, brightening, and really lightweight. A little bit goes a long way, and I can see this being a product I use year-round because it’s light enough for summer, and has been perfect these cold winter months. It doesn’t have a scent, which I really appreciate, and it leaves my skin feeling float and fresh.  year round because it’s Hydrated, glowy skin!
