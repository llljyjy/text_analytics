Says it’s for dry skin type, but I have oily and acne prone skin and this helped with my acne. I needed a basic “plain” face wash that didn’t have any harsh ingredients and this helped with my skin tremendously!! Probably the only face wash I’ve used that didn’t leave my skin feeling stripped after using. Oily skin needs hydration too. I highly recommend this for oily skin. love it
