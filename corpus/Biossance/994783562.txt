I recently received a free sample of this moisturizer and boy am I glad I did! I live in the dry climate of Colorado and this hydrating moisturizer has saved my skin. It soaks into my skin and leaves it supple without feeling greasy or thick. This is great for me day and night since it’s so dry here, and it is safe for my rosacea-prone, sensitive skin. I’ll be using this product for the foreseeable future. Hydration Heaven!
