My skin type is combination, oily in my T-Zone and dry everyone else. It’s been drier than normal due to the heat in Arizona and with my increasing age (I’m only 35, so that’s a little dramatic). I have used other moisturizing face creams that worked well but what Biossance got right with this one, is that my skin STAYED moisturized. It was thick, creamy, not sticky, not overly fragrances and kept my skin supple. And a little goes a long way so you don’t have to use a lot! I would recommend this product to anyone who suffers from dry skin. My skin feels amazing!
