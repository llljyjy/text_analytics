I received the SQUALANE + OMEGA REPAIR CREAM for free from Influenster, Moroccan oil and Biossance. This product is indeed very moisturizing. It is a thick cream and you can feel it on your skin. I could only wear this at night since I do have oily skin and I found the scent to be an earthy smell.  The one con for me was it made my blackheads on my nose worse. If I wore this daily, I’d have to skip my t-zone area. I’m using the rest of this product on my neck and chest areas. I’m getting older and I want to help protect and moistureize those areas as well. nan
