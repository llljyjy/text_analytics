I was so excited to try another product from this brand because their eye cream is my holy grail. My thoughts on this product though I love that it is in a dropper packaging pretty common for serums but still wanted to note. Love the sustainability of this brand. The glass bottle can be recycled. Their squalene saves 2 million sharks per year! One dropperful onto your skin is more than enough and it can be used morning and night. It absorbs fast and doesn’t have a smell really. I really liked the feel of this on my skin, instantly hydrating and I’ve had no reaction so it works for sensitive skin. It’s too early to see any visible differences overall but it’s definitely a serum I’m enjoying. I think $68 for 1.7 oz of product is reasonable because of the high quality ingredients and because the brand is reliable in their creation of the products. I think eventually they may have a mini offered and if you’re interested in the product or brand this is a product to try! SHES HYDRATING
