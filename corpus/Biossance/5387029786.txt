Amazing. I am a very sensitive and redness probed skin so very picky with my skin care products. This cleanser is indeed very gentle and leaves my skin smooth, calm and hydrated, donâ€™t even need to apply moisturizer right away. And it does a great job washing off make up and dirt with very little product. nan
