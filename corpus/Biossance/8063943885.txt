I’ve enjoyed using this retinol! I’m not a total newbie to retinol but have sensitive skin so I always have to proceed with caution. This one didn’t cause me any irritation or purging, although I was only using once every 5ish days to start. Too soon to see results but I’m happy it’s one I can stick with. I also like that this is a blend of retinol and retinal, although 1 star off for them not sharing the strength or amount of either in this product. nan
