I got this to try via Influenster - This has really nice packaging and the vegan and generally everything-concious aspect of it makes me even happier to use it. It was a wee bit “strong for my super delicate under-eye area, but wonderful for yhe rest of my face. Ive used it several weeks now and am happy with how my skin has responded. My concerns are general skin-aging things... uneven texture, fine lines, etc. I feel like after using this my skin texture is smoother, better hydrated. I’d be interested to try other things in the line for some time tonsee how the results are after a good amount of use! This is very nice stuff
