I started using this lotion every night and some mornings. After a few days of use I started noticing improvements in my skin. Whatever ingredients are in here are magical. I had less redness, smaller pores, and less oily skin. I will be honest, it smells a little funny at first but you get used to the smell after a few days. It’s not the worst they just obviously don’t add fragrance but that is a good thing! I’d rather not have fragrance added if it would take away from the benefits of the other ingredients. Huge fan of this face lotion!
