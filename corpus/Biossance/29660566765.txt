My first time using a retinol and I’m in love! I should have taken before photos because I know my skin has improved. My face is so soft now. I’m skin is more radiant, plump, and looks so healthy! I only had minimal peeling with this retinol and my fave can be more on the sensitive side so I was glad I didn’t really experience any of the more drastic retinol side effects that. I use the omega repair cream every morning and it works great with this product. Baby soft face
