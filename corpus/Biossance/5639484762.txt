Despite all the positive reviews I was very exited to try the product. However I also could not get over the pungent smell. After using it for over 4 weeks I developed acne all over my cheeks. It definitely was the offender as since stopping, my skin has improved to baseline. I cannot even return the product since its well outside the return policy timeline. Hard for me to recommend this product. nan
