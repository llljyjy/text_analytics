This is a pretty good basic, thicker moisturizer. However, it’s not worth the price to me. I can get a very similar product for a fraction of the price elsewhere (think Korean skincare). It also leaves a bit of an oily finish on my skin. I don’t agree with other reviews about the bad smell. I use mostly unscented skincare, and I don’t detect any smell from this. Honestly, overpriced
