I’ve used this for four weeks. It has definitely made my skin softer feeling. I love that it doesn’t smell. It’s in a convenient pump bottle. It makes my skin tingle for a few seconds which I like because I know if I missed a spot. I do see less of a forehead line. I definitely think it’s worth a try. Works for me!
