just not in love. if you’re looking for something very very gentle, clean and lightweight this is for you. i’ve been using it for a week now and it’s not for me. i prefer something that foams up or produces a richer lather, the scent is a little too ‘green’, & i don’t feel all that cleansed after use.  All in all if you have skin that is mad at you, or sensitive skin, this might be more up your alley. simply not for me.
