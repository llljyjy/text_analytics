The Biossance Squalane + Omega Moisturizer is very hydrating, but absorbs quickly. It left my skin feeling moisturized, but not greasy. I think I would prefer using it more in the fall and winter because I have combination skin, but if you run on the normal/dry side, you may like it year round. Overall, a great product! Hydrating
