I have really dry skin but I do get texture and sometimes I pick at it (bad habit) and o get scars that tend to stay for a long time. I’ve been using this cream for about 3 weeks. I’m obsessed with it. It feels very hydrating and moisturizing but not at all heavy on my skin.  It is not as thin in consistency as their Gel Cream but not as thick as the Omega Repair (my favorite), it is right in the middle. This Vitamin C Rose Cream has helped a lot with my recent scars and overall brightening of my skin. I picked at my skin after I started using it and it helped a lot with healing.  My skin feels good. Photos are BEFOR I picked at my skin (no pick included of that) and AFTER (3 weeks of use). Love it
