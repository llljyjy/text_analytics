In terms of how this product works, it truly is amazing! The cream is moisturizing and goes on so smooth. It leaves my skin very hydrated all day and helps minimize fine lines on my face, especially after being out in the sun all day. The glass jar is heavy duty and feels fancy! I did take one star off for the smell. It’s supposed to be unscented but mien smells like something spoiled. I don’t want to have to hold my breath to put on my face cream! Add a little fragrance and this could easily be one of my new favorite staples. I received this product complementary in exchange for an honest review. Works Wonders, Scent Needs Work
