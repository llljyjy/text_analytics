I use this in the morning before moisturizer, use a tiny amount and it goes a long way. My skin has become more plump, bright and moisturized since using this! I have been using this about 3 months and the biggest mistake I made was using too much, only use about half the dropper for your whole face and neck! Otherwise its too slippery and gets into your eyes. Great Product!
