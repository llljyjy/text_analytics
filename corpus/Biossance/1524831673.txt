thank thank God I’m enjoying this cleanser! I’m one of those people that read 50+ reviews and heart a ton of products on sephora before bed. this makes the cut!!! I have sensitive rosacea skin and this has not irritated at all and i love the smooth feeling of using an oil to cleanse my skin. ive never done a double cleanse and think this is the perfect level of cleanser to take off makeup on my face - i dont really use it on my eyes and havent noticed a burning sensation at all bc im not using it to remove mascara. lovw the sleek packaging - and i keep the nozzle blocker when i travel and put it in a plastic bag when traveling. no issuesb i look forward to using it!
