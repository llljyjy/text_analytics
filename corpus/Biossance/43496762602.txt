I have super sensitive skin and typically avoid retinols as they are too harsh on my skin but I decided to try this per a friend’s recommendation. I absolutely love this retinol, I’ve seen such an improvement in my overall skin tone and it has helped reduce sun spots. This feels like one of those game changer products that I’m so happy I tried! Awesome for sensitive skin
