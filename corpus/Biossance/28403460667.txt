I received Biossance SQUALANE + OMEGA REPAIR CREAM for free for my honest review. And I promise you I will give you my honest review. The cream was thin and easy to spread. It did not leave my face greasy. I did not notice any difference in my face though. Are used it for over two weeks. I honestly would never buy this cream, not because I did not see a difference, but because of the smell. As soon as I opened up the jar, it smelled like vomit. I put it on my face and it smelled like vomit. I put it in the fridge, hoping that it may change the smell if it was cold, and drumroll please, it still smells like vomit. This is honestly the worst face cream I have ever smelled and I wanted to throw up every time I put it on my face. I wish you could smell this through the picture
