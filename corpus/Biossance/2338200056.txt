I’ve been using this every morning and night for a few months and my pores are completely empty. It says it’s pore-minimizing but I haven’t noticed if my pores appear smaller, but they are completely clean and empty for the first time in my life. I’ve struggled with acne and blackheads on my nose, but after using this daily, my skin is the cleanest it’s been. After washing I pour a few drops on my fingers and rub on my nose, cheeks, and forehead, and then pat it in. It’s very gentle; I haven’t experienced any drying. It’s a perfect product. Buy this if you want clean pores!
