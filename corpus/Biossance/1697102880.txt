I love the thickness and moisture this lotion provides without leaving your face greasy or shiny. It absorbs well and you don’t need much! I also love that it’s a clean ingredient product as that is very important to me. The downside is the smell. It is rancid. BUT after application it fades quickly and I don’t notice it. I just try not to breath it in while applying. It doesn’t stop me from using the product. I received this product for free from Influenster and Biossance but my opinions are my own. Great minus the smell
