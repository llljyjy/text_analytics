I really enjoyed the texture and feel of this after taking a shower and I assumed the terrible smell would go away with time but throughout the day, the smell was actually somehow getting worse after mixing with my body chemistry. The cream is great but the smell is actually unbearable to the point where I canâ€™t use it ever again. Nice texture, terrible smell.
