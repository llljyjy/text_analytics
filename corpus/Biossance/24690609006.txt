I’ve heard about this brand and have always been interesting in trying it. I have very very dry skin so it’s hard to find a moisturizer that absorbs and helps with dryness. This cream really surprised me! I love the ingredients and how it made my skin look and feel. I found that it sat really well under makeup as well. However, I do have some issues with it…. the smell is not good. It literally makes my nose scrunch up. Kinda smells like dirty clothes. Not a fan at all. The smell does go away once it’s rubbed in tho. It’s also a pretty expensive cream. I really wish this smelled better and if I did it would be a go to for me! nan
