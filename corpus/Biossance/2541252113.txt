This face moisturizer is lightweight and really hydrates the skin. My face becomes very dry in the cold winter months and this moisturizer is great at combating my dry skin without the heavy feeling. I was nervous the smell was going to be over powering but it was subtle and nice. Lightweight and moisturizing
