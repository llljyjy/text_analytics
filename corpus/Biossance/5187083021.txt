I will agree with other reviewers that the smell is a bit off-putting, but that aside, this is the best moisturizer I have ever used--if that were to be changed, Iâ€™d be completely in love. I use this at night along with several other skincare products & never feel greasy or weighed down. I have also noticed clearer skin since I started using this moisturizer over others. nan
