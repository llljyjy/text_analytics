I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I can’t get enough of this stuff! It goes on thick but my skin immediately soaks it up. It’s not greasy or overbearing on my t-zone. My only complaint is the jarring smell that usually goes away when I layer sunscreen on top. Amazing all day moisture!
