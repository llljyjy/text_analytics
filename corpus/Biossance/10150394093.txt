I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This is the first product I am using from Biossance. While I thought this cream will be thick and heavy, the texture of it was deceiving. Right after the application, it absorbed into my skin right away leaving it silky and smooth. For its richness, it is uniquely lightweight. I truly enjoyed how it feels on my face. I think itâ€™s great for being worn under the makeup with a primer. The smell was somewhat off-putting, it has the earthy notes of umami, but I was not bothered as it evaporated quickly. I think it lacks richness for a night time moisturizer, but if you pair it will a sleeping mask - it will be perfect. Great product, I truly enjoyed it. Lightweight
