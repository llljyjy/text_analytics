I’ve been using this for about a month now and so far I love it, my skin had been super dry after winter and this cream repaired it.It has a thick consistency that immediately after applying it makes your skin feel and look hydrated and healthy. It has a slight smell to it but  it’s not strong and it goes away quickly. Magic in a jar
