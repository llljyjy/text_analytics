I use this as my nighttime eye cream and it’s amazingly hydrating. I use tretinoin and like to apply this eye cream first to prevent the tretinoin from migrating too close to my eyes and keep my under eyes nice and hydrated through the night. It’s pretty thick, but it works for day time use under my tinted sunscreen as well. I think it helps to plump up my skin and may even be helping with the appearance of my dark circles. I will definitely repurchase this! Rich and hydrating
