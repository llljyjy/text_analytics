I picked this up on the Biossance website, but I’m also posting a review here because I love this serum and I want to tell people about it! It’s stupid cold here right now, and my skin is dry because of it. But after about a week of using this, my skin is definitely more moisturized, firm and glowy. I love that it isn’t sticky like my other peptide serums have been, and I haven’t had issues with it irritating my eyes or making me break out. My skin just looks really nice and even. Be aware, though, a little goes a long way. A few drops cover my face and neck. A beautiful serum
