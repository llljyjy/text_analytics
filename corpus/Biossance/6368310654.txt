I love that this moisturizer has Vitamin C in it, so I don’t need a separate serum for that. This moisturizer left my face feeling very soft and glowy. It has a very light scent and goes on nicely. My only complaint is that it’s a little greasier than I’m used to, but that’s what helps to give a dewy look. I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Very nice!!
