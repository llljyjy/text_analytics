This was recommended to me by a beauty advisor in a local store. I try to avoid chemical sunscreens and have VERY sensitive skin.  I have tried to wear this, because it absorbs nicely with no white cast, BUT every day I put it on, I end up with annoyingly itchy skin by lunch time.  I’ve gone weeks between wearing it sometimes, just to make sure it wasn’t something else in my regimen. Sure enough, I’m totally fine until I go back to this sunscreen. I’ll stick with the Supergoop mineral screen! Itchy!
