In just a few weeks after using all of these products my skin has never looked better. I wake up with soft glowing skin where I used to wake up with dry, dull skin. The lactic acid is a game changer. I used to use Good Genes for years but recently switched to BIOSSANCE’s and wow there is a huge difference. It’s made from natural products and your skin will thank you after not having harsh chemicals on your face. My sun spots have faded in just a few weeks. I posted my three week skin after using all of these products plus a few more by Biossance. The vitamin C oil is a must. I use it during the day and it keeps my skin hydrated all day. I have been using it for three weeks everyday and the bottle is only 1/4 of the way gone. These sample products go a long way so it’s great to get sets like this to try. The eye cream feels so good! Not gunky or leaves any residue. I hated eye creams before because they would feel heavy and pilling on my skin. This eye cream is so soft and glides on like butter. The omega cream is beyond perfect. I have it and the other moisturizer they sell and this one is great for night because it’s a little thicker, but I’ve also used it in the day with zero issues of feeling thick. It goes on and absorbs so good into your skin. I have not found a skin care line where I love all of their products until now. I am so glad I did! Your skin will glow!
