Smells like rose and tastes like rose too.  Iâ€™m giving four stars because the rose in it turns my lips a bit pale.  It also lasts only about eight or nine weeks.  I do think this would be great for others that spend lots of hours in the sun.  Love the rosy hue that it leaves on my lips after I wipe it off.  Because I bought this for traveling maybe the version I got was a bit different than if I bought at a kiosk or ordered direct. Smells like Roses!
