It’s okay. I’ve been using it now for a couple months and I haven’t noticed anything different with my skin. I would like to note my skin is in excellent condition, so I guess this product maintained my skin’s health well. I really like the consistency of this product, and find that it absorbs pretty quickly. I would buy this again as a day serum for the summer. Good, not great
