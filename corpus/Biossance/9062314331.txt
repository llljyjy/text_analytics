My ultra dry skin has loved this serum!It really has a very fast hydration effect and the good thing is that it lasts throughout the day thanks to its hydration trio Hyaluronic Acid, Polyglutamic Acid and Squalane. Its texture is a kind of watery gel that absorbs super well, it’s not sticky or greasy and I think it could be good for any skin. Its color is very pretty and is given by copper peptides that help the production of collagen and elastin for firmer skin.I’ve only been using this serum for a month so I haven’t been able to notice any greater benefits apart from hydration. Really nice plumping serum
