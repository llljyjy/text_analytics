Great moisturizer! Little thick for me in the summer, but I’m sure my fave would love it in the winter. The scent, while faint, is just so-so for me. But probably best for sensitive skin. This also sinks right in, which is nice (not sticky on your face). I’m 36, so this is great for my “starting to age” skin ;) Great moisturizer- recommend!
