It took me a little while to come around to this moisturizer. My skin is really sensitive so I broke out on the first few uses. That’s normal for me though, so when it went away after a day or so, it left my skin feeling really soft. One thing I don’t like is how thick it feels on my face for the first half hour or so. Otherwise, great product! Decent Cream
