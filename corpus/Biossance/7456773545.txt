This is a thick cream, but it does not clog your pores. It absorbs into the skin very well and gives skin a more supple look. It is lightweight, and once it’s absorbed you can’t feel it. There are no harsh smells or fragrances, either. I have oily, so it is always a plus when the first ingredient is water. Another perk is that it is plant based, so I don’t have to worry about putting harsh chemicals on my face that might cause breakouts. Moisturizing
