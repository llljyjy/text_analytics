I am a huge fan of Biossance already. This new product did not disappoint. I received this complimentary to test and review which made me very happy. The moisturizer looks like it will be heavy or oily but it is actually light and quicker to absorb than i was expecting. It does have a rose scent but barely there. Its clean product and squalane that DOENT harm sharks at all. Love it and will continue to use it. Skin feel moisturized, wrinkles are still there. Biossance is always a hit
