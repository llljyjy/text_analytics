Pros: lovely packaging, very light scent, didn’t irritate my dry winter skin, great formulaCons/neutrals: no real noticeable difference (I would argue there were no instant differences other than the moisturization you’d expect from putting any liquid on your skin), takes a while to notice any benefit, expensive for what results I’ve seen. Overall I don’t think this is a bad product. It may just be that it’s not as aggressive as my skin needs! I’m used to using more intense serums, this is a great option for someone that wants something light! nan
