Bought this in the Sephora sale because of good reviews, tried it two days and went back and bought more before the sale ended because I loved it so much. I have very dry sensitive skin. This doesn’t break me out, doesn’t cause acne, and absolutely makes my skin feel more plump and hydrated. I can wear it under makeup too without pilling. Love love love. pricey but so worth it.
