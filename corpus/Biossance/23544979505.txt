I love this moisturizer. This is not something that disappears on your skin and does nothing. It’s a really great thick creamy moisturizer that actually works. it does not smell funny at all to me, it just has no fragrance in it which is much better for my sensitive skin. I don’t have any itchiness or irritation or acne from this product. just smooth glowy hydrated skin. it feels really soothing and calming and it’s great to have if you’re using or have overused any exfoliating products that your skin may need to repair from. I really feel like the squalene from the Biossance line does wonders for my skin. Love
