I received this product for free from influenster and Biossance in exchange for my honest review. What I love about it is that it’s lightweight but hydrating. Vitamin C and Squalene works wonders on my skin. This does have fragrance but it’s pleasant. Not too overpowering. Biossance is one of my favorite brands and I love their products. nan
