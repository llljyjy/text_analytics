This is a god send. This cleanser is so effortless and gentle yet works like magic for my skin.  It gives that clean skin feeling without making my skin dry or flaky.  Bonus is that this is vegan and cruelty free.  I believe this 200 ml bottle should last for at least 5-6 months (if used 2 times a day).  1 or 1.5 pumps are enough for use on my face and neck.  I’m so glad I ordered this during the sale on Biossance’s website.  I also received a few free minis of their other products to try out.  They always have some gift packs available where you basically pay the price of one product and get a few others for free.  Do try this out if you have been struggling with any kind of dry and sensitive skin issues.  A good cleanser is the first step towards your skincare goals.  It’ll improve the efficiency of other products you use afterwards! Best cleanser for dry and sensitive skin!
