I really like how rich and moisturizing this face cream is.  My skin type is combination but I feel like it has been a lot more dry with pregnancy. This moisturizer leaves my face feeling plump and looking dewy and it doesnâ€™t look as dry the next morning. It wears well under my makeup after it has absorbed and I like that I can dip into it vs pumping the cream out. Rich and dewy
