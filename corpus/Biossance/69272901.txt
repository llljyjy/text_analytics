I wanted to like this - and I did at first. The texture is nice and lightweight, and it absorbs nicely into the skin. There’s no sunscreen smell or heavy feeling on the skin, which is lovely.BUT - and it’s a big but - if you have sensitive or reactive skin, make sure you do a patch test before smearing this all over your face and neck. I broke out in a terribly itchy, red rash from this. I had used it a couple of times while alternating it with my old formula Farmacy sunscreen (trying to find a replacement after it was reformulated), but after wearing it for a few days straight, I broke out in a rash. I thought maybe it was something else and when back to my remaining Farmacy while my face and neck healed then tried it again. The rash came back almost instantly. I washed it all off and did a patch on my arm and within 24 hours I had a rash that lasted a few days. So, do yourself a favor and try a sample before you commit to it, just in case. A nice formula…if you aren’t allergic to it
