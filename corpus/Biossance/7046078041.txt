As a woman with auto immune diseases, I constantly struggle with severe dry skin and flaking on my face so a good hydrating cream is vital. This biossance repair cream did wonders for hydrating my skin, leaving it smooth and glowing. I also felt less chapped for longer periods and loved the appearance of my skin as I used it over time. The only reason it didn’t get 5 stars is the tea tree oil smell, which although faint, I could smell and is one smell I absolutely hate, but even that wasn’t enough to keep my from using it. I do recommend this product for anyone looking for hydration! I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. Feels Amazing on my Skin
