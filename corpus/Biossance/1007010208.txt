I’m confused why this is so highly reviewed, but the reviews (and ingredients) are what drew me...sadly, it’s hype. This applies well under makeup and is non-irritating, but offers little hydration. When I used this overnight, my under eye area actually looked drier in the morning. Would not recommend and will not repurchase. Overhyped
