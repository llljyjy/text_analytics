I see a huge difference in my skin with this, unfortunately I have to move on.  I am to the point where I am struggling to put this on because of the smell.  It smells like toe jam, not feet.  I almost wish it smelled like feet lol that might be more tolerable.  I read on the Biossance website that they suggest adding some of their Vitamin C Rose Oil into it but it didnâ€™t help at all.  It does dissipate some, but I swear I get whiffs of it throughout the day? I am traumatized by it I think. I unfortunately must move on.  There are other really good creams out there.  Hopefully Biossance will make a scented and unscented version of this cream.  There is something else I think it kinda smells like but they will not post my review if I say it.  I will always use their Vitamin C, I absolutely love it! As for this cream, ah Bye-Bye. love the results, smell will keep me away though.
