I got this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I have just started noticing some fine lines appearing on my face, especially smile lines around my eyes. So when I received this cream i was super excited! It is very nourishing and moisturising! Very rich! Since it is summer time and it is quite hot, i tend to use it a couple of times per week in my night time routine. It works great, and although i have noticed that my newly appeared fine lines are smoothing, i think i need to use it a bit more often. It will be a great staple in my autumn/winter routine, since it is a very rich cream! All in all, ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! Highly recommend! Great for dry skin!
