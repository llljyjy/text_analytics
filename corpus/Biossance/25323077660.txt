I really liked both of the products in this set, and I’ve repurchased multiple times! The value of this box is better than the full sizes for sure. I can’t say much about the vitamin c in the oil, but I very much enjoy it’s moisturizing effect, and it oftentimes substitutes for a moisturizer or layers on top during the dry months. The lip balm is also really nice, I like it a little bit less than the LANIEGE lip sleeping mask, but for the ingredients it’s worth it. The only issue with the lip balm is that it occasionally has gritty spots on it, but I find it pretty minimal Definitely Repurchased
