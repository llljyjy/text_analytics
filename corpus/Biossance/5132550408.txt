My skin changed in several ways when I started using Tretinoin, including becoming dry and sensitive. I tried numerous moisturizers, oils, gels, and mists to combat the dry and angry, but nothing worked well enough to dazzle me. This stuff, however, does dazzle me.  My skin feels soft and supple again, and it even works well to prevent irritation. I love it. Glorious
