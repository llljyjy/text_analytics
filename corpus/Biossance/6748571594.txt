This is my favourite non-tinted mineral only sunscreen for dry skin I have ever tried (so far). - it is great for dry skin! I have been looking for a hydrating mineral sunscreen and this one fits the bill! It rubs in easily as well, compared to most mineral sunscreen- it does feel slightly greasy at first, but fades into a pleasant, hydrated feeling quickly- it leaves a minimal white cast on my olive skin that fades quickly. This sunscreen leaves the least noticeable white cast of any non tinted mineral sunscreen I have tried - good for dry, lighter skin tones as an everyday hydrating sunscreen, Stay away if you have oily skin or a deeper skintone! Perfect for dry, lighter skin tones
