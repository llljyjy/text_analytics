I couldn’t get past the smell to even notice any results, but I can promise there were none. WHOSE IDEA WAS IT TO PUT A FACE CREAM ON THE MARKET THAT SMELLS LIKE UNWASHED FEET? WHO SMELT THIS AND THOUGHT THIS WAS IT? WHO THOUGHT “THIS IS THE PRODUCT IM PROUD OF”? It smells terrible and does nothing but cause me skin irritation. smells tank and doesn’t work
