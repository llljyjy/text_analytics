I really like the moisturizing abilities of this product. My skin felt amazing and healthy. My skin is smooth and moisturized after only using this product for a week both in the morning and at night. Everything about it is amazing except for the fact that it has a very unpleasant smell. I would recommend this to anyone who can handle the smell. Great, but smells unpleasant
