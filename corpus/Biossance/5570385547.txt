My go to sunscreen. I got a sample a while back, and I held on to that sample as long as I could! I ended up caving and buying the value size. For reference, I would be considered tan-dark, depending on the brand, and I donâ€™t get any of the white cast that usually come with mineral sunscreens. Love love love this stuff! Skin tone tan-dark & it works for me
