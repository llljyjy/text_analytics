I am not usually a fan of rose bcs of other disliked products but this Oil is Amazing! It is not syrupy like drunk elephant (which I also like) so my skin soaks it up even better. The scent is subtle enough. This is my holy grail face oil. I also use it for Face Yoga and it is moisturizing enough to let my hands glide over my skin but also soaks up quickly enough to put on makeup fairly soon after. nan
