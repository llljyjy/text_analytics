I received this product for free for testing and reviewing purposes.I was so excited to try this, as I have never used anything from Biossance. This cream did not disappoint. While the scent was not great, the cream is AMAZING! It is thick yet soaks into my skin, making it feel soft and look hydrated. My skin is loving this! I love that just a little bit goes a long way and cannot wait to try more from Biossance. nan
