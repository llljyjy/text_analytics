This set is definitely a Biossance “Dream Team“! The lactic acid serum is amazing. I use this nightly and my face is perfectly smooth and fresh in the morning. The omega moisturizer is exactly what my skin needs, especially in dry CO winters. I use this day and night in the winter and just night during the summer. The algae eye cream is exactly what my eyes need. No matter how tired I am (mid-40’s, mother, working, and a student) my eyes and skin feel so much brighter with this line! And the icing on the cake is the rose oil! For a few years I used to put rose oil on first before moisturizer. When I made the switch to Biossance, I learned to put it on top of moisturizer as the last step prior to sunscreen. What a game-changer! It brightens, locks in moisture, does not feel oily. It’s such a treat that my skin deserves. This set is awesome! It’s a great “sampler“ to get a feel for some of Biossance as well as a great deal if you’re already a fan. Dream Team of Biossance!
