I rarely write reviews but I read many of them before I buy products and I have to give this cleanser 5 stars!! Not only did this cleanser tackle my stubborn blackheads on my nose but itâ€™s so hydrating!! The smell is absolutely invigorating and I can FINALLY say I found my staple cleanser.P.S The hype is real! Best hydrating cleanser for combo skin
