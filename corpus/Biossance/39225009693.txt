This is exactly what my winter-skin needed!! I like this formula! It’s smooth and refreshing on my dry winter skin. I feel like it gave me a deep penetrating moisture without the heavy greasy feel. It’s pretty lightweight actually and absorbed quickly making an easy to incorporate in my pre-makeup skin care. Rich yet lightweight formula
