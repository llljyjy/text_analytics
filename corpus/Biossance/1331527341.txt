I live in Colorado so my face gets really dry and since turning 30 I’ve struggled with some acne breakouts. It’s been hard to find a moisturizer that lasts through the days but doesn’t feel heavy and greasy. I tried quite a few moisturizers and this one finally felt thick enough to keep my skin feeling moisturized without feeling sticky. It also doesn’t cause acne flare ups for me which was another important factor. I’ve been using this moisturizer for over a year now (I’m on my 4th or 5th jar) and plan to keep purchasing. Also, yes, it doesn’t have a great smell but it honestly doesn’t bother me at all and still totally worth using. Love, love, love!
