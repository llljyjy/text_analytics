Love this moisturizer.  Bought the mini size to try out and am not disappointed. I haven’t seen any significant changes in my facial skin but have only been using it less than week.  I like that it feels nice to put on, disburses nicely and you don’t need a lot.  There is a slight odour for a brief second but quickly disappears.  Will purchase again. Great product.
