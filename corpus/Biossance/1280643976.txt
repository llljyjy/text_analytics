I am lovingggggg this product! Not greasy or sticky and absorbs well. Leaves my skin feeling fresh and hydrated. The smell is a tad off putting due to the fermented lemon peel but itâ€™s easy to get past. I have combination skin for reference. I received this product in exchange for my review. Yes from me!
