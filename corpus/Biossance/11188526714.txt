I was hoping this would be more nourishing, I’ve used squalane products in the past and I loved  them, this was slightly disappointing. As someone with really dry skin, I don’t know if I’d use this again, however I do think if you had normal to oily skin you would be fine using this. I’m about halfway through with this and I’ll see if my changes when I finish the jar. nan
