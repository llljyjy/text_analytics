I absolutely love this biossance retinol night serum! Its not too strong and does not irritate my skin. I’m not left with peely, dry skin like I have been with some other brands. It glides on smoothly and has noticeably helped with my forehead and neck lines/wrinkles. I have been using it for about 2 weeks now on my entire face and I’ve noticed my skin has been smoother and more radiant. I always make sure to moisturize my skin after and have not experienced any redness or irritation. Make sure to use sunscreen during the day too! Overall, I love this product and the squalane is even plant-derived! I would definitely recommend this is you have more sensitive skin too. So glad I was gifted this product from influenster to try! Super gentle!
