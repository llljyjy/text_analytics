I received this as past of an exclusive Influenster VoxBox and was super excited to try. The serum is a pale blue color with milky consistency. It has a mild fragrance that will not bother those that are sensitive to strong smells. The formula absorbs very well on to the skin and it feels quite well. It does feel slightly sticky on the skin but if you follow up with a moisturizer the serum sets. Overall quite satisfied with the serum and look forward to longer term effects. mild smelling hydrating serum
