I’m switching to vegan skin care and I really wanted this to work for me but unfortunately after using it for a couple weeks my skin started getting really sensitive and then red patches started showing up under my eye. I stopped and then tried after a few weeks and the same thing happened. I’m probably allergic to something in the ingredients because now I’m getting similar red patches from Biossance night serum. nan
