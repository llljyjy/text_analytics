I was sent this free for review. Does this work? Maybe. It’s hard to see results from retinol products in short term use. I can say that it is hydrating and does not irritate my dry sensitive skin. I do however have retinol experience. I currently use a 1% serum. I took two stars away bc even after contacting Biossance they would not disclose the percentage of retinol in the product. Of all skincare products, retinol is the one you should know the potency of. There’s no way of knowing if this is for beginners or experienced retinol users who want to continue increasing strength along with consistency. Strength not disclosed
