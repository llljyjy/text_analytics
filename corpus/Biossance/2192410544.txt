I decided to try this as my usual squalane cleanser was out of stock. I am really loving it and it will likely be my new “usual“. It is soft and has a nice smell and seems to remove most if not all of my very light makeup, I always double cleanse anyway with a second product so I can’t attest if it leaves a film or doesn’t remove everything. Price point is a bit higher than I would like but I like the ingredients and the brand. I’m very happy I gave this a try! nan
