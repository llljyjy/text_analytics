I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I really love this product. It goes on and absorbs it very quickly leaving my face, feeling smooth and plump. It does not leave behind any tacky, feeling or residue. The only thing I did not like was the rose fragrance however, I do not like rose so that is why. The rose scent does dissipate quickly, so that is really great. I would definitely recommend this product. I love the feel
