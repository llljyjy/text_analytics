Bought the mini to try it out, and found it quite nice (i have dry skin). I bought it for a specific dry patch to help it and it was okay. I wouldnâ€™t buy it again for dry winter skin but for a daily moisturizer, I quite like it. I found the smell to be a bit weirdly scented personally too. Pretty good daily moisturizer
