I bought after looking for safe sunscreen for my kids on the Environmental Working Group app and found that this one was certified by them as safe. Itâ€™s thick for sure, and leaves a shine if worn without any makeup. But with makeup it looks great after a primer. It doesnâ€™t feel chalky. It is filmy to get off, but thatâ€™s probably just because itâ€™s working ðŸ˜‚withoany makeup. But Good environmentally safe & skin safe option
