After using the serum for about a month in the cold Va weather, I love it for my combination skin. I pair it with various The Ordinary and Pixi products. The serum penetrates my skin easily, leaving it soft, dewy and hydrated. It doesn’t leave my skin feeling oily, even though it is a hydrating serum. My only negative comment is the applicator is not the best quality. I have relatively tiny hands and it’s quite awkward to squeeze the top of the applicator. Received product complimentary from Influenster. nan
