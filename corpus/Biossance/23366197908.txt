I’ve used this moisturizer for over a year and absolutely love it. It’s hydrating, not greasy and makes my skin feel soft and supple. I do agree it smells like smelly feet when you first put it on,  however the smell doesn’t linger.( nothing is perfect in life). I love that it’s not loaded with chemicals that are bad for you. Great for dry skin
