Bought this to put in the ends of my hair, didn’t work so well for that—but WOW, it is amazing on my skin. My face feels buttery and baby-soft, not oily. It actually keeps my skin from getting greasy and gross, and I notice that my acne calms down after use. For the size and cost, it’s more economical than a lot of other face oils. Buttery
