I received this product from Influenster for free, for an honest review. This is truly my absolute favorite moisturizer! Now the smell may throw you off at first, but it’s not crazy strong and you honestly don’t smell it once you put it on. I use this once in the morning and once at night after cleansing my face. After just a month my skin is so much softer. When you put it on it feels almost silicone like because it’s so smooth, but even with extremely sensitive skin I haven’t had any reactions and have only seen massive improvement in texture and tone. I will absolutely keep using this. Absolute Favorite
