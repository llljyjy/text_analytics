This cream makes my skin feel silky, bouncy, and plump! It’s an elevated version of my drugstore Vanicream moisturizer with more beneficial skin ingredients. I’m also really sensitive to rose scents and this one is sooo faint yay. I’m really impressed by this new moisturizer! I love Biossance’s Omega Repair Cream at night time and during the day in cold months. This new Rose cream is the perfect day time moisturizer for under makeup. It has a cooling sensation that I love! At night I can wear it on top of a hydrating serum and it’s perfect. I will definitely purchase this with my own money after I finish this complementary tub. It’s too early to see any brightening but it hasn’t bothered my skin- sometimes Vitamin C can irritate me but this is so gentle. for Impressive silky feel, bouncy plump
