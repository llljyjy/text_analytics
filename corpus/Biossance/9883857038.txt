I received this product free for testing purposes. I have dry acne prone skin and this product made my skin feel hydrated without breaking me out so that was a win! HOWEVER, The. Scent is kind of unpleasant and I couldn’t quite get past it. Even my fiancé commented on it when he got close to me. Overall a great product if you can get past the scent though! nan
