I bought this awhile ago and used it nightly, but I wasnâ€™t sure exactly what it was doing for my face to justify the $$$ so I moved to cerave. I then developed this weird redness on my face and just by fluke I used this moisturizer again for a couple of nights and the redness dissipated by A LOT. Well worth the $$! nan
