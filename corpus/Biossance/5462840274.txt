I was not a fan and not necessarily cause of the smell but the amount of hydration it provides. I have combo skin with dull skin in the winter so my face isn’t like super dry. I anticipated better results from a $58 moisturizer. My cerave cream gives me more moisture. I will go back to my Fresh youth preserve moisturizer which is amazing!!! You will wake up glowing and still hydrated. With this one my face isn’t dry when I wake up but it’s not glowing. It’s not worth it. Its okay
