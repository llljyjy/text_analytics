I immediately had to purchase this a after trying it (initially received a sample of this with one of my Sephora purchases). I have very reactive skin so I am always hesitant to try anything new on my skin. I use the ordinary alpha Arbutin, cosxr aloe sun cream (which i wish Sephora carried) in the am, the ordinary azaleic in the evening and thatâ€™s my daily besides the ordinary chia oil when I do gua sha. I have incorporated this moisturizer and my skin is loving it. My skin is already more even in tone and texture with only a few uses. great on my highly reactive skin
