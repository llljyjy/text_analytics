I really like this. I got this apart of a set with the full size oil and ive been slowly making my way through it . the rose scent is lovely, without being overpowering or nauseating. It does have a similar texture to Vaseline, but it’s much nicer than that. It’s thick and nice for laying on top of a chapstick or lip serum. It stays out throughout the night and keeps my lips moisturized. I def prefer to use it over other lip products to lock in the moisture and it does a great job. I wish it penetrated the lips and hydrated a lot more on its own, but I don’t mind using the way I have been. a rosy treat for your lips
