I saw other comments saying it smells like feet- low and behold, it does. it doesn’t bother me much though. it is a thick cream, great for winter skin. I use the vitiman c + rose hip oil and then apply this and it’s pretty leaves my face well moisturized and a good base for makeup without piling. I got this as part of the “unstoppable glow“ kit as I really wanted to try Bioessence. I’m not disappointed, but I’m not a die hard fan (yet?) either. New to Bioessence
