I wanted a clean, mineral sunscreen (reef safe!) that would be somewhat moisturizing and not irritate my skin. I switched to this sunscreen last fall, and it was just “OK.“ My face felt a little dry after it soaked in, but no problems. Then one day in June, my face became incredibly itchy. I dealt with it for a few weeks thinking I’d been exposed to a harsh laundry detergent on a pillowcase, but it wouldn’t go away. I eventually suspected this sunscreen, the newest addition to my skincare lineup, and stopped using it. No more itchiness, thank goodness! I also don’t feel like this worked as well as other sunscreens in terms of sun protection (my face was always reddish), and it didn’t do well with subsequent applications later in the day.For reference, I’d previously used and loved Neogen sunscreen (not reef-safe), which felt amazing — like a light lotion. I had also used and liked the Murad City Skin but wanted something that felt lighter (and heard the recent reformulation wasn’t as nice). I switched to the Josie Maran Get Even Sun Milk, and am about to buy another bottle. Irritating in Warm Weather
