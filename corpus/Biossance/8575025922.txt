I have been searching for a really hydrating eye cream that will minimize the appearance of my fine lines and dark circles. It did get rid of maybe like  half of the darkness under my eyes, and you know, I’m not crazy, I know it’s not just gonna snap back to the way it was when I was 16, but I wasn’t really impressed. Sadly enough, that’s about all it’s done for me. I’ve tried a few different eye creams at my ripe age of 22, (2 different it cosmetics, the farmacy one with the cherries on the packaging, many from the drugstore) and this one is extremely lackluster for the price you pay. I swear on my momma, The Daily eye cream from colourpop, ($16) is thicker and more hydrating than whatever the heck this is. To each there own, clearly a lot of people love it, but I definitely won’t be buying again. Meh.
