I would recommend using this product only once a week is you have sensitive skin. Itâ€™s great to fight redness but can fry out your skin if you use it too often. I like to apply were my areas of aging are, specially at the ends of my eyes to prevent wrinkles. The pump could use a better design but over all I like the product. Add to your skin care
