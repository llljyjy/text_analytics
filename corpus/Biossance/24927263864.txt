I like this cream. I have very dry skin on my T-zone so I have to moisture it daily. I read this cream works perfectly for a night skincare routine. I’ve been using it and it feels soft, the smell it’s not too strong. Only felt a little irritation the first time but that’s because of my skin problem. So I’m combining this with my daily face cream recommended by my dermatologist. Good for night skincare routine
