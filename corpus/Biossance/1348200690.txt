So far so good! I haven’t had any luck finding a physical sunscreen that doesn’t cause irritation to my skin and this one hasn’t cause severe issues. It is moisturizing and sits well with my foundation too. It is not too thick. I didn’t like it as a moisturizer alone though so instead of putting before primer, I preferred putting it on after primer. It had the slight sunscreen scent but not too alarming and is bearable. Overall, I would recommend this product especially to those with super sensitive skin like mine. Just need to make sure to double cleanse your face at night to make sure everything is washed off. Good for sensitive skin
