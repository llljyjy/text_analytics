I received a sample from Biossance and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I really like this retinol night serum. I have used Biossance products before and enjoyed those as well. This serum is lightweight and does not leave my skin feeling sticky. ILike that it is vegan and clean. It doesnâ€™t cause any irritation on my skin. nan
