I feel like the ppl leaving 1 star reviews are not reading the “How To Use” section. You’re supposed to put this cleanser on DRY skin, then massage, THEN wet your finger tips and massage and cleanse. It’s a great first step cleanser or a morning cleanser post gym or any time you need a refresher. This does not strip your skin in any way, perfect for anyone with dry/sensitive skin. I got this at Marshall’s for $12.99 and it’s definitely worth it, but not sure it’s worth the $28!! it’s very nice just like everything else from Biossance! Side note, the color is like a super pale clear version compared to the photos does what it should!!
