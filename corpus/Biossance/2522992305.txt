I have been using this product for 3 weeks and my skin looks amazing. This retinol product doesn’t burn my skin. I apply it every evening and next morning my skin looks just flawless. I like the texture. I also like application. Just a perfect amount to squeeze. I am considering to switch to this serum because it’s very safe to my skin. I don’t have any negative reaction whatsoever. Price is on a higher side but I guess it’s better than to be burned. Must have retinol serum
