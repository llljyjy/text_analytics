I love this as a second cleanse in the summertime (summers where I live are pretty humid). I have normal, sensitive skin that is easily congested so I need a cleanser that actually cleans my skin with irritating or stripping it and this fits the bill. Typically I donâ€™t believe in paying more than $16 for a face wash, but this is worth it. nan
