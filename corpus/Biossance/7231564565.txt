I love the benefits of this cream - moisturizing, lightweight, makes my skin feel refreshed and smooth..BUT the smell! It smells like sour milk or something is off. I saw a few people mentioned the new bottle didn’t have a smell so I don’t know if I got a bad batch? I can’t stand using it because it smells so bad. Unfortunate
