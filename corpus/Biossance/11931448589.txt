Influenster sent me this product to try and I really needed this! I normally use a gel moisturizer because of my skin type but right now my skin’s dry so I’ve been using this for a few weeks. I love that it doesn’t make my face feel greasy or heavy, even thought it’s a thicker cream. It doesn’t have a fragranced smell, just smells like what’s put in it if that makes sense. You get a good amount of product because it’s thick you don’t really need to pack on a lot. I only use it at night to deep into my skin for better hydration. It’s working for the reason I need it to and that’s to add moisture back into my skin. I would recommend giving it a try. nan
