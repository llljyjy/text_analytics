So gentle and it worked great on my dry, sensitive skin.  It removed  my full coverage foundation and eye makeup effortlessly.  Upon rinsing I took a cotton pad and there was no trace of any makeup residue. This cleanser made my skin feel so soft and it wasn’t  irritating and did not make my skin feel tight like most cleansers I’ve used. Highly recommend! nan
