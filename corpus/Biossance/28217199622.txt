his is my first ever product from Biossance and it most definitely gained all my attention towards all of its products. A Wonderful revolutionary cream I must say!!!Just going to put down all my feeling on it pointwise.✨Super interesting ingredients that work hard to make your skin super perfect. Squalene and Omega, both absolutely plant-based, organic, cruelty free, and works wonders on hydration and moisturizing.✨ Pretty sure safe for all skin types, but best for normal and dry skin✨ Best for all ages, especially 25 and up.✨ Super duper soft and glides literally like homemade butter. It genuinely felt like butter that my mom makes.✨ Has no particular fragrance, but felt weird in the first sniff( just like homemade butter). But it vanishes in seconds.✨ Kept me soft, hydrated and moisturized throughout the night and day. ✨ Doesn’t make you feel greasy✨Perfect base for makeup or no makeup✨ Worked well with all other products in my 7-step skincare routine.✨ Absolutely safe for  sensitive skin✨ A little goes a long way ( pea sized each time)✨ Pricey, yes, but Absolutely worth it!!!This definitely made my skin much much softer like baby’s skin, glowing from within , smooth, bright and hydrated. A super soft magical butter for the skin
