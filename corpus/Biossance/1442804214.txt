I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. Texture: This blue is so pretty, and this serum goes on smoothly. My favorite thing is when I layer it; it doesn’t pill. It’s one of the main things I look for in serums—the ability to layer with ease. The product could be worn alone but I love to layer products. Scent: no scent! If you’re like me and love fragrance free products this is a real deal fragrance free serum. Ingredients: unique, clean ingredients for a great price. Overall I enjoyed this serum. I have very dry acne prone skin which only gets dryer this time of year. The serum did an excellent job of keeping my skin plump. nan
