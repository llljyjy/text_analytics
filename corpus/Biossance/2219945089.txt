A little goes a long way, I used what product that was on the lid from packaging for 2 uses! Just a small dab on each quadrant of your face does the trick. Seems to be more of an overnight cream rather than a daily moisturizer for me personally. The smell is not my favorite but is tolerable. I do love how it leaves my face feeling if I use it overnight, I feel that if I use it in the morning my skin feels a little greasy throughout the day. Would likely purchase again and/or try other products from biossance. Complimentary for review
