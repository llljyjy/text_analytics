I got this as part of a box with Trendmood. I had heard so much about this and was excited to try it. After about 3 weeks of use my skin is loving it. I have combo skin, dry cheeks oily t-zone. This keeps my skin hydrated and no greasy feeling. My only reason for 4 stars is the price and that it has a scent that is slight off putting but does dissipate quickly. nan
