This is not my favorite cleanser.  I am trying to give it more chances but overall I think I misunderstood it.  I think this is meant to be a FIRST cleanse- the directions even say to apply it to dry skin (like any oil cleanser or first cleanse) and then slowly add water to emulsify.  The first time I used this I applied it to wet skin and used it as a regular cleanser.  And it does still work that way; and it still foams.  However; it leaves a slightly greasy, slightly oily feel on the skin after rinsing.  And the foam is mostly visible but it doesn’t FEEL like it’s foaming on the face.The next night I followed the directions and used it on dry skin although I didn’t have SPF on my face or anything to remove.  This works as well; however, I can’t judge its removal abilities because I didn’t have product on my face.  Again, it left a slightly emollient residue behind.  If you have crazy dry skin you might like this.  If you have oily skin or combo you will not.Now... after patting my face dry I do like how non-stopped and clean it feels.  But overall I don’t like cleansers that leave a detectable residue behind.  I want my skin to feel clean, not stripped, and normal (CeraVe foaming cleanser is my holy grail for that reason). Oily residue; not for me
