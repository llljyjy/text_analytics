Only discounting one star due to price. As far as the product itself, it’s a great one. I love that it’s vegan and cruelty free. Packaging is great. Formula seems to be spot on. I love the way it applies. My skin soaked it right up. Michigan winters are rough on my skin, so this has been great. Moisture is instantaneous and it dries very quickly without leaving any residue or weird feeling. Must have
