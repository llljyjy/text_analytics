I really, really love this cream and I’m thrilled that Influenster and Biossance sent me a jar to try in exchange for my honest review.  It contains squalane that is 100% plant-derived sustainably from sugarcane.  It is a lovely thick cream that is super moisturizing, absorbs nicely, and doesn’t leave my skin greasy at all.  A little goes a long way.   I was a little afraid that it would be too heavy for my skin in the warmer weather, but it is excellent.  My combination skin really loves this cream.  The only negative that I can think of is the smell.  It is fragrance-free which I love, but the scent of the cream is slightly off-putting.  It doesn’t bother me enough to take off a star as I really like that it doesn’t have fragrance.  I will repurchase it as soon as I run out. nan
