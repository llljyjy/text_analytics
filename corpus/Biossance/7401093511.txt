Take it slow with this one, they say you can use it every day, but twice a week has really improved the texture and appearance of my skin and curbed breakouts, without causing any dryness or irritation. More than that gets a little harsh on my skin. Will absolutely repurchase. I think its much better than the cerave nightly acid serum, and only needs to be used twice a week rather than daily and has a better effect. Power Player
