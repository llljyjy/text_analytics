I purchased the value size on Biossance’s website and am unfortunately not a fan of this moisturizer at all. I just cannot get over/used to the god awful smell no matter how many times I’ve used this now. It smells like feet/body odor or something, I literally have to hold my breath to use it. I’m just trying to get through and finish the jar because of the $$ tag. This moisturizer unfortunately is not moisturizing at all either. My skin feels really dry when I wake up in the morning after using this before bed time. Smelly and not moisturizing!
