I just didnâ€™t love the product. It felt sticky and I had to use quite a bit of it to cover my face and neck. I have dry skin, so maybe this is better suited for combination or oily skin. I also felt like the serum sat on top of my face. My review is based off of using this for a short time, so maybe it gets better over time. I also received this complimentary from Influenster. Just ok.
