This oil really works for my sensitive skin during the harsh winters of New England. Sometimes I use it alone but often times Iâ€™ll layer a creamy moisturizer over it to really seal it in. I give it a few minutes to really soak in before layering on a moisturizer but at night sometimes I just wear it on its own. very soothing
