This stuff is awesome and truly makes my face feel SO good and so soft in the morning. But the smell for me, is a drawback. It’s not exactly offensive, but it’s definitely off putting esp for a product to put on your face. The smell doesn’t linger once you put the product on, so it’s tolerable. The product does work though and I absolutely do recommend it!!!! Just prepare yourself for the strange smell Once you get past the smell….
