I would give 2.5 stars only because I was able to purchase it when it was on sale and secured the jumbo size due to hearing the good reviews about how moisturizing it is. It is indeed moisturizing and I wake up to glowing skin after sleeping with it the night before, but as I’m applying it I really cannot stand the smell. It’s not even a pleasure scent. The scent is unbearable.
