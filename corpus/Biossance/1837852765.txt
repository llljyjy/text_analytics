This is a great winter time moisturizer! When it comes to a moisturizer, I look for texture, scent, and moisturization level instead of any specific ingredients (those I get from serums). Even though I have combo leaning oil skin, I always prefer a rich cream over a gel formula. I also enjoy a nice scent to my skincare that’s not too overwhelming. This vitamin C moisturizer meets all of my needs!! It’s rich and creamy, has a subtle rose aroma that doesn’t linger too long (so much more pleasant smelling than the original omega moisturizer), and also provide just the right amount of moisture for my winter skin! I wouldn’t recommend this for the Summer or if you have extremely oily skin. Overall definitely a winner! A really good all-rounder!
