Recieved this from Influenster and Biossance free for review.  My skin is combination, so a little oily and a little dry. This face cream feels good on my skin, but Iâ€™ve noticed it could be a little heavy under my makeup, especially for the summer. I use it mostly as my nighttime moisturizer. My skin is definitely more hydrated in the morning. I would recommend it for people who have dry and dehydrated skin. Nice, but a little to thick for my skin
