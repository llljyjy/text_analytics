Received this as a free trial from influenced her and biossance for my honest review. Honestly this is one of the worst smelling creams I’ve ever put on my face it smells exactly like stinky old socks. They didn’t add any fragrance but maybe they should have. Doesn’t seem to absorb into my skin very well either and doesn’t seem to moisturize very well as it claims. I was really looking forward to this considering the price point. But was very let down mainly because of the scent. The glass jar is gorgeous. Other than that I don’t have many good things to say. SMELLS LIKE STANK FEET
