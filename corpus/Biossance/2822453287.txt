I received this item for free for review purposes.  I am currently still enjoying this serum very much. It does hydrate my face very well. The serum is not too thick and it isn’t sticky. It has no scent. The feeling after it dries is just fine. It doesn’t feel too heavy or dry. I agree that it does hydrate the skin quite fairly. I use it in the morning after I cleanse and dry my face. Hydration!
