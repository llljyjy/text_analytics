I picked this up after seeing it recommended for skin redness, and while it definitely brightens up my complexion and feels hydrating, it does not sit well under makeup at all. It took ages for me to make the connection between switching to this moisturizer and my foundation starting to peel off as I was applying it, but when I tried doing my face without this moisturizer, the problem was solved. I also agree with some of the other reviews that mention a burning sensation, although I just chalked it up as an “it’s working“ tingle--probably not lol. Brightening, but Bad for Makeup
