I switched from a popular soy based cleanser as I’m trying to avoid soy as much as possible. A friend told me about this one. I had a bad experience with another biossance product in the past, so I was skeptical. I really enjoy this cleanser! The soy cleanser I was using before was very gentle, and I wanted something similar. I feel this one cleans much better, but doesn’t make my skin feel stripped. There is a scent, but it doesn’t bother me. It reminds me of walking into an Aveda salon, which I like. I’m 3 weeks into the cleanser and I’ve had no breakouts or irritation. Most hydrating cleansers feel like they leave a weird film and don’t clean. This one leaves me feeling clean and hydrated at the same time. Worth the hype. A Worthy Purchase
