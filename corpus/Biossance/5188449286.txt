I received this cream complimentary from Influenster to try. I’ve become pretty picky about my moisturizers somewhere along the way, but I was really impressed with this one right away. The packaging is simple, but also intentional. The product is clean, no overpowering scents and it feels really nice on my skin. I’m excited to see the benefits to my skin over time. Simple & Lovely
