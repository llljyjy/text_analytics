I cannot go on any corner of the internet without this brand being aggressively being advertised and praised by any and everyone who has tried their products (most of whom are paid to give their opinion, go figure). So, I thought why not get a sample to experience the glory of these cream. Very mild smell, and doesn’t really have a very “creamy“ texture at all, it oddly felt like putting on a dry cream. It certainly also felt like that on the face as well. While I will say it felt the same all day/ all night, it just doesn’t have that nice ultra soft silky plumping texture or feeling that I want creams to give me - especially a repair cream.I’m not looking for greasy, tired of the whole slugging trend, you will never catch me putting petroleum on my face. But it just didn;t make my skin feel like it was being revitalized through the entire time I used it.I was comparing it to a Paula’s choice Antioxidant Enriched Natural Moisturizer and First Aid Beauty Intensive Repair Cream, and both of them left me feeling so well moisturized and after all day or waking up after sleeping with either of these creams on, I had that same softness and plumped feeling. I just never found it with this cream, it feels lifeless. I even have a $10 moisturizer (from Korea) and that does the trick immensely better than this cream.Seeing how expensive this brand is and how much people sing praise about it all the time, I was severely disappointed and don’t intend to test out anything else buy them. I would not throw it out but I am certainly not even going to choose it over the numerous good and much cheaper repair cream options that are already out there doing it better. Overpriced and overhyped
