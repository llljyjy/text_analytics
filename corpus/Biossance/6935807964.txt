I bought this through a biossance sample set at the same time I bought 3 other lip gloss /balm products. I tried one a day and instantly saw felt and experienced lasting hydration. Even when the balm was gone it felt like my lips had a seal of moisture on it. It plums but is not a plumper no stinging or tingling. I hate lip plumping products this is good and almost tastes sweet. This is my new holy grail. A little goes a long way holy grail
