This is a thick moisturizer so if you don’t like the thick ones I wouldn’t recommend this. So since it’s so thick I only use a little bit. It’s not the best smelling moisturizer but does the job. Keeps my skin moisturized all day long if you use to much and it’s super hot where you live and can look a lil greasy so only use small amounts. I also experienced a few breakouts when first starting this moisturizer they have calmed a lot now so I think it’s was just my skin getting use to it but I know where it’s so thick it can clog pores rather quickly so please don’t use alot just a thin layer. Overall it is a good moisturizer but it’s one of those ones that you have to be careful with if you have acne prone skin. This was gave to me for my honest opinion on. Good
