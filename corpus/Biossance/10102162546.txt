So, also a part of my coveted, complimentary #springpicksvoxbox was an offering from @biossance : its Squalane + Omega Repair Cream. Now, I’ve got to say that I’ve never come across a Biossance product I didn’t adore before; truly, they usually work very well for me! So, I’m really sorry to say that I had some degree of difficulty even using this product. Outwardly, it looks promising: nice packaging, definitely a “creamy-cream,” and it’s from Biossance. That alone would likely get me to buy it if I were out at Sephora and in the market for a new cream. But if I did, I’d be disappointed. For me, I couldn’t get past the smell. Now, it’s advertised as unscented but I got a strong, almost-nostalgic smell of chlorine-mold-mildew-y pool deck at the local Water Park, and I think we all know what the kiddos do in the public pool at their discretion. I don’t know if it’s the squalane or what, but the smell is so off-putting it’s borderline offensive to the olfactory receptors. A hard (yet sorrowful) pass for me; maybe it’s a wonder cream and will work for others who can get past the smell.  2 out of 5 stars for being non-comedogenic and vegan.#complimentary #SpringPicksVoxBox #biossance #texturelove #MoroccanoilBody @Influenster @biossance @mizani @moroccanoil The no-smell smell got me
