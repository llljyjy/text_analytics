I received this product for free from Biossance and Influenster. It’s truly a great retinol product for anyone with dry or sensitive skin. I love the gel-like consistency and that it has a bit of hydration to it to counteract the usual drying side effects of retinol. It does work well under makeup also but I prefer to just use it at night under a moisturizer. In the month I’ve been using it, I have seen some improvements in my skin tone and fine lines- impressive!! Great for dry and sensitive skin
