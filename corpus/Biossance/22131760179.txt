Biossance products are generally hit or miss for me, but I really really love this one! It has a beautiful milky texture that absorbs really well and doesn’t feel heavy or greasy like most vitamin c serums. I’ve noticed some overall brightening to my skin and fading of hyperpigmentation, but am not sure if it can be fully attributed to this product as I’m using it in conjunction with a few other targeted actives in my routine. This serum is very sensitive skin friendly, and I also enjoy using it under my eyes. The texture is incredibly nourishing as well, and I find this eliminates the need for a separate hydrating toner or serum in my routine. All of that being said, it’s still a lot of money to drop at once for a product containing a form of vitamin c that lacks peer reviewed scientific evidence to back up its claims, aka all of my results are purely anecdotal. But this has been my favourite vitamin c serum I’ve ever used (pure Ascorbic acid serums don’t play well with my skin personally), so I highly recommend if you have more sensitive skin and can justify the price point! nan
