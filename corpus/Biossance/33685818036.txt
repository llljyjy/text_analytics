i was looking to incorporate a vitamin c into my routine to help with my acne scars and this stuff is insanely good! i got a mini size to test it out and one pump goes a long way. after about 3 weeks i noticed my forehead and cheek scars were less visible, my overall skin texture improved, and my face was glowing ! i have sensitive skin and this didnâ€™t make my skin purge or breakout. im so happy with this product and im seriously considering buying the full size once my mini runs out! effective, gentle, amazing !
