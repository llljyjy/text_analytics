Really wanted to love this. The ingredients are perfect and it feels wonderfully moisturizing and nourishing, no stinging, no white cast. Unfortunately when I moved to a hot humid climate in the summer, this just looks crazy shiny and greasy. I can’t even control it with mattifying powder, my forehead looks like an oil slick. I will keep it and hopefully it will still work ok in the winter time, but I’m looking for something more matte to use in the summer time. very moisturizing, looks greasy in hot climates
