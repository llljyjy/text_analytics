I have really enjoyed this serum. It is light and hydrating, and the texture is pleasant. I received this for free for reviewing purposes, and I do wish there was more time for testing before this review as I believe that copper peptides take a bit to show results. The ingredients are high quality, though and Iâ€™m excited to keep trying this! Great serum!
