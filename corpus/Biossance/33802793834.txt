Great spf! It leaves a white cast that melts into skin in a couple of minutes. I got this because my eyes are sensitive to chemical sunscreens. It is a great spf but the white cast makes me look like one of Casper the friendly ghosts friends. All in all great sunscreen but BE AWARE OF WHITE CAST! nan
