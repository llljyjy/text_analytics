I received this product complimentary from Biossance and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I already use the Biossance toner on a daily basis so I was really excited to try this new moisturizer! Biossance always uses nice packaging and I like that their products usually come in glass bottles. It  enables you to use all the product left over in the bottle. I also really like using Vitamin C products in my skincare routine. This moisturizer is nice and light, it doesnâ€™t feel too heavy or greasy on the skin. It also blends in really nicely and my skin quickly absorbs it in. The scent is pretty light, not overpowering at all. I really like how hydrating this made my skin feel, most likely because it includes Squalane. I also appreciate the fact that this product helps with collagen production. nan
