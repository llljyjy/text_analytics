Love this SPF! I’ve been using it for years now and have never had an issue with it. It’s light, and easy to build your makeup on. Makes for a great base or top layer moisturizer, absorbs very quickly. I use it all year round (and I’ve lived in NYC and Texas), friendly for all environments. nothing better!
