I gotta agree with the other reviews that say this cleanser feels very basic. It’s not the worst and makes my face feel soft but I was hoping it’d remove makeup better. I have to go over my face twice to get everything off. I also really dislike the strong smell.. it reminds me of pickles. Not the kind of smell I want all over my face! nan
