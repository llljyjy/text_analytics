Two things honestly. First, I needed to look up Squalane, second, I didn’t want to like this product so much. I got it complimentary to try from Influenster & Biossance. So my thoughts going into it were, all moisturizer is created equal, right? Wrong! This stuff is like the milk of the gods. It truly has made me GLOW, and I’m not exaggerating. My skin is more plump, supple, moisturized, and clear. My skin tone is even and fine imperfections really do seem smoother. I will definitely be buying this again. My only suggestion is making one with SPF in it for daytime use. Currently, this moisturizer is part of my evening skin care routine right after cleansing! Glowing clean girl magic milk
