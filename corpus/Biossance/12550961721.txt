I’m 34 and have combination skin. This has become a staple in my morning skincare routine! My old vitamin c serum got discontinued and was advised this was a good alternative. With every product, results will not show up overnight — it takes time. You really need to follow instructions, in order to see results. After 3 weeks, of using this every morning, I saw my rosacea and dark spots start to brighten up and my skin tone started to even out. Honestly, a little goes along way. I like to spend a little more time massaging this serum on my problem areas. I’m glad I switched to this product! nan
