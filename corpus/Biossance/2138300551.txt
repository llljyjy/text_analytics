Even though I consciously try never to be duped by flashy advertising, somehow the ads for this product got me. In general I like Biossance but this does absolutely nothing. It also feels gross, like a slimy/sticky film that never really absorbs and does nothing to improve skin or even moisturize. Complete waste of money - donâ€™t get duped by the ads! They got me.
