I tried this as a rewards sample and liked it so much that I bought a full size. I have extremely sensitive skin. Most eye creams either irritate my eyes or give me those small white bumps around my eyes that are caused by too much moisture. I have yet to get one bump or any redness or stinging sensation with this cream. Only a tiny amount is needed, so it lasts a long time. I love it nan
