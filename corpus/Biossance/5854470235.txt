I absolutely love this cleanser!! The key is to follow the instructions - start with dry hands and a dry face to apply it, massage it in (which feels so nice), THEN add warm water to emulsify and finally rinse. I wear thick zinc sunscreen multiple times a week when I’m surfing, and it takes it completely off with no residue and my skin feels amazing. Makeup removal is super easy too. It’s moisturizing without feeling greasy or oily. Best cleanser!
