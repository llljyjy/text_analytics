I received the Biossance Vitamin C Rose Cream from Biossance and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This cream did a great job making my skin feel supple and hydrated. It does have a subtle rose scent which makes it very pleasant during application. I did not notice any dramatic differences over the two weeks that I used it, so it is pretty comparable to similar products already in the market. I recommend this product. Great moisturizer with a pleasant scent!
