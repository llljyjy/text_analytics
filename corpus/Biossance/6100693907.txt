For starters - make sure you’re using this cleanser correctly. This is more of a first step in a double cleanse, aka it’s meant to be applied to dry skin, rubbed around, add a little water, rub around more, and then rinse off with more water. Then follow up with a second water based cleanser. It has some decent ingredients, but still not the most outstanding. I agree with another person who said you kind of have to rub a bit harder than I’d prefer when first applying this to your face in order to get it to spread. Once you add the water though it spreads easier. I can’t speak for how it removes make up, but I think it does an okay job at removing spf or other impurities as a first step. Honestly though, it’s not really anything special. I much prefer using a cleansing balm, or even a cleansing oil. It also doesn’t get as “milky” as it claims upon adding water. I also think you might need something stronger if you wear heavy make up. Lastly, I feel like this product is way overpriced. I paid $10 for it at Marshalls, but it’s definitely not worth $28. Won’t be repurchasing. Not Worth It
