I really enjoyed this moisturizer. It is very thick however. I found that I didn’t want to use it in the AM under makeup for this reason but it is great at night! I woke up feeling like my skin was hydrated and glowing. I also liked that the product doesn’t have any smell to it. I did receive this for free in exchange for my honest review. nan
