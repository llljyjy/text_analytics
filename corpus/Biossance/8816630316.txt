So I enjoy this moisturizer because it the scent is fresh and clean. My skin prefers products that aren’t scented to the extreme. This moisturizer smells clean and natural. Love the texture because it isn’t too thick or thin. It is the perfect texture. Gives my skin all the hydration it needs and a little goes a long way. Clean and Moisturized Skin
