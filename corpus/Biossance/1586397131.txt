Nice heavy moisturizing cream when your skin needs some extra love. It’s mostly in scented but there’s a bit of a gross after-scent for a few seconds after you apply it. Goes away quickly, but it’s not pleasant for those few moments. The texture is nice and thick, but it absorbs quickly and doesn’t feel sticky. It can burn for JUST a second when you apply it after exfoliating. Not sure which ingredient is responsible for that, but it’s only momentary. Love it when my skin is feeling extra parched! Good for parched skin, not sticky!
