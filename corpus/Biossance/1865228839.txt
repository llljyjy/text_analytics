I developed hormonal acne when I was pregnant with my daughter, and it left behind awful red spots (post inflammatory erythema) on my face. As someone with previously clear skin, this was really frustrating to deal with. I started using this oil twice a day every day, and apply it after my Clarins serum. Coupled with my use of Good Genes lactic acid treatment, I have seen a DRASTIC improvement in my skin. The spots have almost completely disappeared, and my skin is absolutely glowing. Most days, I donâ€™t even have to wear makeup. I cannot recommend this product more! Holy Grail Status!
