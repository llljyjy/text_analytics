PROS:- no white cast- hydrating (i guess)- no break outsCONS- smells like pennies when the sun hits it - got a mild sunburn (didn’t reapply might’ve been my own fault)- will leave your skin pretty greasy- low spf, will need to reapplySo i wanted to hydrating spf for daily use but this one is too oily for my skin ( i have combo, acne prone skin, very oily t-zone)While i am not completely in love with this product i also don’t hate it. If you are going to use this under make up it is good, just get a powder spf to reapply through out your day :) Average
