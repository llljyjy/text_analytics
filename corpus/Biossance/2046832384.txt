I received the mini size as the birthday gift last year and really enjoyed it. I’ve been using LaMer cream for years and I find this one to be a similarly as good but a much cheaper alternative. I have sensitive oily dehydrated skin and my skin feels nourished overnight after using this. It does have a weird smell that I have to get used to at first, but it doesn’t stay on the face. Consider it being a muuuuch cheaper LaMer alternative I don’t mind the smell anymore lol. I’m buying the full size now my cream is running out. nan
