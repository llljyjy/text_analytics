I got this as a free sample and have used it at night for the past few weeks. It irritates my eyes and has done nothing for my fine lines. Iâ€™ve noticed more of a difference in hydration and smoothing around the eyes using regular lotion or moisturizer. I cannot imagine paying full price for this product. Not worth it
