This oil works! Not at first but I noticed the difference after 2-3weeks. It improves my uneven skintone. How I use it is I mixed it with my moisturizer and just slap it on my face and let it sit there for 5mins before I put any makeup. Iâ€™ll definitely going to keep this in my routine. This oil works!
