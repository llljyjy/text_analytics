I have combo skin so this is the perfect summer moisturizer for me compare to the other ones I have tried. This doesn’t leave my skin oily and my face feels so smooth. The eye product from this brand helped my under eye dark circles a little. I’m still new to this product and so far these are the only changes I have seen. perfect for summer
