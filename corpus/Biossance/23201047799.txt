After hearing so many great things about Biossance, I purchased a discovery kit and this cleanser was part of it. Unfortunately, I couldn’t get past the rotting seaweed smell to use it more than a few times. Worse, the stench lingers. My skin didn’t overreact or dry out with this cleanser - so that’s a positive note. In any case, it’s in the recycling bin now. Stinky Seaweed Smell
