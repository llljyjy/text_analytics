I adore this stuff so much. I have been using it for years and got one for my influenster spring box and couldn’t have been more excited. It’s thick creamy but not suffocating. I use it all year around with other products. But I only use it at night really. It works extra well for super dry days. I have rosacea and it does wonders at night Beautiful
