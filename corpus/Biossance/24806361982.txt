This cream is crazy thick. It feels really good going into the face, but doesn’t seem to sink in well. It lays on top of the skin and feels a bit oily. Initially, the smell in the jar was off putting, but after placing it on my face it didn’t bother me. I will definitely use as a night cream but I find it a bit heavy for the daytime. Interesting
