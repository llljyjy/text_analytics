This set is perfect for beginners to Biossance or current users that want travel size products!  The eye cream is the only product I’ve used that actually reduced my under eye darkness and doesn’t irritate and cause tearing if applied close to the eyes like others.  The Omega Repair cream is amazing for hydrating skin in these cold, dry Wisconsin winters.  I use day and night in winter and at night in the summer.  The Lactic Acid resurfacing serum is amazing to smooth out your skin overnight, I use every other night.  The Vitamin C Rose Oil is the BEST oil, smells amazing and leaves my skin glowing and hydrated.  I recommend all 4 of these products whether you are new to skin care or a skin connoisseur. Best set for travel or just starting out!
