I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. I love this serum! It is my new holy grail serum! It is expensive ($68) but a little goes a long way and it will last for a long time. It is cruelty free, vegan, and clean. I can recommend this enough. My skin looks and feels better. Iâ€™m so happy I was sent this product! The best!!!
