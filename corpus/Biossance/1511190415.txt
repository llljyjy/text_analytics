I received this product complimentary for my honest opinion. This is my first time trying anything from Biossance though I have seen the brand at Sephora many times. I can tell you that with the testing of this moisturizer, I am interested in seining what else this brand makes because this was a very high quality product that noticeably softened my skin to the touch and left it feeling highly moisturized. The texture is very smooth and the consistency is quite think, so a little can go a long way. The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars was because of the scent. It is rather strong and could be deemed unpleasant. I didnâ€™t totally mind it and thought it faded fairly quickly, but it is noticeable. nan
