I have oily skin and this was a bit too hydrating for me so I could only apply it at night. It’s definitely moisturizing and would be great for dry skin. My main con is it has this very off putting smell to me. The product is fragrance free which I usually like, but the natural smell of this is not pleasant at all. Luckily the scent doesn’t linger.I received these products for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. weird smell
