My favorite winter moisturizer!!! I use this for 6 months out of the year and then switch to a lighter moisturizer for summer (pink cloud by herbivore). My skin was moisturizer without being oily all winter and my fine lines and wrinkles were visibly reduced which was surprising!! Highly highly recommend winter moisturizer!
