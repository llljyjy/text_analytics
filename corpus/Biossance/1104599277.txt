I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. I’ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and my skin has never felt smoother honestly. During winter and spring my eczema will flare and caused itchy dry spots but since I started using this product it hasn’t appeared. The smell is a little off putting but very light and fades eventually. The texture is luxurious and thick but blends into my skin beautifully and keeps it soft all day. Definitely will be adding it to my skincare routine. luxurious
