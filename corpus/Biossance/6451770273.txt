I really wanted to love this cleanser, but unfortunately it did not work out at all. The smell is overwhelming, and honestly I think it’s too fragrant and that’s what has been causing breakouts. Even though it’s a wash off treatment, I’ve noticed I’ve been getting really weird breakouts on my jaw and cheeks. My boyfriend actually has been using my cleanser without telling me and he even start developing acne on the lower half of the face too. It’s a shame because I love this brand, but highly recommend not buying this cleanser and going with something else. not the best…
