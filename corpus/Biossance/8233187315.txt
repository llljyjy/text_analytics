This face moisturizer is my new favorite night cream.  It is rich and creamy but it doesn’t leave your skin feeling heavy or greasy. I have trouble with dry skin around my nose and this has immensely improved the issue for me. A little goes a long way so I also feel like it’s a great value for the price. I will be repurchasing this product in the future. Fantastic deep moisturizer
