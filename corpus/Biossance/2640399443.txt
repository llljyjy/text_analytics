I received the Biossance Squalane Omega Repair Cream for free from Influenster and Biossance. I use this as part of my nighttime skincare routine. My skin is dry with sunspots, acne scars and gets sunburn easily. I really dislike the scent of this moisturizer because to me it smelled like rotten milk. The smell goes away by morning but I think wouldn’t be able to handle the smell twice a day. The next morning my skin does feel softer and supple and looks more plump and hydrated with a dewy glow. It does fill the fine lines but when you don’t apply the cream, its visible again. My sunspots are still visible and haven’t lightened yet but I only used it for about 2 weeks. The texture of my skin does look smoother for my acne scars on my cheeks but the crater acne scars and large pores are still visible and I haven’t seen it heal those area yet. I still put sunscreen in the morning since this product does have ingredients that makes your skin more sensitive to the sun. Dislike the smell but skin is soft and supple
