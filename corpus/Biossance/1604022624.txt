This really didn’t do it for me. Some people are glossing over the smell as if it’s not that bad… but it’s pretty awful. Smells like rotting food to me so personally I just dreaded using it. I also thought it was a little slick feeling on my skin, like it say on the surface and didn’t really sink in. I used it for about 3 weeks and didn’t notice any significant benefits. Based on the reviews I thought I would love it, but it’s just not for me. nan
