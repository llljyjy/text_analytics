Finally found a sunscreen I look forward to applying everyday! Previously, EltaMD UV Clear was the only sunscreen that didn’t break me out, but it pilled so bad. This sunscreen not only doesn’t break me out but doesn’t pill either! So happy I found it- already got my sister and friends hooked too. New fav!
