Not impressed. This was suggested to me by an employee when I told her I was looking for something to help fade the lines under my eyes and the crows feet that are just beginning to show. I’m in my mid-30s so lines are just starting to be noticeable, nothing that should need a miracle. This was pricey but the lady promised me it would be worth it - It wasn’t. I didn’t notice any of my lines fade and since you typically have to use products for a few weeks before you see real improvement, I had to use about half the jar, meaning I couldn’t return it once I realized it was a bust. This might be useful for preventative anti-aging and it did keep my eyes area moisturized, but it lacks the ingredients needed for real wrinkle reduction. I give it 3 stars cuz the texture is great (more of a gel-cream), it’s very hydrating and it works well under makeup. Just ok
