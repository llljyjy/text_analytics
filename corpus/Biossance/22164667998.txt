This is a nice serum. As for plumping, I don’t feel any tingling and don’t think I’ve used it long enough to be able to tell if it has plumped and tightened my skin overall. I will say I have enjoyed it as my before bed serum. I feel like my skin has looked a little more even and clearer. Will continue to use so I can see long term results! Nice serum
