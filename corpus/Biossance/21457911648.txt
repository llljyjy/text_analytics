This product has great benefits. It truly does what itâ€™s supposed to do. However, it has a less than pleasent smell. That can be a turn off for buyers. I do not have sensetive skin, so I enjoy a scented cream. Others may not. This product has lipids which are essentially fats. It also has squalane, which is amazing for the skin. Try a sample size before buying a big size. I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion from influenster and biossance. Good, but less than pleasent scent,
