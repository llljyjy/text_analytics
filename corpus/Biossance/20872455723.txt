I received the squalene & copper peptide plumping serum via Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This was actually my first Biossance product ever! I think this is a greatserum; definitely hydrating and makes my face feel good. I think I will gravitate towards this more in the Spring and Summer as my skin is normal/dry and needs a slightly higher level of moisture in the Winter than this serum has to offer. It absorbs into my skin really well and the dropper is extremelyuseful. I also love the clean ingredients and the pleasant, mild scent. Definitely recommend! Beautiful serum!
