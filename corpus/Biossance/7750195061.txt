oticed my dark spots improved within 2 weeks of using this serum. I have used Sunday Riley retinol serum and this Biossance compares very closely to that formula. I have sensitive skin and this serum did not irritate my skin. I feel like the price point is on par with other brands. If you are looking for a retinol serum I would give this a try. Great retinol serum
