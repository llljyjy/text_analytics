I bought a similar set on sale, without the eye cream. I absolutely love the face repair cream and use it during the daytime with any serum, or as is. It is not the best smelling, but it is one of the most moisturizing creams without being too heavy on the skin. I find my skin has improved over time and not needing to use anything else. I love the night serum and am even able to use it as is. The rose oil, I’m saving up to use, but seeing the quality of the other items, I’m positive this will be another go to. I’m almost going to say this is holy grail at this point for me, using it for more than a month and a little going a long way, there is still a lot of the repair cream left. Note that you get the full size cream and thus, this is a great deal.. It also helps that the product is animal friendly and doesn’t have any harsh chemicals that are concerning. Excellent moisturizer
