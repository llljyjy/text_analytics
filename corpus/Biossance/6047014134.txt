I like this a lot, it is helping improve the look of my lips. I feel like they look healthier, not necessarily plumper or anything but pinker and well hydrated (it’s not tinted so I don’t know why my lips look pinker but I like it). The tube and applicator is good. The texture is smooth and not really sticky (any gloss or balm can be sticky if you use too much IMO). There’s no scent as far as I can tell. It’s not too shiny either, I like a natural look and this works for me. And it’s vegan! nan
