I do not understand all the five star reviews, because my experience was exactly the opposite. If you have oily or normal skin I think this cleanser would do. but if you have dry to very dry skin, this is not the product. I tried this product for a week and every time I used it I found that my skin became even drier and felt extremely tight. I used it just as instructed on the package. it did cleanse my skin nicely, but stripped it of its natural oils. I am left wondering if this actually has any squalane at all. I was so excited to use this, but bummed now, especially considering the high price point. Not for very dry skin
