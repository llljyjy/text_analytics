I really enjoy the packaging, the dropper dispenses a perfect amount of the product. The color is neat, makes you feel like the ingredients are actually in there! It also has a nice scent. The first time I used this product I woke up the next morning with a pimple. It couldâ€™ve been a coincidence but I rarely get pimples. It was only an issue once. I would definitely say this is hydrating, however I did not notice much increase in plumpness. I will definitely continue to use this product that I am unsure if I would purchase in the future. I have been using for almost 3 weeks now. I received this product complimentary in exchange for an unbiased review nan
