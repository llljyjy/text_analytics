I have tried so many toners and this is the one I always keep coming back to and re-purchasing. A little goes a long way, and it does minimize my pores and cleanses my skin. It’s hydrating and doesn’t dry out my skin whatsoever. My only complaint is that I wish the bottle was bigger - I have to re-purchase it every 3-4 months! My favourite toner
