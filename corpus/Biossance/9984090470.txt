I received the Biossance Squalane & Retinol Night Serum complimentary from @influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have enjoyed this serum. The retinol is not super strong. I followed the instructions and gradually increased the usage. It has not irritated my skin at all. In fact, my skin feels softer and looks glowy! Even in this weird winter weather of a few freezing days followed by a few warm ones. I think this would make a great night serum for nearly all skin types. I have combo/dry skin in winter and with the seasons changing it hasn’t over dried it all. It’s quite nice. I highly recommend! Great addition to my nighttime routine!
