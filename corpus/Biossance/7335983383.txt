I was hesitant to order this because of some of the negative reviews. But I’ve been using this for about a week now, twice a day and I have 100% noticed a difference in my skin. I get really bad post acne hyperpigmentation and I definitely can already see the spots fading. One thing you gotta remember about products is that everyone’s skin is different so just because one product doesn’t work for one person, doesn’t mean it work for you. I have combo, acne prone skin that recently leans towards the dryer side and I don’t think I want to try any other oil again after this one. My skin is in love
