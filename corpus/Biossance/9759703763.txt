Been using this for over a year. My skin is very sensitive to spf and loves this.  Even on days when I wear no make up this leaves my skin looking flawless. Love that it is reef safe and not hurting the oceans. I had tried a different reef safe spf before that peeled on my face. it was very weird. This is so much better. I love that bissonce is environmentally friendly. I won’t buy an SPF that isn’t reef safe. Reef safe
