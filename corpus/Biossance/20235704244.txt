I’ve used this product for a while now and I’m honestly unsure of what it’s supposed to do but what it does do is make my skin feel hydrated and less flakey. I really love the heavy green glass jar. It feels high end and for the price, it should. Biossance products as a whole area usually pretty great and this one is no different. It feels cool when I apply it to my skin and I always love that sensation because it seems to just calm all my redness. Overall it’s pretty nice Quite nice
