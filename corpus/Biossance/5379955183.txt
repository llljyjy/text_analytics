A wonderful introduction to the Biossance brand! These products have truly made a difference in my skin within a month’s time. The lactic acid exfoliator leaves your skin flawless after one overnight use! The only issue I have is that some products have a very strong smell like the moisturizer. What people say is true, it smells like a mix of cheese and olives which is weird because it’s squalane derived from sugarcane. Otherwise, I definitely recommend this for someone getting into the skincare basics! A Great Starter Kit for Skincare Newbies!
