I love a good double cleanse and have many cleansing oils I enjoy, but this unfortunately is not one of them. The oil is indeed very lightweight and does a good job at breaking down makeup and sunscreen, but it really burns the eyes. If youâ€™re looking for a cleansing oil to use everywhere besides the eye area, go for it, but for me I use cleansing oils and balms to break down eye makeup and there are many oils out there that do not cause the stinging and vision film that this one does.
