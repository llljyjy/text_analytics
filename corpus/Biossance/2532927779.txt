I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Biossance for review. I found this to be a gentle retinol product. Perfect for first time users of a retinol product. I personally have used a retinol fairly regularly so I did not experience any irritation or flaking of skin that can sometimes be a side effect of this type of product. I did appreciate it helping with skin texture and brightness. No noticeable difference in fine lines but that benefit is usually noticed after longer use. I would recommend for any looking to try a retinol product for the first time. The cap of the component was a little difficult to take off. Great retinol for first time users
