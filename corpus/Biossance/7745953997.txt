I know, this is not advertised as a sleeping mask, but I have found that it does an amazing job at that. For reference, I am in my mid 40s and have dry aging wrinkly lips. PROSGreat ingredients: It has squalane, hyaluronic acid and ceramides (ultra hydration blend) and wakame algae which promotes plumped looking lips.Fragrance free: I don’t mind scents in products but as many do, it is better that they don’t add perfume to products, like this one.A little goes a long way.It is a thick product but it melts once applied to the lipsIt is a little sticky, which I find so perfect to use as sleeping mask, because that makes the product stick to the lips much better and stay in place the entire night. I find my lips still moisturized in the morning because there is enough product left on them.Vegan and clean + planet positiveGreat price for the amount you get and how long it will last.CONSI can’t find any. This product is excellent I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador My favorite lip sleeping mask
