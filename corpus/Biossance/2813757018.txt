I am not a huge fan of floral in my face products. In my Influenster profile I think I have the only scent I donâ€™t like to be floral, so I found it ironic that I was sent this to review. That being said, I am a fan of this brand! This lotion was a mild rose scent, delicate, pleasant. I liked it enough. I think I would have liked it more with a different scent. Great face cream, my skin really enjoyed the cream and I loved the way it felt after! Delicate rose scent
