Biossance has great marketing as I fell for the hype but was greatly disappointed. This oil is “okay“ but its not worth $72 and there’s no factual information regarding the percentage of ingredients. As I feel this oil is mostly just rose oil with a very small amount of vitamin C and Squalane because after using the whole bottle, I didn’t see any long lasting results. My skin looked pretty good after applying but once the oil absorbed, the “results’ were short lived. So no “real“ improvement but just a band aid on a scar sort of speak and for $72, that’s just unacceptable and you can certainly find pure rose oil a lot cheaper because that’s all this is. The potency of vitamin C and Squalane isn’t enough to make this oil anything “special“ and the reason it doesn’t offer any longterm effectiveness. Not worth the hype!
