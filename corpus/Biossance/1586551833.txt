Okay, I love this!! I’m a dry skin gal, very very dry. Love this for nighttime skincare. I have definitely noticed a change in my skin since using. My skin is hydrated and bouncy. I love the packaging as well! It’s a heavy glass jar. The scent is a little to get used to. But it is unscented, it’s just from one of the natural ingredients. I love this and will most likely rebuy! Great for dry skin!
