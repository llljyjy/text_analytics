I love it so much! It’s really the first spf that has worked perfectly for my sensitive/break out-prone skin. There is a bit of a white cast but it doesn’t bother me. I do think there are more superior spf’s out there but if you’re not planning to be exposed to the sun for too long… this sunscreen is worth a try nan
