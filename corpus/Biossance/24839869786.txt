This product is REALLY good. I have pale skin and the sun damage on my face is super visible and noticeable. As I’m going in my younger 20s, i have heard to start using Vitamin C products during the day for an anti aging treatment. I read that this was a super light vitamin C and that it was safe to use everyday. I even read that this could be combined with the BHA toner from Biossance since they are both so gentle. Well let me tell you, that did not work for me. I used the BHA squalene toner and the Vitamin C serum together ONCE. By the end of the day, my face felt super greasy, which is unusual for me because i have normal to dry skin. No irritation whatsoever afterwards.I used this serum everyday for a week straight after that without the toner. My face got SUPER irritated. It was so bad that even my squalene and amino aloe cleanser was contributing to redness in my face. But don’t worry, it was nothing that a little vaseline couldn’t fix. As I have learned from my mistake, this product and probably any other vitamin C products shouldn’t be used everyday when it is your first time trying this product. Take your time, slowly transition into a routine, a little break out and redness can happen, but it’s all about getting to know your sensitivity on your face. Now I learned a proper routine to use this without irritation, my face has never been so glowy. I can already see a difference in sun damage being reversed and acne scars lightening, so this product is definitely worth it! Just don’t make the same mistake I made in the beginning. And remember, everyone’s skin is different. Just because this worked for me, that does not guarantee that it will work for you. Definitely give this product a try! nan
