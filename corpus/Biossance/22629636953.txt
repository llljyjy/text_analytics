This cleansing oil is the perfect first step for at the end of your day. 100% I prefer over Dermalogica Precleanse. It works great for me removing face, eye, and lip makeup. If I have a little extra stubborn eye makeup I just use a bit extra on a makeup removing cloth or pad and voila! this is also great when my face needs a break from my full routine. I use 2-3 pumps of the cleanser only - no water - first then I wet my hands and start to rinse. Dermalogica left me feeling still too oily, whereas I feel I have a better balance after this product. Perfect starter for evening routine!
