I really wanted to love this as I love other products in this biossance line however immediately upon trying it it smelled so strongly of citrus orange it really turned me off.  led way to burning in my eyes and my skin felt quite irritated after using this. I normally use tacha cleansing oil that is thicker this oil seemed watery/didnâ€™t clean very well either just felt irritated afterwards not good sadly
