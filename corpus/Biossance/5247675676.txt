My skin didn’t like this product at all. I loved how light weight the moisturizer was, especially for something to use during the day, but every time I used it I felt a very minor burning sensation. After a few days I noticed my skin started getting a very rough texture and feels agitated, so I’ve discontinued this product. nan
