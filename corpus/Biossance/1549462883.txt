Love this product, it is by far the most effective retinol I’ve used. As with all retinols, you have to stick with it for a couple of weeks, but after a month all of my blemish scars and sun damage have faded away. I had a lot of sun exposure all my life so this product works miracles. It also significantly improved my texture and tone evenly. Per instructions, I worked up the frequency of usage and the results have taken years off my face :). I don’t need to even use concealers, foundation, nor powders anymore and it gives my skin a nice healthy glow. No filters needed here. I highly recommend this to everyone but the key is to stick with it, you’ll be super happy with the long term gains! 10/10 retinol, I look 12 again :)
