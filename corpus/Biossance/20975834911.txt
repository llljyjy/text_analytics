This is the first untinted zinc sunscreen I’ve tried without a white cast which I found super impressive. But I don’t think I will use it more than once due to the greasiness. I have dry skin and based on the reviews I thought my skin would be dry enough to enjoy this product but I think it is too oily for me as well. This may work on super dry skin though. nan
