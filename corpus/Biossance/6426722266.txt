I will forever repurchase this product. It smells absolutely amazing and makes your skin have this natural glow. After using it for about a year I have found that at night it works best for me. My skin has time to absorb the product and it really moisturizes my skin. You can use it under your makeup too, it gives a very dewy finish. It is just not cup-o-tea. This product leave your skin feeling fresh and hydrated. ALWAYS a go to
