I am so glad to finally find a mineral sunscreen that does not leave a cast, is not tinted, and moisturizes without feeling heavy or greasy. this is a sunscreen that finally checks all the boxes for me. absorbs quickly, sets nicely, wears well with or without makeup. this has officially moved me from “I should wear sunscreen every day“ to “I DO wear sunscreen every day.“ nan
