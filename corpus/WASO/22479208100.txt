This serum was really interesting to me! I’ve never used a face oil, and this is an oil-serum hybrid which I feel like is really nice to ease you in if you’re new to face oils. It feels light and gives my skin a really nice glow! In a perfect world I might like it to be a bit more hydrating on its own, but I’ve been layering it with another serum under my moisturizer and I’ve been really liking the result! Nice and Glowy!
