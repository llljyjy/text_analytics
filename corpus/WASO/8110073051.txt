I have been using this product consistently for a week or more and I’m seeing a visible difference in my skin! The consistency is oily and it does sit int he face for a while before absorbing completely so I usually skip make up during the day due to lack of time. This does leave the skin glowing and dewy for a good 6 hours. It’s been good for my skin and it really moisturises so great product! Got this for review purposes from Influenster. I will be buying this once this bottle is empty! Great serum!
