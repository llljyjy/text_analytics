I used this product 1-2 times a day (morning and night) fora about week and I did see my pimples diminish. On thebox it says that this product can be pretty drying but Ididn’t experience any dryness in the areas I used it atwhich is surprising because I have very dry skin. So far I’vebeen using this for 3 or 4 weeks and my skin has cleared upwith barely any dark marks left behind. However, my skindoesn’t break out badly so it didn’t take long for me to seeresults. Actually Works
