I received this complimentary product from influenster and shiseido. This is perfect for removing makeup and sunscreen without feeling too oily. I prefer this texture of cleanser over cleansing balms because this won’t give me a breakout. It’s super gentle and hydrating and it doesn’t have any harsh fragrance. The gel comes out great so you can get the right amount before emulsifying on your hand and turning into oil. I also love how this can sit ontop of the moisturizer in your cabinet!! Perfect gentle oil cleanser
