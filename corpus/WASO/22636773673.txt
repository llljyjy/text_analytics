This serum smells exactly like lemons! It’s one of the best scents I’ve found. Isn’t too earthy & isn’t over bearing like many others. My only complaint is is absorbs so fast. I’d like to use it with my gua sha, but it doesn’t stay slick long enough. Also, a couple ingredients I don’t love. But overall, I really enjoy this serum & have used a lot of it in only a couple months! It has a brightening effect and feels great on the skin— Definitely recommend. Smells and feels amazing!
