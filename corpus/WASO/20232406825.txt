This is a great scrub mask for sensitive skin! It doesn’t have much of a scent and it doesn’t leave my skin red and irritated like a lot of other scrub masks do. I usually use this once a week or so. I have dry skin and it doesn’t dry my skin out more than what it already is. As for being pore purifying, my pores do look smaller! nan
