I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. I would say this feels different than you’re typical serum since it’s really thin and lightweight. I think it’s nice under moisturizer/sunscreen in the mornings, but I do think it may have caused my sensitive skin to breakout slightly Good lightweight serum
