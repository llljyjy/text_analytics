This doesnâ€™t have fragrance listed as an added ingredient but it does definitely have a noticeable citrus and floral scent I believe this is due to Orange peel oil and lavender oil being included in the ingredients. I think itâ€™s rather misleading that the brand advertises this as fragrance free when it does have multiple different citrus derived ingredients like extracts and oils that are basically fragrance. I really dislike seeing citrus oils and extract in skin care as a general rule of thumb. I would not buy this I am not even finishing off this vial unfortunately because itâ€™s a waste of space as far as Iâ€™m concerned in my skin care routine ðŸ™ƒI feel like itâ€™s very overpriced it contains ingredients that irritate sensitive skin and it doesnâ€™t have anything in the formulation to outweigh the negatives of all of these citrus extracts. nan
