Really enjoyed this serum-oil hybrid. Has a light Citrus scent. Blended into the skin easily and was able to apply Moisturizer, suncreen, etc over it well. Added a nice amount of moisture and Glow. May not be the best option for oily skin, but a great addition to a daytime routine for other skin types. Noticed it helped with an overall brighter skin tone. nan
