This works fantastic on my oily skin, and most of all, it’s not a gel moisturizer. I just dont like gel moisturizer even I’ve tried and used many in the past, but gave up half way. I then tried skinfix peptide moisturizer, and man, it turned me into a greasy ball after one or two hours. I then switched to Sulwhaso calming moisturizer. It worked fine, not too oily but not worth the price. Randomly found this on Sephora, clicked on it and saw the price + 20% off on top, why not give it a try? For references, I have sensitive oily skin, red cheeks and can get irritated easily. It contains alcohol (Most or not all shiseido products contain alcohol) and Citric acid (At the very end of the ingredients list, so I think the percentage must be really low), but it doesn’t make me flare up or irritated. I use it mostly for day time along with vitamin c and I’m from rice toner then top it off with Skin1004 airfit physical sunscreen. At the end of the day, my face doesn’t turn into a mess but well hydrated even only use a small amount. With this price, I’d say this cream does what it promised. Highly recommend for oily skin
