I have been using this serum three times a week for a month and am loving the results! As someone with acne scars, I like to incorporate vitamin C in my routine and this product provides a nice boost of it. This serum is lightweight and very hydrating, with a light, pleasant citrus scent, and three small drops covers my whole face. nan
