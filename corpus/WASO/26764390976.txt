I liked how this felt on the skin—it goes on really smoothly, dries down quickly, and exfoliates without being over abrasive. I can’t tell if it tightened my skin or not, but it certainly felt like it did.. if I had to complain, it would be that it tightens a bit too much and you have to wash it off quickly or it hurts. But overall I really liked this! Love!
