I am someone who deals with breakouts consistently. I’ve used salicylic acid before so I was aware it could dry out my skin which is did experience a little here and there but that’s normal so I didn’t mind. I ended up really enjoying this product. Whenever I applied it to my acne spots they cleared up within a few days, sometimes sooner depending on their size! The product is lightweight and goes on the skin easily. I will continue to use this product and hopefully plan to buy it again in the future. It’s helped my acne!
