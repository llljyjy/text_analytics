This mask got the job done, it left my skin clean without over drying. My pores did feel more open after the first use. The mask is pretty thick but doesn’t make it difficult to spread and you don’t have to worry about any spills! I’m glad I was able to receive this product from influenster for free! Did this mask help me?
