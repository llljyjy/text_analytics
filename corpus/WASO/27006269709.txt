This clay mask is super refreshing but I did find it a little abrasive when rinsing it off. It define you cleared my pores and my skin felt much cleaner but learned you have to be careful rinsing it off to not damage your skin. I didn’t find the mask very drying either which is nice because clay masks can sometimes feel awful on. The scent didn’t irritate my skin and isn’t heavily fragranced which I greatly appreciate due to having sensitive skin. Overall I really enjoy using this pore mask since it is really effective at unclogging pores. I received this product complimentary in exchange of my honest review from Influenster. Great!
