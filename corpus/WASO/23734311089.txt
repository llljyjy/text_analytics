This works great on the surface level acne and breakouts but not so much the deeper issues. I have breakouts before Aunt Flo and this helped to tame the redness and keep my face from looking as bad as it was. However when I felt like I had some deeper/under the skin breakouts, this didn’t seem to help them go away any faster or feel any better. I put this on under makeup and it didn’t cause any issues or make my makeup rub off or break up in anyway. Overall, for the quick remedy to lower redness of breakouts, this is a great product!
