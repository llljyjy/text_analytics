I received this product complimentary of Influenster for my honest review! This vitamin serum didnâ€™t disappoint me after weeks of trial. I used it first in my skin care routine since the product has a very runny consistency. It looks like water, but it is oily. I appreciate that, because that is what I feel makes the difference. It makes my skin look radiant and moisturized! A must have serum!
