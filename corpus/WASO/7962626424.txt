I enjoyed adding this mask to my skin care routine. I used it after cleansing and as directed. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated which is all I can ask for. I am not sure if I actually noticed a difference in my pores however, that is not a concern I personally have. I would recommend this product to someone looking for a hydrating mask to add to true routine! Cute Mask
