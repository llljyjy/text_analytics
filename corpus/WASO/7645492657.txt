Love the way that this sits on my skin it doesn’t feel too oily and doesn’t really ruin my pillowcase at night it is a little chunky which I wasn’t really expecting however it gives a little bit of extra exfoliation so I appreciate that when I wake up in the morning my skin absorbs most of the product and feels very replenished and Glowy nan
