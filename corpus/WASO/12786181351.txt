This product works great, I use it in the shower to scrub my face and get off any leftover residue from makeup or dirt or oil. I let it set for about a minute or two and then rent off. The product rinses off really well and easily with water and leaves my skin feeling clean and dry. The only complaint I have is I wish the consistency of the mask was a bit thicker. When you rub it on it is very sheer and thin and is almost like just rubbing your skin with nothing on it. I normally use the all cleanser first to wipe off any makeup and then go over with the scrub mask to clean up anything that was left over. Wish it was a bit thicker
