I have been using this for about 3 weeks, every night under my moisturizer or overnight face mask. The first few days, it was itchy where I put it, but it went away after awhile. I started seeing results about after a week. I could see the pimples I put it on had gone down in redness and swelling. After 3 weeks, they’re barely visible since they are no longer red and can only be seen if you’re really close to me as they’ve gotten super small. They’re barely swollen, but I can still see a bit of a raised bump. I hope that by 4 weeks, they’ll be completely gone. I feel like this treatment is more for someone with occasional break outs and not someone with chronic acne however, just because I feel like my breakout was very small due to hormones and nothing compared to someone with acne. I don’t want to mislead anybody. It did work, but my breakouts usually aren’t bad. nan
