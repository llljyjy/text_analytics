First things first, ALWAYS shake well before using. I cannot stress this enough. The consistency is a tad runny so be quick so it doesn’t run off your skin. It absorbs pretty quickly and leaves a nice hydrated feeling. I immediately loved how it gave my skin a healthy glow without looking oily. It didn’t take long to notice the difference in my skin. After a few days my skin appeared brighter, softer, and more evenly toned. A little goes a long way so be careful using too much when applying. Just a few drops will do the trick. Bright & soft skin
