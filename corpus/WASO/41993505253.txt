I really enjoy using this serum. I have been putting it on daily for about a month now and has been helping me with dark circles under my eyes. It makes my face feel shiny and alive. My sensitive is very sensitive, but itâ€™s been doing well with the serum. I would definitely recommend for use. I put some on my fingers tips and in circles add to my face (not my lips). Lovely serum!
