I love shiseido and I’ve used multiple products in this waso line. This wasn’t my favorite. I do like the texture of an oil consistency. It feels pretty hydrating. It may or may not be clogging my pores which I don’t love. I think the packaging is nice but I worry that the vitamin c looses potency not in a light safe container. I received this as a free tester but I’ve used better vitamin C’s that are more affordable so I probably won’t purchase this. Just okay
