I am a little picky on pore masks but this one was actually really effective! Definitely saw improvement after about a month of use, my nose and cheek pores look a good bit smaller and more clear out than usual. I use this mask once or twice a week in the bath and itâ€™s so relaxing! Very easy to use and gentle on sensitive skin. Really no fragrance which is a must for my skin care! Very happy influenster allowed me to try it, definitely a holy grail for my pores Gentle on skin
