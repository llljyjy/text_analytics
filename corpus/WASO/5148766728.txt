The Shiseido Waso Satocane Pore Purifying Scrub Mask is a fantastic mask! I like how it was easy to apply and use overall. It felt cooling and refreshing while on my skin and, afterwards, I love how it made my skin look clear, bright, and glowy. It’s a quick, 5 minute mask that you can do while in the shower. I also liked the scent and how minimal it is. The packaging is more eco friendly with the outer cap being made of 30% upcycled rice husk and the tube being made of 10% sugarcane-derived polyethylene. It contains vegetal exfoliants, which micro-buff away dead cells and prevent clogged pores, revealing skin that feels baby-smooth. The formula is non-comedogenic, vegan, cruelty-free, and fragrance-free. Overall, it’s a great mask that I would repurchase! nan
