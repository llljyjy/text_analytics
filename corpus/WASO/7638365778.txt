I actually enjoyed this product. I’m not a clay face mask person because they’re usually drying on my oily skin, then later, the oil comes back five fold. It’s been an hour since I’ve used thus and my skin isn’t dripping oil, so that waa great. I found this wasn’t drying either. That’s completely new for me with clay masks. This has small beads that felt really gentle on my skin. This doesn’t need to be left on for more than five minutes per the instructions. It smelled pleasant, as well. I would actually buy this. I used a good amount, but I think a little could go a long way with this. I actually like a clay mask for once.
