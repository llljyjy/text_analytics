I’ve suffered from acne for a while and I’ve tried so many spot treatments. I’ve been using this product for about a month now twice every day. It’s helped to make the acne not fully develop on my skin. It’s taken about a month to get the results of completely getting rid of a pimple. This treatment isn’t super sticky but takes about 2-3 minutes to completely dry down. If you want to try it and think it will work then do it. But if you don’t have the money or aren’t sure if say you could probably find better. Not an overnight miracle for me
