Iâ€™ve gradually worked it into my everyday look by using the moisturizer as a base for my makeup routine. I was shocked by how well this moisturizer hid my pores and controlled the tone of my skin. This was one of the first products that I was genuinely shocked by and that I hope others can find their way to try if they have any concerns with visible pores, a sun-sensitive face, or anyone wanting to add a little tint of color to their moisturizing routine. nan
