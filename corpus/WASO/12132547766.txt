I am a BIG fan of vitamin c products, and this is one that is worth the hype. The consistency is a little weird and chunky, but the results are some of the best Iâ€™ve gotten from an under eye product. I usually have dark, sunk in circles under my eyes after a night of poor sleep and this seems to correct that every time. One of the best vitamin c products out there!
