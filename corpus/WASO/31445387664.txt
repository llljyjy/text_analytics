I received this product complimentary from influenster to review. I think this is a product I would used depending on how my skin is feeling. I liked how light weight the oil was and how it made my skin glow and it didn’t interfered with my makeup application. I didn’t like the initial feeling of having an oil on my face, it’s very minor but I could definitely feel it there. I think I will continue using this during the winter and depending on how my skin is feeling. I don’t think this is a product I will enjoy during the warmer weather as I can get pretty oily. I can’t say I notice any major difference on my skim when it comes to dark spots but I also was not consistently applying the product. Overall I think is a good product. Nice product.
