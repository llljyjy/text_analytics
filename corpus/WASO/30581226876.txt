What I love about the Acne Calming Treatment is that you can use it on the go. You just apply to the problem area, and go about the rest of your day! And during the pandemic Iâ€™ve acquired mask acne on the apples of my cheeks, so this has definitely helped me. I absolutely adore this product! Love it!
