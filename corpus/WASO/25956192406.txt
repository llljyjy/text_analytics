The Satocane Pore Purifying Mask did make my face break out a little nothing bad! I wouldn’t use one day before an event as it brings out your pores as it is a clay type mask. It’s definitely helped my acne that’s been stubborn under my skin and helped bring them out. It’s very relaxing to use and very good for acne prone skin such as my own. nan
