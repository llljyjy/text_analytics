Masks are my favorite part of any skincare routine and I really enjoyed this one. My skin feels so clean after I rinse it off. The only problem I had with it is it would get messy with how it comes out and screwing the cap back on. Just nit picking tho I would definitely buy another once I run out the packaging is beautiful tho and aesthetically pleasing My Pores Can Breathe!
