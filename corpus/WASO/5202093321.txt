I love using this product during the day, with or without makeup. It is moisturizing enough you do not need to use a moisturizer over it but easily can and it will not feel greasy or heavy. It has a pleasant smell and a little goes a long way. I donâ€™t see immediate results other than a glowy appearance but it does seem to improve skin texture after using it for a few weeks. Good day time serum
