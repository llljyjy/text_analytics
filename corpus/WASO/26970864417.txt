I made the mistake of trying this product before reading the instructions, donâ€™t make my mistake. If you follow the instruction this cleanser works really really well. It feel SO soft on your skin and has a very minimal scent. I like that you appt to dry-ish skin I felt it made a worlds difference. Truly great but read instructions
