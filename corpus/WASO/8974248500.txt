I liked this spot treatment! I used it on a zit over the course of about 5 days and applied morning and night. It sank in very quickly and has a clear color so it wasn’t noticeable during the day. It worked well, better than a lot of other spot treatments I have tried, but not the best I’ve tried either. Solid spot treatment
