*received as a free item for an honest review* Honestly this eye serum/cream is just okay. It smells nice and goes on very smooth. It is kind of soothing and cooling but it does not make any noticeable difference to my skin. I do not notice any difference in puffiness or dark circles Ehh itâ€™s okay
