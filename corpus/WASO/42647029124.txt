Although I think this is a great product and leaves your skin feeling amazing, the bottle is clear, when vitamin c is exposed to light (any light) it decreases the concentration of the product. So if you have this product I’d suggest keeping it in a drawer or cabinet where it’s rarely exposed to any light. Be careful where you store product
