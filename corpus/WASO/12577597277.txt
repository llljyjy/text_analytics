I received this product from influenster in exchange for my honest review. Personally, I have used many acids on my skin before including salicylic, with little to no irritation. This stuff works and does help calm active acne but I would definitely use it far more sparingly then was is directed on the package because after 3 days of use, the skin where I had used this product was burning and peeling off. Not fun. I haven’t really experienced something like that with any other acids I’ve used. I used this on its own with a moisturizer and i think it did help with some of my blackheads and pimples but not enough to continue use after peeling like that. Maybe switching to once a day every other day would be best. Anyway, this was kind of a miss for me but I’m sure it might work better for others! Maybe not for sensitive skin
