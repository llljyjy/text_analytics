This serum is a great addition to my current routine. I have sensitive, acne-prone skin, so I appreciate that this is fragrance free and Sephora clean. The texture is nice, and it did not break me out. Because it takes some time to see results when using Vitamin C, I can’t say that I have noticed if my skin is brighter or if any signs of aging have reduced yet. But I’m excited to keep using it! I prefer to use this serum at night. Nice Serum
