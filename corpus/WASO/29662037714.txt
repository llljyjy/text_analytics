As a person of color I don’t think I would recommend this product just because it left a white cast over my face and that’s some thing I look for when I’m looking for sunscreen or moisturizer‘s so just be aware. Also it’s a very thick consistency so if you have oily skin this probably isn’t the moisturizer for you and just after a few minutes of putting it on I can already tell that it dried out my face so keep that in mind Ehhh
