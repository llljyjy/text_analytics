I don’t have acne more of breakouts. I usually break out around the cheeks, chin. Those spots really break down my confidence and I can say this has been a life saver! I can compare in a week’s time I’ve seen a slight difference with pimples reducing in size or its just because I’m not messing with it. Idk but working for me! nan
