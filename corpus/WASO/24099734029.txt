I received this product from influencer for my honest review. This product introduced me for the brand . I honestly not a big fan of oily skincare but I didn’t mind this one because it’s not heavy oil and if you apply thin layer it’s a perfect vitamin C oily serum . I definitely notice difference , my face is glowing it’s brighter , and it cleared my dark spots . I like to use it in the evening because I really like how  bright and hydrated my face look when I wake up . It kinda of a problem for me because a lot of products I used and from most of them my face looked dry in the morning but not with this one . Its leaves my face very refreshed and rejuvenated. It’s perfect for the coming winter)) I love it!!!
