It’s really cool how it blends from white to tan, but I wish there was a lighter shade. It’s a little too tan for me (fair skin, brown eyes, dirty blonde). I’m also not sure how good it’s SPF is, it seems like you have to put it on quite heavy to get full coverage. It’s very sheer. Too dark, too sheer
