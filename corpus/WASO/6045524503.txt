I don’t feel like my skin likes this very well. I feel like my acne is getting more irritated and drying out a lot more than it normally does. It isn’t clearing up super fast either. I like that when you apply it is doesn’t burn or sting but I feel like that means it isn’t being super effective. This is a pass for me. not for me
