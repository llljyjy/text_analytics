I’m not much of a huge serum fan, as I have pretty sensitive skin. I have had a few breakouts since bringing this into my skincare routine, but it could also be makeup I’ve been trying so I’m hesitant to blame this serum solely. Besides that, I think it gives a nice fresh and healthy glow to my skin. It’s nice!
