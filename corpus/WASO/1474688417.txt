I am a big fan of this acne clearing gel. I put it on either morning or night and within 2 days my pimple is GONE. It is so gentle. I havenâ€™t had a problem with dark marks leftover. I also love that this goes on smoothly under my sunscreen. Its a nice consistency and you dont need much for coverage. Would definitely buy this on my own. Clears my pustules quickly and gently
