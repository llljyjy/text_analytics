This scrub mask is super gentle and won’t irritate sensitive skin! I have dry skin but my nose tends to get flaky and bumpy with clogged pores if I don’t exfoliate it regularly, so this is great to apply in the shower after cleansing and leaving it on for the rest of my shower. It gently sloughs away my dead skin and leaves my skin feeling smooth. Sensitive skin friendly
