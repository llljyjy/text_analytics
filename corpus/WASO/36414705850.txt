i received this for free from influenster and waso in exchange for my honest review. this treatment works, i just find it frustrating that you must re-apply constantly. it takes at least a week to show results, which is alright, but my acne comes and goes in less than a week. it has no scent, which is nice. i feel like it would work better for someone who has a more set in stone skincare routine. it works..?
