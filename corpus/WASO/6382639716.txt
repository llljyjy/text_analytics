This scrub mask is awesome! I love that you only need to wear it for 5min, as it’s much easier to work into my skincare routine regularly. It’s super gentle on my skin and my pores are noticeably better after using it. Using this in combination with the cleanser and moisturizer from this collection is like an at home spa experience! Gentle yet effective scrub mask
