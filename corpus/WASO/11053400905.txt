I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. I really enjoyed this product. It’s not heavily scented and didn’t feel oily on the skin. As far as effectiveness as an acne treatment it worked with smaller blemishes but didn’t not hold it’s weight against my cystic acne. All things said its a great addition to my prescribed treatment for smaller blemishes that may need less intense care. It’s a reasonable price and has lasted me a while, I would consider buying it again! nan
