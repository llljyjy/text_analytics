I really liked this WASO Acne Calming product as expected if I had an angry red zit I applied it during the day and night and it was visibly less red and smaller in size. I did not feel any stinging or burning with this product and I have sensitive skin. The scent is minimal and its not a bad scent. I feel this product paired along with the light moisturizer and overnight mask aids in brightening your complexion. I have oily acne prone skin and I recommend this product and the line for this skin type. Calming acne!
