My biggest issue is dark sports and puffiness. Been searching for something that gives my skin a boost while also fighting dark spots. So far, this is winning. There’s a noticeable difference in my skin the mornings I use it composted to when I don’t. Think I’ll keep it around in my routine. Okkaayyy
