I really enjoyed using this mask. I love that it’s both a scrub and mask in one product! I have fairly sensitive skin, and this mask felt really nice on my face. The scrub aspect isn’t too rough and didn’t irritate my face at all. Afterwards, my face felt smooth and soft, and looked nice and clean! Would recommend! Great Mask!!!
