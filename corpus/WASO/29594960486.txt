I received this product as a complimentary gift to review from Influenster. My view is 100% unbiased and based solely on my experience with the product. Just like most of the other 1 star reviewers, I have pale skin. I have tried a few different tinted moisturizers and they have all turned orange just as this one did. If I apply it painstakingly light and blend it, it looks a bit better; however, the trouble is not worth it. This is supposed to be a 3-in-1 product that you can just throw on in a rush if need be, not a product you have to tediously apply. The formula itself seems like it could be promising, so maybe Iâ€™ll look into one without tint. Very Orange
