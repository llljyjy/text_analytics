After using this product for a couple weeks (about once a week), I’ve been loving it. It doesn’t have a fragrance and feels amazing while on the skin. It doesn’t make my skin feel overly tight or uncomfortable at all. The scrub feels great while I wash it off and my skin feels so soft afterwards. I’ve used plenty of clay masks that bring out acne, but this doesn’t seem to. Instead, it just keeps my skin clean and acne-free. I love it and it’s definitely going to be a staple in my skincare routine now! For reference, I have oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes but all opinions are my own. Must have!
