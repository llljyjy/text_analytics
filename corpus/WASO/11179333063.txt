Thave been using this in the morning followed by a sunscreen. I love how this is a serum/oil, I feel like most serums just feel like you put nothing on. With this it leaves your skin feeling moisturized but not sticky!! I love how this looks under makeup, definitely gives you a nice glow. I do feel it helps with acne scarring but havenâ€™t seen a huge difference in my face, which is why I only gave 4 stars. But definitely still a product I love using. Feels amazing!
