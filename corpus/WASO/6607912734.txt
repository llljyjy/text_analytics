â€‚This is a good acne treatment. I love salicylic acid for my breakouts. It has a nice gel texture that spreads easily. It does not irritate my skin at all. I notice an improvement in my breakouts after use. It does not stain my pillowcases or other things it may spread onto. However, I do not notice a large difference between this and other salicylic acid treatments I have used. Good!
