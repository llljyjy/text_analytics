I was gifted this Shiseido Waso Koshirice Acne Calming Treatment in exchange for my honest review. This is a really gentle acne spot treatment, unlike other products of a similar nature, its alcohol free and doesn’t dry skin out. It has no fragrance really, if any it’s very very light. I used it for the first time when I experienced a really sore under the skin acne spot that suddenly appeared. I went to bed after applying it and woke up to it significantly diminished pimple that was no longer red, sore, or inflamed. I was really impressed how quickly this product relieved my irritation and symptoms and at the same time did not cause dryness nor did it cause my skin to become flaky and itchy which is what usually occurs after using a spot treatment for me. Impressive. Impressive
