I was hoping this to feel a little more intense or for it to be more exfoliating, but I think this would probably be a great scrub mask for someone with sensitive skin. I didnâ€™t notice a major change, but it makes skin feel clean without being too much explication, and also has virtually no smell. For the price you do get a ton of use out of it nan
