I think this is a nice spot treatment for acne. I don’t suffer too badly with much acne these days, however I got to test this on one and it for sure reduced the appearance of it faster than it naturally would. The salicylic acid % is pretty low so I’d only recommend this for someone looking for clean skincare that just wants a spot treatments for light acne. I will continue to use this,  but would not recommend for everyone. Love The Clean Ingredients!
