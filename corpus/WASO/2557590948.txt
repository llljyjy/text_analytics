This is a very gentle exfoliating scrub and mask. Since it’s a two in one product, the mask never really dries down. I have dry skin, so I actually like that about it. I didn’t notice any drastic differences, like it didn’t shrink my pores or change my texture much. However, it’s a decent mask and my skin feels soft afterwords. A decent product
