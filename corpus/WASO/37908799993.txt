I’ve received this product for free from the Influenster, in exchange for my honest review. This is the first type of the vitamin C I’ve added to my routine and I’m enjoying it, in combination to the WASO YUZU-C Awakening Eye Essence. During my morning routine these products awaken and brighten my skin, I can see the glow and freshness in my look. I have combination skin and squalane in the serum doesn’t make it oily but absorbs nicely and hydrates my dry patches well. YUZU-C GLOW SERUM
