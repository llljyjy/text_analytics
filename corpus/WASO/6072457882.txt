I first I use this as the first product before I did my snail corsx essence  and noticed I broke out more often. My skin is very congested and  certain oil base products can clog my pores very easily. However, I switched it up and used it over my essence and notice it has given me an even complexion. You also have to remember to shake the bottle before every use because the ingredients tend to separate all in all, I think it is a good product specially, for those who have dry skin, but I wouldnâ€™t recommend for those who have congested pores or easily break out with oil based products. Good for dry/ combo skin. Easily clogged pores no!
