Beautiful packaging throughout the whole line! I do not typically use physical exfoliants on my skin, as it makes it easier to cause micro-tears, opening up the skin to inflammation, acne, etc. The initial application of the mask is smooth and thick, but when washing it off, you can feel the physical exfoliants. Would be a great clay mask without them, but still good quality if you rinse your skin carefully and donâ€™t scrub it while removing the mask. Received complimentary through influenster. good quality, but mildly abrasive
