This is a new holy grail for me! I don’t normally use much Vitamin C because I don’t have issues with dark spots, but I tried this and it leaves my skin clear, even-textured, bright, and bouncy. The tiny capsules dissolve as you work them into your skin and it does sink in well so your face doesn’t stick to your sheets and pillows. The scent is really light and not too sweet or cloying. I either use it on top of other serums or whenever my skin needs a refresh. It’s amazing!! Holy Grail
