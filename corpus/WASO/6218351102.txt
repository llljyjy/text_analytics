I received this product through influenster and being the skincare junkie I am, Hadn’t had a chance to try this particular Line before, My skin is combo, with it changing by weather, Im from Texas so Humidity and Climate Bipolar is a Thing, therefore, I didn’t think it will mix well with my skin and conditions of climate but to my surprise I added this Moisture around 7:30 am and hasn’t moved and the color match on my fair skin worked well, there is a slight sunscreen smell to it but nothing overbearing, It neutralized my rosacea and didn’t make my face oily whatsoever, 10/10 Great product!
