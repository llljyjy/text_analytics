I really liked this scrub mask. It’s easy to use and doesn’t take long to sit. The problem is it leaves a residue on your face, so I recommend cleansing your face afterward. However, I did find that this mask makes your face feel clean. The consistency is smooth but it looks like a clay mask. Easy to use
