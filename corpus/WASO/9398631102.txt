Leaves my skin feeling oily but not in a bad way if that makes sense. It drips very easily from the dropper so be careful not to have anything to fancy on. Not a strong scent which is nice. I havenâ€™t noticed any drastic changes or anything to my skin. Maybe a little more dewy looking. Will definitely keep using while I have it though. Not bad.
