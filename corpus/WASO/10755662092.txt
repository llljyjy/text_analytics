I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. This product is great for those of which have pretty painful flare ups. I use this twice daily on all of my breakouts and within 24-36 hours they are almost completely flat, painless, and appearing a lot less red. This is not a spot treatment persay, it will not get rid of your acne scars, and it’s not as affective as those little patches are- but for every day use this isn’t too strong to where my skin is drying out either which happens with a lot of acne treatments for me. I think I would buy this again, and recomen this to anyone who struggles with painful acne. A great Addition
