It’s a good moisturizer but I have others I like more. The beads never fully dissolved and the next day the mask was dried and crumbling off (it felt like my face was peeling). If you don’t mind rubbing off the crumbs or washing the excess off in the morning, then this could be a great moisturizer for you because it does work. However, I prefer others that get fully absorbed and leave no residue. Crumbles off when dried
