To every single person saying they have to use a second cleanser because their face doesnâ€™t feel clean or it feels oily, an oil cleanser is meant to be used first in a double cleanse! You use the oil cleanser first to breakdown makeup and or sunscreen then follow up with a water based cleanser. Oil cleansers should be applied on dry skin then after massaging it into your skin add water to emulsify then rinse. Oil cleansers are not meant to be used as just a face wash. Please research Oil cleansers!!
