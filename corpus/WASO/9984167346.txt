I saw a little increase in hydration but that was it. It didn’t provide any other benefits. I didn’t have any allergic reactions. I’m not a fan of droppers because they can be messier and I didn’t care for the oil feeling, though it wasn’t VERY oily. Smell was not offensive. It provided a bit of a “glow“ but likely because it’s oil and that’s not what I personally like. Didn't hurt, didn't help
