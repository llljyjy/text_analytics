I think this is a really good beginner item for vitamin c products. I have quite sensitive skin and most vitamin c products can make me look like a strawberry easily no matter how little I put. This product is pretty good since it really doesnâ€™t irritate my skin too much. I also have noticed a slight difference in my dark spots. I personally do not like the oily feeling  but tbh it is not as bad as other oils I have tried and is only slight. I also have dry skin as a reference. It does the job
