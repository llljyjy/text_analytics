This was too dark and yellow for my very fair skin with cool undertones, as usual for these type of products. It was better if I didn’t rub it in too much, but it was still noticeably different than the surrounding areas. SPF 30 is nice, but in a product like this, you won’t be applying enough to get that much protection, especially if it doesn’t actually match your skin tone. I passed it on to my mom, and she prefers the Dr. Jart BB SPF 40. Probably good if the color matches you
