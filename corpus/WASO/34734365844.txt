I enjoy this very much. For starters I received this from Influenster as a free sample. I LOVED how this has basically no smell and goes on like you actually have something on your skin. I hate watery creams. I struggle from getting random cystic pimples and I used this for about a week and it did in fact make the pimple under my skin smaller Give it a try !
