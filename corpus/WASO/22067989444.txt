I received this as a free product from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. I normally would not pick this up because I’m not a fan scrubs for my face because I don’t enjoy it, however there are not that many beads in this mask which makes it a product that I can use happily. The scent is nice. My skin is left feeling hydrated and you can see an improvement in texture after I use it. I liked it!
