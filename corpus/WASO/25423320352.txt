Let me start by saying that this is one of the only acne treatments I have used that did not completely dry out my skin after use! I do not break out a lot, more just hormonally or from sweating! I have had a couple breakouts after being sweaty and working in the heat for days! When I come inside for the evening I wash my face and notice that I have a few inflamed pimples that pop up here and there. I pop a teeny tiny bit (it goes a long way) of this acne treatment on my face and let it sit overnight. When I wake up, I notice the redness is reduced by at least half and after around 2 days theyâ€™re gone completely! I have used quite a few similar products but not one that worked THIS good! I HIGHLY recommend, especially if you have acne-prone skin! My Acne Cleared in DAYS!
