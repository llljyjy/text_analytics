I received this for free from Influenster to review. When it comes to moisturizers, I’m very picky as I’m used to using one moisturizer. However, this moisturizer was fantastic! The scent is super light and the consistency is slightly thick (which I prefer!) and keeps my skin moisturized throughout the day and night. Would buy again!
