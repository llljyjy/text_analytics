My face is usually dry and oily. I noticed after using the product for the last couple of weeks that it leaves my face looking plump. As in it leaves it glowy, smooth, and hydrated. Due to this my makeup doesnâ€™t look oily due to its hydration leaving it nice and smooth. Even without makeup it leaves the face soft. One picture is without makep up with the product on and the other picture shows the product with makeup on with the sun hitting my face. Leaves face glowing!
