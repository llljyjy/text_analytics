I’m a sucker for serums and I really enjoyed this one! I’ve been applying this in the mornings before applying my makeup and it definitely gave a nice glow to my face and left it feeling hydrated. This came at a perfect time since my skin gets a little dry in the winter. It has a nice smell as well that isn’t overwhelming.I would recommend it to others but due to it being a little out of my price range and having a lot of serums already at home, I probably won’t be repurchasing any time soon. nan
