I like this acne calming treatment! I use it in the morning and night, as well as throughout the day. It helps to give my skin inflammation comfort from all the mask-acne. It shrinks the bumps and calms the irritation & redness. I love how the product isn’t too strong. Not heavily scented & doesn’t give a intense burning sensation to the skin Nice
