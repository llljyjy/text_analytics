I tried this on my sister (14), and it has really done a difference to her skin. She has oily skin and tends to get acne on her chin and also on hair line on her forehead. She is very athletic and sweats a lot. So let me say she still uses it to this day. She applys a little on the areas before bed and sees her acne smaller and lets red. I donâ€™t think this would be something to use to completely get rid of acne but controlling it. It has a nice thin consistency to it as well so it dissolves well. stands by its name
