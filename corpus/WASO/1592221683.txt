This pore purifying scrub mask is a wonderful addition to my skincare routine.  It is light and refreshing,  has a light clean smell and uses a light polishing scrub. This mask made my skin feel very soft. I use it every week.  I like the results and it makes makeup go on smoother. This would work if you had sensitive skin. I would recommend this to a friend. Great facial scrub.
