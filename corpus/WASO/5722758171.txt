I LOVE this product. I received this for complimentary in exchange for an honest review.   I have used it for about a week but within the first two days of using it I noticed my skin to look a lot brighter and healthier. It have a beautiful citrus lemon smell, very subtle. I recommend using any vitamin c product with an SPF. Only thing is that good vitamin c comes in a dark bottle to protect it from light exposure and this clearly in a clear to yellow ombré packaging.   also this  serum feels more oily than anything  and very runny. Be careful with your clothes ! It doesn’t dry clear.  I will continue to use to see a long term effect. Should be in a dark bottle for good vit C
