This product is clear so it can be applied for the day or night and won’t be noticeable either way. I had a couple of deep pimples and applied this product daily to see how it would go. It eventually went away after about a week which seemed normal for my skin. I will say that my pimples didn’t hurt as much as they normally do when they’re that deep in the skin. nan
