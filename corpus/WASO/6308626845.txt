I have always used pimple patches for my break outs so this was new to me. First off I want to say there isn’t any chemically scent, which is something I’ve noticed a lot of acne clearing products have. It does have a scent but it’s not unpleasant. It is a gel consistency, it is clear when it comes out of the tube and it also rubs on the skin translucent. I’ve only been using it for about a week on a brand new breakout I have from pre menstrual hormonal acne. I have noticed less redness for sure but the pimple isn’t gone, but I will continue to use it because it doesn’t irritate my skin. It’s not stinky or sticky or unpleasant to wear. And the packaging is also extremely cute. This is such a good brand so I will continue to use and hope in the end it gets rid of this pesky breakout. I’m assuming it’s one of those “slow but steady” things. nan
