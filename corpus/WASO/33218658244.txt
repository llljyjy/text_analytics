I luv this product. I never tried a serum and this is my first time using it. It has a light fragrance which is good, you donâ€™t want a scent super strong. I have dry skin and this provides a great amount of hydration especially since I use this and my tatcha moisturizer. The Glow though!! Luv the Glow and Hydration
