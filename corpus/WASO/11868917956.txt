Okay so I tend to deal with horribly dry skin due to my medications I have to take. However this mask works so well!!!!!!! If you have any dry patches this will truly help soften them and hydrate those areas !!! I actually ended up putting this on my face during some lazy days at home for about 3 hours , and it made a huge difference just within 3 hours! My skin felt so smooth and the dry patches were starting to go away! The longer you keep it on, the better it works (: But yes, itâ€™s absolutely amazing and worth the buy!!!! 10/10 my favorite product from influenster so far (: SO SO GOOD !!!! WILL BUY AGAIN!!!!
