I have never noticed a difference after a single use like I did with this moisturizing mask. Absolutely incredible. I have combo skin but sometimes when weather changes I tend to have drier skin, I incorporated this into my nightly routine and used it after toning replacing my normal moisturizer. The next morning my skin was NOTICEABLY radiant and hydrated. Thereâ€™s no scent to the product and you only have to use a little of it. I liked the little flakes it has as it encouraged me to spend more time massaging it into my skin increasing its effectiveness. Will definitely purchase again Amazing hydration!
