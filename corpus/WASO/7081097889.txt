As per usual when applying a face wash I always start with a fresh and clean base. I always gently pat dry my skin with a towel before I begin. I tend to stay away from exfoliating scrubs due to the fact my skin is beyond sensitive. Luckily this mask has a mud-like texture and contains vegetal exfoliants to micro-buff away at the dead cells and help reduce clogged pores. I only left this on for 5 minutes and very gently massaged for 60 seconds and my skin was not agitated. Iâ€™m very happy to report when exfoliating it was a comfortable feeling compared to other other exfoliating scrubs I have tried. nan
