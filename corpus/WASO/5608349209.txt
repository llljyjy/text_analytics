It is really easy to apply and easy to take off, which makes the process easy. Once you apply it, you wait for like 5 minutes and then rub the mask into your face before removing it. When you rub the mask, it feels like little beads that are exfoliating your face, but in a very gentile way. After removing the mask, my skin looked really glowy and it was very soft. My pores and blackheads also looked a lot better and that was only after one use. I will for sure use this again and I was really impressed! Love this mask!!
