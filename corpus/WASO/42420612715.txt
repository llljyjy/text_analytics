I don’t use a ton of skincare products, but I’ve incorporated this serum into my routine and I’ve loved it! My skin feels so plump and hydrated! I love how it’s not incredibly heavy, and the yuzu scent is nice but not overpowering! Definitely happy with the quality! (I received this product from Influenster for my honest review of the product) nan
