I expected this to be similar to my other C serums that I have used in my morning routine but it is very different from any other I have tried. There are oils suspended in this that give an extra boost of hydration without the heaviness of a pure oil. I love it because I have dry skin and use oil as a last step at night but never in the daytime because it affects makeup and when layered with sunscreen, it feels like heavy product sitting on the skin without actually sinking in and hydrating. The formula overall is thin enough for it to sink into the skin so I personally would still recommend this even to those who donâ€™t normally go for oils in other skincare products! nan
