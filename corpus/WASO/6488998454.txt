I received this product as an incentive for writing an honest review. I LOVE this product! It’s not too oily and it’s not dry at all. This product makes my skin hydrated but not an oil slick which I’ve had issues with in the past from other products. This glow-on shot does separate but you just shake it up to mix and it feels so rejuvenating and clean. It’s glowy but not oily and truly hydrates my skin. I’ve been putting it on in the morning and at night before my daily moisturizer and it locks it in so well! With the weather changing and cold weather upon us, this has come in handy! Highly recommend, 100% will purchase when i run out. Rejuvenating and clean, not too oily
