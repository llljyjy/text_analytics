I usually have hormonal acne, deep nodules underneath my skin that take a long time to heal. Normally, the spot treatment that I use is benzyl peroxide on top of tretinoin which kills the zit. This product is not as strong, and calms the skin but canâ€™t hit my zits as hard as i need it to. However, I started applying it on spots that need to be healed post flare up and I think it did a really good job of calming the area and preventing scarring. If you have mild-normal acne, this product is probably perfect for you. Those with more severe acne, this is a good post-spot treatement not enough kick for severe acne
