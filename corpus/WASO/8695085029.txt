I received this for free from Influenster to use and review. I was really impressed with this moisturized and honestly would consider switching over to this. This moisturizer left my skin super soft and hydrated. It definitely has a thick texture, but it absorbs super fast and doesn’t leave a greasy feeling on your skin. I use the tatcha dewy skin cream and I would say they have similar textures! A little bit goes a long way with this product, which for the price is amazing. I’m obsessed with the scent of this moisturizer, it’s a very peaceful calming scent. The scent is faint but somehow it just smells so good!!! Specially if you love lime/lemon scents.Honestly, I don’t think there’s anything negative about this moisturizer for me to say. For the price, it’s literally perfect. I would definitely recommend this to others. Amazing!!!
