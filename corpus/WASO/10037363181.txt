Gave this product a try since most things don’t work well with my skin lol maybe I need to try it for longer amounts of time with different breakouts but it flared my acne out more than it did help it sadly. It smells great though! I wasn’t a big fan of all the different ingredients. It’s decent though, I would suggest a test trial before a full on application :) Okay!
