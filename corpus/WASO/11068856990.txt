I was soo surprised to fall in love with a facial oil! All other oils I’ve ever tried made me super oily, or super dry! And would break me out! This stuff was a godsend during the fall to winter transition. My skin was hurting so bad! Thankfully influenster came in clutch at the right time with the best product I’ve used to date! And no to mention my overall skin tone has improved immensely!! I love this stuff soo much! And I accidentally knocked my bottle over in the skin! Only lost 1/4 of product but I could’ve cried! I’ll use this bottle until the last drop! Also not my skin is super sensitive, combo, oily t zone, dry cheeks, nose, eyes. Read my next review on the eye cream!! Highly recommend both pictured! Surprised!
