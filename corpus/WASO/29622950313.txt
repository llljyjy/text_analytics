I received this free from influenster in exchange for my honest review. I was super excited to try this WITH the eye awakening cream to see the results of them together, but unfortunately I lost the serum not long after getting it. So I’ve been mostly using it alone. The scent not my favorite but tolerable. You could see a difference instantly after applying, but I HATE the texture/formula/feeling after putting it on. maybe I’m using too much but it feels sticky even long after applying so much I almost can’t even get over it. Meh
