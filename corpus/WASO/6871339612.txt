Over the last couple of weeks I have added this scrub mask into my shower routine, and have had some good results. it scrubs and polishes the skin and leaves it feeling moisturized and replenished, rather than raw and feeling like I just rubbed sandpaper all over my face. Would highly recommend for other folks with dry flaky skin! nan
