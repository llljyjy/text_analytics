Cool product! Feels nice on the skin. So far has not made me break out. Really gives you some color and coverage. Matched my skin tone pretty well, keep in mind I do have a tan right now. Iâ€™d like to try this in the winter when I am very fair. I received this complimentary from Influenster for an honest review. Overall, I like it! Still, I prefer my tinted Elta MD sunscreen. Cool Product!
