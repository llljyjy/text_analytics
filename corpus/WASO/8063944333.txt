Personally I like a semi thick moisturizer, this one is very light. It’s good and it does what it’s supposed to do, it also didn’t cause a breakout and it doesn’t have a scent so overall it was a great product but I just felt like I needed to apply a generous amount to feel like my skin was really being moisturized after cleansing. nan
