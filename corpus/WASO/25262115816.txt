I love this beauty mask. Other nighttime masks can be heavy and seem like they just sit on top of my skin. The YUZU-C mask is the complete opposite! It is super lightweight. Since it is water based, it absorbs easily into the skin without leaving a sticky residue. The Yuzu citrus extract and Vitamin C capsules are the perfect ingredients to make your skin glow. If you’re looking to brighten dull or uneven skin, this is definitely the product for you! I’ve been using the mask for the past month and have seen a noticeable difference in my skin. It’s smoother, softer and brighter than it was a month ago. The perfect lightweight nighttime mask
