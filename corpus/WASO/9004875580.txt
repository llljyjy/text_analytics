Really good moisturizer. My skin can be Sensitive to certain products, but this didn’t have a negative affect. It was actually very moisturizing and lasted throughout the day. I would definitely use this again, but it wasn’t special enough for me to switch from my regular moisturizer. Still, no negative thoughts Great!
