I’ve never tried a face scrub and mask combination product before, but this product is awesome! I have combo skin and feel like the clay helps target my oil, but my skin feels hydrated after use too. The exfoliation is very gentle and non-irritating. I’m not sure if I saw any major difference in my pores specifically, but overall my skin has been looking a LOT better since starting to use this mask!! nan
