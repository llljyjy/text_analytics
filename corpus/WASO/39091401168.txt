I used this as directed (on clean dry skin and left for 5 minutes) and I really like this mask. I feel like most skin masks are very drying and yes they make you feel very clean but you’re left with stripped, sensitive skin, not this one at all!!! I love the way this made my skin feel so clean but also very refreshed and hydrated. I probably would not use this very often, it definitely would not be in my daily routine. I’ll likely use this about once a week at most Definitely pore purifying!
