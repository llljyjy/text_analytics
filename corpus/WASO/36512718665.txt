I have a sensitive and dry skin type. This under-eye cream works great for me. I apply it twice a day before I go to bed and in the morning, it hydrates and soft your skin. After few days I see how smooth and soft my skin feels. It has vitamin C which is great for you, it brightening your under eyes skin. Planning to purchase on my own for sure! Perfect eye serum!
