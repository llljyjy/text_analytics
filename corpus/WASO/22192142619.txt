I’ve been using it couple times a week for the last 4 weeks. I have hard time with vitamin c, because is very volatile. However it really did not behave bad, I love the glow that I have and has helped to hydrate my skin during this winter, I used it twice/three times a week and I alternate with my current skincare products, it’s a good addition to my skin. I think is a very good product, it fits me so is working for me. I feel the product is a good addition and I enjoyed how it feels, I am combination skin and I haven’t had any problems with. I recommend it. Hello Glow!
