I’ve tried a lot of vitamin c serums and I like this one. It is more oily than other serums I’ve tried. You can see a layer of oil on the top so you have to shake it firdt before using it. I like using it in the winter bc i get dry patches and this helps moisturize it. definitely like using this. Oily, good for dry skin
