I’ll start with the fact that I did receive this product for free in exchange for an honest review through Influenster. I figured it would be a smaller trial size but was shocked to see it was the full size. The bottle is gorgeous and the details really stand out. I like that it’s split into compartments and that they are clear to see how much product is left. A little goes a long way, one pump covers my entire face and neck. The smell is really pleasant but not over powering. It made my skin soft and dewy. It was a little sticky at first but it soaked right it. The price is a bit higher than I usually go for on individual products but I was really impressed by it.. so I’ll be purchasing another once this one is out. Wow!
