Absolutely love this serum! It has great texture and very lightweight. It absorbs very easily, and it makes my skin feel brighter and smooth. As someone with dry skin, itâ€™s a perfect addition to my skincare routine. It leaves my skin super hydrated and soft. Smell is light and sweet without feeling overwhelming. Very pleased with how seamlessly this item incorporates into my skin routine. Highly recommend, will for sure purchase in the future! Wonderful skincare staple!
