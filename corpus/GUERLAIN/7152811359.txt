After only a couple of days of use, my boyfriendnoticed a change in my skin. When was the lasttime your man noticed a change in your skincareroutine?I use this and exfoliate regularly. Just to push itslimits, I used this with no moisturizer, and I foundthat it REALLY packed a punch. My skin looksBEAUTIFUL and feels so, so soft. The photo I used for this review was a makeup-less picture I took on the first day of a camping trip. Iâ€™d been using the serum regularly for two weeks at that point. Worth the hype!
