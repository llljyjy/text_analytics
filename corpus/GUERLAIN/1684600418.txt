I’ve received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. It has gorgeous packaging which I wouldn’t expect to be any different from the rest of Guerlain’s  Abeille Royale line. It’s lightly scented and leaves my skin soft with slight plumping. The double R serum isn’t heavy or greasy and the pump allows for just the right amount. Slight downside is the price point definitely isn’t budget friendly. It’s been an awesome addition to my nighttime routine, but there are definitely more budget friendly options. nan
