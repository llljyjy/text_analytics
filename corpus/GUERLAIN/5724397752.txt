This product is luxury indulgence from the looks and feel of it but what sets it apart from other luxury serums is that it WORKS! I fell in love with the packaging and the fragrance but I also felt a definite refuting in fine lines in just 4 weeks of using this product! It has a high $ value but I wouldnâ€™t mind spending it because the product justifies it so well! A MUST HAVE SERUM!
