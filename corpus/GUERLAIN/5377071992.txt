This serum seems to work well with my dry sensitive skin. This serum is balanced very well, and it contains such an awesome ingredients like honey, royal jelly and squalane which are healing and nourishing for the skin. The serum absorbs almost immediately so itâ€™s a perfect first step in your skincare routine, make sure to use spf daily when using this serum. The pump design mixes both parts of the serum together to give the perfect amount for each zone. I think the bottle will last me for a few months. The scent is also very light and pleasant. Great Serum!!!
