Coming from an oily girl this definitely made a significant difference to my skin. I received this as a free sample thru Influenster but had been eyeing it prior to receiving it. I began using it after I got back from vacation and my skin was going thru a severe break out phase and texture issues. I noticed an immediate difference in my skin texture after one day both day and night along with my usual skin care. The scent was pleasant, it does tend to have that “mature, older woman” smell but it does tend to fade quickly. I do notice a rather gradual lifting around my eyes and radiance around my cheek bones. I have ventured to say it’s helped in connection with my other skincare to help even my skin tone. Extremely well formulated. The price is steep, but I would definitely repurchase because a little does go extremely a long way. Two pumps is more than enough for me. extremely well formulated
