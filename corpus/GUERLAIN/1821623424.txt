I have been using this serum for over 2 weeks now and it’s quickly become the absolute best part of my skincare routine. The scent is so glorious and my skin feels incredibly luxurious when I put it on my face. I have been trying to use half a pump each morning so that I can savour this product and use it for as long as possible. I feel radiant every morning when I put it on my skin. As a woman in her early 30s I am loving how plump and firm my skin has appeared since I started using this serum. It’s lightweight and absorbs nicely into the skin leaving no residue. If you don’t enjoy scented products this may not be for you but I absolutely adore this smell - I will be sad when my bottle runs out, as it’s a bit out of my usual price range. Luxurious addition to skincare routine
