I would give 5 stars but because product itself is wonderful and I love how it treats my skin but the packaging!!!....its beautiful but awkward.  Itâ€™s like top heavy or something and tips over easily.   I caught it before it hit the ground twice but today it hit the ground and more than half the bottle is gone...  itâ€™s too tall and skinny or something-- Iâ€™m not a clumsy person and I take good care of my products.... just use extra care when handling.  ðŸ˜ž Handle with extra care
