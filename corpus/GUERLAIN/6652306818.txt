Disclaimer: received this product complimentary from Influenster for my review. Before we get into the product, let’s take a moment to appreciate the 2 serums in 1 mechanism. The bottle itself is beautifully curated down to the bee emblem. It’s gorgeous!! Now onto the serum: while some may not like the perfume scent, I really enjoyed it. It’s a bit sweet but not overpowering to me. My skin drank up the serums! From the past month of testing, I wouldn’t say the serums helped with my pores but it definitely made my face glowy!! nan
