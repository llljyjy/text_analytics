Wow is the first word to come to mind for this product! I received this from Influenster and Guerlain for honest review. Typically with skin care I’m always wondering, is this product actually doing anything? BUT with this product I notice immediately that it’s working. This serum gives a tightening and plumping feel to the skin right away. It’s a slightly sticky feel but that soaks in and goes away. After first use I literally fell in love with this product. I’ve been using for about a week and a half and my skin looks like I’ve been getting professional facials. Smaller pores, softer and more firm skin texture, radiant. I’m actually a little upset I like this product so much because it is pricey but it truly works and at my age you can’t put a price on that. I need all the help I can get now before the wrinkles really start coming in. Amazing Product!
