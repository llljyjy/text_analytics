First the good: the packaging just LOOKED expensive. From the box to the heavy bottle. It’s BEAUTIFUL looking.But… I don’t think the product is for me. I found it to be very sticky. I tried it on its own and even under a moisturizer but, I still felt as though my face was quite tacky and that my makeup just didn’t sit well on top of this product. It just stuck to it and not in a good way. I even tried this in my night routine but I could still feel it on my skin when I woke up. Not for me
