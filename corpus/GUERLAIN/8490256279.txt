I really wanted to love this product after seeing all the great reviews. I have dry skin to begin with but since it’s been cold by skin has really suffered. I bought this because I wanted something hydrating that would not leave my face feeling sticky or greasy. It has a beautiful scent and I love the benefits of the breads but when I applied this it just sat on my face and left a sticky film. I first thought I applied too much and waited to try again a different day on a clean face with very minimal product and the same thing happened. I will be returning. it may be great…just not for everybody
