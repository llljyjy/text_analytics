The packaging is obviously gorgeous and luxe.  The serum itself has a fairly strong fragrance which is not my fave.  I do feel like this moisturizes and plumps my skin up and wears well under makeup.  Doesn’t leave my skin too greasey.  For the Hugh price point I will need to use longer to see if it’s worth the money. nan
