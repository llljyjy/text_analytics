This is an incredibly rich and hydrating serum. I would not recommend it for oily skin, but it works great for me. Good for sensitive skin (spot test first), and using moisturizer after this serum seems like overkill. I do feel like my skin seems more radiant and soft after using this serum regularly.The bottle is very pretty and easy to use and hold. nan
