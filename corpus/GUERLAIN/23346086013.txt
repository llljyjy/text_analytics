First, I absolutely love the packaging! The bottle is eye-catching, pretty, and definitely has a luxurious vibe. If you’re not a fan of scented skincare products, you may not like this as much. The scent is DEFINITELY noticeable, but I really didn’t mind it at all. Plus, it’s not like it lasted all day. My skin felt extremely moisturized and hydrated. It also layered very well with my other skincare products, which made it easy to incorporate into my skincare routine. The only drawback may be the price point for some and the scent for those who are senstive or just dont care for scented skin care. Other than that, I don’t think you’ll be disappointed. Absolutely love this serum
