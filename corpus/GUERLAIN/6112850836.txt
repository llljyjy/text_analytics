I received this product as a free sample love everything about this product! The size is plenty big and a little product goes a really long way. The little dropper serum smells so good. A little strong and unexpected at first but itâ€™s a pleasant, perfume smell. The gold flakes in it are pretty too. Spreads easy on the face and the serum itself pumps out nice. It mixes together well and makes my skin so soft. Packaging is cute and heavy. Looks luxury. Highly recommend. Must buy!
