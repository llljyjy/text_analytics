I gave this a try on my puffy, tired undereyes and it did absolutely nothing that a $5 moisturizer from Walmart would do. It says it’s for dark circles, which I don’t have, so it’s clearly for undereyes too. I saw absolutely zero change in my mild undereye post-weekend puffiness. I get better results from my Clinique All About Eyes. The glowing reviews on this make me question the validity of future reviews I read unfortunately, and that’s disheartening:( Did absolutely nothing!
