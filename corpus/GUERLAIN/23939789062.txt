I was very impressed with the consistency of this product. Even though it is two separate serums combined, they work really well together and blended great! My only one complaint was that for me personally, it was a little heavy. I am not used to my face with serums though, so that does play a part. After about 2 weeks I did notice my skin to be more radiant, smooth, and youthful. It is a little pricy, but worth it in my opinion. nan
