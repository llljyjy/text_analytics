I received this free in exchange for my review. I haven’t been able to take note of any anti-aging properties. I can’t tell if it’s doing anything. I enjoy the application and how it mixes the two serums. I just haven’t noticed any difference in my skin since using it for a couple weeks. I’ll keep trying and give it more time to work. Heads up, it does sting if it comes in contact with broken or irritated skin! nan
