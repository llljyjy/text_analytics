I want to start out by saying that I’m 43, with combination/ sensitive skin. I’ve been using this beautiful serum for a month now & it hasn’t irritated my sensitive skin. I love the beautiful ingredients in this serum & it definitely makes a difference in my aging skin. My skin definitely feels hydrated , more plump , smaller pours, reduced redness, skin look’s more radiant , feel’s smoother & visibly more firmer. I’m starting to notice my winkles fade. This serum has a light scent I’ve become accustom to, it’s really hydrating so I use a light moisturizer after it’s absorbed or a sunscreen in the morning. The bottle is absolutely stunning & I love the golden bee. It’s a beautiful, luxurious serum that I’m in love with. It’s so important that my skincare is made with natural, clean ingredients like Guerlain Abeille,Royale Anti-Aging Double R Advanced Serum. I’d highly recommend this to family and friends! This is a must have in my routine
