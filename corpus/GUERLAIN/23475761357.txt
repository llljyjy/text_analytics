This product is absolutely amazing! Every morning I use CeraVe daytime moisturizer with sunscreen and I sometimes got frustrated because it would be a bit matte. I take a drop and add it to my moisturizer and it creates a hydrating, smooth base to have refreshed dewy skin all day! Itâ€™s a great base for makeup or just bare face. The oil is super lightweight and a little goes a very long way. Highly, highly recommend this oil! Amazing! Worth Every Penny!
