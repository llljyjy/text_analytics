Absolutely in love!! Have use this formula for a little over two weeks now and couldn’t be happier. Skin is more even-feeling and firm; while also feeling more hydrated. The formula is smooth when applied and the gold beads dissolve as soon as you rub them into the skin. The only thing I would be wary of is if people are impartial to heavy scents– this one may not be for you. It is very very heavily scented. I personally love the smell, but I could see how it could bother some people. A+!!! New ride or die!
