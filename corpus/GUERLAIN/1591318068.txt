This product makes me feel like I come from old money haha!  The product comes in gorgeous packaging, it feels substantial, and looks lovely to leave out in my bathroom/ vanity. The product itself smells incredible, and is part of why I love it. If you do not like scented products, this isnâ€™t for you.  Now, with regards to the actual results, I would say this is not extremely hydrating, and additional moisturizer is needed. It does feel a bit tightening/firming on my skin, and combined with moisturizer, it feels wonderful. I think more time is needed to see the long term effects, but either way, I look forward to putting this bit of luxury on my face each day! nan
