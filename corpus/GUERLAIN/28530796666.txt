The texture made me squeal like a little girl!! Before I get into this, I will say I received this product free/discounted in return for my honest review.My Collective ThoughtsCan we talk about how this packaging is just gorgeous. Wow! The detailing on the bee was just stunning. The texture was so lush I squealed out loud & I am not ashamed!!!Now, Guerlain makes some bold claims about this serum. After a month of use, women are claiming the following:95% say skin appears lifted & more radiant96% say wrinkles & fine lines appear reduced100% say their skin is smoother100% say the skin is firmerThey achieve through the use of 2 different exclusive technologies.Advanced Radiance-Effect Technology -- uses a restorative white honey concentrate, a slow-release AHA technology & PHAs to resurface.Advanced Lifting-Effect Technology -- also referred to as Youth Correction Dynamic Blackbee Repair Technology is supposed to support the skinâ€™s renewal process. They do use a biotechnological patented method to extract ingredients.Guerlain formulated the serum with 96% natural ingredients. The bottle is made from 20% recycled glass & set up a reserve for the black bees. The company is committed to social impact.Here is what I found while using it. It was pleasant smelling. I thought my skin felt velvety soft once it absorbed. The absorption process did take longer than other serums, but it was worth the wait. One of the major downsides to this particular serum is the price tag. The smallest bottle is 1.01 oz & runs $165 while the 1.69 oz bottle is $225 Super Lush but Pricey
