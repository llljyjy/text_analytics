It honestly feels so great on my skin. Did I notice a huge difference, not really. The smell is also really nice but it’s borderline smelling like something my grandmother would have. I’m not sure I would purchase this again just based on the fact I have better products that cost a lot less. It’s still a good product and might be worth it to someone who would notice more of a difference than myself. It Feels Nice
