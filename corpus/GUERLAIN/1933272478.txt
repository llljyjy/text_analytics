I really enjoyed trying this product. I use this serum every night as the second to last step of my skin care routine. The first thing I noticed is it smells amazing! I was smelling it on my face all night after using it. I also really like the texture. It goes on thing but you can feel it working in your skin after using it. I definitely recommend! Love this product!
