The Abeille Royale Advanced Youth Watery Oil is exactly what it claims to be â€” an extremely hydrating mix between water and oil serum. This product glides on very smooth, but needs to be blended fast as it dries and becomes a little sticky. I use this in between my cleanser and moisturizer, and my dry skin feels very hydrated and supple. Removing one star because the price is quite high compared to other serums that  deliver similar results, but I would recommend this to anyone looking for a luxurious and well-performing product! Great Product
