This is a solid product but for the price I’m not sure it’s worth that, I believe you can find something similar for a lot less! I love the packaging and the ingredients, it definitely made my skin feel moisturized and not sticky but the powdery flowery smell is very strong.  Overall it’s good but not great for the steep price point Good but not for the $$$
