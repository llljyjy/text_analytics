I use this with the toner as well.  The toner lasts a long time if you donâ€™t put it on a cotton round.  Just add a little to the palm of your hand for application.  This Youth Watery Oil is something I never want to go without.  It is perfectly hydrating for my nearly 50-year-old skin.  I did buy the larger size and recommend it because you will want to use it day and night. I had one of those scaly patches on my forehead/hairline.  After a few months, it started to raise and peel I was about to contact my dermatologist because it concerned me but it actually just all peeled off and went away with the exception of a little discoloration but nothing like it has been for 15 years. Amazing Product!
