This serum is really moisturizing and feels very nice on my skin. My skin really like this product but my biggest con is the fragrance. It has a very strong fragrance! It smells very perfume-y and I can even still smell the fragrance after applying it on my skin. Iâ€™ve never tried a product like this before where it has really strong fragrance and does not go away even after application. Other than the fragrance, it think this product works. Also, the packaging is gorgeous, very luxurious indeed. Strong fragrance!
