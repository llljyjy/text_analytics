Love, love  love this serum! It’s very hydrating and makes my skin feel refreshed instantly. I put this serum on at night and I wake up in the morning with a noticeably plumper skin.  It also adds an glow and smells amazing. The packaging is also a nice touch, the gold details and glass bottle add very luxe touch. This one is a keeper in my skincare routine. It’s a keeper!!
