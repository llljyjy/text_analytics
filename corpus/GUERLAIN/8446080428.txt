“I received this product free from @influenster and @Guerlain in exchange for my honest review”.  I’ve been using this product for 16 days; I’ve incorporated this serum in my morning and night routine. I truly believe I need more time to give an in depth review. I can say that the packaging is beautiful. A small amount goes a long way and it’s super easy to put on. I love how the serum feels on my skin and how it makes my skin look as it feels quite moisturizing My skin looks dewy and I have no dry patches at all. I’m really loving the radiant look it give me. I can say Um starting to see a difference on how my pores look, they are looking better.  I need more time to see how much more can I see happening.  I do know that this serum makes my skin feel better than what I was previously using. The down side to this serum is pricing. It Is a luxury item and its $225 for this particular serum. I am loving using this serum and so far I can say I will repurchase. nan
