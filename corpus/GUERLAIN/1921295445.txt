I received the Guerlain Abeille Royale Double R Advance Serum complimentary in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using this serum for about a month. It’s good. My skin feels soft and moisturized when I wake up in the morning. It has a little scent, but nothing unbearable. I actually like the scent. If you are trying to avoid skincare with perfumes, then pass on this one. The bottle looks gorgeous on my vanity, which is always a plus. The pump is easy to use and it comes out in pea sized portions (I only need 1-2 pumps to cover my entire face). Although it absolutely does it’s job, I gave it 4 stars because I don’t think it’s worth $225. I would recommend, but wouldn’t repurchase. Good!
