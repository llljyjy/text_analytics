I cannot live without this stuff! Amazing! I have been a skincare fiend for the last 18 years of my life (I started early due to problematic skin) and this is my favorite product, by far. It’s hydrating without being too slick/shiny/slimy and feels great on my skin. I can definitely tell the difference in radiance and glow when I didn’t use it for a few days. I personally love the scent, but I get why some would see it as too much. But if you’re not sensitive to smell, it’s definitely worth the splurge best. ever.
