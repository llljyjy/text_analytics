This serum claims to firm/tighten, provide a lifting effect, reduce the appearance of pores, and brighten the skin. I am 33, so I do not have a ton of signs of aging BUT I can see a difference when I use this product. It does what it says it does. My skin is brighter and more plump/firm. Fine lines are definitely reduced. I apply this after the water oil and I love the way my skin looks. I only use it at night instead of twice a day which works great for me. It has truly become a staple in my nighttime skincare routine! Works great â€” true to claims!
