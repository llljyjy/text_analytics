I received Guerlain Abeille Royals Double R Advanced for free from Influenster and Guerlain Paris in exchange for my honest review. Upon opening the product I immediately noticed how gorgeous the bottle was, absolutely stunning.  As I applied the serum it was a very easy application with very little product needed (1-2 pumps). The formula is not greasy and has a light pleasant smell, however it is a little sticky at the beginning but that does subside.  After application my skin looked and felt smooth and after a week of constant use (day & night) I did notice the fine lines around my eyes diminish.  My only concern would be how quickly one might go through the product, as I posted a photo of the bottle after one week of usage, only using 1-2 pumps a day.  Overall, it seems to be a great product something I will continue to use. Makes my skin look and feel lovely
