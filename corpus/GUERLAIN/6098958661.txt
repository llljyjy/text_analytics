I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I love the Guerlain Abeille Royale Double R Serum because this product glides on smooth and it actually makes my skin feel and look great. Itâ€™s light enough to not feel sticky or weird, and provides the feeling of moisture without being heavy. It makes my skin look a bit brighter and tighter.  The smell is different then what I am use to but love the way it feels. Serum
