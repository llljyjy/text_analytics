I really like how nice this oil went on. The oil did not feel like your typical facial oil. It absorbed really nicely into my skin.  It made my skin really radiant and helped smooth it out. I am not the biggest fan of the smell of the oil though.  I find it very strong smelling and reminds me of my grandmas perfume.  I am not a huge fan of heavy scented face products. The packaging and bottle is very nice and looks very expensive from the moment you see it. nan
