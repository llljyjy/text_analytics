I received this product for my honest opinion. I really enjoyed using the product for the past month. I do believe my skin got softer and more hydrated even throughout the day. Working un a healthcare setting we still need to wear n95 masks, and I don’t find this product breaks me out or makes my skin oily even with the mask. I do have a deeper forehead wrinkle, it didn’t magically disappear, or soften within this month use. But my skin is noticeably more glowy. nan
