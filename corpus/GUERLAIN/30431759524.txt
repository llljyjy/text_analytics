I have been using this Guerlin Abeille Royale double R serum for about a month now. I received it complimentary from influenster and Guerlin for my honest review. I’ve seen thus far is my skin is much brighter and tighter. My fine lines and wrinkles are much softer and less visible. My skin is much smoother and firmer. The smell is lovely and the bottle is absolutely beautiful. I love how it’s made out of 20% recycled glass. I love how the two active ingredients are kept separate to preserve them! I have so much left and will continue using it. It’s such a luxury brand and I will definitely be adding it to my skin care routine. I would for sure recommend making this purchase to transform your skin into a much more youthful appearance! nan
