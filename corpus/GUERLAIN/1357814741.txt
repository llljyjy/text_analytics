I have a dry cheek area. When I use this under my makeup application, only in the cheek area, I have a moisturized appearance all day. If I were to use this in the T-Zone, under makeup, Iâ€™d look super dewy/greasy there.So, I use this product strategically. Leaves my skin feeling soft & supple.  Love... Moisture w/o greasiness!
