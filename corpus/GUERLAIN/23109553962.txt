I’m really loving this serum so much. Been using it for about a month now and I’m seeing a noticeable difference in my skin already. I immediately could tell how hydrating it was to my skin. After about two weeks I started seeing my skin plump up and my fine lines diminish. The bottle is so luxurious and heavy. I love the separate compartments and how it dispenses so easily. Perfect amount every time too. Definitely recommend to other skincare fanatics like me. Loving this serum!
