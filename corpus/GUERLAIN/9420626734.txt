I received this product and start to use right way because I really love Guerlain products. I was really impressed because this serum is a oil but super light oil and my skin absorbed it fast... I have oily skin and I have problem with acne, and it doesn’t leave your skin heavy or oily. Its a amazing sensation on skin. You can use your regular face moisture after this serum/oil without problems, I noticed my skin with a freshness look after using it alone. My bottle is 15 ml but using for some days I can say you doesn’t need more than 3 drops for face and neck I can say this bottle this bottle will last a long time. I recomend! Amazing face oil
