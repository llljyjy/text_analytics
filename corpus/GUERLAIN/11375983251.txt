I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Guerlain Abeille Royale in exchange for my honest review. First off, this packaging screams luxury. All the way down to the bottle itself. My favorite thing about this product is that itâ€™s made of over 90% natural ingredients. After 4 weeks of use, this serum has revitalized my skin. My cheeks are so soft and plump. It even helped cut down my acne. Luxurious and over 90% natural ingredients
