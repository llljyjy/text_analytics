I’ve only been using this product for a few weeks and while i haven’t noticed any significant changes in my skin, I love the way it feels on my skin - smooth and shiny, not greasy and works as a great layer underneath makeup. that said, for the price, I would only continue use/consider purchasing if I see positive changes to my skin over time. nan
