I am a month into using this product and am so pleased with my results.  My skin is noticeably brighter, clearer, and more plump.  I find my pores are less noticeable and I am pleased with how it has refined the texture of my skin. The product is lightweight and absorbs quickly, leaving no stickiness behind. It has a beautiful floral scent which I enjoy. However, if you’re not a fan of fragrance in your products, you may not. If you’re a fan of luxury products, and don’t mind the price point, I highly recommend.  It has exceeded my expectations! Exceeded my Luxe expectations
