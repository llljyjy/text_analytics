First off I want to say the packaging on this product looks super luxurious, it feels SUPER luxurious and it smells luxurious as well. It smells light, almost honey-like, and flowers! The serum itself is contained in 2 separate compartments that when pressing the button at top, squirt out. You gently mix and warm it in your fingers and smooth over onto your face. Even though it smells sweet, it doesn’t leave my skin sticky. It absorbs well, and goes with the rest of my skincare routine beautifully. I have been using it now for about 2 to 3 weeks, and have noticed that my skin appears softer, and those deep lines that were beginning to form have softened a bit, and aren’t as noticeable to me. I do enjoy how it looks on my vanity, the bottle is weighted enough it feels like you get your money’s worth, and doesn’t feel cheap. The gold accented cap is stylish, with a cute little bee, and shiny. Very easy on the eyes. A little of this product can go a long way, I tend to smooth two pumps over my entire face, and neck in the morning and at night use two pumps just on my face and let the serum sit for an hour before bed. 10/10, will look to buy this again when I run out, as I find even with the price tag it is worth it because it is working for me. Luxurious!! The best my skin has ever felt.
