I did receive this complimentary for an honest review. Loved the packaging! Super luxurious, heavy and stunning! However I have been using this for the past month consistently every night. I haven’t noticed much difference, but I do love the way it feels on my skin, it’s light weight and soft to the touch. My main gripe is that it’s heavily (at least for me) perfumed. I don’t mind scent in my skin care but this smelled like straight perfume, which leads me to believe it has a heavy alcohol content. I don’t mind a luxury price tag so long as the product really shows what it can do, but this didn’t hit for me. Definitely still love Guerlain And still would recommend the brand! Love their makeup! Loved the packaging!
