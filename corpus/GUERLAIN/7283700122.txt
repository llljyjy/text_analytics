Obviously this stuff is expensive, look at the brand.....but....it LOOKS fancy. The presentation and packaging is on point. Then when you use it....it SMELLS fancy. Like, she smells good. You feel expensive with that smell lingering on you. None of that compares to how it FEELS once you apply it though. It goes on so well and doesnâ€™t leave any kind of unsettling feeling afterwards like some oils and serums do. This is a must try, at least once. Pamper your face for sure. Absolutely yes.
