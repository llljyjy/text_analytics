I bought one of the sets that contained this full sized and it worked exactly how I assumed it would, but it was satisfactory. This only lasted me 2/3 months. The packaging is luxe and flashy, but it doesn’t reflect the actual serum. My skin felt hydrated and smooth, but it only lasted for so long and I needed to apply a large amount of the cream and even that itself feels like barely anything going on. I didn’t notice anything extraordinary or worth purchasing again for. There is a alcohol type consistency to it I don’t know how to put my finger on it but it dries very quickly and leaves no residue. Just okay
