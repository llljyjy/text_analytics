I have been using this for a few weeks. I feel extremely (!!) lucky to have been chosen to receive and test this product. Once I got over my excitement (this is not something I would typically buy myself considering the price) I really started to try it out and test like any other product I would. I did feel like it left my skin really soft and it felt good putting on but it did break my skin out which is why I didn’t rate it higher. I do have sensitive skin a bit but I was hoping after using it a while it would subside but it really hasn’t. I’m going to continue to use and see if my skin adjust and then reaps the benefits but it’s hard to decide now because of how much my skin is breaking out. I will update once I’ve used it longer nan
