I’m a redhead with freckles and combo skin but my skin and skin tone never naturally illuminate or radiate, not even with moisturizer. When I use this my skin looks dewy and vibrant. The other day i left the house with no makeup on just SPF and I got a compliment on how great my skin is while I was in line at the grocery storeI don’t think it’s a coincidence. Worth the money! Bottle is pretty too :) nan
