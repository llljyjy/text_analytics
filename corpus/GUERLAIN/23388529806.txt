I received this product for free from influenster and Guerlain in exchange for my honest review. My first impression, I love the packaging of the product, feels and looks very luxurious, the smell is incredible and my skin absorbs it very well, it does leave my skin softer and feels more hydrated. I have been using the product for a month and as of now I like it very much. I will continue to use it to be able to give a more in depth review. Very nice on my skin
