I received this free from Influenster in exchange for my honest thoughts. The bottle is heavy and very luxurious. Just downright beautiful to look at. The serum has a nice light but not overpowering scent. It felt so wonderful on the skin and immediately made my skin so supple and plump. Even the next day my skin was just so moisturized. Not oily just healthy. Highly recommend. Amazing!
