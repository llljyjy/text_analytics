I loved this product! The packaging is so cute and the serum smells amazing. I love that it’s a clean product and good for my combo skin type. I felt like my skin was hydrated and pores looked so much smaller. I loved that the serum wasn’t sticky on my face and my skin felt refreshed. I received this product for free in return for my honest review Love this!
