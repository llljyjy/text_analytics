This was one of most luxurious serums I’ve put on my face. I know some people didn’t like the scent, but I loved it! It was so nice. The serum felt nice on my face too. Never felt greasy and it left my skin feeling very soft. So why only 4 stars? It was supposed to have a lifting effect and I never really saw any lifting for me. However, I did think it made my skin look much brighter and kept it very hydrated Overall, I had a good experience with it and if I ever decide to get more, I think it’s worth the splurge. So luxurious!
