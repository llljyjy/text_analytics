This is a beautiful, lightweight yet powerful serum! My mom and I both used it and it works amazingly on both young and more mature skin. Gives a beautiful dewy glow and overtime makes your pores a bit smaller and skin tone more even. It is a gradual process however and doss require quite a bit of product to see changes so definitely a pricey option, but worth a try for those willing to splurge a bit! Pricey but lovely!
