I received this product as a free sample. I will start off by saying this product does make your skin look beautiful and gives glass skin vibes BUT if you have sensitive skin I would AVOID! After using it for several days it broke me out really bad on the sides of face and my forehead :(. I will not be using this product anymore. Not for sensitive skin
