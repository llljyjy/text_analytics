I received this complimentary from Influenster and Guerlain Paris for my honest opinion. First off, the packaging is gorgeous! Very Beautiful! The scent is light and pleasant. I used it for a month so that I could give an accurate review....I loved it! It made my dry skin replenished and lifted! Great product! Easy to use and works well! I will be purchasing this when I run out. A must have for aging skin!
