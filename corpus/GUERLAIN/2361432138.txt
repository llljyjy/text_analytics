This serum works so well with my skin (I’m dry/normal as a reference). It doesn’t feel heavy or super sticky on the skin, which I like about this serum. I’ve used it in combination with the youth watery oil (10/10!) but also just on its own with my moisturizer and I’ve loved the results from that. This serum gives a really nice glow, and my skin feels like it’s really plump after using it. Plus my makeup holds up really well when using this underneath it. Definitely worth a try! I’m obsessed!
