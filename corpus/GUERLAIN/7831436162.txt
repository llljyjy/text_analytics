This is hands down my favorite serum in the entire world. I love how it’s a double serum bottle, so you get two in one. The way it leaves my skin feeling silky smooth and you can actually tell a difference in my skins health since I started using this. I have sensitive skin and this doesn’t cause me to break out at all. The bottle itself is gorgeous. Even though it is on the pricey side, to me, it’s worth every penny and I will continue to purchase this product. My new every day serum
