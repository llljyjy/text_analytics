I used this serum twice a day for over a month now. I like the feel of it on the skin and I felt like it gave good hydration. The smell is on the stronger side but it isn’t too bad. I wouldn’t recommend it for anyone with sensitivity to smells though. I’m not sure if it has made much of a difference to my skin overall. I think I would need to keep using it longer to see anything. Decent serum
