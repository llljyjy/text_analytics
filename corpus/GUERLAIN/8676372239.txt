This is my holy grail skincare oil. Will definitely repurchase it. I have combination to dry skin. My skin is kind of sensitive and most skincare oil break me out.  But this one doesnâ€™t make me break out at all. It is really moisturizing but not oily. I love it in winter time before putting my make up. It never makes me peel with any foundation but give a lot of moisturizing feeling on my skin. Love it! Highly recommend. Awesome primer oil for combination to dry skin!
