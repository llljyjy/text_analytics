I received Guerlain Paris Abeille Royals Double R Renew & Repair Advanced Serum for review purposes. I’ve been using this product for about a week now. What I’ve noticed: 1) the packaging is beautiful an feel luxurious 2) the scent is pleasant and smells luxurious 3) the formula of both the serum and cream feels good and luxurious on the skin4) the renewing of the skin is evident when using this product as it seems to gently remove the dead skin cells off the face when going to wash the face. I don’t really know how else to explain this part. It’s like after running your finger over your forehead after the day or night skin comes off. Really that sounds gross but not really. But I’m that note. I think I’d suggest using this serum for your night routine. 5) in reference to the above noticeable changes it also smooths the skin. Obviously because the removal of dead skin will smooth the skin. 6) it also does appear to form the skin based on a week of use. All in all this product does appear to have great benefits and it feels so luxurious. I’d say it’s worth it’s stickers price online. Smooths and renews
