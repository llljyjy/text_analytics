First, the packaging is very cute.  It feels luxurious.  The product is nice.  It’s takes a little bit to absorb and I don’t think it would work well for oily skin (but I could bring wrong)  honestly.. I don’t notice much difference yet.  My skin does feel soft, but I also suspect it made me break out.  It has a fragrance, and if you like the line fragrance you’ll like this.  Sometimes I feel it’s a bit much but other times I like it. A nice product but a little expensive.
