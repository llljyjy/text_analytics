I love face oils but I always hate when they’re so oily that I can only put them on at bedtime and not under my makeup. This oil solves that problem!!! Not only does it not feel oily, but it has a tiny bit of grip to it and works well as a makeup primer. My makeup looks smoother and lasts longer. My skin looks hydrated and bright. There’s nothing to not love! Except maybe the price point…. Still I think it’s worth it. Oil, minus the oily feel
