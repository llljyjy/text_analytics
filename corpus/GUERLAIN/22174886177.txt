I received this from Influenster for my honest opinion The bottle itself is very luxurious and instantly beautifies your counter. The scent is light, delicate and very pleasing; sweet/honey fragrance. Shake the bottle to ensure the little pearls get picked up by the dropper. I applied a few drops directly onto my cheeks (it is a watery oil, if you apply onto your fingers it’ll drip down). It goes on quite smooth. You may feel a slight sense of stickiness afterwards, but as you touch your skin it is smooth. I use it nightly and wake up with a fresh and rejuvenated face. It gives you a beautiful glow. I didn’t notice too much of a plumping effect, but the hydration is definitely on point. One of the highlights of this product is that Guerlain works with a bee conservatory to ensure their sources are sustainable. Amazing !
