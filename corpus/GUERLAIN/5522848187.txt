I received this to try out from Influenster, and I have been using this product for a couple of days now since Influenster sent it to me as a product to try for free and holy crap I love it! It’s not an oil! It’s like a water but not quite. It leaves my face so soft and not sticky. It also has these little beads in there that pop!!! I would buy this product hands down! Thank you so much for this! I have started using this instead of using my other face serum. In love!
