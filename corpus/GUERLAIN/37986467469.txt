I received a full size sample in exchange for review from influenster and was skeptical at first as I  have combination skin so adding oil to it seemed counter productive.  After getting over the slight oil slick feeling on my fingers from rubbing it in and leaving it I realized that a very small amount goes a long way and leaves my face feeling soft (not greasy) and refreshed in the morning. love the subtle scent and am 100 % recommending this as a must try for anyone out there that has dry patches or combination skin that could benefit from a bit of softening. A little goes a long way to softness
