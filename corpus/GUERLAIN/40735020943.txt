I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I absolutely love it I’ve been using it for a few weeks now and I feel like it has done wonders for my skin. I love the scent of it too which is a huge plus because most skincare products I have don’t have this good perfumey smell to them! It’s a little out of my price range but is definitely worth it and I am seriously going to consider purchasing it once I am out. nan
