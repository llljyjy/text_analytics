I was excited to try these high end skin care products. I was definitely skeptical and almost thought this was snake oil, but man was I wrong. I actually followed the directions and use it the way it said to. My skin looks different. Very plump and tight. Some of the marks (brown spots) started to fade. It has a light scent which I absolutely love. I was blown away by the results. Why did I give it a four star? Well it’s highly priced and while it’s worth every penny, not everyone can afford it. Would I buy this again? Absolutely!!!! Wow! Wow! Wow!!!
