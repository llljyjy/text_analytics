I had never heard of this brand until trying out this Double Advanced Serum. I fell in love with this serum. The texture is so smooth and refreshing feeling. I love that the ingredients are mostly natural. I feel that the serum worked to help make my skin younger looking and more of an even appearance after about 2 weeks of using it in the morning and before bed. The packaging is also beautiful. I love having it displayed with all my other skin care on my bathroom counter. The only downside I found is that the price point is pretty steep. I feel that in my opinion it is worth the price, but it also worked really well with my skin. Vibrant & Youthful Skin
