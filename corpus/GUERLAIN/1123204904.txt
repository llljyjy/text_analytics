I was honored to be chosen to get such a luxury full size product free in exchange for my honest review from influenster. It has a great texture, sinks in to the skin and pairs well with the sample watery oil. Feels luxurious and after 2 weeks my skin is seeing some slight results: reduced fine lines, lovely glow. Had to knock off a star for heavy heavy fragrance. Itâ€™s almost like putting perfume on your face. I would think for a $225 product they would reduce the amount of fragrance added. Looking forward to seeing the results with prolonged use. nan
