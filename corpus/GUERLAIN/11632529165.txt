Upon immediate application this product absorbs quickly & leaves my skin feeling soft & hydrated. After a few uses I notice little bumps from clogged pores as well as some dark marks from acne disappearing. It does have a strong floral fragrance & a mild honey scent - I wish the two were more balanced. The packaging is luxe. The dual chambers are very cool & I love that some of the glass is recycled & the fact that Guerlain is committed to helping the bee population. I definitely recommend this & see myself purchasing it in the future nan
