At first I was a little concerned before trying after reading some reviews about how it’s not good for an oily face since my face tends to lean towards mild-oily. The first couple of days my forehead did break out a little, but then cleared up immediately after. (I recently learned that this could possibly be a “purging” process rather than actual break out). Over the next several days I noticed how much more hydrated my skin felt and started to feel like it had an overall glow. I will continue to use this product and see if it keeps up! My only concern is if my face would go through the whole “purging” process again if I missed a day. I apply this morning and at night. Also just wanted to state how absolutely beautiful the bottle is! Very elegant and classy. Hydrating with a glow
