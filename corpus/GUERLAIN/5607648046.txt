Many products claim they will make you look younger but this one actually pulls through and so far has given me a youthful glow and plumped up fine lines without being sticky or causing a breakout. Im 31 now and started noticing some fine lines in my forehead and smile line area and have started to see less after only a few days using this product. The one complaint i have is the perfume smell on it. Its made with honey and if theres going to be a scent at all id prefer a honey scent but the fragrance doesnt seem to bother my skin so overall its a great product and a new staple to my routine nan
