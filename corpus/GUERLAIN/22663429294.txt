Everything about this serum is super luxurious! The packaging is beautiful & it feels amazing on the skin. It goes on easy, absorbs completely & it wears well with my other products. I LOVE how soft my skin feels after putting it on. I also love how it smells! The scent is quite strong but it disappears pretty quickly. Its definitely made my skin feel more hydrated & smoother. The only real downside is the steep price. Although I do really like this product, I would never pay the retail price for it. Super luxurious serum!
