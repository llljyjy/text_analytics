This serum adds radiance and provides lifting effects more than any serum I’ve ever used! My skin has a gorgeous, non-oily glow. Even my husband asked what I did differently.I noticed a change in the feel of my skin and a better overall texture. It feels great to put on & I always add a little to my décolletage and back of hands. Even great for mail cuticles! Smells amazing and is definitely my new go to product.I will definitely be back for more when I run out. Even great for post-chemical peel care! My favorite so far!
