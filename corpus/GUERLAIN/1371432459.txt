I decided to really give this serum a full test run considering that I received this product for free from Influenster and Guerlain in exchange for my honest review. I have my own skin care routine so that meant switching up my own serum for this amazing serum. I have been using Guerlain products for as long as I can remember (Meteorites Pearls and Primer anyone?) so when I received this, I knew it was going to be a winner. Apparently this serum has been years and years in the making to ensure they came out with a flawless product - and they definitely did not disappoint. My own serum worked ok but I swear that this worked its magic on my face. It left my face soft and incredibly hydrated after several weeks of use - and I know it was because of this serum. So let’s address the elephant in the room; the price. We all know Guerlain is synonymous with luxury so this product is no exception - this serum is an investment into achieving gorgeous, glowing skin. This will replace my former serum and now I can’t wait to see what Guerlain comes out with in the future. And you thought your serum was amazing
