Amazing product and very luxurious. I received this complimentary and I am so glad that I did. The scent is pleasant and not overwhelming, it reminds me of honey. The product glides very well in my skin and I mixed it with other products such as sunday Riley. I use this only at night because i wash my face throughout the the day and it would be such a shame to waste such an awesome product. So far I love it and I am excited to see how it is long term on skin. Amazing product
