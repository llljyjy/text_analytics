I’ve received a couple samples of this and I really like it. Makes my skin feel soft and smooth and feels so luxurious to put on. It’s lightly scented and smells nice. However, I don’t notice a change in the appearance of my skin, so I don’t think it’s anywhere close to being worth the price point. Nice, too expensive
