This really works! I have very sensitive skin and also a weird sun allergy - which means I have a ton of problems with my skin during summers. And I use mineral sunscreen, so I end up having very dry skin during summers too. This serum is just super smooth, very hydrating, has a cooling effect and leaves my skin looking glowing and radiant. Has the most beautiful scent ever. For the first 2 weeks I did get some pimples, but I read up online about them and apparently it was purging my skin of impurities. After those two weeks - I havenâ€™t had a single pimple and I can see visible difference. Also - so happy that it is mostly a natural ingredients based product and I absolutely love the scent, though it is a little strong and might be irritating to some. (I like heavy scented products) All in all love it enough to splurge on it every once in a while. (It is a premium beauty product $200+ which is the only reason I would not be using this all the time so this is going to be skin spa for days I feel like it!) This really works!
