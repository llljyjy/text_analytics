I received Guerlain Abeille Royal Double R Advanced Serum for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion about this product. I have combination oily skin with T Zone oily. When it comes to skincare products, I always like to use the product at least for 3-4 weeks before I pen my opinion about the products. In this Vox-Box I received this serum along with a mini dropper of oil water serum. I have been using this serum everyday both day and night and haven’t had any issues. This is a serum with advanced radiance and lifting effect technology, that targets visible signs of aging and makes your skin appear smoother, brighter and makes your pores appear redefined. This serum combines two technologies to create a highly effective action on the skin. It’s a beautiful luxurious serum that I am in love with. This serum comes in a very luxurious bottle. It looks very luxurious on your vanity. Its defiantly a little pricy if you are someone who’s in the market to buy a new serum and don’t mind spending money then this is a product to try. I’d highly recommend this to family and friends! Luxurious Product
