I enjoy this product. It sits nicely on the skin and absorbs well. It’s not tacky or heavy. It plays well with other products and doesn’t pell with my moisturizer or sunscreen. I do have to take away a star for the strong scent. Otherwise it’s a good product no notable differences in my skin yet but with prolonged use I think it may stand by what it claims to do. Likable but not lovable
