My initial impression:I loved the texture of this serum itâ€™s a dual that spreads very easily and soaks in well. My skin felt supple like a succulent peach. Time will tell if this lives to its claim of reversing aging but I look vibrant.Few days after: this is causing my skin some congestion and small white heads. I like the texture but my skin feels supple upon initial application but leaves me dry after a while. nan
