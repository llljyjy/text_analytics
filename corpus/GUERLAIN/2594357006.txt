I am amazed at how well this serum works! The bottle itself is gorgeous and the pump is easy to use. The formula comes in two parts that combine when you pump out the product. There is a light scent, although it isn’t too overpowering and it disappears within a few minutes. The consistency is gel-like, not greasy or oily (which I appreciate as someone with oily skin). I saw a noticeable difference after using it daily for a few weeks. My skin was glowing, soft, and hydrated. It made putting makeup on a breeze as I had no dry patches where my foundation stuck to. Overall, I’m thoroughly impressed with this serum and will be repurchasing once I run out. Definitely repurchasing!
