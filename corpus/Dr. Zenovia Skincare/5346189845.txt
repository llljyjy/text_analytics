I have many acne scars from my teenage years and even though I’ve been religiously using retinol to help smooth it out, some of them are just pure stubborn. When I used dr. Zenobia’s scar gel treatment it actually lightening up a lot of the stubborn ones and made it almost invisible! I’m going to keep using it and I hope with time these dang scars will be gone. nan
