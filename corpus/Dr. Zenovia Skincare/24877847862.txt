I received a free sample of Dr. Zenovia Skincare Scar Gel Treatment from PINCHme. I’ve had great success with this product so far. I suffer from acne, so scars are just an everyday occurrence to me unfortunately. After using this product, I’ve notice the healing time is significantly faster than they would be normally. I’ve even tested it on old scars and they look to be healing as well. I’m very impressed with this gel treatment, and will have to get more when I run out. Works on old scars as well
