I may need to wait a little longer to see an effect from the scar gel. I’ve been using this daily, at night, for a few weeks and haven’t noticed much change. But I will keep using it to see if that changes. It has not irritated my skin, so that is definitely a plus. I will stay hopefully that it will eventually give me some results. I have enjoyed other Dr Zenobia skincare products I have tried in the past nan
