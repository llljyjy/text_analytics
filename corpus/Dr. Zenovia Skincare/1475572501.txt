I received this cleanser in exchange for my honest review and I was honestly really excited to receive it. I am already in love with the Dr. Zenovia Aloe Vera Blemish Soothing Moisturizer, so I was happy to add this to my routine for the month. I feel like everything in this brand is just clean, non-greasy and soothing. I often have problem skin around PMS time every month and I can always rely on this brand to moisturize and cleanse without breaking me out even worse. I really like how this cleanser smells, very light but pleasant. I may have to rebuy this one when it runs out, I really like it!! Great Little Cleanser!
