I have been using for about a week now and I am happy with it so far.It’s very hydrating, moisturizing and soothing. My lines and wrinkles are looking less pronounced and my skin smoother and a little plumper.I especially like to use this cream after exfoliating, or using a peel. I feel it replenishes my skin of moisture.I love it can be used on my neck too and I have notice my neck looking firmer.It’s very light cream with a very mild pleasant scent.The only think I don’t like is it doesn’t absorb into my skin. It sits on top. If I use at night and then wash my face in the morning I can still feel it there.Otherwise I love it. I also love this brand. Very hydrating
