I am obsessed. I’ve been using this for a few weeks now and I’m SO happy it’s available on Sephora.com now!!! It is such a good *almost* Aquaphor-esque consistency, but lighter and more blendable and it really hydrates and the area and truly lightened up my scars in a matter of only a few weeks. I’m love Dr. Zenovia’s whole line, and this is just a another winner! AMAZING for both acne scars and other scars!
