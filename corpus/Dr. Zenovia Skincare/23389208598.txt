I have now been using daily for about one month Dr.Zenobia Bakuchiol Hydrating Cleanser and I’m sure glad I did. My face has been taking abuse for many years with harsh weather conditions and hand soap. We just got back from a cruise and I felt that it was the perfect time to start using the cleanser and it has worked. My fine lines on my face have smoothen out due to the elasticity of my skin has increased. My new find has increased the hydration in my face and it feels much softer now. It’s only been a month so hopefully I can start a new regime on taking better care of myself. Makes my face feel smoother and younger
