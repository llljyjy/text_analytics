Dr Zenobia skincare has got to be one of my favorite lines. The Inflam-Aging Night Repair Treatment does not disappoint. I have combo/oily skin and this leaves my skin smooth, non-greasy and brighter in the morning. My pores appear smaller, my face has zero redness and my face feels velvety soft. This is one of my new favorites Amazing results after 2 weeks of use.
