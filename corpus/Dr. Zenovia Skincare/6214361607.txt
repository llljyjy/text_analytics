I like this cleanser to an extent. The packaging is nice and you get a ton of product. The pump dispenses the perfect amount for each area of my face. My skin does feel clean after using it, but I find myself still reaching for a different cleanser sometimes when I want that deeper clean feeling. It doesn’t break my skin out at all and it’s very light, so it’s probably perfect for sensitive skin. It’s good, but not my favorite.
