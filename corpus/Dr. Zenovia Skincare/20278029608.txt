Ok, so my skin is all over the place. I am dry, I’m oily, I’m just a mess lol! I have struggled to find a face wash that actually helps me. I have a dark spot on my forehead that gets red and itchy. It isn’t always super noticeable to others but I see it. Nothing I have tried has helped. I really didn’t have high hopes for this face wash. To my surprise it actually works! It moisturized my skin and made it soft without it feeling oily or greasy. It also took away my dark/red spot! My skin all over is clearer and not splotchy. I actually had a facial done about two weeks after I started it and my aesthetician was blown away at how amazing my skin looked! Miracle wash!
