After using Dr. Zenovia Peptide+Ceramide Repairing Moisturizerf for a couple of weeks I really didnâ€™t notice any drastic changes with my skin.  It is a light moisturizer with a slight pleasant scent.  I found that it goes on very nicely and my skin feels soft without feeling oily or heavy.  The only problem that I had with this product was after applying the moisturizer my skin felt like it needed more moisture.  This is definitley a product that I will use when the weather is warmer. nan
