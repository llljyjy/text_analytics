I am in my late 30s and struggle with hormonal acne. I have tried every face wash out there from ones recommended by derms to high end options. This is the first face wash that I feel like is actually delivering results. I am three days into using it and I can already see a huge difference. My red spots are fading and my skin looks so much less congested. I never write reviews but I am so pleased with this product and highly highly recommend. Buying more product from Dr. Zenovia now! If you struggle with hormonal acne, get this!! nan
