I really liked this moisturizer. The scent was not overpowering, and it went on smooth. It did not feel greasy after application. This definitely helped with a couple of dry areas of my skin. My skin was left feeling soft and moisturized. The only reason I am giving this 4 stars, is because of the $79 price tag. Even though I received this product as a free sample and enjoyed using it, the price point would keep this as an occasional purchase. Product does what it says it will....
