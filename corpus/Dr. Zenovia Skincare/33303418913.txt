I think I am in love with this stuff. I’ve incorporated it into my evening skincare routine as my last step before moisturizing over the past few weeks. Here are my thoughts so far. It has a nice creamy texture and it absorbs very quickly into my skin when I apply it to my face. Immediately, I can feel a tingly sensation and it feels like my skin is tightening. It’s non-sticky and really moisturizes my skin at the same time. Although, I do follow up with moisturizer as usual. I feel like I can tell a difference in the size of my pores on and around my nose already. Plus it feels really nice and refreshing. nan
