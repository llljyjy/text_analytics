I am an advocate for clean, clear skin. A fresh fact just makes the make up application so much easier. I was given Dr. Zenovia clear complexion 10% benzol peroxide and cleanser for my honest opinion. Dr. Zenovia hormonal dermatology skin care line is very different then any one I’ve used before. It is clinically formulated for healthy looking, acne free complexion. This cleanser had 10% benzoyl peroxide that helps remove excess sebum and eradicate impurities. Your skin is still protected with antioxidants and aloe vera. I used a small amount and washed my face like usual. I could already feel a difference. I could feel a little texture when I began to scrub my face, gentle but effective. My skin felt brighter and felt so soft. I used the aloe vera blemish moisturizer to keep my skin looking and feeling it’s best. The third step would be the same spot treatment, which is self explanatory. Use this product as needed. I had a great experience with this skin care line. I would definitely recommend this product! A+ Beautiful Skincare Products
