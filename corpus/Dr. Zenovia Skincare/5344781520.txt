I really enjoyed this cleanser. It was very effective in removing all traces of makeup and residue on my face. I had to take a star off for the price. It is definitely on the high side for saying that it can remove wrinkles. My wrinkles have not budged but I was not expecting miracles. Still a great cleanser though. nan
