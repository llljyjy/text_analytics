I did not expect this product to feel like a silicone pore smoothing makeup primer. It feels like it sits on top of the skin as a barrier- when I woke up my pores on my cheeks looked a little smoother but my skin was so dry. I want to keep trying it just because of the price point but I donâ€™t know if I can get past the texture. nan
