I received this cleanser free for review from PINCHme. First for the negative, I am not a fan of the pump. It takes what feels like forever to pump out enough to wash my full face. I wish this was reconsidered. The wash is good, but it doesnâ€™t quite lather enough for my taste. However, it does appear to remove most makeup. Regarding the attached photo, I washed my face with the cleanser without doing a double cleanse. I then used a toner on the pad to remove residual. As you can see, there is a little makeup left behind, but it did manage to clean the rest off fairly well. I was wearing a full face after about 6 hours for reference. Impressed
