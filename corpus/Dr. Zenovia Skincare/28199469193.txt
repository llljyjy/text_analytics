I received a free bottle of this Dr Zenovia Bakuchiol Hydrating Cleanser from Pinch Me! I really love this product! The only con is the pump only pumps out a very small amount! So maybe a better pump in the future! But its definitely a good facial cleanser! It has a light orangish scent hard to explain! But it definitely works great my face felt so good after using this product! I would definitely recommend this product! I will also be purchasing this in the future! I finished with Dr Zenovia Aloe vera blemishing soothing moisturizer & my face felt great! Works great!
