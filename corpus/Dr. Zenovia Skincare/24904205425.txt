I have been using this on my son’s cystic acne scars and stretch marks.  The stretch marks are several years old and there are so many acne scars, I don’t know how old some are. I don’t think he has used it long enough or consistently enough to notice a big difference.  I am going to keep trying to get him to use it for several more months and more consistently.  If I notice a difference in a few months I will try to update his picture.  The gel is clear and has no odor which I liked.  It is easy to rub in and would probably make more sense for a smaller area of scarring.  (My son’s whole back is covered in acne scars and stretch marks.) I am hopeful that it will at least diminish some of the discoloration. Hopeful for good results, not enough time yet.
