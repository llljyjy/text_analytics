I received a sample of Dr. Zenovia Advanced Retinol Night Repair and was kinda hesitant to try it because I’ve had a few bad experiences with retinol. I’ve been using it for 3 weeks now and love it! No problems with it at all it goes on so nice and your face feels like butter. The fine lines around my eyes are better and old spots and acne scars are disappearing. It’s a great product! Like Butter
