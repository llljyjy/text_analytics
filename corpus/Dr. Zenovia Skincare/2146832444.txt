This spot treatment is wonderful! I have combo skin (classic oily t-zone with dry patches on the side of my chin) and this has cleared up just about all of my hormonal acne. I’ve seen a huge improvement in my skin and it’s not over drying either. Salicylic acid does not work for me but this product has turned my skin around. I also have sensitive skin and habe had no irritation. cleared up my hormonal acne!
