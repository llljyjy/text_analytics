This is a really nice gentle cleanser but the packaging is horrible. The container is very heavy and clunky. It seems like it would be easily breakable. When you try and get cleanser out, the pump is awkward and too short. It takes several pumps to get the appropriate amount out. As far as cleaning the face, it does the job without drying out your skin. It foams up nicely but I did not think there was anything too special about it. I have purchased much cheaper face wash that does a much better job. nan
