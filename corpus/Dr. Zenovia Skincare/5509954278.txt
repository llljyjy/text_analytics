DR. ZENOVIA SKIN CARE - ADVANCE RETINOL NIGHT REPAIR TREATMENT is pretty awesome. I haven’t been able to use it in the right way for straight time period but from what I have it has made my skin so soft. You can feel it as soon as you put it on. I was sure it would break me out because it’s really thick and I can’t stop touching my face but it hasn’t yet. It’s really yellow in color which normally means there’s a good amount of retinol in it so I’m positive this is going to make a big difference in my dark spots which cover a lot of my face. I was so glad there’s something out there taking care of hormonal issues and not just breakouts since mine are from stopping BC. Anyway I’m loving it. Best Night Time Repair Treatment
