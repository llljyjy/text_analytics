Dr. Zenobia’s Bakuchiol Hydrating Cleanser is way thicker than I imagined it would be! I feel like it makes it feel like some of the more luxurious skincare products you’d buy, but actually affordable! It left me feeling refreshed and didn’t flare my rosacea up at all and that actually surprised me. My skin was smooth for quite awhile after using this product, and I have extremely dry skin! Thick and luxurious!
