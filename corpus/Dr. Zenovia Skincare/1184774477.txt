I like this product. Very light texture and absorbing fast enough without stickiness feeling. But in my situation- I recommend waiting for at least 20 minutes before applying this treatment. If I use it right away-my skin peels the next day. Overwise is a very good product. My skin in the morning looks and feels soft, smooth. I do see that my pores get less visible and my skin gets tighter. I like the pump tube, texture looks runny but itâ€™s a perfect consistency. Sometimes I follow with moisturiser on top. My skin is picky but this product is a keeper. Keeper.
