I’m not too experienced with retinol so I don’t have much to compare this with. However based on the description this product sounds like a gentle but effective product. It takes a while to see results with products like this so I don’t know if I can expect a a drastic change with continued use. So far I don’t know that I’ve tested it enough to notice much of a difference. My skin usually responds to products fairly quickly but so far I haven’t noticed much of a change in my tone or texture. I’m not a fan of the texture as it tends to pill on me. It takes more than the normal amount of ribbing to work it into your skin. However my skin does feel really moisturized the following morning so for that alone it’s worth using it up. Considering the price I don’t think I would see myself purchasing this had I not received it for fee to review. Not for me but may work for you
