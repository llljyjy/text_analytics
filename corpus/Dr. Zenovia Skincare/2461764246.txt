I actually really loved the Dr. Zenovia Skincare Scar Gel Treatment. I was surprised at how quickly it started to diminish the appearance of my acne scars. I do think I will need to use it more consistently for a longer period of time, but I can already see the potential after just a couple weeks of use. Highly recommend! Very nice!
