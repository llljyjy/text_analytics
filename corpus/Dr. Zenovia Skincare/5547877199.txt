It’s too early to tell whether this is working but at this price point, I would not purchase this with my own money. I have a pretty gnarly vertical surgery scar on my belly and I’ve been putting this product on there. Aside from keeping it moisturized, I don’t know if it’s doing much. I think my tretinoin does a better job at fading it. nan
