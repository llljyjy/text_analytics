I like the Dr. Zenovia Skincare 5% Benzoyl Peroxide Acne Spot Treatment pretty good, though it does dry my face out a little.  It does help with acne and makes the spots look a lot better.  I usually use it at night, but I have used it during the day when I had a few spots that were pretty sore and irritated.  I noticed when I use this, the swelling goes down pretty quickly and itâ€™s nowhere near as red and irritated as it was before. I like this
