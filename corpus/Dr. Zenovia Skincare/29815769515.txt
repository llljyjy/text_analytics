I used the Dr Zenovia on a scar that resulted from a mole removal. The scar gel made a noticeable difference in the appearance of the scar! It didnâ€™t fade completely but it definitely made the scar way less obvious. I was able to apply the scar gel, let it dry, then apply foundation on top and it was perfect. Worked great even under makeup.
