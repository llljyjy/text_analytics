I am really happy with this acne spot treatment. It clears my skin and helps to prevent future breakouts. I like that it feels more like a lotion than a spot treatment. It goes on clear and is not noticeable at all on your skin. You can wear it outside of the house and no one would even know you have spot treatment on. nan
