I started using this retinol night repair treatment a few months ago and Iâ€™ve noticed a different in my skin it looks more plump, hydrated and it has helped minimize my acne scars and pores. I do not use it everyday because it can dry out your skin fairly fast so I use it everyd other night. Amazing results!
