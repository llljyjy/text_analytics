I was excited to try this as benzoyl peroxide has helped me greatly in the past with my acne. The morning after the first night I used this set; my skin looked great and I had some blemishes that cleared up overnight. After using for a few days AM and PM, my skin started getting irritated and I realized that my skin barrier was destroyed around my t-zone. I stopped using the products immediately and worked to get my barrier back in order. I think I need to use a product with a lower percentage of benzoyl peroxide. I have resumed using the spot treatment but very very sparingly. Positive: The sizes of all 3 products are really great for the price. I would recommend this set for anyone who’s skin is acclimated to applying a higher percentage of benzoyl peroxide. Kinda bummed this set didn’t work for me. But I may start to incorporate the products back into my routine; once per day vs. twice and see how that works. I am just very nervous since I finally got my skin barrier back intact. Kinda bummed, but willing to try again.
