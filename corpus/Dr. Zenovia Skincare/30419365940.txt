I love this peptide + ceramide repairing moisturizer from Dr. Zenovia. This is the first product I have tried from the brand, and I am impressed! I have been using this moisturizer for a couple of weeks now and my face feels more hydrated and smooth. I have also noticed a slight reduction in redness as well. It  does have a bit of a strong fragrance, but I don’t mind this. I have sensitive skin and working this new moisturizer into my routine didn’t cause any breakouts. Give it a try! Great moisturizer
