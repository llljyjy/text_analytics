I received this Dr. Zenovia Skincare Scar Gel Treatment as a free sample for my review. This being said, I found this to be a really great product I am adding to my routine! I have acne scarring and some historic deep scars on my face from a dog bite as a toddler—so they have been there over 3 decades. This product was helpful in reducing the acne scarring I’ve had for years, it had a warming feeling upon application but was not painful, I have sensitive skin and did not cause any breakout or additional skin issues. It was a thicker consistency which was good because it didn’t run down my face during application. I plan to continue using it to see more results regarding the deeper scars. Very good scar product!
