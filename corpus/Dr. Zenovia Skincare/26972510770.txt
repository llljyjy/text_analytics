I thoroughly enjoyed using this moisturizer and it easily absorbed into my skin. It also worked well with a SPF sunscreen over it during the day and at night, I used it on it’s own. I really enjoyed the scent, but I thought of others that might be very sensitive to fragrance and it might be a better product without the scent, or at least offer a scent free option.  The reason why I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is because it did a nice job hydrating my skin, but I didn’t notice any difference after completely finishing up the jar. Good to the Last Drop
