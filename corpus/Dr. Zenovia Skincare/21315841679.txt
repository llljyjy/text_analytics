I received a sample of this product to try and review and I have to say, I really like it. I added this to my nightly routine and it goes on smooth and does not smell. It has a thin consistency but a little still goes a long way. I have noticed that my face feels smoother than before and I am hoping it will continue to tighten some of my fine lines and wrinkles. I do think itâ€™s a bit expensive but I would rather spend the money on something that works. Great Product
