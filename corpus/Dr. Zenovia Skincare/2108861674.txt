Not to much of a difference. I don’t know if I was expecting all blemishes to be gone in the short amount of time of usage but I’m not completely sold. I guess I can see some difference but noting really noticeable. I like the feel of the product. It smoothed into the skin ok. No loud perfumes Okay product
