This was my first time using a retinol product, and I have really enjoyed it. I have combination skin, and have been using this for about 3 months now. I started out with using it 1 day a week, then up to 2, and now I use it every other day. I use it at night after applying The Ordinary hyaluronic acid serum. In the first few weeks, I did feel like I was going through a “purging“ phase- little bumps I had noticed beneath the skin for awhile were coming to the surface. Now, I am enjoying clear skin that feels very soft. This product did not cause me to be oily or dry, which is often a problem for my combination skin. It is very pricey in my opinion, but I do think that the amount in the tube will last for awhile.I was disappointed that this product did not have any warnings on it about retinol + sun exposure. Please note that if you are thinking about trying this product, you should do some research about retinol products ahead of time. Know about where to put it into your skincare routine, products to avoid using at the same time, and be diligent about wearing sunscreen. Clear, soft skin
