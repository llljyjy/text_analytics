I have been using this product for over 3 weeks.  It did fade a very recent scar on my left hand within a few days.  I purchased it to fade a spot from rosacea but so far have not noticed a difference, there may be a very slight difference but it is not certain yet.  My plan is to continue use until the tube is out and hopefully I will see results others have.  This does go on very smoothly, like nothing else I have seen. It is not too greasy and absorbs smoothly but does take 10 minutes to absorb and will look somewhat greasy in that time so I would not recommend using makeup right after application, I would wait 10-20 before applying or maybe use this product at night if you notice it is heavy.  I have it 4 stars due to price and the product amount but I do believe the tube will last over six months of daily use on a small scar. recommend
