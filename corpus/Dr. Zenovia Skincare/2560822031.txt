This is the best moisturizer Iâ€™ve ever used. I have seborrheic dermatitis around my nose in addition to combination skin. This moisturizer has saved my dry skin and also balanced my oil without causing excessive breakouts. It lasts all day and you only need a little bit to go a long way. Would absolutely recommend! nan
