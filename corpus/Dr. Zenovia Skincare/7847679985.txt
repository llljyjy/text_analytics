This treatment is absolutely amazing! I thought by reading the description it would be mainly for acne prone skin. Boy was I wrong! I use this every night after cleansing my face. I don’t use anything else. My skin has never looked better. My skin must love retinol! I’d definitely recommend this to anyone just trying to make their skin look better. More even, tighter, more toned, smoother... Just overall better. YES! Amazing!
