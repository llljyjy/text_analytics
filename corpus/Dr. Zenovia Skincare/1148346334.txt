I have been using the Dr. Zenovia Peptide + Ceramide Repairing Moisturizer for about 3 weeks now and I really like it. It has a light scent and is not too heavy on my skin. It makes my skin feel smooth and soft. I have combination skin and it does not make me oily in my t-zone. I also love that it is cruelty free. Great product! My skin feels so soft!
