The pump for this product was defective on my bottle, but I improvised and got it to work! I had to unscrew and pump for it to come out.. so JUST in case it doesn’t work out for anyone else.. just know you can unscrew it! Other than that - the product has been great! I love that it’s lightweight and it feels like it cleans my skin really nicely. It has a slight lather and comes off easily. The scent is super light and doesn’t feel overwhelming at all. My skin feels refreshed and clean after I use it. nan
