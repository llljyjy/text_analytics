I received this for free in exchange for my honest review. I struggle with hormonal acne on my face and I hadn’t found one product I was sold on until this. Salicylic acid doesn’t work well for me. But this works amazing. I use the spot treatment and the cleanser ans my skin looks so much better than before. I will definitely consider repurchasing. A little pricey but worth it. Love. Great results.
