Don’t be scared of the price tag! It takes a very small amount of this product and only a few uses each week so this will LAST you and it does truly show results. It’s worth the buck but please read up on retinol before use so you know what to expect. This product does take time to work but I’ve noticed a significant change in my skin. It’s very velvety and it applies like a dream. Give it time to work! Powerful stuff in such a small tube!
