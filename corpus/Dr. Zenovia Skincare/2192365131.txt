The Dr Z Ceramide and Peptide Repairing Moisturizer claims to plump the skin, help restore skin’s moisture, is fragrance-free and safe for normal, dry and combination skin.  This moisturizer contains peptides and ceramides.  The peptides are known to visibly firm and tone the skin, and the ceramides are known to restore the skin’s barrier while boosting hydration.  I love when products have these ingredients because it doesn’t irritate my skin, and I feel hydrated throughout the day.  Personally, I have normal to dry skin.  I experience the most dryness during the winter. So, I wanted to test the claims.  From the bottle’s outside appearance, it looks luxurious, and the weight of the bottle is slight heavy.  Upon opening the product, I did not notice a scent, which is great for people with sensitive skin.  The moisturizer immediately sunk into my skin, and I instantly felt hydrated. There was also a slight glow once I applied the moisturizer to my skin.  All in all, I would recommend this product, Dr Zenovia Peptide and Ceramide Repairing Moisturizer, to my family and friends.  I would also recommend this product for people with normal to dry skin. Review of Dr Zenovia Peptide+Ceramide Moisturizer
