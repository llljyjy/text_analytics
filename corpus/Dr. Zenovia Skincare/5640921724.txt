Absolutely amazing! This retinol treatment has drastically improved the texture of my skin, not to mention decreased breakouts, and made my face much softer to the touch. The best part of all, is the fact that I didn’t experience any irritation or redness when first trying it out. I also love the packaging, because the pumps allows you to use the right amount of product every time and it’s very travel friendly. Lastly, I wanted to highlight the  fact that the formula itself is very lightweight, spreads easily, and absorbs well into the skin. Highly recommend! nan
