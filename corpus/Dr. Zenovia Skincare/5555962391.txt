I received this as a free full sized sample through pinch me.  I have used Dr Zenovia before and I loved it. This time I was very excited to try the peptide and ceramide repairing moisturizer! It went on smooth and creamy like a rich lotion and had a great fresh fragrance added to it as well! I used this moisturizer over a span of a couple weeks and noticed a big difference in the dark patches of uneven skin tone on my face. I recently had a baby and I started getting dark spots on my face and it was very noticeable and ugly! I swear this stuff started making my dark spots disappear! It’s a bit pricey but I rarely wear makeup so I don’t want dark spots on my face. I really love this stuff!!! nan
