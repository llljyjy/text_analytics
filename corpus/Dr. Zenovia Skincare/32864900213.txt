I received a sample of Dr. Zenovia Skincare Clear Complexion Acne Solutions System from Pinchme in exchange for my review and am so glad I did! This product works great! I have always had acne prone skin and have tried many different products without anything really working consistently to clear my acne up until now. I wasnt expecting anything different here but I was wrong. Within one week I noticed the swelling and redness was reduced. Within two weeks I noticed the acne I had was drying up. I am now on week three and am noticing the bumps disappearing and a lot less new acne forming. Not only will I continue using this product I would also highly recommend it to anybody that has acne problems Love it
