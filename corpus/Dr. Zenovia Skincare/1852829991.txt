I have been using Dr. Zenovia Skincare Advanced Retinol Night Repair Treatment for about three weeks now.  I am pleased with how it has made my skin feel.  It goes on smoothly and doesn’t leave a sticky film.  I have some acne scaring and fine lines and I feel this product has been making some improvements with reducing the scaring and fine lines seem to be a bit less noticeable.  You can see in the picture how the product isn’t too thick and just glides on with a silky feeling! nan
