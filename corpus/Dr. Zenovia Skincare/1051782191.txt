I received a sample of Dr. Zenobia Peptide+Ceramide Repairing moisturizer as a sample from PinchMe. I am glad I did. this did not irritate my eyes or skin at all.  I really liked the Dr. Zenovia Skincare Peptide + Ceramide Repairing Moisturizer. It made my skin feel plump and hydrated and stopped the dryness I was experiencing. I also liked that it was not greasy or sticky at all and quickly soaked into my skin. No strong scent and worth every penny Keeping me Beautiful
