I only knocked off a star because it’s not in packaging like the picture, it’s in a toothpaste like tube. I personally hate those for skincare because you have to touch every part of it to squeeze out product and it feel unsanitary. Other then that, I love this product. For starters, it has a very pleasant smell. And it doesn’t burn my face like other benzoyl peroxide products I’ve used over time. I suffer from extremely obnoxious and consistent hormonal acne. No matter what I change about my lifestyle, nothing works. Every day, for the past 8 or so years I have had the same ugly chin acne. Dermatologists never helped either, and somehow this was my saving grace. I saw results over NIGHT, it’s amazing. My most stubborn pimple, that does leave for anything, that has existed for almost a decade, shrunk by half overnight after one use. Now each day I use it, the better the pimple looks, it’s practically almost gone. Never leaves my skin dry or tight, I just can’t say enough good things about it. nan
