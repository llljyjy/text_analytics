Been struggling with breakouts ever since I started a new birth control pill and couldn’t control it. Decided to finally bite the bullet and try benzoyl peroxide cleansers as salicylic acid wasn’t really doing it for me. This definitely did make a difference for me, I have less breakouts and they aren’t as painful or big anymore, just tiny ones here and there. I do recommend only using this a couple times a week though bc it is drying and to make sure to really moisturize after using this too Great for hormonal acne
