I received Dr. Zenovia Skincare Hormonal Dermatology Peptide + Ceramide Repair Moisturizer as a sample from Pinchme.com  and I could not believe how much my face looks after 2 weeks using this Moisturizer, all the un even color are blending really well, my face feels like one since I have a combination skin I cannot see any difference on my face.All the dark spots are dissapering without not erritaring my face and since I am in the first stage of menopause my skin complex specially on my face has been changed and I started super over dry skin and since I started using this face cream , my face feels so release and it looks younger.
