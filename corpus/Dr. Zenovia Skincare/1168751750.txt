First, let me start by saying that I am really enjoying this cleanser. It’s a thicker cleanser that looks really pretty, so it feels luxurious to use. It also does a pretty good job of removing makeup and getting my skin clean without drying it out. In fact, I have found my skin to be more hydrated since I’ve been using this cleanser. So, the product itself is great! However, I’m subtracting a star for the bottle/dispenser. While I realize that the glass bottle makes it seem classier/nicer the pump doesn’t work too well with this thick cleanser. I have to pump it several times to get enough cleanser in my hand to cleanse my face. Personally, I’d be just as happy with a cheaper bottle/pump if it meant that it was easier to use. Plus, I can’t help but think the price is higher due to the packaging too. Overall, I love the cleanser but not the container. Great Cleanser
