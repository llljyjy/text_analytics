I’ve been using Dr. Zenovia Skincare Inflam-Aging Night Repair Treatment and I can see the results! It’s has green tea, caffeine, antioxidants, medical grade aloe vera, natural retinol and vitamins A, C and E in it. I use it every night and my pores are smaller and my fine lines are less noticeable! A little goes a long way, when I’m applying it. My makeup applies more easily because my skin is smoother. I can’t wait to see the results might be in another month. It is a little pricey but for me, this product works! Amazing Night Repair Treatment!
