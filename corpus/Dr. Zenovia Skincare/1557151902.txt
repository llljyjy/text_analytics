Dr. Zenovia Inflam-Aging Night Repair Treatment was lovely to apply before bed, soaking in completely and not leaving any residue on the pillows. I was unable to detect any scent which is terrific for those who are sensitive. The best result of using this product was not breaking out the entire month I used it, smaller pores and reduced fine lines! Wonderful is my assessment in a nutshell. Clean smooth skin, without pulling and discomfort in the cold winter month here was what I experienced using this awesome product.  I do recommend this cruelty-free, gluten free preparation. Additionally, it is said to be artificial color-free, without phthalates, parabens, sodium lauryl sulfates, petroleum mineral oil, and propylene glycol. Ahhh, nice!
