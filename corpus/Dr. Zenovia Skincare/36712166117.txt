This is my first time using a Dr. Zenovia product and I love it so far. My sensitive, acne prone skin has turned around and this is the only change in my routine. I have been using this for about a month now and I can tell a big difference. My skin doesnâ€™t feel as sensitive, my acne is mostly cleared up and my skin feels hydrated and smooth. My skin had a rougher texture before. The difference has been night and day, I just wish I took a photo before. nan
