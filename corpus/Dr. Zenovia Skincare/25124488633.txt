Dr. Zenovia Moisturizer is great. I been using its for a little over a week and already seeing at big difference. I struggled with really dry skin and was looking for something that wouldn’t make my skin super oily. This definitely did the job. My skin is not flaky anymore and it’s hydrated but not greasy. nan
