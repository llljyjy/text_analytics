The Dr. Zenovia Peptide and Ceramide Repairing moisturizer is amazing. It is super hydrating and absorbs quickly without any leftover greasy/oily feeling. I love all of the ingredients in this moisturizer and a little goes a long way. It helped to calm and even out my skin tone. By far, my favorite moisturizer I have ever tried! nan
