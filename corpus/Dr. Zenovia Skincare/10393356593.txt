I received this product as a free sample for an honest review. The Dr. Zenovia advance retinol night repair treatment is a great product. It leaves the skin so smooth no sticky residue. I have combination skin and worked great for all my face. It does have a peculiar smell but doesnâ€™t last long. Overall a great product to fight the scars of acne and smooth skin. Great acne repair Cream
