I have been using this Dr. Zenovia Skincare Bakuchiol Hydrating Cleanser as my second cleanser for my nighttime routine and really love it. It has such a great consistency--it is a very thick gel. It was gentle on my sensitive skin and didnâ€™t leave me feeling dried out. I will gladly continue purchasing this! Great second cleanser
