I received this product for free from PINCHme in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using it for a couple of weeks now, I like it. A little goes a long way. It’s very gentle on my skin and hasn’t caused any irritation or breakouts. It cleans my skin very well without leaving it dry. I would recommend it. Good Product
