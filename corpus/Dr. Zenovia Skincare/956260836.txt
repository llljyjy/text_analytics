I LOVE this moisturizer for my dry skin during the winter months. It is very  hard to find a thick, creamy moisturizer that also has  Peptides + Ceramides  that actually works during the months when my skin is very dry and flaky.  I apply the moisturizer at night after my toner and serums. I love how this makes my skin hydrated, and plump . I wake up with my skin looking and feeling healthy and renewed.  I also love that it strengthen the skin’s barrier and boost elasticity. I am 50 years old and I am definitely losing some elasticity in my cheeks and chin. I did notice a slight improvement.  I do think it’s a bit pricey but honestly I would splurge on this when I run low. Amazing Moisturizer
