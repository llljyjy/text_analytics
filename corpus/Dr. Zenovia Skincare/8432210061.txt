This stuff is LIFE !! Iâ€™m 44 I have occasional break outs and redness from lupus my skin has never looked clearer . I was scared when I first put it on because it felt oily but it dries to like a satin matte and I cannot say enough how regular nightly use has changed my skin old spots and redness gone ahhhmazing
