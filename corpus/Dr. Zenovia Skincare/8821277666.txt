I have been using Dr. Zenovia Skincare 5% Benzoyl Peroxide Acne Spot Treatment for a few weeks now and I really like it! I have sensitive skin and was very surprised that it didnt dry my skin out or cause it to become really red. Within a couple of days I noticed that my acne was less red and was drying up. Within two weeks most of my bumps were gone or almost gone. I plan on continuing using this line of products! Works really well
