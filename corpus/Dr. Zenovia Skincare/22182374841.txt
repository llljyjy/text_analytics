I actually have oily/combo skin, but sometimes struggle with dry patches. Dr. Zenovia SkincarePeptide + Ceramide Repairing Moisturizerreally helped to hydrate the dryness and soothe any irritation.However, it sometimes made my oily forehead look a bit too shiny. I think this will definitely benefit those with dry skin ,but I also would recommend it to those with dry/combo skin.The best part for me is that it didn’t cause my skin to break out or “purge“. Too me, that’s incredible! Worth a try!!
