I received this product to try in exchange for my thoughts and opinions and I’m so happy to test this cleanser!  It’s very light and fresh and doesn’t strip the skin at all.  My only reason for bot leaving 5 stars is because I find that things like Bakuchiol aren’t as effective in products that you just rinse off.  Over continual use possibly.  Overall I do recommend this product. Fresh & Clean
