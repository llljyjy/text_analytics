Dr. Zenovia Skincare Scar Gel Treatment is nothing like I’ve experienced before in a scar treatment. The gel itself doesn’t have a scent but the consistency was surprisingly thick. When I applied it to my skin it had a velvety feel to it. I was expecting for the gel to leave my skin sticky because of its thickness but nope. My skin was left feeling hydrated and moisturized. I have dark acne scars and I definitely have noticed some lightening in the 3 weeks I’ve been using it. I’m hoping with continued use they’ll disappear completely. I had no adverse reaction to the ingredients. Give it a try. Good!
