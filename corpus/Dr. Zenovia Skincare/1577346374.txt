I enjoyed this moisturizer very much. It was thick and creamy and it absorbed into the skin very well.  I only use it at night as I feel more dryer in the evenings. It help keeps my skin well moisturized and the scent is very light.  I have noticed that my fine lines have diminished a bit, I definitely recommend this brand. Great moisturizer to have!
