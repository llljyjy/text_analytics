This moisturizer is perfection. It’s everything I look for in a moisturizer,literally. It’s a thick gel that goes on beautifully and sinks in to a nearly matte finish.  It never pills up my serums and I swear my skin already looks firmer/healthier after 10 days of am-pm use. I am in my mid 30s and appreciate the ingredients-and love the ceramides as I’m always trying to improve my moisture barrier.I know this is pricey but it’s worth it. You need just a bit and it spreads beautifully.Honestly, I can’t find anything I don’t like about this product. That’s something I haven’t been able to say in a long time. Absolutely Amazing
