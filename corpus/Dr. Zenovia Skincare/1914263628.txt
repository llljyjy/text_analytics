This cleanser feels so rich and hydrating. It is soap-free, which I appreciate, yet it does give a bit of a lather to make you feel like your face is really getting clean. It has a gentle, citrusy scent and a pretty pearlescent shimmer. The only downside for me is that the pump dispenses so little product at a time. I have to use 2-3 pumps instead of just one, which can feel unwieldy if Iâ€™m trying to dispense the product quickly with wet hands. Gentle, hydrating cleanser
