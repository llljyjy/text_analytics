I really like the solid ingredients in this Dr. Zenovia product and the fact that this moisturizer left my skin feeling supple and non-greasy.  I have sensitive skin, prone to break outs, and had absolutely no issues with this cream.  This rates 4 stars due only to the packaging - since itâ€™s not in a pump, the product is susceptible to air and contamination which can weaken the effictiveness of the antioxidants. Nice mixture of repairing ingredients!
