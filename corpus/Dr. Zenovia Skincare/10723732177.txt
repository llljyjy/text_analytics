I’m really enjoying this DR. ZENOVIA PEPTIDE + CERAMIDE REPAIRING MOISTURIZER. This is my favorite item of theirs I’ve tried so far. It has a very light, gel like consistency. It absorbs fast but leaves my face glowing. I really like this especially as a Spring, summer, fall moisturizer & winter as long as I’m not super dry. It does have a fragrance to it. It’s a pleasant scent, but I’d rather have fragrance free personally. Great glow
