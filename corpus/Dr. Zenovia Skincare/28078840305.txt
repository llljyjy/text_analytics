I received my Dr. Zenovia Bakuchiol Hydrating cleanser as a sample from Pinchme. I love the lightweight foam and the smell was pleasant as well, glad it isn’t overbearing. I noticed a different in my skin and looked refreshed each time. It’s a great product that I definitely recommend using and great for sensitive skin. A refreshing must-have
