I LOVE the packaging almost as much as I love the product. The bottle feels as if it is almost made out of some kind of ceramic and the pump properly dispenses the correct amount. It even looks great on a bathroom counter due to the minimalistic design. A little definitely goes a long way and my skin feels so clean after I use it. An overall great cleanser that I will be re-purchasing! Sleek packaging and overall great product!
