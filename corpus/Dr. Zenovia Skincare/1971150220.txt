I really like the results of this cleanser. I feel that it cleans my skin very well without stripping the moisture in my skin while keeping it supple and firm. Does not mess with the balance of my skin and does not make me breakout like some other face washes. The only reason I did not give it a 5/5 is because it does not lather too much so I feel like I have to use a little bit more than my regular skin cleanser. Overall though worth the price. Does more than just cleaning
