I was pleasantly surprised with this product. I am lucky to have sensitive, dry and flakey skin (specifically in the fall/winter/colder months). My skin reacts to many products, even those advertised as good for sensitive skin. Seeing the label say “Hormonal Dermatology“ was honestly scary.  However - This product is amazing! First of all, it is like a gel cream, super smooth and luscious and light to the touch. I love the thickness of the cream.  It feels cool upon application. It has no scent. Second, my skin is completely hydrated with this cream - no itchy, flakey skin for me! To boot, my skin is now glowing and looks plump and healthy.  I would definitely recommend! Pleasantly surprised
