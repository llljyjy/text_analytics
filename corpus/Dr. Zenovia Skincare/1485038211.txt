I liked this a lot but wouldn’t call it a new holy grail for me. I concern I have with a cleanser is if it will take off my makeup and if it will leave my face feeling clean or stripped. This did take off my makeup but sometimes I had to do a second or third washing to make sure. A small amount of this goes a long way so don’t pump out too much. My second concern was if it would strip my skin and it didn’t it left my skin feeling clean. I didn’t have any noticeable differences in skin appearances or break out but it didn’t make anything worse either. I would recommend this to anyone. Great product!
