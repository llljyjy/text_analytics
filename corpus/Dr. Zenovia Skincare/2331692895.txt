I have used the Peptide & Ceramide Repairing Moisturizer for about 2 weeks now. It feels very comfortable on my skin. Also, does a great job at moisturizing during the winter months in Arizona. I have used another hyaluronic moisturizer and it works as well as the other one at moisturizing. I like that it has both the hyaluronic acid ingredient and also has ingredients for firming. Not sure that I like that it has Dimethicone and Glycerin ingredients, but they probably help with moisturizing and smoothing the skin too. Nice effective moisturizer
