This products are REALLY GOOD. But keep in mind they do be strong. So if you have severe acne use it regularly and follow the steps. In my case I do not have severe acne but on my days a lot of acne comes out, I use it on my days only and the benzoyl peroxide spot cream that one literally takes away my acne in a day. Im not even joking. The cleanser is really good my boyfriend uses it and it leaves his skin like a baby! I love the moisturizer I use this one daily and it really hydrates my skin. I have been using this product for 4 months already and I have no negative comments on it. use it!!!!
