As I’ve entered my 30s and fine lines start appearing, I’ve been on the lookout for anti-aging skincare and thought this might fit the bill. The cream is lightly moisturizing and lightly scented and absorbed well. I first used it during the winter in Minnesota & it was not moisturizing enough for me on its own, so I layered it under a second moisturizer. Although I have aging, sun damaged skin that tends red/sensitive, I did not notice much of a difference with the Dr. Zenovia Inflam-Aging Night Repair Treatment. That said, my sensitive skin did not react to this product either. It might work for some but I would not purchase at full price. nan
