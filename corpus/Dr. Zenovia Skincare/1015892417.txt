I have been having major problems with my skin lately - I’m not sure if it’s my age (I just turned 40), or some other factor I haven’t figured out, but my skin has been breaking out like crazy, especially around my temples, forehead, and cheeks. There couldn’t have been a better time for me to discover Dr. Zenovia’s Advanced Retinol Night Repair Treatment. After almost a year of struggling with this new acne, this Night Repair treatment has been the ONLY product that has started to turn things around for my skin. The texture is different from most products I’ve used - it feels almost like putty, and can be a little hard to spread - but my breakouts began to calm down almost IMMEDIATELY. That has never happened for me before. It hasn’t created a complete 180 degree change for my skin, but it is the ONLY product that has halted my acne, and started to fade the scars that I’ve accumulated. The formula has also been gentle on my skin, and hasn’t caused any of the sensitivity or redness that I’ve experienced from other retinol products. I can’t say enough good things about this - I highly recommend it! Truly an amazing product, highly recommend!
