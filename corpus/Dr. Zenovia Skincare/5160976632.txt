I have been using this on my fresh scar for coming up on 6 weeks now. I can tell a big difference in color, texture and size. While I found it hard to remember to apply it the recommended 3 times a day, I did manage to apply it at least once a day. I plan to continue to use this and start using it on some older scars not that I know it works well. This Stuff Works!!!!
