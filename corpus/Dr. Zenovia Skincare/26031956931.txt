Definitely my new go-to spot treatment! I’ve even added it into my daily skin care routine just to help with enlarged pores and control oil in my t-zone. To be quite honest though, using Dr. Zanovia’s 5% Benzoyl Peroxide Acne Spot Treatment with the rest of the Clear Complexion System, I haven’t gotten much use out of it... as a spot treatment that is. I haven’t had any breakouts!!! I did have one massive break out when I started the system and this spot treatment did clear that up really fast. It was super effective. In less than 3 days my breakout was gone and it didn’t leave a dry patch or red spot which is unheard of on my skin. It’s also really gentle. I don’t know how it worked so fast. I have been applying a thin layer of it on spots with enlarged pores that tend to breakout and it seems to be helping significantly with those areas. My skin really does look amazing and this product has helped a lot. Any redness I might have had is gone and it definitely helps control oil without irritating my skin. I have been using salicylic acid my entire life, 40+ years, and I wasn’t sure this product was going to work as the active ingredient is 5% benzoyl peroxide but I am definitely now a convert! This amazing spot treatment also contains bakuchiol, aloe vera, and antioxidants which is probably why it feels so gentle. It’s not sticky at all and it doesn’t have much of a scent. It has a very light texture, it’s light like a lotion but has this strange sort of grit, as does its face wash companion, almost feels like you might have something on your skin, but that disappears as it is absorbed. I don’t even know how to describe the texture but this stuff is super amazing. It’s definitely a new staple for me and I definitely recommend you give it a try if you’re looking for a gentle yet effective spot treatment. Gentle & Effective
