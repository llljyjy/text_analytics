Pump itself seems very breakable, so I am super careful with it! I do love the scent and the texture of the wash. My face does seem a little dry after using, which is not an issue as long as I follow up with serum, but my skin does run combo/dry typically. I have been using it for 2 weeks now and have not seen any significant difference, but like the product enough that I will keep using it in place of my normal wash face for now. nan
