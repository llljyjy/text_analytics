This moisturizer did the job of moisturizing but I wasn’t very impressed with much else about it. It didn’t improve any fine lines or slight wrinkles I have or improve firmness. It did take away the dryness but it did what any moisturizer would do at a fraction of the price. I liked the texture of the cream itself though because it didn’t feel so heavy and suffocating when I had it on. It feels like a thick gel like consistency. Also, I did like the light citrus like scent it had. It felt refreshing to put this on and was a great moisturizer but I just couldn’t justify paying this much for this product. For that reason alone, I wouldn’t recommend it to others. It did the job.....
