Face masks are no match for this cleanser.. my horribly broken out skin has never looked better since I started using this cleanser!  I had received the product to try from pinchme and it arrived broken, as it comes in a heavy, glass bottle that makes the cleanser feel and look luxurious.  I was heartbroken and reached out to Dr. Zenovia to explain that I would not be able to review the product.  To my surprise, I received a replacement within just a couple days and am SO glad I did.  I wish that the pump worked a little better, as I do with most of the products from Dr. Zenovia, but I don’t even care because this cleanser is so good!  It removes my makeup, leaves my oily skin soft and clean without feeling tight.  I haven’t tried other bakuchiol products, but I am definitely leaning toward this rather than retinol now.  I cannot thank Dr. Zenovia enough!  This is by far my favorite product that I’ve tried from Dr. Zenovia so far, and is now the first cleanser I reach for. nan
