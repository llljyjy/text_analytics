I absolutely love beautiful design of this bottle, I’m not sure if it’s ceramic or something else but it is really really pretty. The cleanser comes in a pump bottle that dispenses the soap easily and makes the bottle easy to use. I LOVE the smell of this product and I also really love that you only need like 2 or 3 pumps to get a good lather. This is the first time I am using this brand and extremely happy to try this out as this is meeting all my expectations. I have combination skin so I always struggle to find the right skincare products that work for me. But thanks to this cleanser I think I found my match, it just works great on my skin.This is gentle enough to use daily and works great at removing all the makeup, dirt, and impurities from the skin and gives you squeaky clean skin.
