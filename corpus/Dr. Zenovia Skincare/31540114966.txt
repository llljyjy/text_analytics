I like that this treatment applies very easily and doesn’t irritate my skin at all.  I haven’t noticed anything negative since I started using it.  I also really like the packaging.  It’s very convenient and sanitary.  My only real complaint is that I haven’t really noticed much of an improvement in my skin.  I also wish it was more nourishing. Seems pretty good
