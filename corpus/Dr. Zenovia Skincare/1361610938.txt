I was really excited to try the Dr. Zenovia Retinol as I’m still trying to find a great retinol that works well with my skin type. This works great on my forehead and chin area but it wasn’t the best for my cheek area, I experienced increased redness and breakouts in the cheek area but that is normal when I try retinol. My skin can be sensitive though. I thought the texture of the product was great and I will continue using it on my forehead and chin. Also doesn’t have a scent to it which is great! nan
