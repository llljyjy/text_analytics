I have been using Bakuchiol Hydrating Cleanser for about two weeks. I have noticed that my face feels so much more moist and smooth. I think it will really help with my fine lines as I continue to use it. The bottle is nice and heavy, and you can tell it is a quality product. My only complaint is the pump needs to either be higher or a little bit longer so it pumps out onto your cloth or hand. Great cleanser - very hydrating
