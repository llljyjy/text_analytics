I have been using the gel for a month and I’m 50/50 on it.  I have super pale skin and every time I get a pimple, it leaves a mark.  I used this on both an old pimple scar from a year ago and a fresh one from a few weeks before I got this product.  This worked at minimizing the appearance of the new one, but did not do so well on the old mark.  The product itself is very nice; it’s a super smooth unscented gel that rubs into skin easily.  I also have very sensitive skin and this caused no issues for me.  I’m going to keep using it to see if I notice any improvement on my old acne scars, but it definitely seems to be more beneficial on newish scars. nan
