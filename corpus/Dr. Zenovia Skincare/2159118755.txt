This is a really great moisturizer. It has already done wonders for my face in just the little bit of time that I have been using it. It is lightweight and it moisturizes very well. I really like the fact that it doesnâ€™t leave an oily residue. It is very gentle on your skin and for me it is already starting to diminish some of my fine lines and wrinkles. I highly recommend this product. Great Moisturizer
