I was skeptical of this product from the start. I didn’t know if “DR.“ was just clever marketing. I also don’t believe generally in topical hormonal stuff, especially since to my knowledge, my hormones are normal and good. However, I had a small dry spot on the side of my nose that my normal moisturizers weren’t “fixing“ and this did the trick. I still don’t know if I believe it has anything to do with hormones. but I do know this moisturizer is helpful for me! Skeptic turned lover
