DR. ZENOVIA PEPTIDE + CERAMIDE REPAIRING MOISTURIZER helped my skin tremendously. I have been using the product for two plus weeks and can really see the difference in my skin. I love the scent, texture and creaminess. I used it as instructed. I massaged it all over my face and neck every day. It absorbs quickly and doesnâ€™t leave a greasy feeling afterwards. Highly recommend! I received a free product from PINCHme, for my truthful and honest review. Great moisturizer!
