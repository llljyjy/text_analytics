The face wash through me off because it has scrubby beads in it, which I do not prefer. I wish it only contained chemical exfoliating ingredients especially since itâ€™s specialized for acne. The spot treatment was actually really nice and super effective. A little goes a long way! The moisturizer was nice but nothing that blew me away. I feel like this would be an amazing kit with a few adjustments. Remove the beads in the face wash and the fragrance! Some hits and some misses
