Received this full sample product from Pinchme. I like this brand and have received other Dr. Zenovia products before. Been using for about 2-3 weeks. It at first had a tingling effect but quickly stopped. I have super sensitive skin so I was nervous this would cause problems but it didn’t. It does what it advertised and shrank pores slightly. It did reduce redness and some puffiness. I would recommend this product absolutely. Good night crème to reduce pores
