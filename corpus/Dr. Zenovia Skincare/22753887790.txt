Dr. Zenovia Peptide + Ceramide Repairinf Moisturizer is very hydrating. I’ve been using it for a night cream for about a month now and i notice it has made such a difference with my skin’s texture. Peptides for skincare is so essential. I really like how this feels on my skin and I’ve noticed a difference after only a few uses. I can’t wait to see the effects from even longer use. Hydrating
