I suffer from hormonal acne and have been looking for a product to help. This acne spot treatment really has helped to keep my flare ups under control. I typically donâ€™t have sensitive skin to benzoyl peroxide products, but this one did at first cause a little redness and dryness. But, once my skin got accustomed to it, this product was great. But, if you have very sensitive skin, I would use caution if you decide to purchase. Great product!
