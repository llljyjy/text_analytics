If you have acne prone skin and hormonal acne this is def the face wash you want to use. I have eliminated my hormonal spots after incorporating this face wash into my routine. One pump is more than enough. It feels a little drying when you first start to use it but as your skin becomes accustomed it feels fine. Really impressed with this one Actually works!
