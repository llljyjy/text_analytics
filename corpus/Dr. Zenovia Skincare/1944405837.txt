Dr. Zenovia Clear Complexion Acne Solutions System is very effective for my acne prone skin. It can be very drying though, so I definitely don’t recommend that you start using it every day from the beginning. I also recommend that you use a heavier moisturizer at night. If you don’t, you might end up having extremely dry skin. Otherwise, it’s a great system for helping clear up breakouts and I’d recommend trying it. nan
