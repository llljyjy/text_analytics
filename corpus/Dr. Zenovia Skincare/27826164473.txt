I have been applying Dr. Zenovia Skincare Inflam-Aging Night Repair Treatment nightly for close to two weeks and have noticed some positive results. My skin is firmer and better hydrated. It has helped somewhat with red pigmentation and reducing darkness around my eyes, I am hoping with continued use that the product will continue to brighten and reduce aging effects. The lotion is non-greasy and goes on smoothly and has not caused my skin to break out. A little seems to go a long way. Happy with the results so far.
