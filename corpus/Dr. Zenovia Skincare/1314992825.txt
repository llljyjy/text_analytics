I was so excited to try the Dr. Zenovia Advanced Retinol Night Repair Treatment and was not disappointed by the amazing results! I applied a thick layer each night and let it sink in and followed by my moisturizer. I had some uneven skin texture and skin tone and acne and with continued use it cleared away like magic! In the 4 weeks of using it approximately my skin texture was so much smoother, my skin tone was so much cleaner, more even, and radiant, my acne had cleared up, and my skin felt firmer as well! I feel the retinol in this overnight treatment really is strong and works wonders and love it!! magic treatment
