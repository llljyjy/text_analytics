Dr. Zenovia Inflam-Aging Night Repair Treatment is a light cream that pairs well with my moisturizer. It has kept my skin hydrated in the morning,  even in the harsh and drying winter season. I’m happy that I didn’t have breakouts which sometimes happens when I introduce a new product on my face. I love that its phthalate,paraben, sulfate-free and is not tested on animals. Great product
