The Dr. Zenovia 5% Benzoyl Peroxide Acne Spot Treatment works really well. My chin tends to breakout and I used this in combination with the cleanser and moisturizer and it cleared up most of my acne. I only use this directly on each pimple because it can be drying. It shrunk down a big spot overnight for me the first time I used it. I will definitely keep using this to treat acne that I get. nan
