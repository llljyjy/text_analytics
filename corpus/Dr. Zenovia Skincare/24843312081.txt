This cream is honestly the most expensive skincare product I have ever used. Naturally, I had high expectations. It does not disappoint at all! I am sensitive to fragrance, and this has a light, fresh smell that is very pleasant. Not too strong at all but nice, I love it. The texture is great too. It is light weight feeling, like a creamy serum. It blends right in and does not feel like a greasy thick layer on my skin, like most skin creams. It does leave a light layer feeling, almost like a mineral or light powder finish (not with a tint, but in texture. Skin feels so smooth though not dry). It feels the nicest on my skin of any cream I have ever used. Also, another of my favorite parts of this is how it really does make an instant difference! My husband never lets me do skin care stuff on him because he has such sensitive skin (prone to breakouts). I kept ranting and raving so much about this cream that he finally let me put it on him. For the first time, he had no complaints. He had me put it on his beard for some reason, he liked it that much. He never got any skin irritation at all & while he claimed to see no difference, I noticed! My only complaint, you could say, is that I wish it came with more. The quality is so good though, I am okay with the size. Bigger would be nice, but it is still worth it! Great product, makes me want to try the rest of the line! PS, I am not sure if this is just me, but it makes me eyes jumpy/twitchy for a little after Iâ€™ve put it on, and it makes my finger I apply with feel a little numb. That was just added confirmation for me of how potent this is! Actually lives up to its claims!
