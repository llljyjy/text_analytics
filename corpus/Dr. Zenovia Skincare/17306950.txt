Iâ€™ve been dealing with dry, flaky skin (which I hate) and this product, Dr. Zenovia Peptide + Ceramide Repairing Moisturizer has solved my problem. Richly hydrating yet not thick nor greasy, this product glides on nicely, is absorbed quickly, smells great and has left my skin so soft and smooth with all dryness gone. Very hydrating
