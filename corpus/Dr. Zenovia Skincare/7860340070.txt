The cream is luscious, absorbs well, and VERY hydrating and smoothing. However, for me the fragrance is too overpowering and lingers quite awhile. As much as I love the feel of the cream, I don’t think I can even finish the jar, much less repurchase. I gave 4 stars because the cream IS luxe, but wouldn’t recommend if you’re sensitive to fragrance like I am. Oh well. Sensitive to Fragrance
