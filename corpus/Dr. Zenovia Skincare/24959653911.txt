Let’s start off with the smell. I really like that it smells very plant based and with just a few pumps it cleans my face. It doesn’t leave my skin nor dry nor oily. It’s perfect for my oily acne prone skin! I received my sample from pinchme and I will definitely purchase a full size bottle. This cleanser does hydrate but it hydrates just the perfect amount!
