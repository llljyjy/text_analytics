I swapped out the Juviaâ€™s Place Glow Serum in my routine for this product.  I have combination oily/normal skin with crater pores and occasional single pimples.  My skin was under good control before using.  The package is a tube with a pump.  It is a thin lotion consistency.  I have noticed any pimples I get deflate after a night with this on.  Otherwise, I have maintained my control.  In other words, I do feel it works well.  I am just not sure about the hormones in the product.  That is my personal hangup.  Thank you for letting me try this. A good Bakuchiol product
