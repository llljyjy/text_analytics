I started using Dr. Zenovia Skincare Inflam- Aging Night Repair Treatment for just about a month now and I’ve noticed a difference in my fine lines and how my skin feels after a night’s sleep. It still feels as nice in the morning as it did when applied. I use in conjunction with a moisturizer that isn’t too heavy as to not complete with the Dr Zenovia repair treatment. It plumps my skin as to not make my fine lines as noticable and I look refreshed. Being in my mid 50’s it’s important to me to find products that work well on dry skin to help keep my skin moisturized. This product doesn’t irritate your skin and if applied close to my eyes doesn’t irritate them. There is no noticable fragrance and it’s easy to apply. My skin feels so moisturized and smooth
