I received a sample of Dr Zenovia Skincare Scar Gel Treatment.  I used the product for three weeks applying both in the morning and before bed.  I used it on an old scar I received from  a burn.  It was easy to apply and was not scented.  My scar has faded a great deal .  l plan on continuing to use it until the scar is gone.  I like this product and would recommend it. nan
