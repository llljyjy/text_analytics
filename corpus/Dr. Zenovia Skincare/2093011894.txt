This moisturizer is great for my aging skin.  I like the ingredients as they help my dry, patchy skin feel and look so much better.  I really like the texture of this cream.  It is not heavy at all and absorbs well into my skin without leaving a greasy/oily feel.  You only need a small amount to cover your entire face.  I  really like that this is cruelty free and does not contain any harsh ingredients. It is also recyclable. This is a great moisturizer for all skin types.  I am very happy with my overall results. Great repairing moisturizer
