The Dr. Zenovia Bakuchiol Hydrating Cleanser works great to remove makeup and cleanse my skin. My skin feels hydrated after use and there was no irritation. It does have a slight mediciney scent to me but that doesn’t carry forward after use and fades quickly. The one major flaw is the bottle. The pump is terrible. It is a bad design. There are 2 parts to the cover and if you put the top cover on and take it off, many times the second part (which is right under the pump) comes off too. The actual pump takes forever to get product out and doesn’t work well. I would not purchase this product if the bottle/pump design stays as is. I am giving it a 4 star because the product itself is very good but that pump needs to go. Great Cleanser But Terrible Bottle/Pump Design
