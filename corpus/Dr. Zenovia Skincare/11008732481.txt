I suffer from hormonal acne, the deep under the skin cysts that hurt and reappear every month in the same spot. This is the best benzoyl product I have tried. My skin is brighter and my cysts are gone. I will occasionally get a small white head, but nothing like before and it clears up within a day or two. I only use this in the shower, once a day. For the first two months, I used this every other day because my skin needed time to adjust to the strength. I have been using this product for seven months now and just bought a second, you don’t need a lot. The product isn’t as pictured, its a squeeze tube not a tall skinny plastic jar. I do not care what it arrives in as long as it arrives though. The product is a white lotion/gel with a slight grainy texture. It smells like how most acne treatments do, kind of chemical-y.
