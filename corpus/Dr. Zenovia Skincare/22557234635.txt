I really enjoyed the Dr. Zenovia Skincare Peptide + Ceramide Repairing Moisturizer. My skin has been so scaly and dry this winter season and I needed something super nourishing and moisturizing without clogging my pores. This was just what I needed. The feel of the moisturizer itself is incredibly luxurious and silky. It leaves the skin feeling so dewy and healthy, but not sticky or oily. The scent is very light and enjoyable. The results that I personally experienced were better hydrated skin and a feeling of plumper more healthy appearing areas that have naturally fine lines. nan
