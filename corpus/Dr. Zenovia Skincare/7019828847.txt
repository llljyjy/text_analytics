I suffer from acne on my cheeks and chin area ,but I’ve managed to control it more lately , this product definitely helps without making my face itch or completely drying it out, I’ve tried other spot treatments before but this is by far the best one. I would say it’s a bit on the pricey side but that would also depend on how often you go through it. I like to use it overnight and my blemishes aren’t as noticeable in the morning. Great spot reducer
