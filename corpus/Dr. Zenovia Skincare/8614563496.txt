I am allergic to salicylic acid so finding acne products are a struggle usually for me so I have been using the same benzoyl peroxide face wash for over 5 years now and it has worked great. Recently the product was discontinued so I tried this because it was one of the only other products I could find with 10% benzoyl peroxide and it is so amazing. It makes my face feel so clean after using the face wash and after just a week my skin is glowing and looks amazing. I highly recommended! Great Product!
