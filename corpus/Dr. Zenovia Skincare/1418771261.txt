I have been using Dr. Zenovia Peptide + Ceramide Repairing Moisturizer for almost a month now. I am really starting to notice a great difference! My face is definitely more moisturized, which is perfect for the wintertime, as I experience much drier skin than normal. I also noticed my skin feeling more plump, which is definitely a positive. I didnâ€™t notice any greasiness. This has a light scent and it feels super lush after you apply it. This is great for my hormonal acne. Super moisturizing and plumping!
