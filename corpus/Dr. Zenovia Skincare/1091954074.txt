I suffer from hormonal acne especially right before my period, this product worked really well for that time of the month. I do have semi-sensitive skin and it’s winter time where I live so I wouldn’t be able to use this product all the time right now. It would be way too drying on my skin for continued everyday use. I could use it everyday if I was in a more stable climate or in a different season like summer. Worked great for that time of the month
