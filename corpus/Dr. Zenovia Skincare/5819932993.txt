This is a great product!! To start, It comes in beautiful packaging with a sleek design that can be displayed for a beauty regimen. The creamy gel is nicely spread, and I felt a slight tightening (I wasn’t sure if that was supposed to do that, it wasn’t bad!). It’s in my rotation of face cleaners now! Great!
