Ive used many humidifiers over the years and nothing compares to Canopy’s! Not only does it have a beautiful look, but it has an amazing run time, isn’t loud (the sound is quite soothing actually!) and the lack of a visible mist makes it so appealing! The first night I used it, I literally slept the whole night without waking up once because of my dry sinuses. The essential oil that comes with it? AMAZING. I’m sooo sensitive to smells and it is so perfect and light, and doesn’t give me headaches or sneezes. I also love that the scent goes on a little puck on the humidifier rather than inside of it. This is definitely a staple for the bedroom and plan on getting one for all the other bedrooms in my house! Canopy did this right!!!!!
