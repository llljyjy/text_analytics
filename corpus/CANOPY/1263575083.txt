They did many things right with the design. It’s a perfect size for a bedside table, easy to fill water tank, scent diffuser, etc. However, I had to return because only the lowest setting was barely tolerable at night. I didn’t feel any moisture in the air at that low setting. If they fix the noise issue I would repurchase. Too Loud!
