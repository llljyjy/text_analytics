I got this humidifier a week ago and have been loving it so far. I’ve been wanting to get one but am pretty picky about the aesthetic of my house and this one is SO PRETTY! It’s so easy to clean, the perfect size, and smells amazing-- worth the money in my opinion.I’ve already noticed a huge difference with my skin. I’m a very dry gal and this has made a noticeable difference already. I may have to get another one for the living room but will give it another few weeks. :) The Perfect Humidifier
