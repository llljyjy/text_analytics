Pros:-Noticed a difference in my skin with 1 use - less irritated, tight and shiny when I woke up!-Also helps with congestion! I was over a week into a bad cold when I received it and used it for the first time. I woke up without congestion or a coughing fit for the first time in over a week. -Pleasant white noise sound is not too loud or distracting to sleep next to Cons (minor!)-I didn’t smell the bergamot after putting the drops on the stone. Not sure if the scent throw really isn’t there, or I just got a dud. I want to try with my own diffuser oils to see if it works better -Filters need replacing every 4-6 weeks according to instructions, which gets expensive quickly if using most of the year Good for skin and respiratory system!
