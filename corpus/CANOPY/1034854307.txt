I was very excited to try this humidifier but i feel like the quality doesn’t match the price. The humidifier is made of mostly cheap plastic, you need to hold up a paper guide to see what lights are blinking and it’s loud. It’s actually louder than my air purifier that runs on a medium setting. The only positive would be that the air comes out ultra fine and not in a mist form like most humidifiers. I will be returning it because it feel gimmicky. Not worth the $$$
