I can’t sleep with out this now. It is a little unnecessary to spend this much on a humidifier but it is a cute one. The only thing I don’t like is it’s supposed to be light sensitive but it needs to be in bright bright light for it to shut off or it still runs so I have to unplug. can’t sleep without it
