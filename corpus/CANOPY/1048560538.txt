I knew while purchasing this it would be expensive, even with a discount code. I’ve gone through gallons and gallons of distilled water in one week even while on the low setting. Apparently it has an automatic feature during which the unit turns itself on even while on the ‘’off’’ setting. It does this in order to prevent mold from growing on the PAPER filter and to keep the unit clean. Therefore, be prepared to go through several containers of distilled water which isn’t TOO expensive but a hassle to always have on hand. Haven’t noticed much of a difference in my skin but I have combo skin so maybe that’s why. It’s also right by my bed and does not disperse the essential oil applied to the scent puck very far so not a big plus there. Overall, not very impressed. Not what I expected
