LOVE my Canopy humidifier. I live in an apartment with old radiator heat, and it wreaks havoc on my already dry skin and sinuses, so I’ve used a humidifier for years. Was so glad to find the canopy because it’s so easy to use and gets the job done! I love how easy it is to clean. I love the essential oils, too. The scents aren’t overpowering. nan
