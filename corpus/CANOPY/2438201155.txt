We LOVE our canopy humidifier so much that we added a second one to our home (in our kids’ bedroom)! It’s easy to use and clean (several parts are dishwasher safe), and there are so many benefits to using it. It’s a staple in our sleep routine now. We’ve noticed we breathe easier, sleep better, and miss it when we travel. It doesn’t take up too much space and is way more aesthetically pleasing compared to other brands we looked at when shopping around. Love the addition of the aroma puck. Just be sure to stay on top of when you need to change your filter. Love this humidifier!
