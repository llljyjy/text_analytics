I never realized what a difference a humidifier can make. My dermatologist recommended one for my dry winter skin and this one was so cute! It lives on my desk and runs all day while Iâ€™m working. I already feel so much better. Super easy to set up and clean as well (dishwasher safe)! 10/10 would recommend to anyone. Cute AND Curing
