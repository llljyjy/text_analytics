I have had my Canopy Humidifier for almost 8 months and I can’t sleep without it! I love that it’s both a humidifier and an air purifier so it’s distributing cleaner air when I sleep. I live in a dry climate (Sacramento) and I have noticed a huge difference in how dry my sinuses are on the nights I sleep with the Canopy running and the nights I sleep without it. The essential oil puck on the top is also clutch because it doesn’t require me to put the oil in the water which can muck up the humidifier itself.I personally need white noise when I sleep, so the sound it emits is perfect for my preference but may seem too loud to others. Super cute and effective!
