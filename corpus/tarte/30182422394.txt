I received this in a subscription box and finally got around to using it up. I personally have dry skin so I lean more towards thinker moisturizers. however, I did enjoy using this in the mornings. I found it to be hydrating enough but also light, allowing me to layer sunscreen withough it being too heavy.The scent is okay but could be more suddle. Good daytime moisturizer
