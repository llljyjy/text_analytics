IT’S GREEN!!  Not “green undertones“ like some tanners have. This stuff came out of the bottle green and stained my skin Hulk green.  WHY is Sephora selling this?  I’ve read the reviews and clearly I’m not the only person who’s bottle was full of green self-tanner.  Thank god I didn’t put this on any visible body parts or I would have been walking around like the jolly green giant for days until it faded. CAUTION: this stuff is GREEN
