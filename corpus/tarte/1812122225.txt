This is really the first whitening product I have used (aside from toothpaste with whitening agents). I bought it because the reviews said it wouldn’t make your teeth sensitive and it didn’t have an overwhelming taste. I agree. I’ve not experienced sensitivity and have no issues with the taste. It’s not had a super noticeable impact on my teeth but they are looking better. I also only use it before I go to bed at night and the directions say you can use it up to 4 times per day so I’d probably have better results if I used it more frequently. It’s super easy to brush on and dries quickly. I will purchase it again - it’s a really good product at a really good price. nan
