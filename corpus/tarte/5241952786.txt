I have mature combination skin which tends to be very dry in my cheek area.  I have used many products and have come across some good ones but I think this product checks all the boxes.  If you are looking for that super hydrated dewy glow this is your product.  It gave me glass skin and it was not overly greasy as my skin drank it up.  No annoying fragrance, no breakouts as of yet, and the price is decent.  Will definitely buy this again as I am obsessed. Dewy glass skin!!!
