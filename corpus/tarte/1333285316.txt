Been using this cleanser for years now. Itâ€™s great on my sensitive skin. I usually use this 3x per week as I switch between some others as well, but this is my go-to. Works for all skin types Id imagine because the gentle nature of it. It has a nice lavender smell. A little goes a long way with this and a 5 oz bottle lasts me quite a while. nan
