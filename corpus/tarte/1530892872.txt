LOVE this moisturizer. Fragrance and alc free. It leaves my face feeling well moisturized, Dewey but not greasy. Its gentle enough to use around eyes which is great since most eye creams are way overpriced! After I tried some other vegan face creams I came right back to this one. *I personally prefer the packaging as it keeps ingredients stabilized and away from light. When you think youâ€™re out, you can removed the top and get every last bit from the jar unlike other packaging. There is indeed the normal amount of product. Absolute favorite. My skin is AMAZING!
