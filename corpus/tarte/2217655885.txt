My go to eye make up remover! The pump is especially useful.  I just soak 2 cotton pads with the cleaner using the pump and left them on my eyes for 5-8 seconds, everything comes off! Mascara, eyeliner, eyeshadow.  Amazing! Gone through 3 bottles now getting a 4th one! Love it! Perfect for removing eye makeup!
