I have tried an ENDLESS amount of eye creams and this is a goodie. I noticed a difference within less than a week of using it. Whatâ€™s rare is that it layers well under under eye concealer - I even mix a bit of it into my  under eye concealer for continuous hydration throughout the day. There is no pilling and no unevenness and the are under my eyes appears brighter. I really like the consistency and that a little goes a long way. It also helps with puffiness in the morning. There is a lot in the package and it will definitely last me a while. I would ABSOLUTELY buy this and try it for yourself. Game Changer
