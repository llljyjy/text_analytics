The Rose microencapsulated moisturizer is a beautiful light weight formula. It has a pink clear color with a smooth texture. The moisturizer blends smoothly and softly, leaving my skin hydrated. I only need a small dab of moisturizer if not it will leave a sticky feeling on my skin. After using the moisturizer, I notice my skin looks brighter, more luminous, calmer with a hint of bounciness.
