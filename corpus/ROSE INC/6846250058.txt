Very nice eye cream. This product was gifted to me by Rose, inc. Since using Iâ€™ve noticed my under eyes are becoming brighter and less puffy. This product leaves my under eyes hydrated and moisturized. It is also a nice base for my makeup and prevents my concealer from creasing. It is kind of thick and will take some time to rub in so I suggest using very very little, but the pump makes it hard to pump out a little amount. Great product but too thick
