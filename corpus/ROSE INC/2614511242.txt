Really nice eye cream! It’s creamy and Belinda well into my under eyes. I love the pink hue to help with puffiness and brightening. There is a little shimmer glow but this helps to brighten the under eyes and I don’t mind it since it’s a perfect skin prep for makeup. The consistency is just lovely! I also noticed how this eye cream can be hydrating and give your skin that effect! I have been liking this eye cream! nan
