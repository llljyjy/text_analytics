I have been using this eye cream for couple of days. With my experience so far I didnot see much of brightening under my eye area yet  this cream certainly hydrates my skin under my eye and makes it look less puffy when used in the morning. I will continue using it to see the brightening effect. I would say that this product absorbs fast and doesnâ€™t make my under eye feel heavy or tacky. Great eye cream to wear under makeup too! nan
