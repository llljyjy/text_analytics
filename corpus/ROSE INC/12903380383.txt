Love using this product! Itâ€™s smooth and refreshing and sits well with makeup use. I put it in my mini fridge for that extra cold touch in the morning. I will say if you use an oil based primer/ products it might spread so I stick with my water bases! Definitely great for a bright under eye effect. nan
