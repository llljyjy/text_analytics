This eye cream is really lovely. Excellent dispenser. The texture is creamy and soft. Not too thick, not runny. Nice to hydrate but not become greasy. Not creamy enough to cause puffiness, but I would say the right texture for brightening and firming a bit. It creates a nice base before eye makeup. No irritation and no scent. The company that makes this is one of my favorites (do your research) and you wonâ€™t be surprised why this is so great. Definitely recommend this one for pretty much anyone. Great universal eye cream! Thank you Rose Inc for gifting me this product. Eyes are bright + beautiful
