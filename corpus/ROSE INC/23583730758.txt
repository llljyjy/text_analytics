This Rose Inc microencapsulated moisturizer immediately caught my attention because it appears so different than other moisturizers. I really like the microencapsulated beads because it makes the product more fun to apply and leaves my skin feeling very hydrated and glowy afterwards. Lightweight product leaves you with glowy skin
