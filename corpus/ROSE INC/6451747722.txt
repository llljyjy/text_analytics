This was my first time trying an item from the brand. I love how innovative this formula is, it makes the whole experience extra fun. I liked the application, however on my dry skin it was enough of a quencher for my skin. I think that anyone with normal to oily skin would absolutely love this product! It also has the most adorable packaging! not enough for dry skin....
