This eye cream surprised me! This is my first skin care product from rose Inc. I’ve been using it in the mornings. It has a light pink color that disappears when tapped onto the undereye. It’s very rich in texture but doesn’t feel heavy or leave a glossy finish. My under eyes are visibly bright all day! It is so brightening and I’ve never experienced an eye cream have such solid results! Gifted by Rose Inc. So brightening!
