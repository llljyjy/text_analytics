Great moisturizer for acne-prone skin. I’ve been looking for a good moisturizer that doesn’t make me break out and this is the one! I love how quickly it absorbs into the skin and doesn’t leave it sticky or oily. It has both Niacinamide and Vitamic C - which makes it a perfect cream for both nighttime and morning moisturizing. I don’t like buying a lot of diffident bottles for morning and night skincare routine, having one good product for all times is the best. Definitely recommend! nan
