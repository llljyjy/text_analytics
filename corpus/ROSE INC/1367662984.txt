I’m a dry skinned girl who needs serious hydration during the winter months. Gel moisturizers generally do not provide the hydrating effects that my skin needs during a New England winter - but this product surprised me. Not only did it quench my dry skin, but it absorbs so beautifully and quickly. The spheres are oddly satisfying when applying to the skin and the scent is subtle and not overpowering. After using this for a solid two weeks, I can say with complete certainty that this is my new favorite daytime moisturizer. It’s lightweight and wears well under a lightweight foundation. I still enjoy a richer cream for evenings, but I will absolutely repurchase this. I’m in love! Gorgeous!
