Rose Inc kindly gifted me the Eye revival brightening eye cream in exchange for my honest opinion. This eye cream has more of a serum consistency and a pearl like color which instantly brightens your dark eye circles.  After application and letting it set, it wears well under my makeup and leaves my eye area feeling moisturized. A little of this goes a lot way and it’s instantly effective. I can’t wait to see if it helps lighten the dark area under my eyes with continued use. Pearl tint
