I have used several eye creams, serums, etc., in the past trying to find one with the right active ingredients that will help brighten and fight the early signs of aging as I just turned 30. When I started using the total eye lift, within the first minute I saw my eyes depuff. I was so impressed with how my eyes felt! This helps firm, brighten, hydrate and smooth my fine lines. I noticed my skin feels brighter and I look more awake. I use it in the morning and I use it under my moisturizer. I pat it onto my skin around the entire eye area, in a gentle circular motion with my ring finger. Its overall formula is so gentle and absorbs seamlessly around my eyes. My fine lines have started to slowly fade. My dark circles have really started to lighten making my eyes look brighter. Ultimately, this has given me a brighter, healthier looking glow under my eyes while diminishing dark circles and crow feet. Even under makeup, this cream shined through! am enthusiastic about continuing to use this to see ongoing results. I will continue to purchase this product and highly recommend you give it a try!
