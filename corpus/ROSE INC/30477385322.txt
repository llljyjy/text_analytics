I had really high hopes for this eye cream since the reviews were really positive; unfortunately it just didn’t do much for me. I applied both day and night and really didn’t see any improvement in my dark circles. The cream was a bit shimmery but mostly just made my under-eye area look shiny, not really brightened. Unfortunately this product just didn’t work for me. I expected more, especially for the price. nan
