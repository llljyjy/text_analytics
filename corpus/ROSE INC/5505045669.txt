I was super curious about this moisturizer since it is the first skincare item I’ve tried from the brand. It is a gel consistency but has these little beads I’d compare to the consistency of fish roe that burst on your skin when you apply it. The beads are micro encapsulated ingredients which preserves them and makes them more effective. I loved how hydrating and cooling it felt on my skin! Very hydrating!
