I switched to the entire Rose Inc. skincare line (toner, serum, moisturizer) two weeks ago. I’ve seen  pretty great improvement in the evenness of my skin tone, my skin feels softer and my face maintains a nice glow throughout the day, but somehow it doesn’t provide enough moisture on its own. My skin has been flaking. I plan to add in an overnight cream to layer on top to see if that helps, but depending on your skin type and goals this may not cut it on it’s own. Dry skin beware
