This is soooo good! The only toner I’ve ever used that I feel like actually does something. If you have bigger pores, clogged pores or blackheads this will help your skin so muchhhhh. It honestly makes it look close to flawless after a couple of uses. I don’t have sensitive skin so I’m able to use this day and night but if your skin is more sensitive I’d say just use it at night. Also some other reviews complained about the scent but I actually really love it! this is a must by!!
