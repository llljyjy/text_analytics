Rose Inc’s eye revival brightening eye cream is a pretty pearlescent pink. It’s meant to diminish the appearance of bright circles and puffiness, but I did not experience very much of either effect. The formula feels nice and hydrating. I appreciate that it has no fragrance and it’s packed with nourishing ingredients like squalane, niacinamide, and fruit extracts. It does not irritate my sensitive eyes, which is a huge plus. It makes a nice primer under makeup, but on its own, it didn’t really diminish my dark circles or puffiness around my eyes. Nice primer, not as effective alone
