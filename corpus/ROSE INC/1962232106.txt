Okay! Let’s start with the packaging, I love it! The product container and spoon feel very high quality. The product itself has a different texture than I was anticipating but it’s easy to apply and feels great on the skin. It’s not sticky and absorbs nicely. The scent is wonderful. The only thing I don’t love is the oily type residue on the skin after application. nan
