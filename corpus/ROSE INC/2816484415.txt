The jar is super hefty. It’s clearly a luxury product in frosted glass packaging. The texture is like nothing I’ve encountered before - it’s like rose beads suspended in literal pink gel. It’s not a lotion at all. It has a heavy scent, but nothing that lingers around too long. It irritates my sensitive skin. Interesting gel
