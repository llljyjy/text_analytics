I’ve tried sooooo many toners and exfoliating acid products, at this point I’m a tough critic. After reviewing the ingredients on the new Rose Inc toner and seeing a reasonable price point, I went ahead and gave it a shot. Lucky I did because this is now hands down in my top 3 (exfoliating toners):  Rose Inc Exfoliating, Youth to the People Mandelic Acid, and Farmacy Deep Sweep. Each serves a purpose depending on what my skin needs for the day/night. Rose Inc is the most intense of these, if my skin is feeling sensitive I definitely have to skip. But when I need a good exfoliation, Rose Inc is my number one go to toner to use. Deep Sweep and YTTP Mandelic are much gentler and don’t pack as much of a punch. Love that Rose Inc has such a great mixture of beneficial acids, plus Niacinamide and Kaolin Clay, and no essential oils or fragrance. Such a beautiful formula. I also have the new Tatcha Tonic, it does not have anything on the Rose Inc toner. And for $59 I would definitely not repurchase the Tatcha Tonic. I will 100% repurchase the Rose Inc Exfoliating Acid Toner. Love the packaging and overall aesthetic too! Amazing Effective Exfoliating Toner
