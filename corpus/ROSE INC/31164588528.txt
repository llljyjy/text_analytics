I can’t speak for the brightening effects of this eye serum quite yet because I’ve only been using it for a few days and have very dark circles, but I can say that I love how moisturizing it is. It had a thicker consistency which feels so soothing and moisturizing on my dry skin. In addition to hydrating my under eye area, I feel like it smooths it out - which is great before makeup application. Love how thick and hydrating this is
