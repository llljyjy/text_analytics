This eye cream is very unique in my eye cream collection. I’ve tried so many different formulas but this is the first time trying something that actually brightens while hydrating my under-eye. the cream itself has a pearlescent quality which helps to add that extra brightening effect. A little goes a long way, you only need about a half a pump for both eyes. It’s perfect for me to use at night before bed or as a priming element before makeup application.  I love it so much! My under eyes are SO hydrated
