I received this moisturizer complimentary from Rose Inc and I love it so much! I’ve tried countless moisturizers and honestly have too many currently, but this one really stands out! It’s probably my favorite texture of any moisturizers I’ve ever tried. It’s ’jelly’ like and cooling and has these little jelly bead type of things that feel amazing on the skin! I also have pretty sensitive and reactive skin and this hasn’t caused any irritation or redness at all. Coolest texture!
