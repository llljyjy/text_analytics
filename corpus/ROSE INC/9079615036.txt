I received this Hydration Replenish Moisturizer complimentary from Rose Inc to try and review. This is a beautiful gel texture moisturizer that is perfect for my oily to combination skin. Like many oily girls I have difficulty getting most regular moisturizers to absorb into my skin, this gel smoothes right into my skin.  This wears really well under makeup and feels incredibly lightweight yet nourishing. I have no issues with the light natural scent bothering my sensitive skin.  Iâ€™d highly recommend!
