I tried numerous moisturizers to find a good am/pm moisturizer and this was my favorite. I find it makes my skin feel bouncy, and moist, not sticky but certainly some residual moisture which I prefer. I  have dry skin and acne prone around my chin. This feels like it moisturizes my skin and doesn’t disappear after an hour. I also like that it doesn’t pill (a problem i had with the Shiseido moisturizer i tried).  I also really like the texture of this--similar to a product I am lusting for currently and love- Dior Prestige Micro Huile Rose Serum. Effective moisturizer for dry skin with no pilling
