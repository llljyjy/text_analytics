This is such a unique moisturizer! It’s almost like caviar with the micro encapsulated bubbles and feels so interesting when you first use it. It’s got a lightweight, gel consistency and comes with a lovely metal spoon to distribute product. It does have a faint scent and leaves my skin hydrated. Very unique product overall! nan
