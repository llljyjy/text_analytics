This moisturizer is soo refreshing and hydrating, it feels like a cross between a serum and a moisturizer because it glides right on.  It absorbs easily and leaves me with a dewey complexion. It is very lightly scented with rose and smells and feels so luxurious.  I received this moisturizer complimentary from Rose Inc. in exchange for my honest review. Gentle and hydrating
