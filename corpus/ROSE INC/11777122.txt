Really enjoying this brand.  Does what it claims and this eye cream is fantastic.  Feels great on the skin, absorbs beautifully and leaves under eye area bright and hydrated.  Plays well with other products and wears nicely under makeup.  It is pricey but you donâ€™t have to use a lot so it will last a while.  Highly recommend! nan
