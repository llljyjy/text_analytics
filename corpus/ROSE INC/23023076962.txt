Having oily skin I have a huge list of demands for a moisturizer and this one looks to be very close to the ideal one! The texture of this moisturizer is something - it’s not just lightweight, it’s weightless! My skin absorbs it immediately without any residue and feels perfectly hydrated and soothed afterwards. I’ve been using this wonderful formula for two weeks already and love how plump and luminous my skin looks. Can’t wait to se the result of prolong use! The texture is to die for!
