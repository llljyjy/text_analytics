Well let me start with the last eye cream I was using it was brightening (with vitamin c) and it burn my under eye, this one is a winner for me, it feels super creamy but lightweight at the same time, I can definitely see the puffiness go away when I put the cream on, and I really like the consistency and the packaging!! Creamy and lightweight perfect combo!
