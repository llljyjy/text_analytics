So disappointed! I love Rosie HW and the reviews made me think this product was a holy grail. It does nothing for my skin. I think it even made it drier and sticky. It feels like it’s from the Pixi brand at target. Way overpriced and completely underwhelming. Doesn’t do anything - much less anything groundbreaking. It’s so bad I wouldn’t even give it someone else to use. Target Quality
