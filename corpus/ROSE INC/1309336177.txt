This is a gel consistency moisturizer that contains microbeads that melts into your skin.  It has an inviting rosey scent to it that is not too overwhelming.  I have combination skin and would only use this as part of my nighttime routine since I am prone to an oily t-zone.  Once applied, it creates a hydration barrier that locks in the moisture.  In the AM, I can feel that my skin looks luminous and moisturized.  My skin feels soothed and has a calming effect. Super hydrating
