One of the best gel moisturizers I’ve found!!!! I’m incredibly picky about gel formulas. Most of them leave a sticky film or pill up throughout the day. The beads in the gel melt in easily and everything sinks into the skin beautifully. This leaves my skin super hydrated, soft, and glowy. So happy I was able to try this! I’ll definitely be purchasing again. Super Hydrating & Softening!
