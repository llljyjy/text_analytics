I received a free sample size from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I really liked this, it was super moisturizing but not heavy, it absorbed very nicely on my dry skin. It also felt incredibly soothing. A little bit goes a long way, I had a tiny sample jar that Lasted a week! It is scented like most makeup counter brands, especially Estee Lauder, but you get used to it and I didnâ€™t have any bad reactions whatsoever Soothing!
