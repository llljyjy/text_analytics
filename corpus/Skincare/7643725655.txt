I have been struggling with dry flaky skin on my chin all winter and the first time after using this mask before bedtime I saw a tremendous change. I have been using this as a “spot” treatment on all my dry spots during the day and then as a “mask” at night. You need the smallest amount, and it’s totally worth every penny. nan
