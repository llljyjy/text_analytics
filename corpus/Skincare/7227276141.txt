I definitely like this product a lot. I wouldn’t say it’s my favorite serum of all time tho. I love the glowy golden undertones it has and I like the consistency. Possibly for my skin type its just not over the top iconic. I do really like it tho, its a good everyday serum don’t be scared by the retinol. It felt very mild on me but I am super thick skinned. Good every day serum
