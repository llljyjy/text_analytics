This is such a unique cleanser. The whole experience was so lovely, when applied its creamy and hydrating. There’s a slight tingling feeling to it but nothing that was bothersome or triggered my sensitive skin. When washing it off, it’s easy and leaves my skin feeling moisturized but clean. Would recommend  for people with dry skin! Great for dry skin!
