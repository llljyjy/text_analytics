I really like this product! It’s moisturizing without being greasy or heavy, smells good and hasn’t caused any irritation on my very sensitive skin. It’s actually helped me get rid of some irritation caused by a previous moisturizer. I received it complimentary in exchange for my honest review, and I would honestly use it again! I do very much dislike the Day cream version w/ SPF, it’s an entirely different product. works well!
