I like it received a sample size a little does go a long way I’m 55 and have very dry skin. What is really nice is there is for me a glow to my skin without there being a metallic side effect it does not show up my texture or my fine line. It smooths my skin out. I like the smell didn’t really notice a smell. I will purchase a full size of this it’s cheaper than Tacha dewy cream and that is what I was using before. I also like the Vita. C in it there is a slight tingle when I first put it on but goes away quickly. Will purchase full size
