This was given to me as a sample to try and I love it. I have been using it for 2 weeks now. It is the most luxurious eye creams ever. I have tried plenty and their oily or just doesn’t sit well on my eyes. This one takes the cake and it doesn’t burn or irritate my eyes. I gave this 4 stars because of the price It is pricey but overall I love it. It did help with the puffiness under my eyes and has helped with my darkness. Star of all eyecreams
