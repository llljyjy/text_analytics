I received this complimentary from Influenster and Clinique in exchange for my honest review. I’ve only been using this for a couple of weeks however I have noticed a slice difference in how plump the skin under my eyes is starting to become. I don’t have wrinkles so I can’t give a review based on how well this product works on wrinkle repair. But this is product is moisturizing. Very moisturizing
