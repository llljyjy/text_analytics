So far, so really good.  This was gifted to me by SOS (I started buying the SOS spray since it first came out because of the effects of wearing a mask everyday.).  The spray is very good, but I really love this serum.  I have extremely difficult skin, it’s dry, it’s aging, it breaks out if you look at it the wrong way. Redness has now become an issue.  This serum does not upset my skin at all.  I wake up with soft, calm skin.  This serum is saving my face. SOS Intensive Redness Relief Serum
