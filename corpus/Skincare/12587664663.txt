I’m a huge fan of origins and I really like this mask, however, it did not work for me as my skin reacted a little bit. BUT, I tried it on my boyfriend and OMG his skin was sooooo smoth and nourished afterwards that he loved it and asked me to order him one! It does what it promises and keep in mind that it didn’t work for me, personally, but IT CAN FOR YOU, because it did for my bf. Would I recommend to a friend? Of course.P.s: the smell is something i’d change because honey has a strong smell! It is great!!!!
