This product has sulfates. I thought since it had the clean at Sephora label it was verified sulfate free. I have a sulfate sensitivity, went to re-read the ingredients after my skin started itching. Sulfates are in the ingredient list. Should not be labeled clean at Sephora. NOT clean at Sephora, has sulfates.
