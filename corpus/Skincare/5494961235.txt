The product absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. It does have a watery texture, but all u have to do is pour a little in your hand and apply it to your face. The fact that it has a high SPF, is clean w/other great ingredients in it as well, is great! I like the design of the packaging, bc it doesn’t take up a lot of space. I also have NOT had any issues with the purple on the container coming off. I rely heavily on reviews and since there were so many negative reviews, this is why I chose to write one on this product. The reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is bc of the price. It’s so expensive. I highly recommend this product and I will be repurchasing it again. Great Product
