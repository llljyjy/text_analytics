Got this product free of charge in exchange for my opinion. I’ve been using it for about a month, maybe four times a week. It goes on nicely, isn’t sticky or drying in anyway, and dries down quickly. It also has a smell that I hate, although I’m seeing most people are saying that it’s unscented so I’m not really sure what I’m finding that offensive. It doesn’t take long for it to dry on my face, and the smell doesn’t linger, and honestly even if it did I would still use this product. I didn’t look particularly old or haggard prior to using it, but since I started hi I’m glowing in a way that I didn’t know it was possible outside of pregnancy. I posted pictures on my Facebook and two people who hadn’t seen me in over a year commented how my skin was glowing. Realistically, this is a product I didn’t know I needed, and I’m glad I found it. It seems to last a very long time, so the price point is definitely worth it, in my opinion. If anything changes, I will update but in the meantime, I’m one happy customer. A new staple
