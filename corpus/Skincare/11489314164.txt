As a middle aged man, I’ve grown to accept my crows feet that are beginning to form. I have NOT accepted dark circles under my eyes or my eyes looking tired! Since I started applying the Kiehl’s Super Multi-Corrective Eye Zone Treatment every morning, I look a lot more refreshed and energetic. I noticed it most in pictures, as the dark circles are gone and there are no bags to cast shadows. I highly recommend making this a part of your daily routine - it’s easy and the results are great!
