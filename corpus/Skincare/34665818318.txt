This product works!  When I apply it at the first sign of a blemish, it either keeps it really small or keeps it from fully developing all together.  I suffer from cystic acne and whiteheads and the Skinfix Acne Spot treatment really works wonders on diminishing or completely stopping my acne breakouts.  I’ve tried so many spot treatments and none of them worked like this does.  It’s very potent, so you don’t need to apply too much or it may dry and irritate.  It’s very effective stuff that highly recommend. It Truly Works
