I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. As I was using this serum, I was wondering who it’s intended for. The texture is much closer to a gel moisturizer than a serum, and it doesn’t feel hydrating at all on my skin. Since the benefit is supposed to be wrinkle reduction and anti-aging, I would think that hydrating and plumping would be a part of this product. The main treatment ingredients seem to be niacinamide and peptides (which I already have in other favorite products) and a variety of plant extracts. It has a very light herbal/citrus scent to it, and feels nice going on, but I’m completely missing the hydrating and refreshing qualities of my other serums, and have to slather my face in moisturizer. I have normal/oily skin, so maybe someone with oilier skin wouldn’t need these qualities. Overall I will finish it but wouldn’t repurchase, and will go back to using other products in its place. Not that special
