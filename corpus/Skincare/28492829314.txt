I received this product for free from Laneige and Topbox in exchange for my honest review. We all know by now that I absolutely love Laneige products, so I was beyond excited to know they launched a new Retinol Firming Cream Treatment. As I’ve been really into anti-aging products recently, this has been such a staple in my skincare routine. This cream is said to target the look of fine lines and wrinkles, firm and smooth out the skin while replenishing hydration at the same time. Now the product comes in a rather small tube, only 50 mL, but a little does go a long way, especially if you’re new to retinol products, in which you need to slowly build your way up. With consistent use of just two weeks only at night, I have noticed the lines around my eyes seem to be reduced quite significantly and aren’t as visible as before, instead the skin around the area is much more firm and tight. The cream isn’t greasy nor sticky at all and absorbs really quickly into the skin. There is also a very mild scent to the cream. I would definitely recommend this product especially if you’re looking into retinol or anti-aging products to try! New addition to skincare
