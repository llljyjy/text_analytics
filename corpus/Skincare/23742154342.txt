Charlotte Tilbury wows me again with another incredible product! Ever since I tried her flawless airbrush foundation I’ve been hooked.Not only does my skin look more vibrant, but it looks plump. I don’t have many wrinkles so I can’t confirm on the results there, however, I do have enlarged pores and this gem has toned them down significantly.I’ll update the review as I continue to use it but so far, I’m impressed and very pleased! Hello glow!
