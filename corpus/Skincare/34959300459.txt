I received this product from Sephora Collection in exchange for my honest review.  This cleanser is amazing.  Its super gentle and effective,  I like to use a cleansing balm to remove my makeup and then this afterwards to cleanse.  It leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean without drying it out.  The ingredients are so gentle and I love the subtle fresh scent. Affordable, gentle cleanser
