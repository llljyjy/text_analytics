Dior Cica Recover & Repair Multi-Use Balm is amazing!  Iâ€™ve been using this product as a face cream for 3 weeks and I love it. It feels so great on my skin, leaving it feeling super soft without a greasiness or heaviness.  I have noticed that the lines on my face appear softer and the overall texture and appearance of my skin is improved.   I have sensitive skin and this balm has not caused any stinging or redness or breakouts. The only thing that I would change would be to add some kind of sun protection so I could wear this as my only day moisturizer. Softest skin ever!
