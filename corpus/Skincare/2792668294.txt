I recieved the trial sample of this cream a while ago and just finished it (used it sparingly at night). I really enjoyed the consistency and feel of the cream. My skin felt hydrated and did not react to any of the ingredients (I have sensitive skin). I am in my 20s so I have not been able to notice any changes to fine lines, but overall I think this is a great product! Another great YTTP product!
