I was quite pleased to add this product to my daily skincare routine. Its very easy to use and one pump of product was enough for my whole face. The first week of using it ,i noticed it dried my skin out so I had to put extra moisturizer. After the first week my skin got used to it and it worked great. It leaves my skin looking shiny and clear. nan
