I really enjoyed the clay type mask in the sheet mask format. This would be a great item to travel with! I found that it covered my face well I don’t always have the best luck around my nose which concerned me with this as that’s my ‘poreblem’ area but this worked great! Didn’t feel super drying and I definitely felt like my skin was smoother looking after using. nan
