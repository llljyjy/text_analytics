This product is good but pretty basic. It’s def not worth the sticker price. It feels more like a lightweight lotion than a serum. I mixed mine with water and it combined nicely, absorbs faster, and feels more like a serum now. Not all products accept dilution but this one does! I haven’t noticed much benefit from the Vitamin C, mostly this just keeps my dry skin hydrated under my daily lotion. Basic lightweight lotion
