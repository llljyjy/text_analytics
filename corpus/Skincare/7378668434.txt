Truly a great product! I have dry, sensitive skin and this serum has helped brighten and even out my complexion. I have tried various vitamin c serum brands and I keep coming back to YTTP. I thought the fragrance was going to be overwhelming when I first got it but after using it- itâ€™s not strong or bad at all (I actually like the slight scent of ginger- very subtle). Plus a little goes a long way when using the product. fav vitamin C
