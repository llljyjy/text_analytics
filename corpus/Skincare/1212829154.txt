I have been enjoying using this product - it goes on easily & doesn’t make my face seem oily or greasy at all. It does smell a little bit like sunscreen, but it isn’t overpowering or terrible at all, it’s a decently nice smell for this kind of product. My favorite part, though, is that it is reef safe. That’s amazing! Reef Safe for the Win!
