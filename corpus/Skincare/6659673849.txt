I definitely enjoyed this moisturizer the most out of other products I have tried. I absolutely love that a little bit goes a long way. When applying, directions say to sweep upwards. I found that it did tighten my skin decently. I noticed a tingle in the cream, almost like a menthol feel and smell. The smell is over powering and takes some getting used to due to the strength but I was able to get used to and found myself enjoying the smell. I honestly cannot tell a difference in my skin the long run but could tell when applying and drying my skin would feel tighter at that moment. I would definitely recommend giving the product a try but if sensitive to scent beware that it is a strong smell and not something I can describe, not terrible, but not the best. Enjoyable moisturizer
