Gentle cleanser, only need a small amount for the whole face.  Cleanser is scented, a lot of people have complained about the scent, but it doesn’t bother me too much. If you are more sensitive to smells, I can see that you would be deterred by the scent, since it’s a bit on the strong side. The gel cleanser is easy to apply, and doesn’t dry out my skin, reason for a 4* is because I find it a bit pricey for what it is. nan
