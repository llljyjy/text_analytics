This product is amazing! I have normal skin. I typically exfoliate twice a week. I like the foamless texture of this product. It goes on smooth and does a great job exfoliating without feeling abrasive or rough. It has a nice, light and fresh scent. After just a week of using the product, my skin is noticeably smoother and softer. I highly recommend this exfoliator as part of your face cleansing and beauty regimen! Add this cleanser to your beauty regimen!
