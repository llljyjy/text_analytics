I’ve been using this product for a few days and I am not disappointed. I have typically oily skin, but since having my son, I’ve noticed excessive dryness when it comes to my face. The moisturizer is light yet heavy enough to leave me feeling smooth and conditioned. 4-stars because the smell is a little weird and oddly enough, I wish the fragrance was stronger. I like it…
