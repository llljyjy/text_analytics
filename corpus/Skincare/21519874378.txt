This is a nice cream but I believe it caused breakouts so I’d rather use it on my body than my face. It has a nice light herbal scent and the texture is medium thick and creamy. At $60, I’d definitely not purchase full price as there are better k-beauty brand products for less money. Thanks Influenster! Not for my face
