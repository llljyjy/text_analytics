[I received the Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream complimentary from Sulwahsoo in exchange for this review] This isn’t my first time using any of Sulwahsoo’s products, but this one is already one of my favorites. I find it has that usual Sulwahsoo scent, which I personally like, but it is a strong almost herbal luxury smell to me. The packaging of course is also herbal luxury and I have always liked the packaging of their items.As for the actual cream, I mainly used this on my forehead on my fine lines and in between my eyebrows. I find it did make my forehead appear smoother and less textured after just a few days. I can’t speak on the effectiveness on fine lines yet, but to be honest my fine lines aren’t very intense to begin with so it is hard to really know if there is any difference. The texture of the cream was really light and sunk into my skin really quickly which is nice if you have limited time to do your skincare. It didn’t feel heavy at all. I liked using this at night as one of my final steps and I really feel like it is a nice step in my routine that has brightened my skin. I’m a new mom and anything that helps my skin look a little brighter and more alive is a blessing to me. I personally can see myself keeping this as part of my skincare routine for a long time. Very moisturizing and helped my tired looking skin
