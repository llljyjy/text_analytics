Iâ€™m new to the cleansing balm game but when I got a chance to try this I was excited. I love how this balm can also be used as a mask and leaves my skin feeling silky smooth and hydrated. I was impressed at how well this balm took off my thick foundation and non-smudgeable lip stain. I love that it is vegan and has great ingredients for skin health. Overall, this multi-tasking product is a must have! You will love this stuff!
