I’m not entirely sold on this sheet mask. I wish the eye holes were larger, as some of the product got onto my eyelashes and stung my eyes. While my skin does feel smooth and looks radiant after using it, I did notice an abnormal amount of redness immediately following use, but this faded after 10-15 minutes. The biggest issue I have with it is that it left my combination skin feeling so dry, almost as if it stripped all the oil away. That’s not generally something I like in my skincare products, so I don’t think I’d purchase it but I would recommend it to people who struggle with oily skin. nan
