I am so sad. This clogged my otherwise clear skin horribly. Within less than a week my pores were so clogged and I had deep acne pop up. My skin has not looked like this in years and the only change was this cleansing balm instead of my normal one. Iâ€™ve discontinued use and am waiting for my skin to heal. nan
