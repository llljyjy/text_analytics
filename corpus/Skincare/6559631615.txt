This moisturizer has a rich consistency and leaves your skin feeling hydrated. I prefer lighter moisturizers in my morning skincare regiment, so I incorporated this into my evening routine. The immediate finish is dewy, but it dries eventually and leaves a silky texture. There is a lighter fragrance that i do not mind in the evening, but not if it were to be under makeup. Rich + Hydrating
