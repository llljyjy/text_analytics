i’m easily influenced when it comes to buying new products and this was super hyped on tik tok & i thought i would love it but i regret not buying the mini version to try it out because i don’t like it. the product kinda builds up and flakes on my skin and i have dry sensitive skin so i thought i would love this but it’s too much of a highlighter instead of a subtle glow it’s nice but doesn’t work for my skin.
