I received this product for free from Influenster and Clinique in exchange for my honest review. Typically I’m not big on buying eye creams because I don’t usually have any issues with puffiness or wrinkles around my eyes. But between work & life I’ve began to look tired around the eyes. So I was looking forward to seeing if this product might help. It comes in a cute purple container. The product didn’t have a smell. It was a cool non greasy cream. From the first use I could tell a bit of a difference. It’s like the lines & bags around my eyes became instantly moisturized & assorted to fade after just one use! I really enjoyed this product & will most likely use it again. It works!!!
