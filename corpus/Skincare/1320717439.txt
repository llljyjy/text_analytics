I received as a #freeproduct, CLINIQUE Smart Clinical Repair™ Wrinkle Correcting Cream, Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream, and Wrinkle Correcting Serum. I applied all 3 after getting out of the shower. I liked how the serum had a very light scent and absorbed quickly into my skin, leaving it dewy feeling. I can’t speak to its wrinkle correcting as I only used it once, but would consider adding it to my skincare regimen. nan
