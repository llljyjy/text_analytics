There’s no wonder why this product is out of stock. It is sooo moisturizing. During the winter my lips get dry really fast and now that it’s getting colder my lips are more prone to chapping. This lip mask is very hydrating and having it in my routine has been a great help. Very moisturizing totally recommend
