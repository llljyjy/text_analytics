I received a complimentary sample from Influenster. I have very dry skin and felt like this product was not enough to keep my skin hydrated. It has a gel texture which feels nice and cool when applied. It doesn’t leave any sticky feeling and at first my skin felt hydrated. It just didn’t last long. I would recommend this product for people with normal or mixed skin. Great texture
