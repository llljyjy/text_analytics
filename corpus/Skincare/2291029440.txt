I’m rating a 3 “average” for this product. I think it offered average results, nothing special or awful. I will say I prefer a semi matte to matte finish from my products so that they continue to perform throughout my workday as my natural oils build, so this product didn’t meet that expectation because it’s dewy and creates too much shine later in the day. I think ILIA C BEYOND TRIPLE SERUM SPF 40 worked best as a stand-alone product during hikes and no makeup days. I studied the application instructions heavily and didn’t have any issues with pilling, so if you are, make sure you’re  attentive to the application details. It worked well under cream foundation but my powder foundation applied well but didn’t last as long. I did like that my skin was protected and also moist with only one product. I didn’t need extra moisturizer or serum and it was as greasy or drying as other sunblock options. In my Photo, I applied this serum in Tone 1 on the side of my face with the Ilia bottle. The other side has no product. Dewy and protected with one product
