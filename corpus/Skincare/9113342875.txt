I personally love it. As someone with sensitive skin and acne scars, it has significantly reduced the redness in my face! It doesn’t sting my face like other comments have mentioned. However, I only use it in the mornings. Vitamin C can be harsh on the body in the first place. If you do really rub it in, it turns almost into an exfoliate which is not good to do everyday. I just lightly tap it in and it has worked for me. Also, can’t beat the price for it :) I love it
