When I say I have sensitive skin… we’re talking rosacea, a sensitivity to avocado oil (good luck finding a lip balm), literally any scent in the world… even products devised for the most sensitive skin are a huge gamble. I was in a bad way thanks to a failed experiment w a new product… I thought eff it let’s give it a whirl it’s already hot garbage in here. Whoa. Big risk and big reward. After ONE NIGHT my flare up completely calmed down completely. Bless.I won’t use this every night, most likely- it def feels a little tingly while it’s working it’s magic. But really impressed and definitely a convert!!! nan
