I love this product! I used it for the first time on a trip to Arizona and it prevented me from getting burned in the scalding sun. I didn’t use moisturizer either as this has hyaluronic acid, which locks in moisture. My skin is sensitive, but this product works great and doesn’t clog my pores. I use it regularly now! Great sunscreen
