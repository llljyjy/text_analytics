I have been going through an incredibly stressful time in my life and my skin has been paying the price. I’m so happy to have discovered this treatment because it’s helped bring my whole eye area back to life. It decreased eye puffiness significantly and really brightened my under eyes which have been plagued recently by dark circles due to lack of sleep. It sinks into the skin quickly and makeup layers well over it. I am a major fan of this lovely serum and definitely recommend it. nan
