Okay before I even get to the product, can we talk about the pump?! OMG I wish everything came with this twist up and down pump! It’s so travel friendly and I never have to worry about a spill or losing the cap. So genius! I also love the balm, my eye area is soo hydrated! But I’m only using it at night because the consistency is so thick that it takes too long to sink into my skin in the morning. New Nighttime Favorite
