First of all $48 for a 2 ounce product? In this economy! I should have known better. AND second of all this mask is extremely sensitive to temperature changes which is why I would advise to purchase only in person if at all. By the time I received this product it was a discolored gray green moldy leaky out of the box mess. Plenty of other BHA masks on the market Iâ€™d say skip this one. Returning ASAP. BUYER BEWARE
