I love this. I found it at TJMaxx a while back for like $12 bucks, and I thought “sure, let’s do it“. It’s great. It works as an under-eye primer (which I need), it brightens my eye area and makes my dark circles and bags less noticeable. When I use it, I put a drop of rose hip oil under my eyes first for a bit more moisture, then I take a small pump of the Bright-Eyed and mix it w/ the Milk Makeup Flex concealer and I tap it all around my under eye, my brow bone and my eye lid. No creases in my concealer, no flakey-ness, and best of all, I don’t get those white pimply looking things under my eyes like I do with some other eye creams I’ve tried. The cream lasts a long time, I bought my tube at TJMaxx sometime in April or May of 2021 and finally used the last of it in October of 2021 - so 5 to 6 months. When I could afford, I went to a sephora and bought a second bottle at full price and I have 0 regrets. I saw some folks had trouble with left over product collecting and hardening in the pump, yeah, it does do that, but that is a minor irritation for an overall great product. On my 2nd bottle
