Received this complimentary to try out and so far it’s ok. I am not a big fan of the scent, but I could get past that because if how moisturized it makes my skin feel! It absorbs fast and a little goes a long way. Most definitely won’t use it on my neck area as suggested though because it did cause me to break out under my chin. Otherwise, doesn’t cause breakouts anywhere else on my face! Nice
