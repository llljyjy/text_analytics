I have been very happy with this product.  It goes on smoothly, is not sticky or thick, and feels very fresh and clean on my skin.  I even started mixing a small amount with my liquid foundation, and it helps to keep the foundation from clumping, and makes it easy to apply and keeps the makeup looking fresh. Great addition to my routine!
