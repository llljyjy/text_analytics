This is wonderfuly packed, but the bottle was missing a lot of product. Quality wise, it feels great on skin. You get a pretty refreshing yet fully hidrating feel. It absorbes pretty fast so you do not have to wait for it to dry or absorbe.Even though i was desapointed with the anmount of product that i received, you can say that you can apply just a little bit if the cream to cover all of your face. Bottle was too empty
