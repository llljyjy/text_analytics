I think I have a new go-to facial sunscreen and I was gifted by Josie Maran! I originally was kind of skeptical because when I first used the sun milk, there was some weird product build up that would start to gather once it settled? But just the other day, I realized you have you have a freshly prepped face for this - the products donâ€™t build up the way it originally did. My favorite part about it is how truly milky and lightweight the product is! A little goes a long way! My face stayed sooooo hydrated for the ENTIRE day. I was dewy but not sweaty looking and my face FELT healthy. SPF is very important for me, and this sun milk definitely lines up with me! My skin drank this up!
