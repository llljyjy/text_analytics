My skin responds really well to glycolic acid but most formulations don’t have enough of it.  This is great, it is very effective.  Older skin like mine needs glycolic acid to keep it healthy looking, as it doesn’t regenerate as quickly as it used to :).  I use this about 4 times a week and I can notice the exfoliation, especially if I stop using it.  I am about to purchase my second jar when I noticed there weren’t any reviews from us mature users and decided to contribute.  If your skin responds well to glycolic acid, this one  is a keeper.  Very fresh  mild scent that dissipates in about 5 minutes. Great for mature skin
