I received this product as part of a free sample program and I literally LOVE this toner. I have combination skin type so I was worried it might make my skin a little oily but I was definitely wrong. This toner is light but effective and left my skin not only feeling refreshed and clean but SUPER soft As well. Prior to receiving this sample I used o’lay toner with witch hazel which don’t get me wrong is a good toner however you have to use so much of it at a time but this toner is the complete opposite, a little bit goes a long way. A new Must have in my routine
