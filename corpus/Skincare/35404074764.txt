I received this Smart Clinical repair “wrinkle Correcting Serum“ #freeproduct from #topbox in exchange for my honest review . The serum was easy to apply and made my skin feel smooth and hydrated. My skin didn’t feel sticky or oily, it absorbed real quick. After application  my face was looking brighter and overall refreshed. I think if I was able to use it longer, I could see a excellent  improvement with my fine lines. I would recommend it if you can afford it. Excellent
