purchased based on good reviews. used this for 2 weeks... kept smelling cat pee after and finally realized it was from this. some ingredient in this triggers that smell.. so peculiar. very unpleasant. also started breaking out and that hasn’t happened in years. soon as I stopped using it , didn’t smell cat pee anymore. this is a no go for my sinuses and sensitive skin. unpleasant experience
