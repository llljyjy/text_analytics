I recently received a free trial of ILIA C BEYOND TRIPLE SERUM SPF I followed the instructions and it works great it is very light weight and blends smoothly into my face and matches my skin tone perfectly, I have noticed  my skin improving even my pores look smaller it , the only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars it’s because of the strong smell due to the ingredients , but there are other products like this and if you are already used to this it won’t bother you, it is definitely a good product . nan
