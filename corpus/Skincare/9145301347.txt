I received this product complimentary and have been really enjoying it in my morning routine! it’s a thicker consistency so it’s great for the winter months when my skin is extra dry. I love that is has added spf as I never leave home without it. it works well with my other products and makeup.  the only thing I will say is that is definitely has alcohol in it so if you find you’re sensitive to that, I’d avoid this one. my skin doesn’t mind! great day cream for dry skin!
