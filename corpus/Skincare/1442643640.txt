I feel like a black sheep writing a bad review with all these 5 star ones hahaha but I did not like this moisturizer for my skin. It does feel velvety at first after u put it on. But my skin got really dry and not smooth feelingafter like a half hr. I have really dry skin and I tan on top of it so my skin requires a seriously rich cream I think. This did not hydrate me anywhere near what I need. So I’m going to say if you have dry dry skin with some extra dryness in there this won’t be for you. Also I didn’t think it brightened my skin at all. Used for a week. Pretty disappointing with all these great reviews- I’m also 37 and not 23 so…. NOT FOR ME ANYWAY
