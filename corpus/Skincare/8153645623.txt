I’m obsessed with this spray. I’ve tried quite a few facial mist, and this will be my go to from now on. It feels so cooling on the skin. And it smells wonderful. I love the packaging—the spray is the perfect mist. It smells really good. I usually use it after cleansing my face and before starting my skin care routine. I then use it again before using the hyaluronic acid plum plumping serum. I also like to use it before putting on make up. It gives the face a nice Dewy glow. I’m on my second bottle, and will continue to purchase a third, fourth, fifth, and so on. This will be a new staple in my skin care routine One of my Fave Facial Mist
