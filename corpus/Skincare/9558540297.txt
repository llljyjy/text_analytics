I really enjoy this product and have incorporated into my daily skincare routine. It’s the perfect toner and I’m not entirely sure how it does it, but it seriously helps any time I have any acne flare-ups. The only reason I’m deducting a star is because when it came the bottle was not full (see picture). I have been using it for a while and will continue to use it, but I hope in the future the bottle will at least arrive full for the price. great toner replacement!!
