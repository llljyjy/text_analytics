The serum leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized. It does not have an oily feel as I have experienced with other moisturizers. I only wish it was not a scented product as I prefer my skincare not to have fragrance. Apply with your hands to avoid transferring bacteria with the applicator. Great feel, strong smell
