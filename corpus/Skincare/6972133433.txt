I received this product free in exchange for my honest review. I tried this for the first time today, and it has a very unpleasant scent, kind of like traditional sunscreen but with something more pungent added. itâ€™s a very thick formula so it felt like it sat on top of my skin. I think it would be great if you plan to be in a high-sun environment, but not good for every day wear. Very thick formula
