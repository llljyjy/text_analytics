I received the Belif Aqua Bomb Brightening Vitamin C Cream and just in time for these hot Summer days! (I received it for free #complimentary from @Influenster and @Belifusa #HeadToToeAqua in exchange for my honest review). I have used the original Aqua Bomb True Cream in the past and really enjoyed it. This Vitamin C cream seems to be a replica of the original plus added bonuses. This Cream contains Vitamin C, E and 4 types of Hyaluronic Acids. I love the gel like texture and I love the citrus scent. Skin feels hydrated hours later without any greasy feeling (I have oily/combo skin).  My original moisturizer is almost out so I am considering buying the full size Belif vitamin C cream. Going to buy the full size
