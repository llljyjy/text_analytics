CLINIQUESmart Clinical Repair™ Wrinkle Correcting Cream Is a great product! It really has decreased the looks of my forehead wrinkles and fine lines around my eyes. It smells good and is really thick. I like that it’s thick because it seems to last longer. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. Yes Baby!
