I recieved this product as a sample serum from #trywithtopbox in exchange for an honest review. Unfortunately, the sample itself was tiny (barely enough for a couple of uses) so I can’t speak to it’s effectiveness. However, as with all Clinique products, it’s light and super fast absorbing. I have fairly sensitive skin and it was very calming and didn’t bother me whatsoever. I wish I was able to try it for a little longer to give a better review, but I will be purchasing this, as the couple of days I did use it, I really liked it a lot. #freeproduct Fast absorbing, nice and moisturizing
