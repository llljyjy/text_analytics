I’ve been using this product at night after cleansing. I received this from Influenster and Biossance in exchange for my honest review. I’ve seen a lot of issues with the smell but I didn’t think it smelled horrible and it fades once applied. I have normal skin with acne scars as well as fine lines and wrinkles. My face felt soft and moisturized after using and it seems to be helping with my texture. I’d definitely purchase again if the results remain good. Great for aging skin
