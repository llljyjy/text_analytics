So I would love to say that I am an inexperienced retinol user. Before this product, I had never tried any product with retinol in it at all. I just turned 24 so I don’t have any really bad signs of aging yet. However I have some lines forming and some hyperpigmentation on my face. I will say 0.5% on my sensitive skin that’s never had retinol, I had some peeling. And that’s when I knew I needed to not use it as often until my skin gets used to the strength of the retinol. But I am loving the results so far, my skin is brighter definitely more GLOEI. And I love what it has already done in two short weeks on the lines under my eyes and on my forehead. I love the dropper packaging and the amount for 1 year is plenty as you only need 2-3 drops for a full face. I loved this product and can’t wait to try many more drunk elephant products in the future. I'm so Glowy
