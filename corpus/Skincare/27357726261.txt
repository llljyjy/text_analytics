I thought I would really enjoy this product, basically having a 2 in 1, but I did not like it. I wanted to save time in the morning by having vitamin C serum and a first layer of some SPF, but the overall product was not a keeper. I can never tell how much product I have left in the bottle. Plus it never felt even full. The smell is medicinal, and texture is tacky. When it “absorbed” into my skin it left it very shiny and tacky. I felt like I had to pump 5 squirts just to cover my face. Maybe it’ll work for others, but was not impressed. not a keeper
