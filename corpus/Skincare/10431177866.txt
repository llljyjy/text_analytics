As you can see, it works! My eyes look even better now, after consistent use (comparison pic was taken just a few days later). It is the only dark circles treatment that has genuinely worked for me! I have sensitive eyes and wear contacts, so I just have to be careful to not get any of the serum in my eyes. It is a fantastic product! Works on my skin like a charm!
