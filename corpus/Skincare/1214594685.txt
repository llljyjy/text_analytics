Everything this claimed to do was the answer to all my prayers. I have oily skin with clogged pores and This made them so much worse. It turned my little bumps to huge cystic pimples. Even my husband took notice and had to ask if I was ok. I stopped using it for a few days and my skin calmed down a bit. Correcting what this did with dr Dennis goss peeling wipes. Def be careful worst thing I put on my skin.
