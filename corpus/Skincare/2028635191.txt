This thing is amazing to say the least. I actually have the FOREO mini 3 as well which I think is PMD Clean’s biggest competition so I’ll list the pros vs cons. Pros: has a handle, multiple vibration strengths, a real rose quartz side that warms to apply serums, silicon so it’s easy to keep clean, rechargeable. Cons: you can’t connect it to your phone via Bluetooth like the Foreo but honestly that’s not a huge deal to me as that’s less convenient anyway. If I find myself in the middle of cleansing & want to change the strength/time I’m not gonna stop to grab my phone. So my final thoughts.. this cleansing device removed every single blackhead I had on my nose after a couple uses. I’m still blown away by it. I can’t recommend this enough!! Removed every blackhead!
