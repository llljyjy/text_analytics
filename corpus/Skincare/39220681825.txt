I’m impressed. I don’t say that often. I was skeptical at first, but did some research on the brand and figured I’d try it out. I will never use another moisturizer. EVER! As the name suggests, this is a light cream, and that’s how it feels. Don’t expect some heavy night time cream. I’ve been wearing it under my make up in the morning and I’ve been very pleased.It is expensive but it drastically changed my skin within a few days of use. I mean, this cream is remarkable. What’s impressive is that the instant effect actually improves the more you use it. I’m more impressed now than the first time I tried it. I’m in my late 30s and my skin is prone the hormonal changes — let’s say I have good skin and bad skin days. This cream is a sort of stabilizer. This is a very, very good product. HIGHLY recommended Miracle cream
