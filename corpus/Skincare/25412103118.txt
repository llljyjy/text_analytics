Honestly really wished I wouldn’t like this due to the price tag lol. This does wonders for my skin and I can even see the difference overnight. The smell might be strong for some (they aren’t kidding when they say honey) but it is so so hydrating. The packaging is super cute and sturdy so I will def be reusing it along with the magnetic scoop as well! super hydrating!
