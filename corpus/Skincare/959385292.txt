I’ve wanted to try out Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream for a while now, so I was very excited to try it for free for my honest opinion, and it definitely exceeded my expectations! It was extremely moisturizing, while not leaving my oily skin feeling greasy. I felt like my face and neck were hydrated and bouncy for the whole day, and didn’t get too shiny. The scent was also pleasant. I will be adding this to my daily skincare regimen, it’s totally worth the price. Ultra Moisturizing!
