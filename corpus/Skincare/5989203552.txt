I love this oil! I have normal skin and I use it as a primer and hydrating oil before my moisturizer. I have received compliments on my skin and makeup, and itâ€™s truly based on this oil. I use ILIA products along with my Toska Spa products (spa in Charlotte, NC). Worth the purchase. One of my favorite skin & makeup products
