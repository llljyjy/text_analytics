The Good: I got this significantly discounted to the point of it costing a few bucks. I want to say that’s “good“ but that’s still expensive for one sheet mask... especially when it doesn’t work well. I truly have very little good things to say about this mask but before I jump into the bad part of this review (the meat and potatoes) I want to point out by saying I have gotten numerous different Sephora Collection masks and 80-90% of them I actually really end up enjoying which I think gives me a good comparison of the quality/expectations of this brand when it comes to their sheet masks.The Bad: I have oily skin especially in the summer and can sometimes still spring up some random breakouts even in my mid 20’s so when I saw this charcoal mask I was extremely excited. Charcoal usually works good on my face and I’ve had success with some acne-aimed sheet masks from SC. The overall fit of this felt just off laying on my face and it was significantly drier than what I expect from my usual SC masks which are usually very saturated with serums. I also didn’t feel any pore tightening and minimizing effect from this mask, I truly did not see any results both long or short term. Lastly, this mask somehow left my skin feeling dry which is a really strange experience and result from a sheet mask which is usually hydrating regardless of if it’s aimed at targeting acne or pore minimization. The Ugly/Honest: Even at it’s hugely discounted price, this mask is still not worth it in my opinion. There are better, cheaper and more effective masks out there even within the SC collection. This mask is a total miss in comparison to their usual quality, I was highly disappointed. This One Is A Hard Pass...
