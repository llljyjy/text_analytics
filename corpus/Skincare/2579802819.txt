Nice Moisturizer, esp for the dry arid weather we live in right now. Its a heavier feeling cream but goes on very smooth, which was really nice.  Some heavy creams gets sticky or tacky and hard to cover evenly. The sample I received was small, so I didnâ€™t notice any major visible changes. However my skin did stay hydrated through the day. nan
