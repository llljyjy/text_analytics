My first review on Sephora because I have to tell everyone how much I LOVE this product. I have acne prone skin and have been battling acne since junior high. I recently got to a place where my skin looked good, but I accepted the fact that I will always have at least 1-2 pimples at all times. That is until I discovered this product!! I use it twice daily after washing and before any treatment serums. And WOW. Iâ€™ve been using it consistently for 2 months and have had at most 1 zit that went away in 24 hours. Youth to the People is incredible. no more pimples!
