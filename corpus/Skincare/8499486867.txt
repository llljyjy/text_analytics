I have thoroughly enjoyed using Dr Zenovia pepide and ceramide repairing moisturizer. I noticed results within 3-5 days of use. My skin felt so plump and soft, but without the additional greasy feeling I tend to get with moisturizers. This also helped with my hormonal acne which I thought was a lost cause at 34! nan
