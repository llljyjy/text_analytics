Usually I’m not a fan of overnight face masks but this exceeded all of my expectations! It went in smoothly in my face and my skin really absorbed and gripped in to it. In the morning my skin felt smoother, hydrated, and more vibrant. Can’t wait to continue using this! This was gifted to me but I genuinely enjoyed it! Best Overnight Face Mask!
