Last week while on vacation, I was the recipient of a glorious top of the line, high-end Spa HydraFacial. It was a glorious experience - such a treat and my skin felt clean, hydrated, healthy and looked magnificent. My GloFacial tool arrived shortly after I returned home. I immediately tried it and was amazed... the instructions were very easy to follow, it was quite easy to maneuver the tool across my face, even around the creases of my nose. The “beeps“ made it easy to know I was using it correctly. The hydration injection was AMAZING! My skin felt similar to how it felt minutes after the $300 facial: clean, pores looked smaller, hydrated, tighter and my face was glowing. Most amazing thing was that there was actually “gunk“ in the waste chamber (just 5 days after having a spa HydraFacial). I plan on using my Glofacial 2 to 3 times a week, without fail. This tool is a must buy! A game changer. Comparable to $300 Spa HydraFacial
