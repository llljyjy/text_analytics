I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this cleanser. I have been using the mini bottle for over a month now and still have a pretty decent amount left. You don’t need to use a lot of this baby to get your skin feeling supple and clean. This cleanser literally lathers so much with an amount the size of a small pea. I put it on a silicone face scrubby and massage my face and neck in circles -- In the shower, it’s great to do behind your ears and such as well. This cleanser leaves you feeling super fresh and clean without stripping your skin away until it’s so dry that you start getting more acne. My skin was breaking out like crazy from masks at my work..... lol. This has completely saved my skin! You are able to use it both morning and night with no issues as long as you are keen on moisturizing afterward :) Sudsy Bubbles :D
