Since the pandemic, I’ve worn less makeup lately. However, I decided to focus on my skincare a lot more in an effort to prevent premature aging. I’m 38 now, my photo is current.I absolutely adore the dew drops. The scent of watermelon is very faint. I appreciate that bc I don’t like a lot of different scents combining. I’d rather have scent-free skincare and haircare products but this is worth the extremely light scent.After my facial cleansing oil, micellar water, Tacha Essence, Kiel’s Anti-wrinkle Eye Cream, I apply 2 drops to my face and I stay dewy-faced all day.When I wear makeup, I add a drop to my Smashbox Makeup Primer. I don’t experience makeup peeling like I do with other products, so I’ll continue using this for as long as they make it. Dewy All Day
