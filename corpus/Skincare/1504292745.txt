A beautiful product, pumps out the perfect pea size amount to use for all over face. Fun yellow color and it has no scent. By all means, loved this product at first application! Smooth and soothing to apply. Unknown retinol/retinal % and that is frustrating as that is something that needs to be titrated not kept secret.  However, it did unfortunately break me out on night 2 of usage. And that was a bummer. I have sensitive acne prone skin and I knew that was a risk I was willing to take to try this. Made me noticeably breakout in places that I don’t usually and that is how I gauge it. I do recommend you try it out though to see if it works for you though! Everyone is different. I wish it did work for me, but I’ll have to stick with my non fancy prescription tretinoin that doesn’t break me out. The hunt continues! nan
