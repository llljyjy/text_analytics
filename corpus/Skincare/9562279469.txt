TULA resurfacing toner is really more like a serum than a toner. It has a thick consistency that glides on nicely but is very different from a traditional toner. It may be because of this thickness that I had trouble getting the product out of the bottle, which has a pump you have to press down on, hard, many times, for anything to come out. (Maybe I just had a defective bottle.) The product itself feels luxurious but I honestly can’t tell if it’s making any sort of difference on or in my skin. You may have more noticeable results!
