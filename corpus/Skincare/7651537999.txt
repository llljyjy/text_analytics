I picked up this mask on a whim. I’ve been using it every night since I purchased. This feels like the missing link in my skincare routine. This leaves my skin glowing and more even. My redness is reduced and my pores are looking more refined. I caught myself in the car review and was shocked how good my skin looked. This is the only thing I’ve added to my routine. nan
