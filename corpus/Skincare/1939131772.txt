I used this product as a replacement for my regular moisturizer, I felt it left my face nice and moisturized, definitely not greasy as some moisturizers do.  I might consider purchasing this product as a replacement for my regular moisturizer but would definitely recommend to others who have dry skin. Good Barrier Cream
