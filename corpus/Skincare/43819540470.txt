The Clarins Double Serum is fantastic. I absolutely love the hydration it brings to my skin. I recieved a 7 day free trial from #butterly. I started by using a gentle cleanser to clean my skin and then applied the Clarins Double Serum in gentle upwards motions on my face. This serum feels so great and a little goes a long way. The amount in the sample packets was enough to put on my face, neck and top of my chest. Since using the serum I have had no dry or irritated areas on my face. Which I normally have this time of year as the air is dryer. I also have not had any pimples pop up since starting this and my skin seems brighter and more even. Iâ€™m loving the Clarins Double Serum and I will definitely be purchasing more! Thank-you #butterly Amazingly hydrating Serum!
