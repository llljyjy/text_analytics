I have never written a review on Sephora, but felt compelled to since this product helped me out! I had the worst eczema flare I’ve ever had on my under eyes and eyelids (inflamed, itchy, and dry). I got a sample of this and it helped so much I bought it the next day. It’s been a few days and after consistent use, my eyes are visibly improving, no longer itchy, and I can comfortably wear makeup again. I expect my flare will be gone in a few more days. I noticed this balm has 5% colloidal oatmeal versus most products I’ve seen only have 1% which really helps to lock in moisture. This is a holy grail product for me and is now a staple in my skin care routine. nan
