I’ve been wanting to give Algenist products a try and what better way to test the waters than with this lovely 10 day set. As I’m in my mid thirties, a boost of collagen is needed on my skincare routine. The liquid collagen felt great on the skin as well as the hydrating Genius cream. Did I mention that this set includes a full size eye cream?! This is a wonderful set that I highly recommend. Wonderful kit
