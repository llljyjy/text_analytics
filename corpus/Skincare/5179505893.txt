I wanted to love this product. Ever since getting the Coola spf 18 mister, I’ve loved the idea of a spray spf you could apply over makeup, but wanted something with more spf than the Coola version provided. I bought this from seeing it on Instagram, but it is SO incredibly greasy (and thats coming from someone with already very dry skin) and also started to burn my eyes after an hour or so when the product was clearly starting to get in to my eyes. Couldn’t wait to wash my face. Had high hopes, but this wasn’t it. Sadly, don’t recommend
