IT has been one of my go-to skincare brands. Confidence in a Cream is an anti-aging moisturizing cream filled with a bunch of very beneficial ingredients that improve your overall skincare health. I’ve used their old formula before and although it was okay, there were other brands I liked better and so stuck to those. However, I’m glad I’ve had the opportunity to revisit and retry this new improved formula with an upgraded ingredient list that takes out many of the irritants that were previously in the old formula. Among its key beneficial ingredients are Niacinamide, Squalene, Hyaluronic Acid, ceramides, and a peptide-lipid complex, all ingredients that help reduce or prevent early signs of aging. The texture of the cream is a bit on the thicker side but it does absorb quite readily onto parched skin. I highly recommend applying a toner first or on slightly damp skin for easier application. The cream has a light but not unpleasant scent and does very moisturizing damaged skin. I live in a warmer climate area and this cream is too thick sometimes especially during the afternoons, so I like switching to this cream during the evening and prefer using it as a night-time moisturizer during the summer days. Over all, I am quite satisfied with this product and highly recommend it, especially to those who have severely dry skin. I also have naturally sensitive skin that breaks out if I happen to use the wrong skincare product so I’m happy to say IT’s Confidence in a Cream has not caused any adverse reactions. My skin feels plumper, looks less dull, and feels more hydrated and smooth after starting on this daily regimen. Great moisturizer for aging and depleted skin!
