I can’t speak to how this product performs for people who have supremely dry skin. But if you have moderately dry skin, this is an excellent product that should receive WAY more mainstream love and attention. I don’t believe there is any product on the market comparable to it. It’s even rated 5 stars on Beautypedia- no easy feat. Baba Bomb has it all- nourishing ingredients, fragrance-free, and it is BEYOND hydrating and moisturizing- super emollient!  I have not used any other facial moisturizer in years and will continue to purchase Baba Bomb.  I think its rare find to find a skin care product that I’d actually formulated well and I really appreciate this one! Simply The Best
