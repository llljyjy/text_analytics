If your looking for a great moisturizer this is it. Its so creamy but not heavy. It leaves my facing feeling and looking so hydrated. It doesn’t take long at all for it to sink into the skin. I don’t find it has a smell. I would recommend this for all skin types. I have dry patches and this moisturizer have help with them. Great Cream
