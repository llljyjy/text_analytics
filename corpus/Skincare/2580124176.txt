I received this product complimentary from Influenster and shiseido in exchange for my honest review. I liked how this acne treatment cream was lightweight and not drying. I don’t have a lot of acne anymore since I’m in my mid twenties but I do suffer from the occasional hormonal acne. I found that this spot cream was nice in the skin and easy to apply but I found that it created more acne after the some were on its way out. I stopped using it and then it sorta stopped. I’m not sure why but if I have another breakout, I’ll try it again but for now my opinion isn’t as positive. I would recommend you to try this to see how it works with your skin. It would be a great product if it does work on your skin. However I’ll have to try this again and see if it does break me out. I’m going to wait until my breakouts go away before I try this again on a hormonal pimple soon. lightweight gel, not drying!
