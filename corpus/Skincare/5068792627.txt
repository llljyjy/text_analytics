Retinol without the sting is the best that I could describe this product. The product was just ok with me. I have tried other retinol products cheaper than Kiehlâ€™s and they perform way better than this. It does not really give me the firmness and glowy effect that I have experienced with other brands. However, if you have a sensitive skin and you want to include retinol in your skincare routine this would be the best product you can have. nan
