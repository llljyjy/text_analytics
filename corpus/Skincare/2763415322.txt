I adore all things DE.  I basically use this brand exclusively as it works better than any other brand I’ve ever tried (and I have tried everything).  But this product?  No.  I have very fair skin - typically I wear the lightest or second lightest shade in foundation/concealer no matter the brand.  These drops didn’t show up on my face at ALL.  Maybe I got a bad batch or something but I added more and more and literally only saw the lightest pink tint, but nothing that would pass for blush.  I was hoping this would be like the bronzing drops (which I love), but this was a waste of money.  I would not recommend. Not Effective
