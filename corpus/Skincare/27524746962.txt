I was pleasantly surprised by the serum. It is so gentle on my skin. It leaves a nice glowing refreshed look to my skin the next morning. It does visibly reduce the lines in my forehead. The packaging is very unique. It has a shorter lifespan once opened another serums. I believe this is because if it’s unique mixing of ingredients. Overall if you use it consistently on a daily basis you will go through the bottle before its expiration date. I personally use this on my face neck and décolletage. I will purchase again in the future. nan
