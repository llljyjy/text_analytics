I received this product in exchange for a review. I do like the consistency of this product. It feels nice going on my skin and leaves the eye area feeling moisturized and looking hydrated. It is a heavier eye cream so it is definitely only for night. I don’t notice much of a difference and I’ve been using it for a few weeks consistently. Great feel and smell but I don’t notice any improvements. Nice but not great
