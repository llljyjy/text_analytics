Feels really nice and refreshing on the skin, and soaks in really fast without feeling heavy. And I’ve definitely noticed a difference, my skin has been more glowy and less red! I’m afraid to use it too much because I don’t want to fade my freckles, but it certainly has helped with brightness and hyperpigmentation! I definitely recommend Gives you that glow!
