I received this as a complimentary from Deralogica. It is okay its my first time with this brand.  It was okay to use easy but I did not see a significant effect on my face. Maybe over time the effects will show. It was not harsh on and left the face feeling soft. It had a smell though when you were putting on your face. It was ok.
