I will admit, this feels like a very luxurious product. The bottle is glass and heavy, and it just looks and feels like you’re being fancier in your skincare. The product itself, though, is something that I’m just not a fan of. The first thing you notice when you use this product is the fragrance. I am someone who can occasionally suffer from breakouts and sensitive skin so I try to avoid using fragrance on my face at all. Added fragrance is one of the ingredients. The second ingredient is alcohol, which is interesting, as that tends to dry out your face, and this product boasts hydration. I didn’t notice anything miraculous happening when I used this product, and I just don’t know if I would spend the money on it to see if two bottles’ worth or more would lead to anti-aging, smoothing, and more hydrated skin. I’ll use it up, but I wouldn’t purchase myself. Not Worth the Money
