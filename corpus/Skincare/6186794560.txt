This was my very first drunk elephant product and I had a difficult time figuring out how to open it. After an embarrassing amount of time, I learned that you have to twist the cap to reveal the pump. Ive been using this product for the past few weeks now and my under eyes definitely feel more hydrated! A little definitely goes a long way so avoid using too much product otherwise your under eyes look oily. The consistency is very smooth and hydrating. I would like to add that I do not have sensitive skin. It does not sting for me as other reviews mention, but it does leave a tingly feeling as if I had a face mask on. I would get this product again! nan
