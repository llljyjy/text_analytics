I really enjoyed the texture of this sunscreen. Its very easy to glide on and clear so easy to achieve adequate protection. However, like many others, this sunscreen irritated my skin making it feel itchy and broke me out. Its not ideal, but I will keep the remaining to wear in water since its the best thing I found thats lightweight, waterproof, does not leave a cast, and is water resistant. Def worth a try if your skin does not get irritated easily! Could have been great!
