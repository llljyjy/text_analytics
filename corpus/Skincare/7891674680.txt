I was provided this product by dr. Jart and Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. This mask was pretty decent. It was a little difficult to apply and messy but I felt nice with a good texture. Smell was fine. I didnâ€™t feel like it did all the things it was supposed to but overall a nice product. I would not likely purchase it again due to the price. nan
