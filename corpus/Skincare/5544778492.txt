I received this Shiseido anti-aging serum for free in exchange for an honest review. The secret ingredient is reishi mushroom extract, which has been called the “anti-against powerhouse”. This serum made my skin so much softer, which helps fight fine lines. Amazingly it didn’t irritate my sensitive skin! Didn’t help with redness, but still a great product. nan
