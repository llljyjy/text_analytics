Very nice product. I did notice my skin was more smooth and healthy looking. I have extremely sensitive skin so I had to go easy with it. I ended up using it on my neck and forehead with a very light dabbling on my face. I like the product as I like everything they have put out. I think for my skin, some of the other products are a better fit for my temperamental skin. Worth a try though as everyoneâ€™s skin is different. Worth a try
