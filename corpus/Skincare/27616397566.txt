This moisturizer is so creamy. It has a light scent that is not overwhelming but like all Estee Lauder products the smell is very characteristic of the brand. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin with a healthy glow. In my type of skin (combination) it will be perfect to use it at night or in fall/winter. Using it in the morning would be very heavier specially in summer. The package is like all the moirurizer of this brand. Overall is a really good moisturizing, with anti aging and hydrating ingredients. Really good moisturizer!
