I am very careful about what I put on my skin. Dr. Zenoviaâ€™s peptide + ceramide repairing moisturizer is cruelty free, artificial colors free, has no parabens, no sodium laurel sulfates, no petroleum mineral oil, no propylene glycol and meets my standards for a clean product I feel good about using. They are also clean in  having a reduced plastic & recyclable package. My skin feels dewy and my complexion seems brighter and more even after using this product. I like the ingredients, including the green tea, aloe and cucumber extract. My winter skin is much improved. Clean skin care
