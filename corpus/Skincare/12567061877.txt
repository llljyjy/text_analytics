I love a nice rich night cream that doesn’t feel greasy but one that also doesn’t get absorbed too quickly and leaves my skin wanting more moisture. This is exactly what I love and look for in my night cream. To do the work of many other - what I consider unnecessary - steps in skincare routines (additional toners, essences, masks, oils, etc.). With the exception of other Genifique products I have and adore, such as the serum. They work wonderfully in conjunction to one another to make my skin feel hydrated, healthy, and to smooth over my fine lines and smile lines (aka wrinkles I’ve had since my teens).In terms of cost, I would be remiss to not acknowledge the price. Lancome Genifique products are generally quite pricey, but they do work. If you’re willing to pay this amount for your skincare, you won’t be disappointed. If you’re not willing to pay this pricetag, I suggest looking into other nice ceramide creams at a lower price - such as Farmacy Halo and K-beauty products like Dr. Jart’s ceramide cream. You can find those at more acceptable deals.But I do truly enjoy this product and recommend it. Note - I received this product in exchange for an honest review. This product is a real treat.
