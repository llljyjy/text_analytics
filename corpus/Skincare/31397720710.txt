This cleanser is suitable for removing everyday impurities and makeup (I use it as a second cleanse). My skin is also very sensitive and acne-prone (cystic acne) so when I use this cleanser, it does not give me any irritation and calms down breakouts. It leaves my skin feeling so soft and clean and a little goes a long way - seriously! Highly recommend! Great for sensitive and acne prone skin!
