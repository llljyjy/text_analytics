This product really gave me fast results. My forehead wrinkles are so much less noticeable and I did have some peeling which I considered a positive. The only things I didn’t enjoy about the product was the tiny directions (let’s face it if we are using retinol, small print is hard!) and the process of preparing the product was confusing and I ended up spilling some of the product. My skin is looking good!
