Got it from a Lancome skin care set.Not sticky. Absorbed fast. Heavily fragraced. The smell would last the whole morning with mask on.  Not sure whether it causes allergy but noted redness over face after wearing it a day with mask. Not prepared to give it another try under epidemic. Heavily scented sunscreen
