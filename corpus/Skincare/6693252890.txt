i have kinda oily skin and as much as i wanted to like this it just didn’t work for me :( it was a little too orangey and wouldn’t dry completely and kept transferring. it’s really pigmented which is great and if your skin is dry i’m sure it works well but for me i’m gonna have to give it 3 stars not for me :(
