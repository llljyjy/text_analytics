Product is great. One of my all time favorite sunscreens. I can layer it with anything and it works so well. The only issue is the common one that everyone is facing, with the thing breaking so it’s really messy now. I can still close it and open it, but it does just pour out from a spot its not supposed to (messy). I have kept it stored in the same place in the same way after reading other reviews before I purchased, but it still happened to mine. I don’t know if I’ll repurchase because of this issue, but if it was fixed I’d repurchase forever. Great product, not great packaging
