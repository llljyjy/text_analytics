Sephora Collection gifted me to this product, but theopinions are completely my own based on my experience- I am a big skincare junkie I like to give products a fair chance by using it for a few weeks and I did so with this product, I am very picky when it comes to AHA BHA or any exfoliant especially if it’s going to be sitting on my skin, I do have very sensitive skin I would say this product wasn’t bad but there are definitely better options out there! nan
