I have tried many supplements in the past and was skeptical, but ever since I went off birth control I’ve had breakouts on my chin that nothing can prevent. Until this! After about 2 weeks, my skin was noticeably clearer - 0 new breakouts. I went out of town for a weekend and forgot to pack these, and my chin broke out again. But then after a few days of taking these daily, I’m all clear again. I eat plenty of vitamin A as I have a salad pretty much daily, so I think it’s the zinc or other ingredients. But whatever it is, im so thankful I tried this supplement! it works -  zero breakouts!
