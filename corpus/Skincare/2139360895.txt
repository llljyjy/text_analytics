This is the product I didn’t realize I needed so badly in my daily skin care regiment. I replaced my usual serum with this for a week as a sample and the results were amazing after just a couple days. This time of year tends to bring dry skin for me, and when I add this on with my daily/ night time moisturizer, my skin is not only glowing but incredibly moisturized and feeling great! It also makes a beautiful base to start my makeup in the morning, and isn’t too heavy. You need to try this!
