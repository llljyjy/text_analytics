i love this product. it’s a great beginners retinol. based off my experience with it, I didn’t peel, i didn’t purge a ton. I just got a few small pimples but they went away fairly quickly. I noticed that my skin was brighter just a week after using this product. I’m only about 6 weeks in, my skin has cleared up tremendously, it looks brighter and more plump. nan
