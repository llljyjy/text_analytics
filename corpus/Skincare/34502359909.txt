I am so excited to be reviewing this product. Over the years I have begun to realize how important good skin is. So many cosmetic companies claim they are the best one to try. I was not sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised at the results after using the It confidence cream for over a week. It does not take much, to use on your entire face and neck. I live on the East coast and right now we are suffering from a heat wave. Other creams I have used in the past in weather such as this would basically melt off as you were sweating the It Confidence cream goes on smooth completely hydrating your skin without just laying on the surface. My face and neck are smooth and supple without that feeling of a cream dripping away.I noticed after a week fine lines were smoother and my face had a more even tone to the completion. The It Confidence cream went on like silk and never felt heavy or greasy. I would recommend this to anyone who wants better looking smooth skin. I was pleasantly surprised that I did not start to break out. Usually that happens when I try a new cream. That just goes to show you the quality of ingredients used. Now I have a brand new staple in preserving my skin. Pleasantly Surprised!!
