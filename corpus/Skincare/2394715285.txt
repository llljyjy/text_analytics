I’m the type of person that loves trying new products, but skin is just not having it. It’s super sensitive and 9/10 will breakout into a rash. Summer Fridays’ products have been a favorite of mine and the eye cream is no different! Instant glow with the subtle shimmer and you can feel your skin tightening in a good way. Definitely a must try! Sensitive Skin
