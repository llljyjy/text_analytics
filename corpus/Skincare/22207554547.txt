I LOVED the old formula, it was so creamy and hydrating but still nice and light but this formula feels more watery which I don’t like. It had a very light scent but this one almost smells like bug spray when it’s dry, it’s not good. I really preferred the old packaging as well,  it came with a little spoon and the new packaging feels bulky and like a huge waste of plastic and space. So disappointed, this was my holy grail product. New formula and packaging
