Very gentle to my sensitive skin. My skin was irritated by some mineral oil based products when I was younger.  But the ingredients of this product is so clean and the scent from natural herbal products calms me down as well. This is one of  the three makeup removing products I keep repurchasing. LOVE it for my sensitive skin
