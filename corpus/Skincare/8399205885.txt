Currently halfway through my 3rd bottle! This stuff is great to put right after you wash your face, when its still damp, and before you apply your serums/treatments. My skin get dry easily, especially after washing, so this is great to avoid that tightened feeling.IMO, it’s better than the Laneige Cream Skin. (I brought the mini Laneige cream skin on a trip bc it was part of a value set, and my skin broke out into little bumps; so I’m sticking to the FAB toner) Plus, it’s $9 cheaper with an extra ounce of product. 3rd bottle, better than Laneige Cream Skin
