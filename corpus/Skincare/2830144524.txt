This smells so lovely, exactly like honey, probably because actual honey is so high on the ingredients list.It’s thin in consistency with a slight shimmer from the mica (for those of you who know about the ethics of mica, this is important), super spreadable, not thick like other clay masks, and the application is a breeze.And that’s about where it ends for me.There’s so much spearmint oil in it that my face literally burned until the mask fully dried, which didn’t take long, and it left my skin feeling very tight, dry, and thirsty. I know it’s a clay mask and that’s what they do, but I was hoping the honey being a humectant would offset that.I am unaware as to whether or not they ethically sourced their mica, but I imagine if they had that that would be one of the selling points, and I’m not seeing that.Overall it’s a no from me. Smells exactly like honey, concerning ingredients
