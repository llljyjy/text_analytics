Moldy! After using this for a couple weeks, I was starting to like it, albeit a bit heavy, I found it worked well with my sometimes dry skin. Unfortunately that didnâ€™t last long, went to open it today and there is gray mold growing all over it. Problematic to say the least, it also does not play well with other products and pills. RETURNING immediately. Moldy after a couple weeks.
