The Kosas brand has easily become one of my favorites over the last year. This Plump & Juicy spray serum is comes packaged in a beautiful orange and pink bottle that reminds me of sherbet. It has a light refreshing scent and a beautiful light mist. Each time I use it I feel as if I am giving my skin is given a drink of water. Being in my later 30s anti-aging products are a must. This serum not only makes my skin feel more refreshed and hydrated but also more plump, awake, and healthy. I especially enjoy the refreshing benefits it provides after using my at home microdermabrasion machine because it has almost a cooling feeling but also helps to soothe the skin. This product has become and will continue to be a part of my skincare routine. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for anti aging benefits, plump and healthy skin. It is a product that can be used for all skin types but as always it is always recommended that you do a patch test to be safe. Must have serum
