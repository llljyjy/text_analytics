I hate to say this but I really love this cream!! My skin is so bouncy, moisturized, smooth, CALM no redness and I have a little bit of rosacea on my cheeks that nothing gets rid of. I did not want to love this but I really really do which is so hard because it is so expensive but if you’ve tried all else and can afford it I’d definitely say give this a try. It’s unscented but definitely has a smell to it that I wasn’t fond of at first but it quickly goes away. I’m obsessed. Hate to say it….
