I received this product to test out to give my honest opinion of. And first of all I would like to say I love these packets they open easily and I am able to get all the product out , feels like a very good high quality serum not oily feeling at all , after the first use my skin looked so much better less dry and it took a long while to see just the tiny bit of dry form after using like just before I planned to use it the next day which is amazing! After days of using I noticed that spot not even get dry again. This has to be the best serum in the world to keep my dry skin at bay specially right now in my pregnancy itâ€™s been drier then normal, I plan to buy this and have my husband use it as well.
