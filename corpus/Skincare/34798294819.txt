I received this product to test from Influensters. I was really excited to try this out, as I’ve never used Dior creams before. I like that it’s a squeeze tube and not a tub you stick your finger in. The texture is not oily on the skin which is great because I have combination skin. This balm leaves my skin feeling the right amount of moisture where it is needed. It’s easily spreadable you do not need a lot at once. Truly love! love it!
