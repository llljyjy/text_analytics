Incredible ! I was concerned this would make my face oily and difficult to apply cream contour over but not in the slightest. It goes on super smooth and blends well at the hair line. Kind of expensive, but totally worth it. I would 100% buy again and again and again. I didnâ€™t have any problems with the packaging and found it perfect for traveling. Also the bottle makes it really easy to just squeeze a few drops into my moisturizer/ serum. Totally replaced my foundation and gave my skin a beautiful, not orange glow! nan
