I am happy I tried this product. After using for 2+ weeks my skin looks healthy and hydrated. I use it Confidence in a Cream both in the morning and night. This moisturizer keeps my skin hydrated when used under mineral sunscreen. Mineral sunscreen tends to make my skin dry and dehydrated especially when using day after day. it Confidence in a Cream turned my skin around, I am thrilled with itâ€™s moisturizing properties. I look forward to continuing to use this moisturizer and will purchase a jar when I am finished with this one. Healthy hydrated skin!
