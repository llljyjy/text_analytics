I love all things to make my lips not crusty AND THIS IS MY FAVORITE. First of all it’s vanilla, it’s perfect I’m obsessed with the smell. It lasts a long time and even when it’s gone my lips are actually nourished and don’t go back to being dry like so many other products. The colored one is also amazing. This has become my emotional support lip balm, I refuse to be anywhere without it. It’s like the Laneige sleeping mask but better and very much worth the money. This withstands the 30 mph wind, the snow, the rain, everything. buy this pls
