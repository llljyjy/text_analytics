I’ve used this vitamin C off and on for a few years. I think it provides good results, however I don’t enjoy the texture so I change up quite a bit.  I’ve yet to find “the one“ for me so when I run out of whatever brand/formula I’ve been using and don’t know which other one to try, or when I just want a decent basic vitamin C, I go back to the Ordinary Vitamin C Suspension 2%+HA Spheres 2%.  It’s reliable and affordable.  I only use it the morning after rinsing the previous nighttime skincare product. I apply this vitamin C and let it sink in for a few minutes then proceed with moisturizer and sunscreen. It works well for me. Old reliable
