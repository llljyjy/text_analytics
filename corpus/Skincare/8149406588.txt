This is a good idea to keep the around eye area moisturized. The presentation and packaging are nice but I just find that the stick is a bit hard to apply directly around the eye area. I haven’t used it long enough to tell if it helps reduce the fine lines. Would have preferred if it didn’t have Phenoxyethanol in the ingredients. Good idea
