this is my holy grail cleanser! i randomly get flair ups due to my facial dermatitis and a few months ago my skin got really bad. it was severely dry, raw and sensitive to every facial product. this is the only cleanser i’ve come across that didn’t irritate my skin and make it drier than it already was. also, an added bonus is that it takes off all my facial makeup! holy grail for me
