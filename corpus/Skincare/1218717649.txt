I was excited to try this free sample from Influenster in exchange for my honest review of this Dior product. First of all I took a sniff and the smell was very pretty. I was afraid it would irritate my face. It did not! The little bit of product I squeezed on my finger along with the water lathered and covered my whole face. It is rich and creamy  so it definitely left my skin clean and moisturized. Try it and you will not be disappointed! A little goes a long way
