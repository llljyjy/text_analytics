I’ve been using this cleanser for about 3 years now and it’s the only cleanser I’ll use! I noticed a huge difference in my skin about 3 weeks into using it, my skin is less oily, I break out less and the breakouts are less severe, it’s really helped me get my skin under control! I’ve had acne for about 15 years and this is definitely my favorite cleanser for my skin, I highly recommend it, just make sure you give it time to work, skincare needs at least 4 weeks to really show great results and get through any purging!!
