I worked for the brand and whenever a client would love this product but not the price of the bottle itself, I always suggested they buy the refill instead!  Itâ€™s cheaper and the product is distributed by a pump, so your product is protected!Get this!  Smoothes pores and leaves skin beautiful. Amazing as a primer, but keep in mind a little goes a long way!  Applying too much can alter the weartime of your foundation! Just buy the refill instead!
