When you first put the cream on it has a wonderful scent and rubs into the skin really nicely. I have combo/acne prone skin and HAVE to use an oil fee moisturizer. But for my areas of skin that are combo (not just oily) I am left with dry flakes about 5-10 minutes after this soaks in. Like my skin seriously has never look drier and not hydrated. So I always have to go over those areas with a better moisturizer. Just keep it in mind, still a good product but has a very specific niche. Not very hydrating, left skin dry
