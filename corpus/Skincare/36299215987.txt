I received this product as complimentary from Influenster and Shiseido for my honest opinion.The consistency of this sunscreen it’s liquid so it’s easy to apply and has a clean smell. It has a moderate tint but you can easily blend it. I like that is a mineral sunscreen. I have fair skin, so on me there isn’t any white cast for the mineral ingredients but I don’t know how it would work on a darker complexion. The hyaluronic acid helps to maintain the skin moisturized and it’s a nice extra feature to have in a sunscreen. I would purchase it in the future and I would recommend it to a friend if the price for you it’s not a problem. nan
