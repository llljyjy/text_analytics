Love this!  Feels like a mix between an oil and water, soaks in perfectly. My pores are starting to look smaller after daily use for about two weeks. The hydration and base for other products and makeup is great. I don’t use toner much but this is now in my regular rotation. Also seems to be soothing my chronic cheek redness!  Light sweet smell that fades quickly, don’t let that scare you off. Not sticky or tingly or burning at all. Great for my fair sensitive skin. Highly recommend. Bought full size after getting a sample. mix between a serum and water, light and hydrating
