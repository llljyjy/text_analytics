Honestly I didn’t see that much of a difference after using for a while. It’s very gentle, so if you have sensitive skin it might be great for you. It also made my skin really oily so if you have extremely oily skin I’d suggest you try something more mattifying. I’d recommend this product to people who’s never used acid products. nightmare for oily skin peeps
