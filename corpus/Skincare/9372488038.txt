I cannot believe how underrated this product is! If you have dry, acne prone skin, use it with farmacy’s daily greens oil-free gel moisturizer, let it set for 30 seconds, and apply this. Let it sit for about a minute and your skin will look healthy, glowy, and slightly tinted to cover redness and irritation. It doesn’t break me out at all, and doesn’t melt off throughout the day. My fav waterproof sunscreen for ocean swimming uses this same method but with the supergoop play sunscreen. Neither have a white cast!! A girl's best friend
