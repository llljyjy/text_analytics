This cream went on very smoothly. I put it on after my shower and washing my face, and a little goes a long way. There was no strong overpowering scent, which I liked. It wasnâ€™t too heavy, although I did a few things before bed and was already a little dewy and sweaty easily, so I recommend putting on right before bed! I liked the pump design, and how you can get the perfect amount everytime. Delivers Promised Results
