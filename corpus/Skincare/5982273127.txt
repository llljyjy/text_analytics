This is definitely not what I was expecting when the bottle said “lotion” despite it being labeled as an essence I thought it might be a bit thicker. I tried this AM and PM, and I found it more effective in the AM (since I already use a thick oil and moisturizer in the PM). It is VERY lightweight, and must be applied with a cotton pad. No noticeable scent. It felt cooling and not sticky when applied. I would say this helps retain moisturize over the course of the day, my face looked slightly more hydrated longer. But it is hard to say how this works long term since the sample size I received was really only enough for 2 weeks. I appreciate this product and am considering adding it to my permanent routine! nan
