I was given this by Influenster, and I’m honestly soo glad they sent this to me because it actually improved my skin to the point it’s staple in my routine now. My skin looks a lot “fuller” I’ll say that, like the skin is plump and healthy. I’ve noticed more even texture and I don’t find any dry patches anymore since the moisturizer is nice and thick! I really would recommend this to anyone looking for a solid moisturizer in the routine. Smells pleasant, works well, and price point is nice to me. Will be purchasing myself. Really enjoyed using this!
