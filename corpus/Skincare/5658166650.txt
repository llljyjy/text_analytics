Been using this product for a couple of months and I feel like it does helps calm redness I experience all over my face, but for the price it isn’t anything remarkable. There are other cheaper products that do the same thing. For this price I feel like it should have helped actually improve my skin over time. Something I love about it though is that I have sensitive skin and this has never once irritated my skin or made it worse. I guess it’s worth a try if you’re someone looking for something gentle. nan
