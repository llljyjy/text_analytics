This mask is fantastic. I have sensitive, acne-prone skin so I have to be cautious about what skincare products I use. I wouldn’t use this every night (just because of my skin concerns) but it’s great to use once a week for a boost of hydration. I also use this after getting a little sunburned, and it does a great job of reducing my redness and hydrating my skin! Rich, hydrating overnight mask
