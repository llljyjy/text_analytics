So when I used it the first time it felt super sticky on my hands which I don’t mind at all. It has no hard smell which i love.It included two part serums which u r required to.mix together n apply  to your skin.I was afraid I’ll break out but I have to say the minute I used it on my skin it felt hydrating n the very next second I felt like I had nothing on my skin and found my self going in for my usual moisturizer to follow as u should after a serum.I obviously don’t see any dramatic anti aging changes but I do fell my skin is a tad more hydrated but not as much as I would like it to be Would I go out n specifically purchase it for the price it is probably not. Let me know if u have used it and what is ur review on it !! Hydrating
