I received IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Makeup: 3 in 1 Makeup Melting Balm with a full size to sample. The smell is like citrus and it melts the makeup well, I would not recommend this one to remove waterproof eye liner because it gets messy but besides that it is all good. Compared to other make up removers this one dissolves well but might need a brush to avoid getting the balm dirty. I would recommend but only for make up.I also recommend to wash the face with a cleanser to avoid greasy feeling. Melting Power
