This is my new favorite face cream!! My skin was glowing after using this. I tried the original aqua bomb cream but I love this one is packed with Vitamin C and other essential vitamins! I have very dry skin and this is the perfect formula to combat that issue for me. It is extremely hydrating and a little goes a long way. The texture is great and I like the packaging as well. Would definitely get this again. Glowing skin!
