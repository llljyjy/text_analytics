I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my review. I can’t say I’m in love with this product because I don’t have much experience with any resurfacers so not sure what to expect. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes since using this but also don’t use it too frequently since it does have a small smell (kind of like flour) to me and a bit of stickiness. Will continue to use it since I’m still using her other products and they’re not too bad, but as a stand-alone I probably wouldn’t purchase this. nan
