I received this as a free sample and was excited to give it a try. I have never tried any Kiehl products before, but have heard good things. When I received the serum I was interested to see that it came unmixed. It was easy to mix up and prepare. I have fine lines and just the beginnings of wrinkles at age 41. I have been looking for a serum/product to use at night so that I don’t have to use multiple products during the day under my makeup. This serum went on smooth. It wasn’t thick or sticky. The texture was good and it absorbed quickly without leaving any residue behind. A little goes a long way. I concentrated mainly on my eye area, forehead and jawline. Using just the tips of my fingers I applied a small amount and had no issue using the product. I didn’t have any stinging or burning with this product as I have had with other serums. I have not used this product long, so the verdict is still out on long term benefits/wrinkle reduction. The overall texture of my skin seems tighter and clearer. I did decide to use it only every other night because I was noticing some drying of my skin. Overall I liked the product and would recommend people give it a try for themselves. As with most face products everyone will have their own unique experience. Too early to tell
