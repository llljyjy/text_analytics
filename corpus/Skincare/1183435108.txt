I’ve tried all of the YTTP moisturizers (and like them) and this is by far my favorite. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated. My skin looks brighter and the fine lines on my forehead have diminished. I have combination skin and this moisturizer was easily spread, not too heavy or oily and felt refreshingly rich. I have been using this product for less than a week and highly recommend it. My routine is the following: Superfood Cleanser, Herba Mate Resurfacing Energy Facial, YTTP toner, Triple Peptide Cactus and Oasis Serum, Dream Eye Cream and then Polypeptide 121 Future Cream. I have used Superberry Hydrate & Glow DreamMask, as well. The Future IS BRIGHT…
