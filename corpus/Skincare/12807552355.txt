This drunk elephant leave on face mask is amazing! A little product goes a long way, it only took a couple pumps to cover my entire face and neck!  It made my skin feel super soft and moisturized. It also made my skin look a bit brighter and the redness of my skin around my nose is no longer red and Iâ€™ve used it twice so far! I am definitely looking forward to having a more even skin tone and the dark spots on my face fading!  This mask has already helped my skin so much and I will definitely keep using it for my skin to continue to improve from it! great face mask!!
