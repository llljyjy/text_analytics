I have combo skin and I received this product to try out and review. I am 37 with fine lines and developing some wrinkles especially in my forehead area. I used this nightly for about 2 weeks. I have to say I noticed a change in the forehead wrinkles after about day 3. It is very thick and hydrating. I would recommend this product to anyone worried about wrinkles and fine lines. Itâ€™s very hydrating so your skin will just soak it in. It felt luxurious and I loved it. I will purchase a full size and I am glad they sent this to me. I have fallen in love with the feel and the way it makes my skin look. I am glowing in the morning AhhMAZING
