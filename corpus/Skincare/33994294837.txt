I must confess that seeing that make up remover in black was kind of weird and scary. Lol but as soon as I tried it, was a nice surprise. After you rinse your face with warm water the softness is incredibly niceee ! No make up remains and extremely soft results. Bright skin! I fell in love with this product! I used a cotton pad to apply it on my skin because I donâ€™t like to dirt my nails with black.. #takethedayoff @clinique @sephora Incredible softness after use
