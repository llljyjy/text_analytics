Smells & feels nice going on but I didn’t notice any difference in my pores. The hydration didn’t hold up all day either. I layered it over a high quality serum and my skin felt dry mid-way through the day (of note: it is winter in the dry Colorado climate). I like the cream but it won’t work for my aging skin in the winter. May be better during the summer when it isn’t so dry. Not the best for dry, aging skin
