I’ve been using this product for a month now and unfortunately I’m just not in love.I think the witch hazel was a little harsh on my skin and I didn’t notice any drastic positive changes in my skin. I love the concept of the refill option. My only other comment would be that the pads themselves were very thin and I found it difficult to only grab one and not 2 or 3 stuck together. Not my favourite
