I love the Kiehl’s Retinol night serum. It’s extremely easy to use and easy to set up! It comes with the retinol in a separate pouch so it stays fresh. All you have to do it switch lids and push down to activate. I’ve been using g this serum for over two weeks and have noticed a huge difference in the appearance of my fine lines and wrinkles. The are almost non existent! The serum absorbs quickly, doesn’t smell and the bottle will last for months! I highly recommend this product to everyone!! Easy to Use Retinol Serum
