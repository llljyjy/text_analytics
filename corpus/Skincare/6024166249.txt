Perfect for underneath makeup - I wanted to look glowy/dewy so I used the tatcha dewy moisturizer + this for a light/natural makeup look and definitely achieved it even with my oily skin!Wearing today to test out non-makeup wear and it’s pilling (yes as I touch my face while working oops) but still don’t like  it pulls all over. Would probably buy the mini just to have for makeup use because I like having multiple products and routines! great primer for makeup!
