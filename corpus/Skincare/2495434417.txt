I recently came across this line and was excited to add this to my nighttime skincare routine. I was looking for something that could help rehydrate and also calm my skin from some irritation I have been having. I feel like this is a really nice formula I like I do like the packaging. Initial results seem promising and I can’t wait to see improvements in the next few weeks. I’ll be looking into more items from the line. nan
