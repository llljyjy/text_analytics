This is my new favorite face sunscreen! I was hesitant to try it, but Iâ€™m so glad that I did. It leaves absolutely no white cast, none, and I have medium skin that tans easily. It rubs in easily and is also pretty moisturizing, so I can use it by itself most days. I love that it is non nano zinc, which makes it reef safe. I have very sensitive skin, and this did not break me out or cause any negative changes to my skin. This sunscreen is lightweight, and I love how it feels on! I highly recommend it; it is worth the cost. Definitely worth it!
