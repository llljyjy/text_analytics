Preface by saying that I do not like primers. They either clog my pores or are too sticky, pill, etc. But.... holy cow this is such a beautiful canvas. I wanted to try it since I love their other products and I am so glad I did!!! Glides over my moisturizer and sunblock perfectly, does not pill, and my NARS, Tarte and Lâ€™Oreal foundations lay perfectly over the top. I am in love! Beautiful!
