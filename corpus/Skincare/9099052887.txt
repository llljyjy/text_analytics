As someone with combination/oily skin, this moisturizer has become an absolute holy grail for me. It is noncomedogenic so it doesn’t break me out, and it feels so nice on the skin. The only con for me is the price, however I’ve tried multiple other moisturizers and always go back to this one! Holy grail am moisturizer
