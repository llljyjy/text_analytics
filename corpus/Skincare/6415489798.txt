I love the texture of this moisturizer. It almost has a gel-like consistency. It has a light, pleasant scent that’s not overpowering. It left my skin feeling moisturized and bouncy. Love that it’s formulated with vitamin C because I’m always looking to improve any discoloration in my skin. This absorbs nicely and would be great for both morning and night. Bouncy Skin
