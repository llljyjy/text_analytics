This is a nice product. I’ve recently had a few dark spot blemishes that have stayed on my face after some acne from wearing masks the past couple years. It’s helped with removing the spots after a week or so of using it. The texture is nice and you don’t need to put much! I’ve seen comments about the smell and it’s not bad as people make it seem. As a man, you don’t ever go out of your way to get this product but I have definitely been missing out! I recommend to all the males out there! I like it!
