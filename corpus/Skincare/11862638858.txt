I usually stay away from anything with anything involving lemon and peel but this mixture is fantastic! The fresh lemon scent is light and not overpowering in the least. I have been using this product consistently for a few weeks now due to being a member of Bzzagent and having a free product to test and give out my honest review. Iâ€™m very happy with the overall results and my skin feels cleansed and fresh, especially now after a few weeks. I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family and give it a 4 star review! Great Product!
