I have been using this in my skincare routine but didn’t take a before or after photo so I never noticed a difference. That was until I got sun spots on the back of my hands and I freaked out. I used this and then now they’re almost completely gone! I looked at my face and compared with older photos and noticed a difference as well. I definitely recommend it! It may feel a little tacky (a lot of vitamin c serums are) but you should be using a moisturizer & spf after anyways so you shouldn’t feel the tackiness after. REALLY WORKS!
