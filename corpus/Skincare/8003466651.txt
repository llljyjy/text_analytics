Ordered this without realizing it contains menthoxypropanediol, a menthol derivative which is sensitizing (i.e. irritating) to skin. Guess that’s what I get for trying to save money. I will be returning this product. Two stars because as other reviews have said, it doesn’t leave the skin feeling dry and stripped. Contains menthol derivative
