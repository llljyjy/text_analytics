Love this super fine mist that tingles your skin after cleansing. The spray itself goes on easily but I preferred the feeling when putting more in my hands and applying it that way. This method puts more product on the surface of your skin and made the tingling sensation more noticeable. This seems like a spray toner but it is a serum, my skin being combination, sometimes would be fine with just this. I have been a licensed esthetician for over 30 years and have loved serums ever since but never tried it in a spray form. Since this is such a fine mist and light weight, I would recommend for others with combination skin, not so much for really dry or dehydrated people. It is unscented which is something I appreciate and those with sensitivities should do well with. The packaging is glass and on the heavy side, would love to see this in a small travel size, sprays are a great refresher when flying.  I did not notice plumping but felt firming which is nice. nan
