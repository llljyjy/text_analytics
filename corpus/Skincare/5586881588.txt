I really liked the formula for this product. It’s creamy and hydrating and does work well under makeup for me. It’s unscented which is great for sensitive skin, and although I had no visible changes in my skin tone after using/applying, I really liked the moisture it gave me! Also the jar looks small but there’s SO much product given how little you apply daily! Hydrating
