gifted by eadem! I love this moisturizer. it has ceramides, fatty acids, all of that good stuff to really help your barrier. it is unscented and feels so good on the skin. it has a light whipped yet thick feeling, and I actually love it!! it rly has been helping with tret dryness! super nourishing!!
