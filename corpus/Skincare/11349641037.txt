I have been using Lancome Advanced Genifique Repairing Night Cream every night for 3 weeks.  It has a pleasant texture and smells very good.  It is easily absorbed into the skin, the skin remains pleasant, it is not greasy or sticky.  The skin on my face is now healthier, the fine lines are not so evident, the skin feels hydrated, firmer and more radiant. I Love It
