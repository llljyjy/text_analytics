The only thing I really like about this is the smell, which is citrusy.  The product is quite thick and heavy feeling. It feels sticky for a while after application. It might be making me break out, but I’m not sure.  But what’s most annoying about this product is the applicator: it only works for about 3/4 of the product.  Now I’ve turned the bottle upside down to try to get to the remaining quarter, but even gravity doesn’t make it budge since it’s so thick.  I don’t think I would buy it again. Thick and has a terrible applicator
