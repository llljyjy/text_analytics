I was excited try this product out for my congested blemish-prone skin. It has a nice light scent and a lightweight slightly tacky serum texture. I’ve used this 2-3x a week for 3 weeks and it broke me out everytime. When I took a break from using it, my skin improved but then broke out again when I resumed use. Definitely, prefer Drunk Elephant’s TLC serum over this as I see a difference with every use plus it doesn’t break me out. If you enjoy the TLC serum too, there may be a chance this won’t work out for you. Breakout city!
