While this product hydrated my skin and made it glow, I just cannot get past the scent. This cream had such a strong scent that I could smell it on my face when I would wash it off the next morning.You will get good results with this but if you are sensitive to strong smells, I would consider alternative products in the Tula product line.** I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review** nan
