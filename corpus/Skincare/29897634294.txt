I received this #freeproduct from Topbox and have been using it for a few weeks. I use it during night after my face cream (Laneige Water Bank Moisture Cream). I find my skin more moistured in morning and radiant. I think this combination works great for me. Also, I love the smell. Itâ€™s not heavy and overwhelming. Bonus point go for a small spatula. The product is easy to apply and more hygienic to use. #trywithtopbox Winter must have
