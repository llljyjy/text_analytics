Goes on easily, provides a really nice dewey look. The coverage is light, but enough to blur my imperfections to the point where multiple people noticed the first time I wore it, saying my skin looked great. I just wash or rinse my face, moisturize and apply with my fingers. I have worn it without moisturizing first with no issue as well if anyone is looking for more of a one-step product. It may look shiny when first applied, but give it a moment to settle and itâ€™ll look great. nan
