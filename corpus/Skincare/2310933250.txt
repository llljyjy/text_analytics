not buying these again. Very disappointing. They used to be my go to wipes, had the watermelon and coconut, plus the exfoliating ones. I will finish off my current pack and find a different brand. They don’t clean the same as they used to, and there is like a “film“ that stays on your skin. Doesn’t feel clean. More expensive and less wipes, plus worse product. changed the formula and texture of the wipe.
