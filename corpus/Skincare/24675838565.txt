I was so excited to receive and try these items after hearing such good things about Tula. Overall, I think the set is a great step into skincare, particularly anti-aging, and includes the basics most are looking for. The moisturizers have a distinct smell that I could take or leave. I really enjoyed the overnight one but the morning one doesn’t feel quite right, which could be a skin-type issue. The instant de-puff and wrinkle drops felt great on the skin, I’m just not sure how much change I noticed. I will definitely continue to use them to see how the perform over more time. I received these products complimentary from for testing purposes. nan
