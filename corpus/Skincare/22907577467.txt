I must admit that I love multi-use products. I mean who doesnâ€™t want to save time and steps when doing your skincare routine. Who needs such a routine when you can use this Dior Cica Recover & Repair Multi-use Balm. I tried it on my hands first because they are always dry and sensitive. It is a rich, smooth cream but also lightweight and non greasy. I have now used this on my face and neck for two weeks in the morning and evening. This fragrance-free multi-use balm is perfect for my dry and sensitive skin. It soaks into your skin but also somehow leaves it feeling moisturized all day. I will definitely add this to my must purchase list. I highly recommend this product for any skin type. One of the best multi-use products I have used.
