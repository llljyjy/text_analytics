After I take a shower I apply this, morning & night, it feels really good on my skin. I like to cycle my products & I use this one along with the lactic acid to dilute both products because they’re really strong, I’ve seen a difference in my skin already. I’m enjoying this product and I’m going’ on three weeks of use, im told its a gradual process so I’m excited to keep going. I recommend. nan
