I love Kiehl’s lotions and soaps and balms, so I was excited to try this barrier cream during this cold, dry snap we are having. Let me just say this is the perfect winter moisturizer. I put it on in the evenings and my face stays moisturized and soft for 24 hours. Try it, you won’t be disappointed. Great for winter!
