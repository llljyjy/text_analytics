Wowzers- I am super pleased with the Peace Out Retinol Face Stick! This super easy to apply concentrated retinol serum balm is awesome for my fine lines. I wash my face, use my nighttime moisturizer, serum, and as the last step I use the retinol serum stick. Layering my products using the balm last. The serum balm is simple to use and does not irritate my skin. My forehead lines are starting to soften and smooth out. Itâ€™s a miracle.  Recommend! Easy to use retinol face stick balm
