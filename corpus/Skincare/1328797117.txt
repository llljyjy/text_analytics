Unfortunately this is the only product from this line I don’t like.  It made my under eye area so dry that my expression lines started to appear like permanent wrinkles.  It didn’t matter how little or much of the product I applied, it did nothing long term (3 months use) and it certainly made my eyes look worse.  I had to use a second eye creme in hopes that maybe, just maybe, this serum will work long term (just gives an immediate dry, waxy look to my eye area).  Big no for me.   However, the face creme and resurfacing serum is amazing and the peels a staple in my routine. Made my eye look horribly dry and aged!
