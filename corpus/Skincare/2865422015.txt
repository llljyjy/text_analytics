about a year ago I started working with one of my friends on my skin. my goal was wedding ready but I loved the results of my VI Peel and Micro-Needling so I kept going. for me, after the 48/72 hour mark of a treatment, my skin gets really really dry and very sensitive, especially with chemical peels. this toner is a must! it’s mild and it’s super hydrating. when my skin is being reintroduced to my products, I always start with this. I use it morning and night. it hydrated well and my complexion always look healthy with this. Post-Chemical Peel and Micro-Needling lifeline
