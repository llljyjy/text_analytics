I recieved this product from influencer to test for my honest opinion.I like how pretty the box and bottle is but I’m not crazy about the scent. It kind of smells like a mud mask to me which isn’t horrible and I can’t be mad at because of the great list of ingredients. I have sensitive skin and eczema and when I first tried this product I had a small flare up and decided it wasn’t for me. But I simplified my routine and decided to try it again and now I’m in love! My skin hasn’t been this supple and smooth in a while. I don’t have any issues with wrinkles or fine lines but my skin had not been at it best. I feel like I get almost spa like results after a while.  I usually apply fresh out the shower after exfoliating and it absorbs very well. I noticed it helped with hydration, my skin looks brighter, and over all more healthy. My pores also are a bit smaller. I’m so glad I decided to give it another try. I highly recommend! Definitely magic in a bottle
