I have been using this as a base for my foundation and it is so hydrating. It leaves me with a really pretty glow after I apply my foundation. I don’t even need a face primer! My skin is oily/combo and even after a full day of wear, I didn’t look greasy at all. I didn’t notice any scent and it says 2-3 pumps is what you need. I find that 2 pumps is more than enough. The only thing is that the pump squirts the product out really fast and far out so I almost dropped a bunch the first time I used it. It’s quite liquidy so it got a little messy. I was much more prepared each time after that :) Great base hydration!
