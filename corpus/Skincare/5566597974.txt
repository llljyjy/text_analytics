I received this as a #freeproduct. I only received enough to use for about a week so I can’t comment on its effectiveness. I used this serum only during the day. I liked the consistency of it and doesn’t have a smell. It didn’t leave my face feeling sticky like other serums. It paired really well with the Smart Clinical Repair™ Wrinkle Correcting Cream. Nice Serum
