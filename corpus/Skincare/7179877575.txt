Let me tell you I was a bit skeptical at first but this cream is amazing. My skin started feeling dry and textured so this night creme came at a perfect time. It’s easy to apply and was easy to fit into my night time routine. It has a light and natural scent that doesn’t bother me a lot all. It really hydrates and moisturizes my skin. My skin now looks and feels smoother. The price point is a little high but honestly it’s so worth it. ill definitely keep buying this product and do recommend it to others. I’m obsessed Love!
