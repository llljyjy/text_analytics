I wanted to love this because I love Glow Recipe, but contrary to its description, it does have a greasy feel to it. I noticed when I added this to my routine, I had an increase in comedones & cystic acne. I never experienced any pilling that others have claimed, however. It sat on top of my toner & serum nicely, and I was able to apply makeup on top of the sunscreen without any issues. Sadly Iâ€™ll be switching this out for another once I finish the bottle.
