Thanks to Inflenster I got this in the mail and gave it a try. I have been hooked with Tatcha lately and Tula is a great equivalent. The formula is rich, light baby powder/peach scent, and non greasy. It absorbs well on my skin too. I gave it 4/5 compared to Tatcha since Tatcha has better container appeal hihi nan
