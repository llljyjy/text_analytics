I have previously used this product a few years ago when I had acne that would not go away for years! This was my saving grace and my skin was very soft, but I switched cleansers as money was tight at the time and I was still young. This past year my skin has resorted back to its old ways with major breakouts and hyperpigmentation. This has cured my breakouts! It is gentle on the skin and has even helped my pores become smaller. I recommend 1000%. I use it twice a day and if I wear makeup I double cleanse with it after. My face has never felt this clean! Worth the Price!
