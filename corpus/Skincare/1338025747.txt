Pills up under every moisturizer I tried. Same with foundation.  I guess better for only night use? Even then the results were nonexistent. My skin actually got worse, but that’s probably cause I stopped using my previous product that had it under control. I also wish I could get past the smell… it smells like a childrens chapstick or candy. Artificial and way too sweet. I hope it works for others but it’s a no from me dawg. Just a waste
