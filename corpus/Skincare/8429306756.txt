I received the New Clinique Take The Day Off Charcoal Cleansing Balm complimentary from BzzAgent and Clinique in exchange for my honest review. This Charcoal Cleansing Balm is amazing!! I absolutely love it! It starts as a Balm but as soon as you start to massage it onto skin it turns into a silky oil! It removed all of my makeup, including waterproof mascara! It also removed any dirt, debris and excess oil from my skin! The Charcoal Cleansing Balm did not dry out my skin, it did the opposite, my skin felt really clean and silky soft! It does not leave any residue feeling after rinsing it off. I love that this product is fragrance free, Dermatologist Tested and safe for all skin types, including Sensitive Skin and Acne-Prone skin! Charcoal products are amazing for your skin, Charcoal draws out excess oil and other impurities from your pores...my pores feel and look clean and clear! I can’t recommend this product enough!! It’s amazing!! If you haven’t tried it, you need to!Thank you BzzAgent and Clinique! Love it!! (Not because it was gifted!)
