I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. First thoughts were simple, functional packaging. The actual product is a light lavender but of course applies clear.This cream has a different texture than I expected. It’s a thicker cream in the jar. Great for hydration. It applies very light weight though and absorbs quickly into the skin. It’s a wonderful eye cream so far. I’m always cautious when trying a new product near my eyes but this was perfectly fine! No adverse reactions at all. I’m happy I got to try this out! nan
