I’d give it a 3.5. I have dry skin, this is oily at first but sets with time. I have no problems with it under make-up from sheer to full-coverage. I have no problems with the performance. I like it but don’t love it. But, given other sunscreens out there, I would repurchase. Just not top of the list to repurchase. My important points are:1) It says it’s a 2oz bottle but the bottle says 1.6 oz. Which one is it?2) Strong fragrance. My eyes are sensitive to the fragrance of sunscreens and makes them burn. I became worried when I smelled this because the scent is pretty strong. However, although it is a strong fragrance, it doesn’t bother my eyes like other brands do. And the scent dissipates, unlike others. So, although it does have a fragrance, it didn’t bother my eyes. Note, I don’t actually use this on the undereye and lid, I only use mineral sunscreen for that. But the scent of other sunscreens can really bother my eyes throughout the day and this one didn’t.3) As stated, I have dry skin. So I actually appreciate the oiliness of the product. It isn’t oily, it hard to describe. It’s silicone/oily/emollient. My dry skin appreciates it very much. However, I am not sure how people with oily skin or in humid locations would like this. nan
