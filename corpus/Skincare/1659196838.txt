I received this as a free sample from influenster. I have used clinic for years so I was very excited to try this.  It is a great moisturizer for sure. This isn’t greasy and goes on easy.  I can also put make up on over it no problem. I used this for about 3 weeks.  I don’t feel it did much for lines and wrinkles. If you want just a great moisturizer this would be great but not sure it will help if you need something for wrinkles Great moisturizer not so much on wrinkles
