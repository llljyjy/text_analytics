I received this product complimentary for testing. This serum does a good job at evening my skin tone and brightening it and leaves a Dewey after glow which I enjoy. It has a mild sunscreen smell which doesn’t bother me. Make sure to shake before applying and to pat, not rub the serum to avoid pilling. The only thing I don’t like is that this is a mineral SPF, so it sits on top of your skin, so you will need to make sure to wash your face at night. Overall, I think it did a good job at brightening and evening my skin while protecting it from the sun. Do wish there was more of a tint of color to this tho Great product.
