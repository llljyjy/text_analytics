I received this serum as a free product through Influenster. After using it I’m 100% convinced that I will be buying the serum and the cream together to use as part of my daily facial routine. I use it every night and morning and my face feels like it’s been recharged. It’s smooth and it looks great. I was skeptical because I usually breakout with facial products but the serum and cream have worked well for me. The smell of the cream is even nice. I love it. I highly recommend both the serum and cream. Worth it!
