This product definitely exceeded my expectations. I have combination skin (mostly oily) and this didn’t dry my skin out nor did it make it feel greasy afterwards. It’s done an amazing job at buffing away all the dead skin on my face and it leaves my face feeling so soft and nourished afterwards. I haven’t tried a probiotic skincare product before, so I’m not sure on how much this works in that area, but it’s something I will definitely be adding into my regular skincare routine! Definitely would recommend this product! Amazing exfoliant!
