This is the best sunscreen I have ever used. I am on my third refill and I can’t get enough. It’s so light and leaves no white cast (I have light to medium skin). I recommended it to a friend with a darker skin tone and she LOVES it! If there is any product from Sephora that I recommend, it is this one by far. It is so lightweight and extremely hydrating, not to mention it is one more the more affordable sunscreens. If you’re scrolling through the reviews trying to figure out whether or not to buy it, this is your sign to get it!! Heaven in a tube!
