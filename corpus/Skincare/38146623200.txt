I received a complimentary jar of Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream from Clinique and Influenster in return for my honest opinion. I did not really like this product. I put a small amount on my jaw near my ear and hairline. It made my skin itch and develop little sores. I definitely would NOT use it on sensitive skin. The product smelled horrible! My husband did not like the smell either. However, this product did make an awesome foot cream! #CliniqueSmart #complimentary #gotitforfree Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting
