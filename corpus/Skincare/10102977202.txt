I love the ultra calming line from Dermalogica. I have red, often inflamed from breakout prone skin and have noticed immediate results with the following skin care routine and products: 1. Pre-cleanse 2. Ultra Calming Cleanser 3. Daily Exfoliant (for extra support) 4. Toner Spray (absolutely love this step) 5. Ultra calming Serum 6. Ultra calming Gel Moisturizer It’s an expensive routine, but I am happy I made the investment! Plus the cleanser is great size for the cost. It’s my second time purchasing! great value and it works!
