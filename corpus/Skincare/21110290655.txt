This is by far the best lip mask I have ever tried. It leaves my lips smooth and hydrated and I can still feel it when I wake up in the morning. I used the Berry flavor in the past, but I quite enjoy the Gummy bear one this time around. I wouldnâ€™t say it smells like gummy bears exactly, maybe more like a grape candy, but I still enjoy it quite a lot. Best lip mask
