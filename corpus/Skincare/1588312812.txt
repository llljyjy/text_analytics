I have a very bad dark spots on my face and I have been trying so many different well known brands and none of them have ever worked so far.I have now been using this serum for 4 weeks on a daily basis, morning and evening, and it is really noticeable the improvement on my skin. Especially the appearance on my dark spots. Even though my dark spots not disappeared but I can see that they are slightly lighter and brighter.The three chambers pumps work and blend very well, easy to use, the texture so smooth although it does leave a bit greasy feeling on my skin but it dries fast.I also notice this serum helps reduce my fine line wrinkles as it helps to moisturize and tighten my skin. I will definitely add this in my skincare routine and definitely will buy another bottle once this one finish because itâ€™s worth it for the price you pay. Triple Serum
