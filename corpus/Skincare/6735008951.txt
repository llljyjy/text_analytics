this product broke after just over a month of having it. the top seam is clearly defective and randomly leaks everywhere.. neither summer fridays or sephora offered any help for their defective product :( i loved this brand and used tons of their products but iâ€™m not supporting it anymore.what a joke.. high end product that breaks immediately?? so sad ugh. save your money guys!! there is way better products and customer service out there so cheap.. breaks immediately. waste of product
