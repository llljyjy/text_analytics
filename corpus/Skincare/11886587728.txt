This might be my favorite sunscreen ever. I have oily skin and most sunscreens leave my face feeling greasy but not this one. Has a nice light hydration and does well under makeup. I have light skin but from what I can tell this doesnâ€™t leave a white cast. Pretty affordable and does the job. Will definitely purchase again. favorite sunscreen
