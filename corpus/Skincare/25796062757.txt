My skin tends to get quite dry in the winter to the point where some areas on my face were peeling. Since my skin is quite sensitive it’s sometimes difficult to find a product that doesn’t irritate my skin. When I started using this product in my everyday routine I felt and saw my skin improving. My dry spots went away and my skin feels smoother. I’ve been using this toner for a little over a month now. This toner is definitely something I will keep buying! I LOVE IT!
