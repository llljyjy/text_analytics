I have very sensitive, reactive skin and it is nearly impossible to find sunscreen that will not break me out. What makes it worse it that I am combination- oily in the t-zone and dry around the mouth, so most sunscreens tend to make me an oil slick rather quickly. I was nervous to try this, especially since it is supposed to be glowy and fragrances but let me tell you… this is a game changer for me. I use this as my daytime moisturizer (I add moisturizer on my dry areas after applying this) and it is an amazing base for my makeup, doesn’t break me out and gives me a beautiful glow without making me oily. The best sunscreen ever
