I honestly look forward to using this cleanser. It feels so good *because* it’s applied to a dry face. I apply it in circular motions all over my face until it loosens up and becomes nice and warm and more oily instead of the cream-like consistency that comes out of the tube. I often go back for more than I originally dispensed to get my face and neck completely covered. I love getting into every nook and cranny as it becomes so spreadable and like you’re giving yourself a massage. This is my first step in a double cleanse routine that I follow up with a water based cleanser. Give it a chance! Especially if you have dry or combo skin. feels like self care to use
