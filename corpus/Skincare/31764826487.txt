Ugh I’m so disappointed. The reviews I read gave me hope. I have oily skin and larger pores so this new “dewy” skin trend makes it hard to find matte SPF’s. My skin is also REALLY sensitive and this stung my skin. I tried it a few times, bothered me every time and it is NOT mattifying. Def a miss for me and will be returning :( beware if you’re sensitive!
