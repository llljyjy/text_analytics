My favorite thing about this mask is that is not messy at all.  Non sticky or greasy feeling.  Easy to apply and to remove.  It did its work perfectly.  I felt a fresh feeling and kind of minty sensation that I did liked.  The texture was good and felt comfortable on my face.  I do have constant build up on my nose and fore head.  After applying and removing the Dr. Hart mud mask, my face looks brighter and cleaned.  My pores looked even smaller which was excellent for me.  The mask attaches to the face very easily and stays in its place all the time.  My skin also felt smoother and improved.  Another great feature is that contains sea salt that exfoliate my skin and removed impurities and dead skin.  I really loved it and I do recommend buying!!! Great Mask!
