This was a pretty good moisturizer for my oily skin. I only gave this product four starts because I don’t think I will be as effective when the weather is warmer outside. I applied this product twice a day for about a month. In the beginning I had a few blemishes that showed up but I have been clear for the last few weeks. I love the scent. It’s light and goes away shortly after application. Good
