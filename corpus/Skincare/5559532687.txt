we all hate the price but getting a trial size i gooootta say it’s unlike anything ive personally ever tried. it’s intergalactic velevt texture that like absorbs into your face with a finish i wish literally every product from skincare to makeup that i own would do. the price is so brutal bc it keeps so many from trying this amazing stuff in the worst elitist way possible but idk its for sure epic, i cant hate like i can't. even. it's otherworldly imo
