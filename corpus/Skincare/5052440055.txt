This is a great sunscreen to wear under make up. It feels luxurious, the texture is silky smooth, and I like the fact that it has a really high SPF. My only concern is that for me it left a whitish film on my skin, kind of washing me out, so if that’s something that you don’t want, I do not recommend this product. Other than that, it’s great! I received this product free in exchange for my honest review from Influenster and Shiseido. Great sunscreen under makeup for oily/combo skin
