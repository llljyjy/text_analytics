I recieved a sample size product from Infuenster for my honest review. I have a combinational skin which tend be on more drier side during change of weather period. Spring and fall being those two. The cream, bit on thicker side like nivea, is very easy to apply. There is no scent which i actually like. My skin is also very sensitive but i was comfortable with this one. Not sure about 100 hrs though because that means not needing to apply the cream for at least 4 days and i needed to apply. Overall, its does the job and would buy one. Great for combinational skin
