I was previously using PTR vitamin c moisturizer but am in search of a simple moisturizer I could pair with Retin A. This product was not moisturizing but left a sticky film on the skin. Iâ€™m prone to sebaceous filaments and this really made that so much worst :( I wanted to love this but it just left me dry with a bumpy nose. I switched back to my old moisturizer after finishing the travel size and my skin immediately bounced back. might work if you have oily skin.
