I received a free sample of this serum to try in exchange for my honest opinion. I had enough in the sample to use for a couple of nights only, but loved the texture and how it felt on my skin. It felt luxurious, but unfortunately, did not have enough for prolonged use to evaluate the effects:) #freeproduct Free sample
