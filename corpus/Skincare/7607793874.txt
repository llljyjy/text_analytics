My usual combination skin became predominantly dry after my recent pregnancy and the cold winter. Aside from my night moisture mask, this has since become my staple. Found the cleanser to be ultra hydrating, and the moisturizer to be just thick enough to not need a serum underneath. The mask is a nice extra but the other two products were my game changers Great rich quality
