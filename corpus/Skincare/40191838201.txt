I have acne prone/sensitive skin. I don’t wear makeup, but I bought this product because I read that double cleansing can be beneficial. Anyway, I used this balm daily at night and it made me break out. I don’t use this daily anymore. Now, I just use it as a face mask/body wash when my skin is dry cause I don’t want this to be a complete waste of money. Definitely wouldn’t buy this again but it is not terrible. Not for my acne prone skin
