A new spin on serum - spray serum! Kosas Plump & Juicy Spray-On Serum is a unique vegan spray full of collagen, peptides, and plant-based probiotics. This is an oil-free hydrating, anti-aging serum safe for most skin types, including sensitive skin. The glass bottle is gorgeous and makes a statement on my product shelf. Kosas Plump & Juicy Spray-On Serum has a light floral scent and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and plump. Over my 20-plus years as a medical esthetician, this would be the first spray serum that I have reviewed and I am here for it. Applying the spray serum can be tricky if you have false lashes on this would be my only con. I recommend spraying the serum on a cotton round to apply near the lash area. I also went a few steps further and sprayed this serum on my neck and decollete......AND...drumroll...I LOVED to apply a tiny bit on top of my make A new staple!
