I really enjoyed these travel size bars. They really help to even out my skin tone and does not cause me to dry out. They definitely do what they say and I’m looking forward to using these bars more often. I should also mention that these are very compact and easy to pack away if you if you do a lot of traveling plus they don’t leak like liquid soaps do. Drunk Elephant Bar Duo
