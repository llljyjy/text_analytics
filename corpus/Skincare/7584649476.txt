This is one of the best sunscreens that I have ever used. It is such a light weight formula, its not sticky. In addition it didn’t make my face feel greasy. The best part about it was it didn’t leave a white cast on my face which most sunscreens do. It gives your skin such a beautiful glow and your skin feels and looks youthful. This sunscreen has such a nice scent but it’s not overpowering. I have extremely sensitive acne prone skin and anything that has any sort of scent breaks me out. This one is extremely minimal barely there.  I’ve been using it for a couple days now and my skin has not broken out.  So I am so pleased with its performance and it’s SPF 50 so it’s the perfect amount of sun protection. I love Glow Recipe products and every Glow Recipe product that I’ve tried has never disappointed me!!  I would definitely recommend this to everyone. THE BEST SUNSCREEN!
