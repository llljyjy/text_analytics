After using this product for the last few weeks I have noticed a dramatic difference in my skin. Not only in the clarity but also in the evenness of my skin tone. Before I used to have some dark spots and they are virtually gone! The smell is very faint and not too over powering. It also doesnâ€™t make my skin feel overly greasy after applying it! The packing is very sleek and high end. However, the price tag is not! This is a very affordable alternative that works just as well as some very expensive high end products. I would definitely purchase this product again!  This product does have longevity and a little goes a long way! Overall, I would highly recommend this product to my friends and family. I did received this as apart of a free sample program A new staple in my routine
