This is a very lightweight product which I really appreciate ~ many neck creams are very thick and are sticky, making them impossible to work with for daytime use. With NÉCESSAIRE neck serum, there is no greasy or tacky residue, just pure hydration ~ my neck feels smooth, soft & supple.  Peptides add to the hydration and bring anti-aging benefits.  I haven’t seen any “lift“ with this serum, but my neck wrinkles are less noticeable great non-sticky, long lasting hydration
