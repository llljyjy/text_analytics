Easy application , smooth texture, doesn’t require a lot and as you work it into your skin it “melts” into a smooth balm. I was concerned about using it in my eye area but did not have any issues whatsoever. It came off with one pass of a warm cloth and all of the makeup was gone! My skin felt clean, soft and moisturized! Definitely adding this to my routine! Does the Dirty Work!
