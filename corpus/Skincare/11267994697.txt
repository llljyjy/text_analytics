This cream is amazing. I received it free from Topbox to review. They recommend that you use it in the morning and evening, but I only use it in the evening. It provides complete hydration to your skin. It’s thick, a little goes a long way, and it smells so good. The scent is like red roses and it’s very light. I love a good moisturizer and this one is my new favorite. Smooth vibes
