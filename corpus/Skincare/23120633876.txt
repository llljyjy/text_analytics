Received the mini jar on my birthday and was in awe with the formula. A little goes a long way for my dry skin. Got the value (full) size during the sale and was so disappointed with the consistency. I feel like the one from the mini jar feels more balmy and absorbent, it leaves my skin smooth and plump without any shininess. The full size leaves my skin greasy, feels that the product just lingers around on my skin longer before it ’disappears’’ Five stars for the mini jar, not the full size
