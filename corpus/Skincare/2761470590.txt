I purchased this through recommendation of Caroline Hirons, skincare goddess. This does not strip my oily/combo skin, instead it leaves it adequately moisturized and balanced. It definitely adds a level of moisture that my skin lacked. It also cleanses well! This is the perfect morning cleanser or second cleanse in the evening. I enjoy using this most of all, it feels rich, dreamy, and luxurious! Highly recommend. gentle, moisturizing, rich!
