I received this mask from Influenster for testing purposes and I honestly had low expectations considering it was just a face mask. But after using it, I ended up loving it! It was broken up until 2 pieces instead of one, to fit your face properly and once it was on my face, it didnâ€™t move once! Normally I have to constantly adjust it, just this one stayed on my face so I felt like I could actually move around with it on. It also dried down, which never happened with any other sheet mask I tested out and you can see the difference in your face after taking it off. My face was so smooth and there was a noticeable difference with my blackheads. I would definitely repurchase it and again! the best face mask I ever used!!
