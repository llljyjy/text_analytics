I purchased this line as I tried the starter kit in January 2022 while on vacy in Hawaii worked wonderful. I replenished the line in April 2022 and started using this sunscreen. It is thick like body screen and is seriously pore clogging. I used it for 3-4 weeks and it made my Acne issue so much worse!!!! I tried it under my moisturizer(this lines water-based Moisturizer), I tried it over the moisturizer and without. Nothing helped. Discontinued using it and the breakout reduced significantly!!!! This line period not great at all!!! Northeastern 40 yo woman with medium skin tone Absolutely the WORST sunscreen Iâ€™ve ever used!!!!
