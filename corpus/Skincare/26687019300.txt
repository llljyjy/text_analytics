This cleanser must’ve been made for my specific skin type. I have fair, clear skin with the occasional blemish, just turned 40 and have light rosacea on my cheeks. I  am starting to get very fine lines around my eyes. I sometimes have issues with dryness, but it’s sporadic depending on humidity levels. I’ve tried other Zenovia products and didn’t like them at all, including the hormonal acne line. This cleanser is up there with Indie Lee and Philosophy for me (those are my current favorites) it’s super hydrating, cleansing, non irritating, gentle, creamy, non scented, it’s all I love in a cleanser and more. Easily wipes away makeup. Highly recommended. Love this cleanser!
