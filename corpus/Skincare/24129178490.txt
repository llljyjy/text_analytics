I purchased this sunscreen in hopes of finding a good daily moisturizer with spf for my extremely dry skin. I ended up absolutely falling in love with this product. It has a pudding-like consistency in the jar, which is interesting and slightly cooling on the skin. A very little goes a long way, leaving the skin looking dewy and refreshed in the mornings. I wouldn’t recommend this product to someone with dry skin. It’s really moisturizing and can leave those with already oily skin looking greasy. in love!
