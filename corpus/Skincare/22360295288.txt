I recently got a chance to try their New Dermalogica circular hydration serum!     I have been using it for a few weeks and love it! It has a gently gel-like consistency. You need just pea-sized amount of serum to lightly cover your face and neck. It absorbs pretty quickly leaving skin refreshed, hydrated and plumped! I love its delightful scent that dissipates after application! I apply it in the morning and night after toning and before moisturizing and I really enjoy using it! Amazing serum!
