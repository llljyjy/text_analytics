Such an amazing year-round cleanser! Does an amazing job at removing sunscreen without stripping the skin. The formula is a little interesting but it gets the job done. I use one pump on damp skin. After 30 seconds, I re-wet my hands and continue to wash my face. I noticed a huge difference in my skin when using it like this. I think it helps with brightening the skin as well. Amazing Cleanser for Dry Acne Prone Skin.
