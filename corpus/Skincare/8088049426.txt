I received a free sample in exchange for my honest review. I really liked this product. It reminds me of a BB cream. When I received it, I thought the color would be too dark, but it was perfect when applied. The concept of having to shake it up before using was different and created an added step. Considering itâ€™s a powder with oils, it makes sense to shake and combine. I was very happy this has SPF included and 40, which is a good band. I really like that a little goes a long way. Just a few dots in key areas around my face provided great coverage and absorbed quickly, leaving my face moisturized with a nice glow and without being oily. Really like this one
