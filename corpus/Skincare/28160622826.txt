I love this serum! It’s not sticky, and very light on skin. It’s so easy to apply, a few drops goes a long way. There’s a tingling sensation on my first application, but didn’t bother me much. I didn’t experience any skin breakouts which I am glad! My skin feels soft and radiant, every morning as I wake up. I have a combination type of skin and my skin tends to get oily at noon time, so I only use it during night time before going to bed. After weeks of using, I noticed my skin is glowing, and hydrated. I’m happy with this product! @dermalogicacanada, @sephoracanada, #giftedbydermalogica nan
