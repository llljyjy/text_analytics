I really love this cleansing bar. It is not overly scented, yet has an amazing scent. It is not overly sudsy and does not become squishy upon immediate use. It is firm and I’ve gotten 5-10 uses and the bar is still in tact. I can tell I’ll have this for a while so it is definitely worth the price! I have no noticed any immediate changes to my skin other than smelling great hours after showering. Definitely a 10/10! 10/10!
