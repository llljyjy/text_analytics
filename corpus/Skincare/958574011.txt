I like this scar gel treatment so far. It really did help fade the temporary red scarring from my most recent hormonal breakout. Now I am using it on my old rolling scars to see if it will help with the texture. It’s too soon to tell, as it takes a bit to see improvements with scars like these, but I am optimistic! I really like Dr. Zenovia’s products since they are formulated by an actual dermatologist. Good!
