To start, I have fair, sensitive skin with purple veins/circles around my eyes. This product is very thick and creamy and absorbs well. I think it is definitely hydrating and temporarily brightening due to the light color but I didn’t see much of a difference is overall tone, texture, and fine lines. The scent is subtle, nothing overwhelming. I did not have a problem with irritation. I had high hopes for this product since the benefits are things I look for in an eye cream but I don’t think it is worth the price point. I’ve used this for two weeks but will continue to use to see if there’s any noticeable long-term effects. Packaging was also nice and sturdy. Just okay
