. I’ve been using this serum for a month and I am pleasantly surprised . The packaging is super convenient and allows you to get out the perfect amount of serum to apply to your skin. The scent is not overwhelming into me. It works just as well as my good genes serum. The only downside of course would be the price. ￼ A bee youthful experience !
