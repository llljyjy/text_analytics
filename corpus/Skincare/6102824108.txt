I received this product through Influenster and was extremely excited to try it out. The mist is super light weight and smells refreshing. I feel like I need a few pumps to spread across my face because not too much squirts out but once it’s on, it feels like heaven. I’ve noticed my makeup go on a lot better when I use this product to prep my skin. It makes my face glow and keeps my makeup on a lot longer! Gucci never disappoints! Lightweight Formula
