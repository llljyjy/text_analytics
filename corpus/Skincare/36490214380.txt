I have an issue the some minor sagging in my under eyes, so I’m always looking for something to help tighten things up. I’m also trying to cut down on my routine with something that has a little bit of everything. Decided to give this a try since it claims to “Tighten, Hydrate, and Brighten.“ The consistency is like a serum, and goes on nice and smooth. I didn’t notice any irritation, which is great since I have sensitive older skin. There is hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, and peptides in the serum - all ingredients that I love. I definetly noticed some tightening in my under eye areas - nothing earthshattering but better than before. I really enjoyed the experience and the ingredients are geared for more older women like myself i presume. I would recommend if you’re an older millennial. Love the tightening effect!
