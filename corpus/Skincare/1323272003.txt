I don’t often write reviews, but this is one of the best products I’ve found. I’ve been using this for about 3 years now, I’m on my 4th bottle. I’ve got medium skin and use the medium/dark oil. It does take a couple of tries to get used to it and find the correct number of drops to find the glow you’re looking for. I’ve never had any streaks or blotchiness. I apply it right after I shower with an unscented lotion, and I never have any lingering smell. Love this stuff!
