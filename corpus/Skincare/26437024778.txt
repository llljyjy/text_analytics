So I have combination skin which is really annoying sometimes it’s dry sometimes it’s oily and sometimes it’s both in different places. I really wanted to like this serum especially given the price point, but it just made my skin feel really greasy. And not the good kind of greasy, like it didn’t really absorb well and although it made my makeup go on smoothly I feel like it melted off later on. Some oily products absorb well and then it doesn’t matter anymore but this one was not for me. I guess it would have to be a night time serum for sure but I didn’t see enough results to really want to work that hard with it. I get impatient quickly but who knows maybe it’s the best if you stick with it :) Too oily for me
