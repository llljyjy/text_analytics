I rarely write reviews but I feel I have to for this product! This is the smoothest self tanner I have ever used. It’s so easy to apply, it’s easy to tell where you applied, and waiting only the few hours instead of sleeping in it (and ruining my sheets) is way easier for me. If you want to get even darker, wait for it to get fairly dry and do a second coat. I do my body and then another coat on my stomach at the end. I just exfoliate the day before and make sure I’m completely dry when I apply. I don’t necessarily apply right after the shower either - sometimes in the middle of the day, as long as I exfoliated before. The color develops really nicely and looks like I got a professional spray tan. best ever
