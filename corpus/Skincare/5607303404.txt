I LOVE love the original aqua bomb and I have always wanted to try this vitamin C cream. I felt like this formula is just as good as the original. It’s light and refreshing with a subtle citrusy scent. This cream is packed with vitamin E & C with well known Lady’s Mantle herb that’s in their original formula. I would describe this cream as a gel-cream that doesn’t feel tacky. I love these types of formulas during the summer months. I haven’t seen a dramatic difference in my dark spots, but I have seen improvement of skin texture. My skin looks quite radiant in my opinion after using this. This was only a small sample that I have tried but it worked well on my combo acne prone skin! A bit pricey but I like it
