Obsessed with this cream! Every time I run out I tell myself I won’t buy it again (because the price is ridiculous), but other face creams don’t even compare. This cream is sooooo hydrating and makes my skin feel plump, clean and glowing. It is thick but feels luxurious and actually absorbs quickly; it doesn’t leave a greasy feeling or residue. I’d love to see environmentally friendly refill options for this. Obsessed!
