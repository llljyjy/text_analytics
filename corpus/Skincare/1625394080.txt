I’ve had my Canopy humidifier for over a year & so glad to see it available at Sephora! It has been a game changer for my skin, (it’s very dry to combo depending on the season) as well as helping soothe my sinuses & husky morning voice.  I hadn’t used a humidifier since I was a kid, but felt confident to try it because of the anti-mold features - because eek ew mold.  The aromatherapy discs give my bedroom a relaxing swanky spa vibe (goals). highly recommend this (very pretty) upgrade
