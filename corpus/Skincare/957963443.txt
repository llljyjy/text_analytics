I bought this a few times and didn’t make full connection that this cleanser made me break out when I normally don’t.  I would make excuses thinking it’s probably my period coming or I ate too much junk etc, but now I tell every time after I use it, while it did clean it, it also cause me to have much more breakout.  I’m not sure which part of the cleanser is doing this but it didn’t work with my combo/oily skin and it took me a while to figure it out but I’m pretty sure now. Made my combo/oily skin break out much more.
