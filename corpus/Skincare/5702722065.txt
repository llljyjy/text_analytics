I really love the texture of this cleansing balm. I used the original to take off my makeup and loved it. This one seems to be another bonus layer to this cleansing balm. The product is similar texture to the original buttery formula. Warning, your face will totally be black but you have to trust the process. I found that after scooping out the product with my fingers, it is easier to work with after warming it up in your hands first. I have lashes so I prefer to use a warm wash cloth to take the “day” off my face- I do this several times to make sure the product comes off. Overall my face felt nice and clean and it got the job done. I love that my skin felt clean and didn’t feel drying like other soap cleansers Ive used in the past.If you wear makeup and sunscreen on the daily, I would highly recommend this product as an addition to your skin care routine! Feels like butter!
