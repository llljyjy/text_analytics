This was recommended to me at an Innisfree store in Seoul while I was living there. Iâ€™ve been using it since the entire Bija line came out, starting with their famous bija masks. The store employee who had been helping me find products for my very dry skin suffering with the Korean water and climate for a few years. She recommended this in tandem with the Bija toner saying this would help with my hormonal/environmental based breakouts at the time. She was right and I have been using it in tandem with the Bija facial toner since 2015. I stocked up before moving back to Canada and did everything to get my hands on it until FINALLY it became available here!This is my GO TO cleanser. When I ran out of it after moving back, and before it became easily available at Sephora my skin visibly suffered, becoming dull, dry and I experienced breakouts again.  It leaves my skin feeling very clean after. It does have an almost tea tree or minty like fragrance which I love in the morning, but not everyone will enjoy. Minty Tea Tree Smell I love in the morning
