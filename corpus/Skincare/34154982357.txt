This is a great product that I am enjoying using.  I have only been using it for about a week, every other day, so I am still waiting to see any drastic changes to the dark spots on my face and chest that I have been using it on. There does seem to be some changes but still feel like I need more time to really see the effects. The product is vegan and Clean at Sephora which is great if you are looking for products that fit into that. Our skin takes on a lot of damage over the years and as I age I realize the importance of having products that can help aid in repairing the damage that has been done. The serum is lightweight and the drop applicator is easy to use. Good Vegan product that helps with dark spots!
