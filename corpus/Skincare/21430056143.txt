Such a great cleanser! I’ve replaced my previously face cleansers with this and I won’t go back! Love that it’s soap free. My skin looks and feels great since I’ve started using this the last few weeks. I will say it does leave my skin feeling a bit tight and dry afterwards, but it keeps my skin clear and looking great. I found that I can now use my thicker face cream without being oily or breaking out afterward when using this face wash, which is great because my skin definitely needed extra hydration with our fluctuating weather. Skin feels so clean!
