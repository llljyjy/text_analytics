I LOVE this vitamin C serum with turmeric. It goes on more like a lotion, but it’s brightening and calming and I like that is smells natural instead of perfumed.  That being said, they need to hire a packaging engineer… (or if they already have one; maybe find a better one?) The bottle design means you lose 20-25% of the product because it is stuck to the sides and won’t pump out. A couple ideas for them:1.) Deeper slope in the bottom of the bottle so the creamy mixture moves downward and can be pumped out instead of gathering at the sides.  There is plenty of dead space at the bottom of this bottle for them to improve the slope.2.) Make the bottle bigger and thin the formula out a little so it flows better— e.g. go up to 1.2 ounces and add .2 ounces of something less viscous. 3.) Use a tube or something that is gravity fed and we can squeeze to get product out. Higher end skincare is already expensive (this formula is wonderful; but you’re spending $70 for .75 ounces of useable product).  It’s sad that so much of the product is wasted because no one thought about the bottle/usage.  Super lazy design. Amazing product, terrible bottle design.
