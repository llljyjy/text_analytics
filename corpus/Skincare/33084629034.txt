This soothing cream is on another level! I am a first time user and I was amazed by how little I need to cover my face! It is silky smooth and not too oily. It hydrates my face wonderfully and it is so light! The smell is also light and clean, not overly powerful like a lot of others. I love that they are using pods as an easy and sustainable  way to refill the bottle creating less waste! Definitely something I will be recommending to others. Love it! A little goes a long way!
