I got this exactly 1 month ago. I went down a tiktok rabbit hole about skin care, wondering if there would ever be a way to minimize the look of my pores/black heads on my nose & chin. Full disclosure: when I started using this 2x daily, I also started a morning routine of Sunday Riley CEO Glow face oil and a night routine alternating Sunday Riley Good Genes & Inkey List Retinol serum. My skin is the best itâ€™s ever looked, but of all that, I think the Biossance toner is really contributing the most to making me love how my skin looks. Also not sure if this is disclosed in the product info, but the bottle is glass for anyone who may care. nan
