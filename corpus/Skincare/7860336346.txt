Context: I’m an oily girl!!! I’m always a bit hesitant with adding skin products to my face routine bc typically- the more products I add, the more oily I get. HOWEVER- I love this stuff. I put it on after I wash my face and before I add myMoisturizer and sunscreen. A tiny drop goes a long way for my oily face which means this bottle will last me awhile. My skin feels smoother and looks glowy. I also do think my pores appear smaller. Love it!
