I was really looking forward to trying this product. The texture is good but I hate that it has that god awful Ph activated neon pink colour. When I wear lip balm without makeup on (which is like 95% of the time) I don’t want my lips to look like a child smeared their mom’s lipstick on their face. Just why??? Why does it turn neon pink on my lips??
