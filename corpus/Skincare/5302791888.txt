I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This was up against another long-standing moisture surge cream that I have been using and ultimately, the original one just won out. After using this Dior balm for a few days I woke up with a dry, flaky red patch on my cheek which was something I was able to avoid all winter prior to switching from my old product to this new one. This may have been a coincidence, hence the 3 stars, but ultimately I would not buy this product again as I have another one that is just more effective. Donâ€™t love it
