I was very excited to try this Origins PLANTSCRIPTION™ Multi-Powered Youth Serum. I like the bottle design and, it’s very easy to dispense the product. My skin type is oily, and I used this serum as a part of my nighttime skincare routine. I felt the difference after just 1 use. It definitely made my skin more smooth, soft, and less textured. Once applied, it absorbs fast, and doesn’t leave any sticky feeling. It provides a good amount of  hydration as well. So far, I’m really loving this serum! Great!
