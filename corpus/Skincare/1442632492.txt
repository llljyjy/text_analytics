I’m unsure if I am seeing any benefits from this product. It does smell lovely and not strong. It feels great on my eyes morning and night. One pump goes a long way which makes me feel like this bottle will last. Overall, nice to add to the routine but I can’t sing it’s praises yet. Nice, but is it working?
