This product did not work for me. I recently changed my skin care regime and added this. I wasnâ€™t seeing any good results but I did some digging and found that this product contains Laureth-4 which is a pore clogging chemical. To test my theory that this was the issue, I did everything the same except I used this product on only one cheek. Within days, I noticed the cheek I was using it on was not getting any better, while the other side and my forehead was starting to look noticeably clearer. I would return this if I could but I will likely just toss it. Waste of money for me and I will not be buying again. (Side with daith piercing was the side I used this product on) Does not work
