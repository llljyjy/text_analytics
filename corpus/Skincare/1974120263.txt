I’ll start by saying that this is a great product that does what it advertises. There is no scent, the formula is creamy and spreads very nicely on the face. I felt like I could’ve sat there rubbing it into my skin forever. It did dry down just a bit, but not enough to make my face feel tight or make the mask start cracking. It was a standard rinse off where it took more than one go around for me at least to get it all removed, but it wasn’t difficult by any means. It left my face feeling soft, refreshed and clean. I would recommend this to anyone, but also believe that there are more price efficient options that can provide the same results if you are on a budget. nan
