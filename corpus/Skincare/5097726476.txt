I have been using this retinol for a few weeks starting off slow and then actually incorporating the brands lactic acid serum on my nights where I’m not using this retinol. And I have to say my skin has had zero irritation (when you use it correctly) and my skin is definitely smooth and very even. I notice the texture of my skin is much different especially when I put a full face of makeup on the next day. Definitely recommend this retinol if you’re looking for something non-irritating but gets the job done! nan
