I received this product complimentary, and at the right time too. I was just looking for a new sunscreen and had my eyes on this one because i love FAB. It’s lightweight and feels like an extra layer of protection on the skin. I have a combination skin type, more on the oily side, and this sunscreen gave me no problems. I also have sensitive skin and this sunscreen clearly labels that it is safe for sensitive skin, which it is. I’ll definitely be purchasing it when I run out. must get!!
