I love this cream so far. It’s very thick and a little goes a long way. I love that it’s thick because I have dry skin..and it absorbs really well too. The scent was kind of strange at first, but honestly love it how. It doesn’t have fragrance so it smells more natural and “weird” I guess. If you’re picky about smells do not get it, :) nan
