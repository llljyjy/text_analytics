Iâ€™ve thoroughly enjoyed using this moisturizer. It is lightweight but provides amazing moisture while giving a mattifying effect. I have dry cleaning, combination skin and this has been great to use in the summer because it provides needed moisture to the dry areas while keeping oil at bay. It absorbs quickly and there is no scent. I love the sleek, aluminum container which looks great on my vanity. I will purchase this when I run out and would definitely recommend.
