Little did I know, this item has Moringa!! To start off, I’m a huge superfood nerd. I didn’t know this item has moringa when I first started using it. Since I have a combination skin, I tend to not put facial cream on my t-zone unless it’s gel or serum. Nevertheless, the result of this facial cream on my cheeks was phenomenal… my skin feels so plump and the cream gave this instant glow. I love how it wasn’t oily, but instead it left my skin velvety soft. Once I found out it has moringa, I applied it on my entire face. I love how it hydrates my skin without being greasy. And it didn’t break me out either! I had a love-hate relationship with facial cream, but this is now my go-to facial cream. Definitely a superfood your skin loves. It’s definitely a superfood your skin loves
