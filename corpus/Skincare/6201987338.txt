This shape is so brilliant. It will not break like other rollers because it’s a solid piece. It’s ridge and dual sides all serve different functions, so it’s versatile. You can thoughtlessly do lymphatic drainage while watching a movie, you can massage around the eye to soothe sinus pressure, pop in the fridge overnight to de puff with in the morning! Love love love! Magical
