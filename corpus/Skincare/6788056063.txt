I love this Charlotte Tilbury Magic Eye Rescue Cream.  It is very moisturizing and effective.  You donâ€™t need to use much to feel long lasting moisturizing effects.  It also seems to have lightened the bags around my eyes.  It has a very smooth, thicker texture.  A real treat to apply.  Definitely recommend if you can fit a luxury eye cream into your budget. Effective!
