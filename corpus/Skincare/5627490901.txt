This stuff is fine if you don’t want to put anything on top (i.e. makeup). In fact, it’s probably pretty good if you don’t want to layer -- I’m an oily girl and I really don’t get shiny with this stuff on, which is impressive considering it has such high spf. It’s mildly irritating to my sensitive skin, but not enough to be a dealbreaker for me, and I’ve found that to be the case for most sunscreens over 30 spf. I don’t notice irritation every time I put it on. If you want to put on makeup over this though, gooooooood luck. None of my holy grail foundations (with primers!) or even powders went on evenly or nicely or looked good. So, I’d recommend thinking about how you plan to wear this before purchasing. I bought two when they were on sale and I exchanged one of them for the similar Murad 30 spf product, which doesn’t have a mattifier in it so my makeup looks great over it. I plan to use this one for no-makeup days only. Not good for layering/makeup
