Beautiful packaging. It has a pleasant smell that does not linger after application. The scent reminds me of faint watermelon. I used this while in Bali and the air was humid. It applies thick but evenly. I found it velvety and non sticky. It gave my skin a glowing texture. If this product had completely clean ingredients, I would purchase. I received this product in exchange of a review. Velvety
