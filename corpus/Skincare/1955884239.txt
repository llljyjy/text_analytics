This is the one. No more to say! ...but I will, because that alone wouldn’t have sold me lol. I am absolutely in love with the way this makes my lips look and feel! I have soft, non-peeling, supple, and hydrated lips all day long. The consistency is utter perfection. It’s not sticky...it kind of melts when you touch it, like coconut oil, but slightly thicker. If you’ve ever tried lanolips, it’s similar, just not as thick. The smell is very light. Like you’re back sugar cookies, but at a distance. Simply delicious lips. Cay Skin has done it right. Seriously, you can stop looking right here. Let them take your money!! Search is OVER!
