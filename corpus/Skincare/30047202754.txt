Estee Lauder has been a staple in my collection since I started with make up and skin care. Ive been using this product for approx two weeks now and I love it!! It goes on smooth and silky, like satin. Just melts into your skin.  Its fragrance free and Iâ€™m into that! I tend to have combination skin in certain parts and this moisturizer is delicately keeping the dry patches moisturized. And the only patches in control. I will definitely continue this product as part of my daily routine! Two thumbs up, and 5 stars My new must have!!
