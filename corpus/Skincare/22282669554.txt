Upon receiving this product I really loved the vibe that the bright orange packaging gave off. The packaging and writing on the product is clean and simple but the colour is really eye catching. Thebottle itself is glass which speaks volumes to the quality of this brightening treatment. As soon as I took it out and he’d it it felt like a high quality skin care product. Upon use I was not disappointed in this product! It’s very watery and applies nicely to the skin. At first, it smelt like it would burn on my skin. I guess I just had an association with other similar smelling products. However, there was no burning sensation to be had with this product. After several weeks of use I have noticed my skin is brighter and looks better than before. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Great for combination skin!
