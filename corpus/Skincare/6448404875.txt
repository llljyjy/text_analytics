I received this as a free sample from Influencer Vox Box. I love the fact that it doesn’t leave a greasy residue. The cream is very light and airy wasn’t expecting that. I like the fact it has sunscreen in it too. I’ve only been using for a week skin feels less oily. Skin is no longer dry in my troubled patches. Love that it doesn’t have a smell either. Once putting on skin feels cooler. I will purchase once my free sample is finished. Estee Lauder Day Wear
