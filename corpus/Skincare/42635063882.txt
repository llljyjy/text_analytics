My skin hates sunscreen and so do my eyes.  Either my eyes tear nonstop, my skin turns warm and red, I break out in hives, or my face becomes so oily and shiny looking I could use it to grease a baking pan.  This is the first (and so far only) sunscreen that I have had 0 side effects from. Only sunscreen that had 0 side effects!
