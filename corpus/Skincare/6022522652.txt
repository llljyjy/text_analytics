I love this. It’s completely worth the money as you get such a large jar and only need a small amount. I have a fair complexion and deal with redness at times I love that I just put a small amount on and I can sleep in it and it doesn’t even feel like there’s anything on my face because it’s soaks in and in the morning I wake up with a glowing complexion that is not red anymore. I love every product from tatcha. This is a must have! best product for redness
