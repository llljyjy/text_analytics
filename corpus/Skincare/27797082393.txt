I used the entire bottle and it didn’t do much, if anything at all, to fade my acne scars. Also the dropper is really terrible. I ended up just pouring the serum into my hands to use it. I was a little disappointed because I was expecting more from a brand like FAB, one of my all time favorite skincare brands. Will have to pass on this one - there’s better niacinamide serums out there. nan
