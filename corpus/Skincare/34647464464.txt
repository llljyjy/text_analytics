This moisturizer is on the light side so I wouldn’t recommend it during harsh winters. However, it does give a dewy glow and the scent is quite subtle. However, it pills when I put my mineral sunscreen over it. It absorbs into my skin rather fast as well, and there’s a tight feeling on my skin when I wear it overnight. Overall, it only gives a light moisturizing --- the focus is more on the dewy glow. light and refreshing, not too moisturizing
