I really enjoyed Kiehlâ€™s Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution and found it very moisturizing. A tad too much for my chin area where I tend to break out. As much as I liked it, it did nothing to old dark spots. On the other hand I did notice a brighter complexion. Overall, I would buy again, just avoiding breakout areas. Very moisturizing
