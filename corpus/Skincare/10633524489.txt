One star off for the fact that this did nothing for my hyperpigmentation (new and old) after a month of use, twice a day. Two stars off for packaging design. Eadem is slick for how they constructed this bottle. It’s impossible to use the dropper to pick up the remaining product at the bottom of the bottle. I also purchased the moisturizer that came with the scooper. I thought to myself, “no worries, I’ll use the stick to scoop out the remaining Milk Marvel.“ Well I looked inside the bottle and Eadem unnecessarily added some plastic piece to the bottom of the opening rendering it impossible to use any tool to get any of the remaining product out. At least the product isn’t too thick; I can flip the bottle and painstakingly watch the serum make its way to the top. Not only is this a waste of my money, it’s a waste of product and resources and my time that I have to use trying to use up every bit of this $68 serum. nan
