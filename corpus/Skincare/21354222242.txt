This is my nighttime moisturizer, and I feel like it has remodeled my skin, like my face got new floors. It feels so smooth and hydrated all day long. I have normal skin and this isnâ€™t too much for me, but it feels like a more intense version of my day moisturizer, which is Clinique dramatically different moisturizer (also excellent). Surprised this has such mixed reviews, I highly recommend it. Fabulous Moisturizer
