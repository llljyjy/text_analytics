So good I ordered a 2nd jar! It works! You feel it working the first few days and after 2 months I was amazed at what it did to my 46 yr old skin that’s along volume with age - I’m not ready to do fillers so I told then I’ll stick with this cream! I have sensitive skin also and did not irritate.I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a lift. As you apply like it says start at the chin/base of neck and work product upward and I swear, my jawline and chin have lifted! A wow product! WOW just amazing
