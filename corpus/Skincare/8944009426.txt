Received this #freeproduct from TopBox for an honest review. I found this serum to be ok. Nothing special or exceptional as with other clinique products that I’ve used in the past. I used it for a week each night before bed and after the third night I noticed that my face had a break out. The texture is more on the liquid side but a little goes a long way on your skin. Not heavily scented which is a good thing. Overall I wouldn’t recommend this to family and friends and wouldn’t purchase it. Just OK
