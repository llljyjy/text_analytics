I have been using this toner for a few weeks, and it has transformed my skin so much! It has helped reduce my breakouts and it makes my skin so glowy! I have received a lot of compliments on my skin ever since I’ve started using it. My skin is oily and sensitive, but it becomes more oily if it’s not hydrated properly and this product is perfect for that. Never did I think a toner would have such an impact on my skin. A lot of products break me out but this one doesn’t. I’ve been using it every morning and night. In the morning, I just use this toner, the Isntree hyaluronic sungel. At night, I use this and Cerave moisturizing lotion, and sometimes I add Kiehl’s daily microdose retinol serum. I received this product as part of a ‘free sample program’ but now I’m hooked and I will be buying it regularly. Best Toner I’ve ever used!
