I love Estee Lauder products a lot! I find their skincare products worth the money but this time I wasn’t impressed by this essence. It’s hydrating without making my complexion oily.I only received a small sample, so I am unable to comment on the long-term effectiveness. I didn’t notice a dramatic difference after using this product. I would continue to use it because it was sent to me for free, but I don’t find it a must-have in my skincare routine, save your money and your time and skip this one. I think you can find better essences for a fraction of what this costs. Just okay for me
