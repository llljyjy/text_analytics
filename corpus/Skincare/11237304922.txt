Very disappointing and I do not recommend. I’m not sure why, considering the mix and concentration of ingredients, but this product just did not work for me. I used for nearly 3 months and continue to see clogged pores in my nose and chin, which are my problem areas. I used consistently in the evenings, per directions, and not once did I see any improvements in my clogged pores.I have had significantly better success with the Paulas Choice BHA 2% Liquid Exfoliant, and for that matter, even The Ordinary’s 7% Glycolic Acid Toning Solution.  As a 47 year old woman who has always used exfoliating acids as part of my skin care routine I am sorely disappointed with this product. After waking up to another face of clogged pores, I have finally accepted that this product is nothing more than chic packaging and moved on. Did not work.
