Love this cleansing balm, you just massage it in, I let it sit for a minute, like when brushing my teeth or washing my hands or something and then wipe it off with a reusable cotton pad, then follow up with my normal skincare, if you have thick full coverage this will help melt it away, if you have waterproof make-up leave it for a few more minutes and then normal skin care. It doesn’t smell like anything, it doesn’t break you out, it is a huge tub for a great price. nan
