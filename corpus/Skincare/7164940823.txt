I LOVE LANEIGE! Like almost my entire skincare routine is their products. I loved the Water Bank Moisture Cream so much, so when I ran out I naturally bought this new version. My skin still feels hydrated, but I am having the worst, most painful breakouts I’ve had in years! The only thing that’s changed in my skincare or makeup routine is this, so sadly I think something in the new formula is different and no longer works for my oily skin. 3 stars for hydration, but definitely won’t buy again after these painful pimples I miss the old formula
