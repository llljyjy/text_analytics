I love Estee and had high hopes for this one! This is not offensive to the skin, but left me wanting more as far as skin benefits go. Maybe my skin is in a weird place, but I really saw absolutely nothing beneficial about this product aside from a cute bottle. I had hoped for more from this brand I love! Not bad not really anythingâ€¦
