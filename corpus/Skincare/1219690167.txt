Sadly this product did not work for my sensitive eyes. About 10 min after applying eyes start to water and itch, and I wake up in the morning with huge puffy under eyes. The tumeric cream is so gentle around my eyes that I figured this eye cream would be similar but that is not the case. Also when I received it the lid from the pod left adhesive all around the edge of the pod. I reached out to the kora team to ask what was in the adhesive because I was worried about it getting in the product and I have allergies to adhesives. They said they would contact product development and then never got back to me. However I donâ€™t think my reaction to this product is just from the adhesive residue, I think there is actually some other component I am sensitive too.  So my advice, proceed with caution if you have sensitive eyes. For reference I have dry sensitive skin with rosacea. Watering puffy eyes
