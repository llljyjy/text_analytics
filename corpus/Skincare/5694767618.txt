I LOVE these eye masks - I feel like most of the eye masks I use don’t actually do anything, like I’m just doing it for the ritual.  Not these - I felt like my under eyes were alot plumper afterwards.They were kind of tingly on me, which I LOVE in a product. My only initial complaint is that the little eye masks were kind of tricky to separate. There was a ton of actual product on the little pieces - which is important, because I’ve had masks with almost no product and it’s always such a disappointment. I did not find this to be the case. Very pleased with this product. so pleased with these eye masks!
