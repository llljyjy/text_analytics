I was surprised by how much i enjoy this mask - though for $70 i definitely better!  I like clay masks in general because i’ve got combo oily skin and pretty large pores that can get quite congested if I don’t stay on top of cleaning my skin. This mask does what any good clay mask does which is decongest pores and remove excess oil.  What’s unique about this mask is how it works as well as any hardcore clay mask while actually hydrating my skin at the same time. You put it on and it has a lovely warming sensation and smells divine (typical tatcha scent). Wash it off 5-10 min later and skin looks/feels clean but remains soft and well hydrated. It’s a great mask which i will absolutely be repurchasing once i run out. Another winner from Tatcha
