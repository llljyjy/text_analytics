I just snagged this lip balm, and while it is more on the pricey side it is totally worth the money/hype. I apply this all day including before work, after my morning and night skin care rituals, and even on top of lipstick. I will definitely be purchasing this product again, and don’t let me forget the scent… it had an amazing scent almost like a sweet nutty scent just a little different then the original bum bum scent we all love but it’s great!, I highly recommend! Worth Every Pretty Penny!!!
