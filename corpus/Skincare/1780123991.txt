I received this product free for testing purposes.  I have been really happy with the result.  I LOVE the metal tip, that instantly helps depuff my eye area. The cooling of the metal tip feels amazing, especially in the morning.  I love how I also do not need to use my fingers to apply the product. There is no scent which I like. The product is more a cream consistency then a serum I would say, but it is light, not a heavy cream. I definitely have seen results using this product. My under eye area looks much brighter, smoother and refreshed.  I love how itâ€™s easy to use with the applicator tip. Love it!
