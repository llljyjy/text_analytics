I like this moisturizer better than cerave’s daily moisturizer because I have oily skin. This moisturizer keeps me from getting too greasy because it’s light and watery rather than thick and oily. I’m giving it 4 stars because it didn’t change my life and isn’t too special, but it also doesn’t break me out and does a great job at being a simple moisturizer. Lightweight and not greasy
