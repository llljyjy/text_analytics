I took my sample size with me to vacation in Florida. After spending a day at the beach, even though I use SPF 50, my chest will always burn. The rest of my body tans. I showered for dinner and applied an after sun moisturizer and was still uncomfortable with the sunburn.  I finally was getting ready for bed, washed my face and applied the Ferulic Brew Essence to my face and felt such a nice cooling sensation and relief.  I immediately applied the essence to my sunburned chest and instantly felt it soothing. I couldn’t believe it. I applied a little more and went to bed and by morning, no redness or itching from the sunburn. My skin was soothed and felt great. I think we found another use for this!!! It’s amazing for sunburns!! The lactic acid helped tremendously! Holy grail status!! Soothes sunburns
