I absolutely loved receiving this as a free sample through PinchMe! Algenist Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm really does deliver on silky smooth coverage and does not leave a greasy feel whatsoever! Having never tried this balm before, but being familiar with the  Algenist brand, I’m super excited to include this cream into my daily/morning ritual! I also really like that it does not have a weird fragrance or any scent whatsoever- just a clean smooth fresh feeling! I’ll definitely be recommending this to my friends and family (my mom already jumped on board and ordered a jar from Sephora last night haha!) thanks again! 10/10 would highly recommend! AMAZING smooth fresh feeling!
