This product was gifted to me by Summer Fridays, but by no means is this review fake and this is my honest opinion.  The scent of the lip balm isn’t too overpowering and the taste of vanilla is faint. It’s fairly thick and it was a bit difficult to squeeze it out from its tube. Although when I placed it on my lips it didn’t feel too heavy. It feels hydrating and very creamy. Although personally, after knowing it’s price, I would not buy it for myself. But if you’re feeling bougie and want to spend a little more on yourself, I would say go for it. A bit too pricey, but good
