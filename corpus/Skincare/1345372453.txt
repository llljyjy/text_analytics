I can’t say I really noticed a huge difference. I’ve been using this product for a few weeks now just a few times a week. I like the packaging. Easy to use and simple. Don’t love the smell of the product but it could be worse. The price point is high but expected for the name. I have combination skin. I don’t feel like this made me break out at all. Applied easily, pilled slightly. Left my skin feeling soft. nan
