I received this product to try on exchange for my honest opinion. This eye product is nice, but it is by no means a balm texture. When I think of a balm, I think of super luxurious and moisturizing. This is good for daytime use, but I need something heavier for night. There’s not much scent which is great for an eye product!  I love the packaging. There’s something fun about the twist feature! Nice product but not a true balm
