I have been using this moisturizer for about 2 years now and it makes such a difference in my skin. I can clearly tell when I stop using it. I have true combination skin (oily t zone, dry patches, normal patches) and this works for me morning and night. While it is a thicker creme, I feel like it sinks right into my skin after a few minutes and can put makeup on easily in the morning, or a great night cream layered on an oil. Could not recommend more, I have gone through countless jars! Only con is I donâ€™t love the component it comes in. Best creme I have ever used!
