The Outset Restorative Niacinamide Night Cream it’s a must have. The consistency is rich and creamy, but doesn’t feel heavy on skin. Honestly feels a very luxurious, but effective experience. It absorbs very quickly and the skin feels soft. In the morning bedside the softness you feel your skin nourished and smoother. Definitely a must try/have this fall/winter season.
