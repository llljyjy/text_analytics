This serum is very light weight and absorbs so nicely - 0 stickiness!! I’ve been using for about a week now and overall feel like my skin is brighter. I have noticed that very small dots have started to fade, but I think overtime the more prominent acne scars or picking scars will fade, I think too early to tell. Overall, I’ll be sticking to it because I’m happy with the results thus far. Disclaimer: The smell is not great as mentioned in a couple other reviews, but after a couple uses, I doesn’t bother me as much. nan
