This lip mask is delightful! You apply before bed to really allow the product to absorb overnight. The texture is thick and greasy, very similar to Vaseline, with no scent or taste. It takes a while to absorb, but your lips will thank you for it in the morning. I wake up with the softest lips every time! Note:  I received this product free for testing. Thick and Luscious
