I really like drunk elephant, but this creme was kind of a miss for me. I really look for reduced darkness under my eyes, but unfortunately, I did not see that improve for me with this product. Good thing about this creme is that you barely need more than a tiny drop. It spreads really well and if youâ€™re trying to get as much out if a product as possible this can deliver. nan
