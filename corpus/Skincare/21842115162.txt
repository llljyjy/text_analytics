I used this product when I was on accutane. I put it on once or twice a week when my skin would start to get flakey. It really helped! Vaseline never did anything for my dry patches but this completely got rid of them over night. If youâ€™re starting accutane or just have really dry skin you should try this. It does stain your pillows if you have white pillows. You can mix it with your moisturizer and put it on a few hours before you go to sleep to prevent staining. nan
