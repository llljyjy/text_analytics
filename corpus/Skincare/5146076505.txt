I was a loyal Farmacy cleansing balm user and decided to venture out and I love this much better. The consistency is creamier and even “grips” to the skin to remove all makeup in one go. I also felt my face felt much cleaner once I rinsed this balm off compared to the Farmacy balm which sometimes felt like it left oil residue behind. Can’t recommend it enough. New Favorite
