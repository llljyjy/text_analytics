I have been incorporating this cream in place of my moisturizer since receiving to try and review. It is a nice thick cream and dries down to a slight matte but not drying. Leaves my skin feeling smooth. Itâ€™s not completely creating a Poreless effect but I do see a difference vs no product. My skin looks hydrated and have not had issues adding makeup on top. Will continue using! nan
