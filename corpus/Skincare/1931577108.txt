his moisturizer is best described as a rich, ultra-hydrating cream. However, I didn’t find it overly heavy or thick; it absorbed and gave my skin a dose of hint of glow and “bounce”. Overall, the consistency of the moisturizer is silky and luxe, you won’t need to over apply. It does have a slight scent as expected, but it doesn’t seem to linger and did not bother me over all. I will subtract 1 star due to cost/lack of accessibility. I received a complementary sample of this product in exchange for an honest review Great for Dry Skin
