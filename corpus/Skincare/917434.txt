I really enjoyed using this new product, which I received complimentary from Algenist. I love trying different toners and believe it is a crucial skincare step. My skin is pretty finicky at the moment: I have some dry patches but my main concerns are texture and early signs of aging, so I was excited to try this for the texture benefits. The product comes in a somewhat heavy glass bottle and there is a tiny flip top cap under the main, heavy cap. There isn’t much of a scent to the toner, and it’s thick enough to almost be essence-like. I found it to be pretty hydrating and it definitely did not exacerbate my dry patches. I’ve used it for a while now, and I’m so pleased to report that I’ve seen definite improvement in my skin texture! It feels and looks so much smoother. Based on the quick results, I can definitely recommend giving this a try! Delivers real results
