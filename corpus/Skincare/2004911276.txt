So, I received this product complimentary via BZZ Agent and it works pretty well on my skin. I think my skin is pretty thirsty given the fact that here in SC we are nearing triple digit heat. It is pretty hot and humid; hence sticky out. So, this definitely does the trick and keeps things hydrated and moisturized. It is great with HLA and specially formulated with niacinimide serum to really rev up the anti aging protection boosting power that your skin definitely needs. You will start noticing a difference after about 10 to 14 days of usage.  Great for women like me in their prime 30’s to 40’s! Great for thirsty skin!
