I really like this eye cream, I’ve used it for a while only recently buying something different to switch it up. I didn’t notice it helping with under eye circles, but it was really hydrating and felt nice on. The cream spreads well, so a little goes a long way. It also wore nicely under my concealer. Overall a good eye cream. nan
