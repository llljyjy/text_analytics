i love using this product on those no makeup makeup days/natural makeup days or when i’m rushing and have barely any time to apply makeup. only one star removed bc despite me saying i use this in a rush it does take quite some time to blend out with my hands because of the mineral sunscreen in it. but once blended out, it looks amazing! perfect coverage, and layers nicely under liquid blush and highlighter. i have a fair light olive complexion so the shade works perfectly for me too! covers my red blemishes enough for me and evens my skin tone. can’t recommend enough. a new fave!
