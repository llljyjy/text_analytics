This is definitely a nice mineral sunscreen. It doesn’t leave a white cast on my skin. It’s safe in my sensitive skin and lightweight formula. This blends very well into my skin. It’s not greasy and leaves a great matte finish, which I love!! It’s scent free, which is nice! I totally recommend this SPF!! Perfect SPF
