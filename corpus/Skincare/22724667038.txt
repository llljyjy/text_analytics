I love this retinol oil!! I’ve been using for a month, I started to use it every 3 days like I was reading to avoid breakouts, then every 2 days and now I’m gonna start using it every week. I had no break outs and my skin feels so soft, shiny and some of my acne scars disappeared. I really recommend it! Love it
