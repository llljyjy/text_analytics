This is a yes for me :) I have really enjoyed Ole products in the past so I was super excited for this new launch. This cream has a super thick rich texture that my dry skin has seriously loved. I havenâ€™t experienced any irritation and my skin is super glowy when I wake up in the morning having applied it the night before. great for my dry skin
