This is the best smelling gradual tanner I’ve ever used! I put it on my legs and walked into our room and my boyfriend even said “what is that smell!” He loved it. The effects are gradual but do show a nice tint right away! Have to rub in quite a bit but not sticky after applying. I got this complimentary for testing but I would definitely recommend this tanner. Love the smell!
