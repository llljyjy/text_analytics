I truly love certain Sturm products (eye cream, face cream, enzyme cleanser), but this product is a total miss for me. Is it a moisturizer? A primer? The concentration of active ingredients is so low that you’d be better off using pharmacy-grade brands. “Apply after your moisturizer for a lit-from-within glow, over makeup, or combine with your preferred skincare product.“ > Applied after moisturizer, this makes my normal/combo skin VERY oily within an hour. > Why ’apply over make up’? Just apply make up that has a subtle shimmer, if you want a glow. > Combining with other skin care products dilutes the concentration of this already weakly-concentrated product.Definitely not a ’must have’ robust product, but an indulgence, if you can afford it. Confusing product.
