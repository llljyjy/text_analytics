I tried the smallest size just so I could compare with the Farmacy cleansing balm:  DEFINITELY prefer Clinique’s version:  It’s less greasy, faster, more effective in one tiny application with cotton ball to take off one eye at a time makeup removal! (unscented too!) I will definitely re-purchase bigger size (the smallest size is best at gym, post-workout shower & make-up removal for the day) Take The Day Off Cleansing Balm Makeup Remover
