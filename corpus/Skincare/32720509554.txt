ive been using it for about a week to correct some discolouration and texture, and iâ€™m already noticing a difference!! the zinc has the quickest effect, smoothing out any texture and reducing the appearance of pore in just a few days. the skin around my mouth (which was a bit darker than the rest of my face) is also starting to get corrected! i use it twice a day, once in the morning and once at night, five drops each time. a little goes a long way with this product. great & quick results!
