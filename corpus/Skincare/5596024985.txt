I usually use cream blush when I do wear makeup but this is my absolute favorite when I don’t wear makeup. A little goes a long way so don’t be upset about how small the bottle is. I go foundation free most days but I love to use this and mascara. Great texture, does not cause any irritation on my sensitive hormonal acne prone skin. Not oily on my skin. Does not cause any breakouts or irritation for me. nan
