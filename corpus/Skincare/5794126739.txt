This face cream is amazing and I donâ€™t say that lightly. I have sensitive and very dry skin. I also have early signs of aging with fine lines and rough texture. This cream is Incredibly lightweight for the amount of moisture it delivers. It kept my skin incredibly moisturized and dewy all day. I have spent a lot of money on creams from Augustinus Bader and LaMer and this one stands right up there with the best of them. Definitely will repurchase. Luxury Face Cream
