This is a wonderful product. It works great for dry and sensitive skin. I love the fact that it doesn’t have a fragrance to it. I get no skin irritation when applying it at night. I also use my moisturizer as well. I’ve been using it twice a week for the last month. My skin feels very soft/smoother the next morning. I get redness on my checks and on the second day they don’t look red or less red. So that gives me a boost of confidence. I believe it’s worth the price point cause a little bit goes a long way. Overall I love this product and I do hope to see more results in the future.I recieved this complementary for testing purposes. Good for dry and sensitive skin
