It felt very emollient after application but the second the product touched my inner lip, mouth, and tongue, it was extremely bitter tasting. I applied it before bed and couldn’t kiss my hubby goodnight because I didn’t want to inflict the taste of the lip treatment on him. After a few mins, I ended up washing it off. Received yesterday, returning today. YUCK - extremely bitter!
