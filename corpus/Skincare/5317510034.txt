I tried this and another product at the same time and started breaking out ridiculously all over my face so I stepped back and tried them on separate days and this turned out to be the culprit! I can’t believe that something for acne prone skin made my skin break out as bad as it did. I won’t be repurchasing this and I really hope they reformulate it. breakout central!! (don’t buy)
