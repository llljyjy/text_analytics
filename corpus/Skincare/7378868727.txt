I actually bought this product- I would probably purchase the dark next time but I got the medium. First of all- it sprays super fine mist oil so I just rework by sections and blend with a tanning mitt. It’s so moisturizing and glides on smooth so it’s the fastest I’ve ever self tanned before . It’s clear and doesn’t stain my sheets !! It also smells so good but it’s a light scent- no bad tanning smell at all. I was also shocked that my skin absorbed the oil and I didn’t feel greasy or sticky at all anywhere- but my skin looked so healthy and moisturized. I took it all over my hands/fingers and it blended so naturally that you would never guess my tan was fake. I’m sold! Love it!
