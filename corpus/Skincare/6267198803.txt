This is a wonderful cleanser. The minimalistic packaging has a weight to it that makes it feel expensive and luxurious. The pump works well to dispense an appropriate amount of product. A small amount goes as long way as it lathers up really well while cleansing. It removes my makeup and leaves my skin feeling clean but not dry. I have sensitive skin and occasional breakouts and have noticed a decrease in skin irritation and breakouts since using this cleanser regularly. The scent is mild and barely noticeable. This is the first Dr. Zenovia product I have tried and it left such a good impression that I am looking forward to trying others by the brand. nan
