Absolutely LOVE this new improved formula!! It pains me to say I don’t love anything YTTP but the old formula was simply too sticky...no matter how much moisturizer I put over it. I would have to barely use any of this product and even there had to be careful of the stickiness. But boy did it pack a punch! This one doesn’t have that crazy stickiness, especially once it dries down and you moisturize. It definitely still packs a bunch and I see almost overnight results but slightly less intense which I can definitely feel and appreciate as it’s still super effective. Thank you YTTP!! <3 Wow!! YTTP really listens!!
