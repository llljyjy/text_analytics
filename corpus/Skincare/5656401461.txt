I’ve been using this consistently for about a month. It makes my skin feel clean, it’s the first thing I put on my face and then my moisturizer. I see a difference when I apply my foundation, there is less of a “pore” effect look on my cheeks especially. My skin definitely looks brighter and even. The reason I give 4 stars is that - I felt like it wasn’t doing anything, but if it helps, my foundation looks a lot better on. that clean feeling
