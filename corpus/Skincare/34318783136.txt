This is a rlly good makeup removing balm. However for the price… not worth it. I have strictly used extra virgin coconut oil before this and I honestly feel like they are interchangeable, and for the price I would go with coconut oil. Obviously my skin reacts fine to coconut oil but I know some people can break out. I would love to keep buying this but for $36 for the small size I got, it’s just not worth it (and I have spent tons on makeup products, so that’s saying something) Amazing makeup remover, not worth the price.
