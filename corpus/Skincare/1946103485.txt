I received a sample size of this product to try. It was brought to last me day and night for four days. I found the moisturizer had a slight powdery smell to it which wasn’t over powering but if you are not one for a fragrance in a moisturizer then this may not be for you even though it is slight. I found that since it is a cream it is a little thicker. It went over my face well and my face felt moisturized. As it was a sample size I’m not able to speak to the benefits it offers. I would be interested in trying a bigger size and would recommend this product, Not Bad but would need more
