I like the way you have to mix the two parts of the serum together.  It made me feel that it was a fresher as the ingredients were not activated until I mixed them myself.The consistency of the serum was just right.  It was light but yet I felt as though the product was absorbing into my face.I’ve noticed a slight improvement after only two weeks, so I’m hoping over the next several weeks I will continue to be impressed. Lightweight easily absorbed
