Love this product! I love the packaging this product comes in, it’s a very sturdy glass bottle and I love that it’s a pump as opposed to a tube like other eye creams I’ve tried and I love how creamy this product feels, I’ve used many eye creams that are very wet and oily feeling that just sit on my skin but this product feels much creamier and absorbs into my skin visibly brightening my under eye area! Love the packaging & the product!
