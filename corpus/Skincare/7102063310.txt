I prefer to use eye serums in my nighttime routine but I ended up using this in the morning AND at night. The metal swirl application is DIVINE! The cooling effect is so refreshing and soothing, especially after waking up. I really enjoy massaging the product into my eye area. The serum is lightweight and has a very smooth consistency. It absorbs quickly into the skin. I have sensitive skin and didn’t experience any congestion issues or irritation. I’m in my thirties and I’m starting to see wrinkles. Thankfully after a few weeks of use, I’m seeing a reduction in their severity. But my undereye puffiness has seen the most improvement. Soothing and Refreshing
