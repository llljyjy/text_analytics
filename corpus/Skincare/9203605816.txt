I love this cream! it has a thinner consistency, but it’s incredibly moisturizing. I apply it every night, and sometimes during the day too whenever I feel like my skin needs some extra hydration. It’s super gentle and great if you have sensitive and/or oily skin. The packaging is really nice— very sturdy with a nice weight to it. I feel like my skin looks more plump and luminous in the morning after applying the cream at night. I will continue to use! New favorite in my skin care routine!
