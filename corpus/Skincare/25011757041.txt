After using this product for nearly two months, I highly recommend it! There is no smell, it is very gentle and leaves your skin looking radiant. This is what has worked for me: I use the Fenty cleanser, followed by the peel pads. I let the pad soak in for a minute or two, and then I follow up with my Laneige moisturizer. That’s it.I decided to wear no makeup during this process to see how the products would work and work they did. Initially, I felt uncomfortable because I wasn’t able to conceal my blemishes and dark spots, but they visibly started fading and now my skin looks so healthy. Others have noticed as well and I’ve gotten so many compliments on my glow. I also have hormonal acne and have not yet experienced my usual flare-up. Highly recommend
