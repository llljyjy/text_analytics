The serum itself is really nice. I have used it for about three weeks now, twice a day.  My face feels great after and it does not dry my skin out or irritate my face. I did not prefer the bottle the product came in. It’s hard to get all 3 serums to mix at first, mix it before it comes out, would make it a lot better. Also for $135 I would expect slightly better packaging. The bottle is quite flimsy. I would use this product again but I don’t think I would buy it for myself. I really like what’s INSIDE. The packaging is eh.
