I’ve been really enjoying this serum! it’s quickly become part of my everyday skin care routine. My skin was feeling dry and textured. Not anymore, this serum has helped hydrate and smoothed my skin. It goes under makeup seamlessly and gives a very nice glow to my skin. Scent is refreshing and I love how it’s not an overly liquid formula that goes all over as you’re applying into the palm of your hand. I cannot comment on wrinkles. Luxurious
