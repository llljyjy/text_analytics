I love this! Everything from the fact that it has ceramides, spf, and a lightweight oil texture! This is the perfect addition to any skincare routine, but especially for dry skin. I find most sunscreen greasy, it almost always leaves a white cast, and often breaks me out. This is the perfect spf for under makeup. I let it sink in before applying makeup and my makeup still lasts all day. Supergoop is one of those brands that just does SPF right! Now if only they’d fix their CC cream back to the old formula… but that’s another story! what a great concept!
