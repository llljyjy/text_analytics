I love this sunscreen! It doesn’t have any tint which is nice because I am really pale but use self tanner in the summer so it blends in well. It has a really faint but nice smell, its definitely on the greasier side but nothing I find like too much, I have dry skin so it’s actually really nice. I was really pleasantly surprised with this product love
