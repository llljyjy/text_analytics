I have oily and acne-prone skin and this is my No.1 SPF so far. It does have a matt finish, it is not sticky (YAY) and it is a great base for my foundation. My skin does get a little oily during the day no matter what lotion I use, therefore donâ€™t expect to be matt all day. The only downturn is that the product is pricy. Non-sticky and matt finish
