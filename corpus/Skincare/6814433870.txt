I was able to try this with #trywithtopbox as a #freeproduct. I have been using it for about a week and so far I am a big fan. I like the mild scent. It has a nice light consistency. I also really love the packaging itâ€™s very cute. I noticed that it absorbed nicely into my skin and left it glowing. It also made my skin feel very soft, even prior to applying the cream. I noticed that it kept my skin more hydrated throughout the day. I have combination skin and usually get an oily T zone as the day progresses, but with the serum and cream combination I notice that my skin did not become as oily as it usually does. loving this!
