Cicapair™ Tiger Grass SerumThis product is great. I have sensitive skin and this makes it feel amazing! I have been using it for a week and have seen major skin improvements. It has helped with the redness that would happen on my cheeks. It keeps my skin soft and hydrated too!  Like magic.Cicapair™ Tiger Grass Color Correcting Treatment SPF 30Smells great, and the texture is thick but easy to spread. It leaves skin feeling refreshed and moisturized but not oily. I wear this instead of foundation and it looks so nice! My skin looks naturally flawless with it! Highly recommend this one.Cicapair™ Tiger Grass CreamFor the past couple of years, I’ve had problems with dry, flaky skin on my face. When irritated, it gets red and stays red. Heavier but doesn’t clog my pores or break me out and actually moisturizes. This stuff transformed my skin overnight. It soothed the itching and redness and hydrated it. I’m in love and will be purchasing the full size. nan
