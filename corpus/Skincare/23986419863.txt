✨ It’s the first time I’ve tried this product, my skin instantly felt fresh and soft.  And it has an exquisite citrus smell.  It seems to help lighten dark spots, and I’m very happy to see the results in a month.  I feel that if I would buy it again after feeling my skin like this, this product is new and not yet on the market and the price would be $68 dollars. Bouncy BrightfacialMasque illuminateur. I réceived these productsfor free from Influenster and brand(s) in exchange for my honest review. A must have in my daily routine ❤️✨
