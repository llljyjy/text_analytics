This is the worst cleanser ever. I’d rather wash my face with mayonnaise. It doesn’t cleanse, leaves makeup, dead skin, everything on your face. It was solely made without care as a pretty gift with purchase item or to boost the value of their gift sets and promos. Do not use this or your skin will suffer clogged pores, dullness and breakouts. worst cleanser ever
