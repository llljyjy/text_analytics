I’ve used a lot of HA serums and this one is good but not my favorite. Fragrance isn’t something that usually bothers me in products but this one is super overpowering. It also lingers on throughout the day which is a big reason why I don’t really reach for this product. I do like the plumping effect it gives and the jelly-like consistency though. Received complimentary from Moon Juice. Strong Fragrance
