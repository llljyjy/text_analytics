This sunscreen is truly worth the price!!1) My guy always smells SPF in my make up and it disturbs him, this made it by him undetected.2) Sunscreens, no matter what, always give me little zits after use. This one did not. I even pushed the envelope and went to bed without removing it. Woke up with no issues and skin feeling nice.3) Works flawlessly with other serums and under a full face of makeup.Would totally pay out of pocket for it and recommend to family and friends. Great for everyday use. Just not for poolside, as this formula is NOT water resistant. AMAZING!
