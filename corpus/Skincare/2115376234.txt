I absolutely love this cleanser. I use it at least twice a week to get a good exfoliating cleanse. It doesn’t dry out or irritate my skin. It really has helped to keep my acne in control especially when I got really oily or had to wear my mask all day. I’ve been using this for a while now and haven’t noticed any problems! Good cleanser-keeps my skin happy!
