I finally finished my little container and after using it consistently every morning I can confidently say that it was just ok for me. I loved the smell and the texture, it soaked in nicely and left my skin feeling moisturized. In terms of the actual benefits of the Vit-C I would say I noticed no difference in my skin. If youâ€™re looking for a more brightening treatment for dark spots, texture, and overall glow I would look at something more targeted with a higher concentration. It's Just Okay
