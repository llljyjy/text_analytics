I love this product! Using it in place of concealer for my under eyes during the day and itâ€™s a really nice lightweight texture and seems to hydrate the area nicely while brightening and hiding my dark circles. As for long term effects of decreasing fine lines and dark circles, not really noticing much of a difference there but as camouflage it works beautifully. replaces concealer
