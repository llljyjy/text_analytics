I’m giving this four out of five stars for the following reasons:1) The product smells and feels amazing, however I feel like you have to use quite a bit of it at once. If I could use less and get the same effect, I’d have given it 5 stars.2) It’s absolutely moisturizing and makes your skin feel really soft afterwards, however I found that in the tub it makes my skin feel a bit slimy. The residue feeling was off-putting, so again, only four stars.3) Don’t make the same mistake as me and try to shave if you’re soaking in this...the build up of product on my skin clogged my razor and it took about 10x longer to get the job done! So again, only four stars because I’m a multi-tasker and if I’m bathing, I’m shaving! Let my mistake be a lesson to you...
