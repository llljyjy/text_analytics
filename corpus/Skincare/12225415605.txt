Despite all the positive reviews, I didn’t know what to expect when I received this complementary La Mer treatment lotion. I have combination skin and products can be a bit of a hit or miss on my skin.  However, this location is my new skincare bestie because it left it feeling refreshed with the right amount of moisture.  Let’s not forget about the glow that my skin had after using it. It really is worth all the hype. Worth the hype
