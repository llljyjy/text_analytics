I got this sample from #butterly and I’m so happy!! The packing was amazing. The box it came in was so cute and held all the samples for 7 days!! Best part is it’s 2 serums in each one. I love that the active ingredients are separate and only mix with the turmeric serum once applied to the face. After using this for a week my face felt so great. Visibly flowy, healthy and fresh. I also love how subtle but refreshing the smell is when applying the product, and it doesn’t leave a sticky residue at all! The product itself is quite expensive though so I’m not sure if 7 days is enough to sell me on this to buy it right now… but maybe one day! #clarinsdoubleserum Great serum!
