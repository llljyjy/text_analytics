I’ve been using this for about 2 weeks and I’m on the fence about whether I’d buy it again. Not noticing any improvements or difference with my under eye area. It does brighten the area just by the actual formulation but I think there must be less $$ brighteners available that do the same thing. What I don’t like is that the brightening effect seems to make me look like I have more pronounced bags under my eyes. on the fence
