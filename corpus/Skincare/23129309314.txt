I’m in love with this kiehls retinol night serum. I never have used a retinol product that really works and in a short amount of time. in just a few days of using, I noticed less visible wrinkles and more smoothing to my skin. it’s has no smell to it, a CLEAN product. this product is a now must have in my regular regime and I willing to recommend this product for its a very good product..you get to mix the powder retinol mixture into the clear serum to get the best retinol results you can achieve. best retinol serum yet!
