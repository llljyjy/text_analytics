I’m in my late 20s and have been developing my skincare routine since I was 15. This cleanser formulation feels like an oxymoron and shouldn’t make sense, but it does. My tiny pores and non-tight face after using is a testament to how well this works. I have the definition of combination skin. My cheeks are fine, but my T-zone is singlehandedly my biggest problem. I have washed my face religiously with clean hands twice a day for years, experience minimal stress, and use products that I’ve scoured the ingredients of multiple times and labeled as sensitive and derm approved, and yet I was still suffering from random whiteheads on my forehead, nose, and chin, as well as itchiness and redness. I feel like my skin was in a great place years ago, but something changed and many products and ingredients I used to be able to tolerate (like retinol), my skin can no longer take and I experience rashes and other issues. I was worried that removing retinol from my routine would make my skincare effectiveness fall apart, and it did. Since then (for about 2 years) my skin has been dull, tight, itchy, riddled with random blemishes that scar, and uneven texture. I have been scrambling trying to rebuild my skincare routine and I finally feel like it’s solidified with the help of this cleanser.I can feel the clay doing its work while I massage it in, but I also feel the glycerin and other hydrating ingredients when I wash this off. I love how it’s a cleanser and not a mask you need to leave on for several minutes.Using this combined with the sample of the Ready Steady Glow toner, my skin has returned to what it used to look like in my early 20s. It’s completely clear, bright, pores are small, and I don’t feel like my skin is crying out for moisture even after I apply moisturizer. I have replaced my double cleansing with this cleanser twice a day, and I no longer experience tightness or rashes.If you feel like you’ve tried everything, give this cleanser a try. Miracle Cleanser
