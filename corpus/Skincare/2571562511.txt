This was sent to me by the brand but my opinions are my own - if you haven’t tried anything from Pollis choice yet you are absolutely missing out! This is one of my absolute favorite skin care brand and go twos when I’m looking for a specific product. In addition to that if you’re not using retinol in your skin care routine you are absolutely missing out. Not only does this one have .3% retinal it also has peptides and vitamin C. This brightens my skin and has definitely helped prevent. Retinal doesn’t only need to be used to treat aging skin it is great at preventing as well. Absolutely would recommend this A must have
