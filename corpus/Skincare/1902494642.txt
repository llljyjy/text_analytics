I have very dry, sensitive skin that is prone to redness. I love this lotion and have been incorporating it into my skincare routine day and night. The texture is watery, and only a couple drops in my hand are needed to cover my face. I use this product almost like a toner, right after I wash/dry my face and before putting on any other product. Because only a few drops are needed, I expect this product to last a long time. This lotion is very hydrating upon first use - I’ve noticed that it helps my face stay hydrated throughout the day. I’ve seen a gradual decline in redness so far, but I hope the results are more dramatic as I continue to use this product. nan
