I received this as a free sample from YTTP. While I love the brand and religiously use a couple of their products, this one didn’t wow me. I don’t think it’s hydrating enough for me to use in the winter alone and that price tag is hard to justify. I’m sure there are huge long term benefits to all the fancy peptides, but there wasn’t enough moisturizing and immediate benefits for me to purchase. Maybe worth a try if peptides are really your jam. Not worth the price
