The Dr. Zenobia Skincare Bakuchiol Hydrating Cleanser is an overall fantastic product. It has a light scent, and goes on smooth and creamy. It kind of gives the appearance of a spiderweb like material when pouring it in your hand, but don’t let that fool you. It cleanses the skin gently, while leaving it feeling soft, and supple. My only complaint is my pump did not work, I tried everything to get it to pump out the cleanser, but nothing ever came out. That’s not a deal breaker cause I just remove the nozzle and pour it out the old fashioned way. It doesn’t take much to wash your face and neck with, the cleanser goes a long way. PinchMe sent this to me to try out, and I’m glad I got to try it, it’s definitely a good product. Healthy, Soft Skin
