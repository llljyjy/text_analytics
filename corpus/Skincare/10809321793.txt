I really like this serum, it makes my skin glowy and smooth. I used it 2 or 3 times a week and that worked well for me.I donâ€™t really have any dark spots but it does help with dullness and unevenness. It does however smell like craft glue which is odd but overall I recommend trying it out. I like it.
