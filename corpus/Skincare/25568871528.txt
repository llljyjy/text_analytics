The product itself is nice, like others have mentioned a little goes a long way. You wouldn’t want to use this every day but it’s a lovely scrub. However the whole experience of using the product is cheapened by the packaging. It doesn’t feel nice or high-end, which makes me wonder if what’s inside is nice? The sticker label was crooked, the jar is very thin and flimsy plastic. To open the seal on the top there was no tab to pull so I had to cut it with a knife and product was wasted. Given the price point the packaging should be nicer. Drugstore products feel higher end.I know this is a new line for her so hopefully she can find a nicer 2oz jar! Dr. Lara, the packaging is AWFUL!
