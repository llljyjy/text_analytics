So far so good! I am used to using heavy moisturizers for my dry skin so I was pleasantly surprised that my skin feels so hydrated with this light cream. I am prone to redness and breakouts from certain products and so far my skin is really drinking this in. I wish it wasnâ€™t so pricey because I definitely might have to start using it permanently. nan
