Doesn’t make my skin oily, doesn’t smell or feel like sunscreen, is nice and thin, and looks absolutely STUNNING under makeup.  This has replaced primer for me and I gifted one to my mom and no joke the next morning I look in the trash to find ALL of her primers, she only uses this now!  It’s no joke!! STUNNING under makeup!
