Been using this tool once a week since Jan 2022. Its now almost April. Im 34 yrs old with texture and acne-prone skin. This tool helped me to minimize my acne and over time the tool has left me with very soft skin results. Before using, highly recommend watching tutorials on youtube then practicing with the practice disk so you get a feel for the motion. If you want an at-home tool, this may fit your needs. If you want less ‘work’ then pay for someone do to a treatment. Usage of this tool is about 5 mins. Wash off the dead skin and retinol up! Im a health science researcher so paying close attention to what this tool offers. - Tool has not broken on me and I use the coarse blue disk. Im happy with this tool and excited to see the results over this year. Has Benefits
