So far I have enjoyed using the product. I do wish it were a bit more moisturizing as I have very dry skin. I have been using it at night and I like the consistency it has. I haven’t noticed a ton of difference in my skin yet but I’ll continue to use. The smell is very mild which is a huge plus. nan
