Love this face oil, it’s a new must have for me! I’m pregnant and had to change my entire skincare & make up products - baby was drying me out and leaving me flaky no matter what I did. This oil was a game changer and really helped hydrate and nourish my skin. It has a very light, natural-honey fragrance and feels thick but dries quickly and comfortably. Good for anyone on the go as well. nan
