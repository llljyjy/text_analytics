Absolutely fantastic as a spot treatment on my face and has helped my chest/back acne a ton! I was using the murad body acne spray which is super expensive but this honestly works way better. I apply a thin layer every couple days and my back is completely clear, smooth and soft! I’m saving so much money since switching. Highly recommend to anyone struggling with body acne, it can be embarrassing but you’re not alone! nan
