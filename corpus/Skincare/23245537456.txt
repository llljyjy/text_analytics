Oh my freaking goodness!!!! This is the best moisturizer I’ve ever put on my face before. This is super creamy and almost looks and has the texture of a water gel cream, but then when you apply it, you can feel how luxurious and creamy & thick this formula is. This has the most beautiful,  emollient texture that just glides onto your skin. It’s so much more nourishing and thick than the original, but this is great. It does leave a somewhat greasy layer on top of the skin right after application, but it’s not a lot and if you’re applying makeup, it helps glide it on smoothly. Let it dry down and sink into the skin for about 5-10 minutes before you do anything(makeup included) on top of the moisturizer. Would recommend. Let dry & sink in before applying makeup.
