i have oily skin and dark circles because of staying up late for school. i didnt realize how hydrating it is. makes my skin look so greasy. i used it morning and night which is way too much for me. i reduced it to only at night and it still made my eyes oilier than normal. it didnâ€™t even brighten my eyes at all. i also got bumps around my eyes (milia) which is probably from over hydrating. nan
