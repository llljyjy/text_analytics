I’ve always had acne problems, so finding a cleanser that has Salicylic Acid is fantastic! It’s obviously more of a “cream cleanser“ than a “foam cleanser,“ but it works great! My skin felt really clean and soft after applying it. Despite the fact that it has acne-fighting agents, it was mild on my sensitive skin. Recommend
