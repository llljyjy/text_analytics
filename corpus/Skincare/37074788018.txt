This product was okay, I don’t think i’ll be buying it again. I did in fact give this to a friend with oily skin. As I have very sensitive and combination skin. I did not enjoy this, my face burned every time I even touched it on my face for a few seconds. This would go on for about 5-10ish minutes after settling in and moisturizer. I don’t think it made a difference after two weeks either. Meh
