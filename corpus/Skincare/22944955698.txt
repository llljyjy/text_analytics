I really loved this product. In the past I’ve had issues with sunscreens leaving a weird film on my face or having a distinct smell but this wasn’t the case. It went on really smooth and acted as a moisturizer as well. Although it’s more on the expensive side a little goes a long way so you won’t go through it super quick. Little goes a long way
