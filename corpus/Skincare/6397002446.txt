Let’s talk about Holy Grail of hyrdation!!! This is it :) It’s been a few weeks now, (wanted to wait to review) and I have to say this is the best hydrating lip gloss. I’m 58 and really wanted something hydrating and not too, too glossy, after all, I did when I was 20 something lol! In all seriousness, this is amazing and stays on long hours, keeps lips hydrated. I tried the Berry, my favorite is the grapefruit. I will be trying the others as well. Buy this you will not regret it! I will be purchasing the others soon. FYI, ita always my go to! Enjoy and Buy! Run don’t Walk  over to Sephora :) Lips love this!
