To be honest - not a huge toner kind of gal. its hard to notice a difference in my opinion (unless its SK-II). My friend highly recommended this to me however, and as I do trust their opinions, I gave this a try. Well, hello, Biossance! Im not a stranger to the line, but to this particular product in the lineup I am. This really turned my head after giving it a test drive. I get oily in certain areas around my nose and forehead, but the rest of my face tends towards dry and sensitive. I used to think I needed a slightly stronger cleanser in the summers, but I think thats not the case; I think using something like this only on my oily areas will be much more overall effective. I cant stand my face feeling taut or squeaky clean, especially with aging concerns. I dont really have a pore problem, but they do tend to be more noticeable in my oily areas; swiping this across those areas definitely left them feeling cleaned and under control. I love the scent, I love the bottle, and the brand! All in all, highly and surprisingly impressed. Glad to add this to my routine - just in time for summer. 5 stars! Surprisingly impressed with a toner.
