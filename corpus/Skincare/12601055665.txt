Love the shine and the sun protection this product offers. Also love the ease of application. I have very sensitive, cystic acne prone skin and it hasn’t broken me out! I would say it gives you more of a oily shine rather than a glow from within. For that reason I only use it on my high points of my fave for touch ups and a different product for my whole face. Not necessarily a bad thing if that’s your vibe. It is quite greasy, and my hair does get stuck on my face after I apply. Overall, I think it’s fine but I wouldn’t purchase again. It’s Okay
