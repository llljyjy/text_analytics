I recommend this Dior Recover and repair balm, especially for fairly sensitive skin like mine. It is fragrance free and non-irritating. It has a thick creamy consistency. Even after needling my face, the balm is gentle and calming to my skin. I recommend this for sensitive skin. Thick and gentle balm!
