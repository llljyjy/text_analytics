After using this night cream for 2 weeks my face looks and feels AMAZING! The results so far are astounding and I highly recommend giving this a try. The ingredients are great and the scent is very mild. I have sensitive skin and while using this cream I had no adverse reactions and no irritation or breakouts! My face seems to love it and feels moisturized and bouncy. The amount of product you get in the jar is alot and will last a while. I am definitely adding this to my night time routine. A must have!
