I am loving this eye serum so very much. I received it complimentary to try but I will be repurchasing it on my own when I finish it, since it’s become a key part of my skin care routine. The applicator is incredibly cooling and soothing. The serum itself seems to smooth out my under eye area just beautifully and improves how my concealer applies as well. It’s lightly scented, and the scent is lovely and not long lasting. I don’t often remember to use eye serums, but I look forward to using this so much every evening and it really seems to nourish my skin and leave it looking so much better. I highly recommend the Super Potent Eye Serum since it lives up to its name! Beautiful Serum with a Soothing Applicator
