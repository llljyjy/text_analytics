#gotitforfree to try out in the mail. I was so excited to get this 7 day sample to try out as I love serums and they are a big step in my daily routine so I am always on the lookout for the new and improved ones out there. Getting a complementary 7 day sample allows me to try before committing to the product. So excited when I got it in the mail, I immediately stopped usi g my normal serums and gave the clarins double serum a go right away. I used all the provided samples befire giving this review. I will definitely buy the products , amazing feel on the skin and leaves a nice shine and does make your skin more radiant even after one use. After only 7 days my skin does feel much smoother and more radiant. I do want to add that I feel a more long term use needs to be done before I can give a 100%accurate review, but after only one week I can definitely say I am not disappointed. Love it, will buy and definitely recomend. Smoother and more radiant skin after just 7 days.
