I didn’t wanna write a review about this cream until I use it for a good period of time to be able to benefit people! We’ll I’ve been using it for a good 2 weeks and I really love how moisturizing this cream makes my face. It’s make my face feel like baby skin! I have a dry skin and It’s a great primer also before makeup, doesn’t feel greasy at all as it absorbs into the skin perfectly!!!! The only thing I wish it was with spf. But overall it’s a great moisturizer and I highly recommend it. Great moisturizer
