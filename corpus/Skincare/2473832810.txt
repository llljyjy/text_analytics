This is one of my favorite moisturizers EVER. When my skin lacks hydration it gets extremely oily (like oily eyelids that burn my eyes oily), and since I’ve used this product (about 2 months now) I’ve noticed a big difference in the oil production. I was a little scared to try such a thick product, but I am so glad I did. I no longer wake up with oily skin. It is thick, a little goes a long way for me, but my skin feels so hydrated in the mornings. I don’t feel it’s too sticky or too much when I go to bed. I have noticed a big difference in my skin and this product has made me want to try more of this brand’s products. Helped my oily skin
