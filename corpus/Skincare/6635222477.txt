I love the day cream counterpart to this so much, so I was expecting this cream to be just as good and I think it is. It doesn’t have the “glow” element or the SPF that the day cream has, so this is great for night in my opinion. It’s thick and hydrating, but still feels light and absorbs well on the skin. Definitely recommend for anyone with normal to dry skin. Love it for Night
