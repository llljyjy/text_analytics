I have normal to dry skin, I was really excited to use these, I  noticed smooth soft skin after the first use, I waited 5 days and used it again. After about 2 weeks my skin started to get reallly dry, I could notice it when I wore makeup and I when I wash my face I use products for dry skin and nothing has really helped clear my skin up, Iâ€™m still extremely dry even after use. :( not so great for drier skin.
