Years ago this used to be one of my holy grail products and one of the only things that evened out my skin texture--unfortunately theyâ€™ve since reformulated it and it just does not work for me anymore. My skin leans dry and sensitive, especially in the winter, and this is MUCH too drying for daily use. I found myself wanting to reapply within a few minutes of putting this on because my skin felt tight and dry, which of course only further dried it out. I am giving this three stars because I assume it still has the benefits it used to give me with respect to evening skin tone and texture, but beware--would not recommend if you have anything close to dry skin. nan
