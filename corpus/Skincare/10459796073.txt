I absolutely LOVED Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Advanced Barrier Cream. I have very dull, dry skin. Using Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Advanced Barrier Cream, I definitely felt a difference. It goes on super smooth and creates a very soft, non-greasy moisture barrier. I used it in the morning, before putting on make-up, and at night, before going to bed. It really made my skin feel good.
