I was wonderfully surprised by this treatment lotion! The scent is amazing, especially right before you start or end your day. After cleansing, I would place a few drops in my hands then I would gently pat and massage my face while my face was still damp. This formula has a middle viscosity so it isnâ€™t too thick or sticky. After application, your skin will feel nice and hydrated. This product is perfect for makeup prep! Light and Refreshing!
