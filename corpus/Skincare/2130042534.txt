I absolutely love this makeup remover. It works extremely well, melting off all my makeup with ease. Even eye makeup is no match for this formula! The product is silky smooth and almost water-like in texture. It is fragrance and color free, which I really appreciate. You feel like youâ€™re really purifying your skin before cleansing. This has become an easy first step in my evening skincare routine. After using, my skin feels clean and refreshed and feels extra soft. Pure and effective makeup remover
