This is the first time I’ve tried a Gucci beauty product and I have to say, I love it! This spray really surprised me. The smell of roses is perfection and I love how it can rejuvenate my face midday in the summer heat of FL. I’ve used it as a primer, as a setting spray, and just for a refreshing spritz midday when I feel gross. The scent is so light and refreshing. Will absolutely keep this product stocked! Love it!
