I received this product free for my honest review. I typically wear a liquid moisturizer and never before thought of using a base underneath. However I changed my mind after using this product. This is perfect for summer days in the sun. I would not be able to wear alone without my tinted moisturizer over the top though because it did give my skin an odd ghostly glow. However it does the trick and kept me protected all day long! nan
