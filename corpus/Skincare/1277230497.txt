You get a good amount of product for the price point and for me to use on a regular basis would last a good while. I think the price point to product amount is very reasonable. The product is hydrating and felt very cooling when applied, especially on these hot summer days. I have dark circles and it was mildly brightening, I didnâ€™t expect miracles in terms of concealing but it did help. Would purchase again! Hydrating & Mildly brightening
