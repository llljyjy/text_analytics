I have normal to oily skin with large pores and red patches.  While I do not have dark patches per se, I knew this product was working when it started tingling upon application.   Using this serum nightly has definitely evened out my skin tone, reduced hormonal outbreaks and brightened my skin.  It does have a scent but it doesnâ€™t seem to bother my sensitive skin. An effective product to even skin tone!
