In short, this product is nice to have as an addition to once skin care/make up routine but I don’t feel like it’s absolutely necessary. For one thing, it goes on like a primer. At first it’s kind of greasy then it dries and if you happen to rub your skin even a little, it starts to flake up a bit. I already use SPF for my face before putting on my make up so I personally will stick to that. It’s not a bad product but I personally don’t feel is an important part of my routine. Just  okay for me
