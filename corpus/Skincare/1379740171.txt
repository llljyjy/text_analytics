***This product was received complimentary from INNBEAUTY Project.*** I received this retinol treatment about 2 weeks ago. It’s supposed to help improve the appearance of hyperpigmentation, wrinkles and uneven texture. I did notice that my skin color has improved. I wasn’t really too concerned about wrinkles so that does not apply to me. I didn’t really have an uneven texture. My main concern was the skin discoloration. It did help with that. I was unable to use it during my shows outside just because I was scared of what the extreme heat was going to do to my face in South Florida with this retinol. Overall my complexion does look a lot better. I would definitely recommend this. Even Skin in One Step
