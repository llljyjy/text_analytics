Drunk Elephant’s New A-Gloei Maretinol Oil, helps all of my major skin concerns. It minimizes the look of fine lines, hyperpigmentation, blemishes, sun damage, and even wrinkles. I’ve definitely noticed a difference in my skin. My fine lines, look and feel lighter. My skin even seems brighter! It’s very easy to apply. I apply it, after I wash my face in the morning. It just absorbs and melts into my skin. It doesn’t show or come through my makeup. I’ve never been disappointed by Drunk Elephant. This product is not different! Drunk Elephant Really Helps My Skin!
