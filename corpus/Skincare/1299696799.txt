This cream is very thick. I have minimal lines but my undereye becomes crepey looking if my skin is dry. If I use very rich creams, I develop milia. When I first received this cream, I was sure milia would pop up. A month later, that has not happened. I think it would be too much during the day but it is perfect for night. I have not noticed any brightening yet but my skin feels hydrated. Love this as a night cream
