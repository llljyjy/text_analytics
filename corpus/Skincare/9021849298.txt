I never write reviews because I’m dyslexic- this is how much I disliked this product! I was excited to try this cleansing balm because of the “allure seal” great price and I’ve really enjoyed the other Inky List products I’ve used. This seems defective, it smells like castor oil and drips out in greasy spurts. I closed it back up and massaged the product hoping maybe it had just separated a bit, that wasn’t the problem. Yikes! I tried it anyway hoping it might work better than it looked, smelled, felt, clumped!!! Yuck! It was a gross! It felt like I had just dipped my face in paraffin wax, but this couldn’t be peeled off, or rinsed off. I had to tissue it off then use my foaming enzyme cleanser to remove all the residue. It must be defective. I wouldn’t even use it to shave my legs. All the thumbs down!!! defective?
