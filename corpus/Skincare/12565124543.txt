•I received this product for free from Influenster and Dr. Jart+ in exchange for my honest review•The Dr. Jart+ Premium Beauty Balm is makeup and skincare in one: it hydrates, conceals, and protects skin from harmful UV light ✨This BB cream has very light texture, and gives skin a dewy finish. I have an oily skin, and it’s a  little too shiny for my liking. I only use a tiny amount of product and it’s enough.The color isn’t perfect match for me, but I can make it work with a little bit of a concealer.A huge plus for me, especially for the summer, that this product has SPF 40 ☀️I was nicely surprised, that BB cream lasts very well on the skin, even on the hottest days. I wasn’t expecting that, since the product is so  hydrating. I would recommend this product, if you have dry skin, and looking for a hydrating BB cream, that will even out your skin tone.
