These pore strips are like none I’ve ever used before they are like vacuums, my pores have never been so clear! The longer you leave them on the better, I find 4 hours doesn’t really do them justice it has to be 6-8 and I find that once a week is often enough to keep my pores invisible. I usually cut them up to maximize their usefulness because I need them for my chin too, not just my nose and forehead. Only reason I’m taking off a star is because the package is small I really wish they had a value pack available nan
