This product is very good. I have had a lot going on so I haven’t exactly been eating well or getting enough rest. I’m in the process of moving so it’s been a bit stressful. I felt and noticed that a pimple was forming because my chin was bumpy and swollen and hurt a bit. I applied this product before going to bed and I very much liked how it wasn’t drying or rough. It also did a great job of drying out the pimple before it formed.  It worked overnight and quickly and did not irritate or burn my skin or face.  I received this complimentary from shiseido and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. very good!
