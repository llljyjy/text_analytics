Honestly, I tried this not expecting to love it as much as I do! I’ve tried caudalie before and always love their products, but have stayed away recently as I always find they run out quickly. Since trying this, my skin was INSTANTLY brighter, has less breakouts, more even complexion, etc. It has been a game changer in my routine and I’ve been using it for almost 2 months with just having used a little more than half the bottle at this point. Only reason i’m not giving 5 stars is because my skin feels tight after / I use it before my moisturizer and dont think I could use it without the moisturizing step that follows! Wow!
