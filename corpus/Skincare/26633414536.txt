Very milky and rich, you dont need more than one pump which I figured out after trying for the first time with 3 pumps lol but its really nourishing and gentle. It kind of lathers but doesnt really foam, just gets a little frothy. It didnt burn my sensitive skin and left it clean but not stripped. I honestly think this is a good cleanser for dry or normal skin types, I absolutely love that itâ€™s fragrance free. I hate cleansers with perfume, i dont think skincare should be scented artificially. I prefer a natural scent. It will be worth the cost knowing you only need one pump for face/neck/chest, Amazing! I love this cleanser A little bit goes the long way, worth the price!!
