Whoa. I have never used a product like this. Microencapsulated moisturizer? Not going to lie, the texture was a bit off-putting at first but I got used to it. And this moisturizer leaves my skin hydrated and glowing. This is scented but hasn’t irritated my skin so far. I’m interested to see the benefits this has on my skin after much use. nan
