I cannot say enough good things about the product and enough bad things about the packaging. I saw the reviews about packaging and thought it wasn’t a huge deal but it totally gets in the way of using the product. I am constantly finding small flecks of packaging on my skin. I’ll finish the bottle and LOVE how the sunscreen looks on my skin, but I don’t know if I’ll repurchase unless they fix this horrible packaging. Great product, truly awful packaging
