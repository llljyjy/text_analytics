I got this in a Sephora favorites lip pack sampler.  To be fair, I didn’t buy the pack for this but I was happy that this was included because I like the sephora’s in house product line sometimes.   My plan for this balm was I’d hoped it’d be a nice balm to put on my lips while applying my makeup in the morning. So I wasn’t expecting much, just something to hydrate and wipe off before putting on lipstick. This will not work for that nor will it work as a lip balm throughout the day--for me. The balm bullet I got is one of the waxiest and hard lip products I’ve tried in a very long time.  There is no creaminess or softness to be had with what I got.  Also the taste is a plastic coconut taste that even when wiped off remains.  I disliked this so much I’ve thrown it away. Hard plastic-y coconut tasting lip product.
