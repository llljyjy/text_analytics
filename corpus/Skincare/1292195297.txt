I loved the scent and the lightweight formula. However, it pills up really badly, even on bare skin. I immediately had little white flakes pill up on my face and made it look like my skin was peeling off. It also stings my face a little, although itâ€™s fairly mild and goes away after a few minutes. I will definitely be returning as this is not worth the money. Disappointing
