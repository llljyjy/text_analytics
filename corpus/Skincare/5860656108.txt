This product is really nice. The actual formula is smooth, I like the concept of having the products separate until they’re applied, and I definitely saw anti-aging and brightening effects. However the packaging seemed a little cheap, in the pump seems flimsy. For this price point you’d think that the packaging would be a little more sturdy. So smooth and easy
