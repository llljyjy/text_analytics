I received this Hydrating Gel Moisturizer complementary from Influenster and Community Sixty-Six in exchange for my honest review. First, I like the name of the brand and find it meaningful (60 seconds and 66 days is all it takes to form a habit). The packaging has a minimalist color-way, and portrays a green message and I like the QR coding on the package, which was convenient to get more info on the product. It claims to be vegan and has no animal testing. In terms of value I thought the price was a little high for the small amount in the container. I like that the dispenser is a pump-type dispenser, which allowed for better volume control. The direction says to use a pea-size amount but I found it hard to easily glide over the entire face for full coverage, hence I needed more product than recommended. I also didn’t feel the product was gel-like and while initially the application was tacky/sticky like a heavy cream, it wasn’t too hydrating as my face was dry again not too long afterwards. The product is fragrance-free, which means you will be smelling the natural scent of the product, but that did not bother me at all. Overall I thought the price is too high for the amount in the container, especially when I had to use more than the recommended amount. I also didn’t think it was hydrating at all, so I won’t be purchasing after finishing this product. nan
