Definitely recommend! I have major discoloration on my face because of stress related habits, and tried everything besides bleaching which was last resort. I was shocked to notice them almost gone!! My skin tone is almost evened out and it’s only been a week in a half. So far this product has been awesome for me. I really didn’t expect this from any serum. My skin is great and more youthful! I’ll be using this for a while! It’s worth it! So happy #getitfree#trywithtopbox love this serum!
