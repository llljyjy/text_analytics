I absolutely love this toner! I’ve been using for a few weeks now and it makes my face feel so good and it keeps it hydrated. It smells good and it is not thick. I moved to the desert from the South and I need allllllllll the moisture! Kudos to the Sephora employee that recommended it to me. I was so hesitant at first because I’ve not had good experiences with introducing my skin to new products. I may just have to switch to the entire line lol. Moisturized face
