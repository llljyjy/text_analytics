I did not expect much from this product but wanted to try it out and I’m so glad I did. I have sensitive acne prone skin but this didn’t break me out or irritate me at all. I’ve always had redness around my nose and smile lines and after a little over a week I’ve noticed such an improvement! I recommend trying it for sure. Definitely reduces redness!
