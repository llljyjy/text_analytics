Loved this. Left my skin looking plump and glowing. Got used to the smell pretty quickly and it doesn’t smell for long at all. It would not discourage me from purchasing again. It’s just a bit expensive for 1oz. That is the ONLY reason I’m giving 4 stars. And with that being said. Would definitely recommend little pricey but def worth it
