I bought this hoping that it would fade some of the hyperpigmentation I have from acne scars on my chin and nose areas.  It’s been a few weeks and there’s barely a difference?  My main problem with this though is the texture of the product.  Maybe I have a batch that went bad?  Or maybe this is how it’s suppose to be?  But it’s really oily and goopy when it comes out, almost like it’s separated.  I’m not a fan, but I’m going to give it another week or two to see if my scars fade.  Not sure I would recommend it because it’s pricey for what you get, but it seems like this works for a lot of people...worth a try, I guess! Odd texture, haven't seen results yet
