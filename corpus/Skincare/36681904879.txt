it’s meh. i have combination skin and this moisturizer helped me with my oily t-zone, however, if i used only one pump, my dryer areas would get all flaky and feel extremely dry. using 2 pumps helped with that but i went through the product way faster than i thought i would. this lasted me about a month and for the price it’s not worth it. other moisturizers usually lasted me 3 months or sometimes more. it also sometimes burned so don’t recommend it for sensitive skin. nan
