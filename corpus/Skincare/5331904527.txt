I have combination skin that also get dry in the winter months of NYC. This perfectly cleans the makeup off my face without stripping the moisture out of it. It also helps soothe my skins when it’s a little irritated. I also appreciate the fact that it isn’t scented. Highly recommend. So fresh and so clean
