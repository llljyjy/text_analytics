I have tried several different cleansing balms and this one is really good (not in my top 3 tho). I really like that it is polyethylene free, this makes the balm a bit less buttery but it is something Iâ€™m willing to give up. When it comes to removing makeup I think it is good enough, although it takes longer than other balms. Pretty good cleansing balm.
