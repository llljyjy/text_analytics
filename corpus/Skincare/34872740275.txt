Love these retinol peel pads. They do have a slight sting to them which I love. They make my face feel very clean and almost refreshed. I have definitely seen a difference when used with a serum. I have used with for over 3 weeks now and have noticed the wrinkles not be so defined in my face. Would definitely recommend this product. Awesome product.
