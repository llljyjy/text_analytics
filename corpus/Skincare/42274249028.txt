I received this product #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox and I have been trying the wrinkle-correcting serum ohhhhh this serum love it because it absorbs well and the consistency is really good not watery. I used this serum after face wash in the morning and I paired it with winkle correcting cream it makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated for the whole day with one time try and has zero fragrance which is good for me. Thank you clinical. I must have in my morning care routine
