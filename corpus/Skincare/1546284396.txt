I don’t think I’m bougie but this brand has the best hand creams. My husband’s hands get really dry/chapped from work and after using these consistently, he says they significantly healed/improved his skin. They also smell great in my opinion. I make sure to get these when Sephora promos are available so I can pay less as they are pricey but a little goes a long way. Hubby approved
