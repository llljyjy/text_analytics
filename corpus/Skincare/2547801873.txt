I was really excited to receive this product and wanted to love it. But I would not repurchase it. The good? Hydrates my skin okay, packaging looks nice. I love that it’s cruelty free and strives to be environmentally friendly and sustainable. You can open it up by twisting the lid to get the last of the product, though it’s not intuitive to notice or use it that way every day. It smells nice, and my skin texture feels somewhat improved. The bad: The packaging isn’t the most functional. It’s awkward to hold, and using the pump while it’s sitting flat doesn’t work well. Either you get projectile moisturizer, or you have to gingerly hold your hand by the pump. As well, the claims about antioxidants helping counteract blue light and pollution? I could only find one study on it, which was recent and didn’t show that significant of a change to warrant copy on some packaging. In relation to pollution, the only studies I saw were relative to ingested antioxidant supplements. So… not relevant to skincare. Perhaps not an issue to many, but it irked me to read that. Conclusion? Packaging description aside, the product is nice, but not my favourite. I prefer more hydration and found myself topping up with another moisturizer to have this work for me. That said, it would probably suit someone with oiler or balanced skin better than my dry skin. If you can afford the splurge and value sustainable products, I say go for it. Not for me!
