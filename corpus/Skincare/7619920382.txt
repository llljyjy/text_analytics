I really liked this product. It leaves the skin feeling really clean/detoxed but without the stripping sensation that most toners produce. My face actually felt pretty hydrated after using it, so I only felt the need to follow with a light moisturizer (which is perfect for the warmer weather). Would definitely buy again! Pretty nice & soothing
