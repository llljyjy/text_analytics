So far I really like this product! I have dry, sensitive skin, and am typically not a fan of retinol, but this retinol alternative does not agitate my skin in any way. I have used the Herbivore Bakuchiol serum as well, but I really enjoy the creaminess and quicker absorbency of the Moon Fruit. I have been using this every night for a week and have noticed more of an even skin tone, which is a problem area with my skin, and my face and neck feel more supple and firm than when I started. nan
