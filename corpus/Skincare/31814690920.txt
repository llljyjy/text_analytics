I like this mineral powder sunscreen a lot because it must barely takes the shine away and doesn’t make me look dry at all. I don’t particularly like the packaging so I prefer to take off the part holding the powder, dump a small amount into my hand (or whatever you prefer) and then use the brush to dip into the powder and apply to my face. Also- this alone is not enough for sufficient sun protection! It’s perfect if used over a traditional sunscreen and also for reapplication throughout the day. Application Method!
