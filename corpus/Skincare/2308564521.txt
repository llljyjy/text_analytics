my skin drinks this up!  I have very hormonal, acne prone, sweaty, dehydrated skin, and this is the lightweight moisturizer I’ve been seeking for post cleansing.  I’ve tried others (PTR cloud cream, GR plum plump) which leave my skin  oily after an hour- the only thing similar for me so far has been the GR watermelon glow pink juice moisturizer.  A++, great product, greate price point. nan
