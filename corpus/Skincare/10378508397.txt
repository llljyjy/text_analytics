I was pleasantly surprised by how gentle yet effective this night cream has been! While I did receive it for free, I’m not afraid to say when I don’t like a product and have previously. I did genuinely enjoy this product as I found my skin looked healthier with less texture. It didn’t break me out along my chin as a decent amount of products do and I actually found it helped my acne. However, I’m still hesitant to say it’s worth the price. nan
