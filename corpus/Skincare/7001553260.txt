I use a plethora of glow recipe products, from their cleanser to their serums, toner and even creams. I have never felt so let down by a product. No matter what moisturizer I use under this (a gel or lotion) this sunscreen pills. My entire face is covered in white pilling spots. The sunscreen smells nice and feels fine but it is completely unusable. Disappointing
