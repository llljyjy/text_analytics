Let me start by saying that I am not one to splurge on beauty products unless I hear AMAZING things about it. So let me just tell you that after testing a sample of this product for a couple of weeks, I am ready to splurge on the full size product!!My skin is definitely showing signs of “maturing” at forty years old. I have tried a lot of products over the past few years, both high end and drug store (you know the drug store brand commercials…”better than the $100 cream”). Truth be told, none of the products I have tried for my maturing, combination skin, have blown me away. That is, until this little baby came along. It’s weightless, and makes your skin feel soooo smooth. I love that it doesn’t have an overwhelming scent. I am definitely noticing a decrease in fine lines.If you are showing signs of aging skin, give this product a try! Love this stuff!!
