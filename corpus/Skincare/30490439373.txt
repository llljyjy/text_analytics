A gentle fragrance free cleanser that doesn’t upset my skin or cause further acne despite my skin being extremely sensitive. Can be a tad drying when my face is irritated from retinol but doesn’t make the irritation any worse. This is the first cleanser I’ll completely finish and repurchase. The price cannot be beat! nan
