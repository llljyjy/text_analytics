I love this moisturizer. I have very temperamental skin and am always nervous about adding things to my routine. I knew I needed an spf that wouldn’t make my skin more oily or create that white cast since I have pretty dark skin. This moisturizer doesn’t make my skin more oily or too dry , and the fact that it’s spf50 is amazing since I deal with pretty bad hyperpigmentation from past acne scars. I think this is perfect if u have TRUE combination skin. Some people think their skin is oily when it’s actually dry . When ur skin is dry, often times it’ll produce excess oil to combat the dryness. And you may need something a little heavier for moisture than this cuz it is REALLY lightweight. I think that could be where some of the mixed reviews may be coming from. Either way This is a staple in my daily morning routine! I love it It gave what it's supposed to have gave!
