I really really love this product actually. I have acne prone skin and it’s very lightweight that it didn’t feel heavy on my skin. I used before bed and I woke up with very smooth and clear looking skin. I prefer to use this at bed time rather than morning and night because it just fits better into that bedtime routine for me. Def recommend!! Love love love
