I was getting some pretty bad acne with the change of the season and my skin just felt really icky. I have tried many different creams and liquids as a part of my skincare routine to attempt to alleviate it but I ultimately came to the conclusion to try something that works from the inside out. Thats why I wanted to start using this product. I know many people that use HUM Nutrition products everyday and they have always worked for them so I decided to give their collagen tablets a try. After only 3-4 days of using the tablets, my skin has started to clear up and it looks as even as it did in the summer. My skin also feels smooth and hydrated. My favorite part about this product is that it is so easy and fun to consume. I love popping it in my water on my way to run errands or for a quick refresher in the morning. Plus, it tastes amazing! All around I highly recommend this product if you have dry or acne prone skin and I can assure you that I will be repurchasing! Got rid of my acne!!
