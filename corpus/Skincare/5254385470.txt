Confidence in a Cream Hydrating Moisturizer is extremely firming.  I noticed the results close to immediately.  I also noticed a more even skin tone from using it.  It has a tick consistency, but it blends well and absorbs immediately. I would have given it 5 stars but it isnâ€™t extremely moisturizing. Very Firming
