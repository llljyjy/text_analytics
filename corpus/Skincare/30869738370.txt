I recieved this sample as #freeproduct from #tryitwithtopbox in exchange for my honest feedback. The sample size is very small and its hard to give an honest feedback as I used it twice but since I like and trust Clinique products I would say that its a good product to try. It didnâ€™t irritate my skin. Nice cream
