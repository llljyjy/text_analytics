I received a complimentary sample of this to review. It’s good as a last-step nighttime product atop others, as it does well to lock moisture and other products in. I wouldn’t put it under things and it’s not very hydrating just on its own. It does do well to protect from water loss, though. I’d recommend it over more hydrating serums, essences, or even over a facial spray or splash of water. I haven’t noticed any improvements to fine lines or wrinkles, but maybe that takes more time than a sample can do. Good as a bedtime moisturizer
