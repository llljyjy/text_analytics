I received this product complimentary from Algenist in exchange for my honest review. Algenist new GENIUS Liquid Skin Resurfacing 2% BHA Toner gently exfoliates, smooth wrinkles and plumps the skin. N Its formulated with patented and exclusive Alguronic Acid, Vegan Collagen, Azelaic Acid and 2% Salicylic Acid to provide effective exfoliation, reduce the look of pores, help refine texture and evening the skin tone, leaving it purified with a healthy appearance.I love that this product was specifically made for individuals with hormonal skin concerns. This includes blemishes, wrinkles and loss of firmness. Since I am in my mid 30’s this is a really important factor to me. After using this product, my skin is instantly clean and exfoliated without feeling dried out. This product definitely helps get rid of excess oil my cleanser left behind without over stripping. It doesn’t feel harsh in anyway and there are no strong, irritating fragrances. After using this product every morning for several days, I noticed my blemishes slowly fading which I really appreciate. If you have similar skin concerns as myself, I would highly recommend you give this toner a try! Don’t forget your SPF afterwards. Algenist
