The engineering behind the Canopy is so thoughtful and I am super pleased with my purchase. It is insanely easy to clean, which is a huge plus for me since I’ve taken to my old humidifier with a toothbrush before and it is not pretty. I LOVE the puck feature and am very excited to explore the other aromas. I have a stubborn patch of acne on my left cheek and since I’ve been using it at night, I’ve noticed it has cleared up a lot and my skin has brightened. And it’s so cute and not an eyesore on my nightstand! game changer!
