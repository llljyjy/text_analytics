This Kiehls Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution is easy to apply all over or just as a spot treatment. I have anxiety so I pick more than I’d like to admit so my face normally has dark spots and I’ve really noticed a difference while using this solution. Some of my spots are completely gone and some that are definitely a lot lighter. The solution isn’t irritating at all and absorbs pretty quickly. I also don’t have any issues when it comes to scent. Easy to use
