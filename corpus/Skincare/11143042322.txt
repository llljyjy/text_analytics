I am loving this product so far! I like the ingredients in the product and I love the texture of it. Product feels nice to apply- not too thick and not too thin or watery. Sits well under makeup, but still gives a lot of hydration to the under eye area. Will continue to use this! (I was gifted this product to try and review.) Loving!
