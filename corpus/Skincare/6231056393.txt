I received a complementary sample to test and review. I normally use a night cream for my eyes but havent found one that gives any noticeable results on my fine lines so I wasnâ€™t very hopeful.  I was wrong. This eye cream feels silky and absorbs quickly to leave my skin feeling softer. After using this for 14 days, I noticed my fine lines have become less noticeable and the skin around my eyes feels wonderful. I will continue to purchase this once my sample is gone. Love this
