I was really excited about this. I like the foreo face wash device, and they had good customer service when mine broke. But I am not 100% convinced this works for me.I have a cyst that will pop up about once a month around my chin, and embedded white heads. I think those pimple patches work a lot better and faster than this device. I will use this device on the same spot like 3 times throughout the day, and I feel like the cyst isnâ€™t drastically smaller. nan
