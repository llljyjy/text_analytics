Fantastic. Only tanning product I’ll use. Fits my principles, does what it says it will, and lasts forever as you only need a little to see an effect. You use it with your moisturizer so you can continue to use products that you know work for your skin. And given it’s added to moisturizer it’s easy to use all over your body.The only downside is that it can slightly spur on or worsen breakouts but I’m very prone to breakouts and there are few products that my skin won’t react to.Still love it. nan
