The Ordinary’s Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA is amazing. After using it for the last year, my skin is softer, brighter and has less blemishes. I have some freckles from sun damage, and The Ordinary’s Buffet Anti-Aging Serum works well with this moisturizer to give my skin a soft, smooth, more even tone. This moisturizer is a steal of a deal, too! Soft, healthy skin at a steal!
