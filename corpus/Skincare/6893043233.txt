I received this product to try for free in exchange for an honest review.I used the product for a week as directed and did notice that my skin was well moisturized and looked bright. You definitely do not need to use much for day time use as the cream is thick and spreads very easily (kind of like butter but without the greasy feel). It goes on smooth. At night, I used twice as much as a sleeping mask. The product smells great and is rejuvenating in the morning.I don’t like that it doesn’t have anti-aging properties and for that reason will use it more as a sleeping mask a couple of times a week and an “ai didn’t sleep well last night” day cream rather than a daily moisturizer. Smooth cream, great scent
