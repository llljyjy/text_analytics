Unfortunately, for the high price of this serum, I have serious concerns with the ingredient list. The second ingredient listed is denat alcohol, which should never be that high. It’s known for causing irritation and dryness with prolonged use in that high of a mixture (if it was lower on the list, it could be beneficial to deliver other active ingredients, but this isn’t the case). I don’t think I would ever purchase this product for anyone, especially someone with sensitive skin. I did receive the product for free through Influenster. Concerned about ingredients
