This razor is really hefty and is way different than regular razors I’ve used in the past. First off, it weighs much more and it definitely takes awhile to get used to using it. I feel like I have to angle it a certain way in order to get a clean shave. It just doesn’t have that maneuvering ability like other shavers. After I got over that fact and got the hang of it, I actually ended up loving it way more than I thought I would! nan
