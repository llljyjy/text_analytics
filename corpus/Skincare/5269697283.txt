When I received word that I was about to try the New Smart Clinical Repair wrinkle correctingt Cream by Clinique I was very excited. I mean I am coming to an age where I am going to need more and more of this. Do not be fooled by the size of this product, as I was at the beginning. A little does go a long way! It is so rich but fast absorbs into the skin! Where I have seen a MAJOR improvement is around and under my eyes! It is my biggest area of concern and where I am most self conscious of my aging and developing wrinkles. I have been using it for at least 3 weeks now and still have a bunch of product left. I personally do recommend it. I love it!
