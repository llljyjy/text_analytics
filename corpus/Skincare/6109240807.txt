I used this eye cream for three weeks every day.  I used it in the morning and night.  Although it was very moisturizing while I was wearing it, I did not notice any decrease in my fine lines.  It works well under makeup.  If you are looking for a moisturizing eye cream, this works very well.  I just did not see any decrease in wrinkles/fine lines. Very moisturizing
