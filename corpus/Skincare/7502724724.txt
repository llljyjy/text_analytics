Product says it takes three days of consistent use to notice a difference. I used it twice a day for three days. While my skin did feel moisturized, I didn’t notice any visible effect on reducing signs of aging. I have dry combination skin, and I will say this product absorbs quite nicely. It doesn’t sit on top of my skin like some moisturizers/serums, but blends well and absorbs. I loved it as a free product, but probably won’t buy it once I run out. absorbs nicely, but doesn’t reduce signs of aging
