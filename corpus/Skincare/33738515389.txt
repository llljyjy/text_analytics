To start off, I received a free bottle of this serum from “Pinchme” & was ecstatic to try. I had never heard nor tried this brand before, however after researching I looked forward to testing out this product. The bottle came in a box with great packaging, I really loved the name,”ILIA” because it is definitely unique and stands out. I love to wear makeup & do skincare routines trying out several different brands from high-end to low- end with clean ingredients & luckily the serum contained spf 40 which was an added bonus. My first impression upon receiving was the modern, sleek, luxury look of the bottle and it came with a push top to disperse the serum unlike some other similar products. The bottle is very informative as well with a large enough font for consumers to read plus a lightweight size being convenient to carry. Moving along, the shade matched my skin color perfectly. I replaced my current serum with this & have been using for 4 days. I experienced no problems with the push top/ dispersion of product, applied in the morning under my Mac makeup. •liquid texture-watery/runny could have been more thicker •fragrance- n/a not really any smell •ease of application- simpleused an foundation brush/ makeup sponge to apply •two pumps to get an even look •consistent upon each use •no smudging •helped oiliness of skin •faded off at the end of day- didn’t have to remove •look- matte/glittery/moisturized•feel- smooth/ good combination with Mac makeup •no problems with breakouts or anything •spf was very beneficial could tell it was included •high quality/ clean ingredients•better than other serums I have used Things I disliked •texture was too runny/watery •could be cheaper 8 out of 10(10 being the highest) Would recommend to friends and family & purchase in the near future if price was a little cheaper ILIA CLEAN TRIPLE SERUM with 10% Vitamin C|SPF40
