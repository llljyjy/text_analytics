This serum seems to be a winner. I love the smell of this serum. It spreads really well and goes on light and does not feel oily. It has really helped with my darks spot. They got very pronounced after I went to Hawaii and they are almost completely gone in just a couple of months. More pores are smaller and my skin is just more radiant. I like that it is made from natural products. I would definitely recommend this product. All Natural Gem!
