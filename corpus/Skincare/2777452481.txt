I tried Goop Glow Dark Spot Exfoliating Sleep Milk, and I really wanted to like it, but it didn’t work like I had hoped.  I have combination oily skin that is also fair, so hyperpigmentation has always been an issue.  I used the product as directed, and my dark spots didn’t fade.  The product made my skin feel kind of sticky and greasy in the mornings. Not for Me
