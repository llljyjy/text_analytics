I received this complementary from infuenster in exchange for my honest review. I used this while in Boston when it was 6 degrees out and I found it kept my skin very moisturized. It’s very lightly scented which is good if you are sensitive to scents. I haven’t used it long term yet to see the effects there but it does feel very nice and does make my pores look smaller.
