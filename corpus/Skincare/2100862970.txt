I have rosacea and super sensitive skin and I wanted a moisturizer I could use daily that wouldn’t aggravate my skin, but rather calm it down a bit. Enter this cream: at first, I didn’t think it did anything at all, but the more I used it, the smoother my skin got (less texture from the rosacea) and I saw a different in my redness on my face. As soon as you apply it to irritated and hot skin, it’s so cooling and feels so nice! I use it after Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser and it feels great. Also, for the person who said that this is just a more expensive version of Cerave — I disagree. Not all moisturizers work for everyone — for some reason, Cerave doesn’t work well at all with my skin, but FAB ultra hydrating cream truly does soothe it. Worth the price for the tub because I’ve only used about 1/5th of it and I’ve been using it every day for about 3 months now! Worth it! Calms rosacea
