One day at Biossance someone created a decadent, rich cream that works so well, no one had the heart to admit it smells like cow farts.When I got this cream a few weeks ago I was so excited to try it. I put it on and loved it, it’s so rich and deeply hydrating. I checked reviews and saw many complaints about the smell—so weird because it didn’t smell like anything to me.Turns out I had COVID. Now that my sense of smell has fully recovered, this cream does in fact smell horrible. I still give it 5 stars for how it feels and works. Smells like cow farts. Amazing cream but smells like cow farts
