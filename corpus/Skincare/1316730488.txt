I didn’t really feel as though it lasted to it’s 100 hours of moisture. While my skin did feel nice. The product almost evaporated into my skin. So it took quite a bit of product in order to test it on my whole face. Even when I tried with putting serum on first, it was the same result. My skin felt smooth but it didn’t feel hydrated, if that makes sense? My makeup also ended up getting dry patches and looking weird a few hours into my day. Even with my hydrating spray it felt dry. I’m not sure if it was just a weird formulation error but I didn’t really enjoy this. And I think I’m going to stick with what I usually use. My skin just gets really dry so that probably has something to do with it nan
