I was super worried when I realized they were discontinuing the old formula. Especially as someone with acne prine skin. When something works, the last thing you want it to try something new, but ever since I have had this new one, I was have been IN LOVE! It has a think texture, but it is not heavy on the skin. My skin leans more combo as I use topical acne medication. It is just perfect. I use it day and night and have been soo happy with this. Definitely give it a try! Better than the old formula for me!
