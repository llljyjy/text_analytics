I had high hopes for this but I unfortunately have to return it. Two stars for the spray bottle and the aesthetics but it ends there. I tested it on one thigh soon as I got it. I even used the applicator mit from the same brand. Didn’t do squat for me and it also began to stink after an hour. I’ve gotten better results from drugstore self tanners. This is a no for me. nan
