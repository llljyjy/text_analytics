So I used this product every night after I got it and I love it so much honestly. In the cream it self there are some shimmering particles added and it was such a great touch. After I apply this eye cream I can’t stop looking at myself in the mirror because my under eyes are so hydrated and they look so glowy I love it. This product is not too thick and not too thin it’s the perfect consistency for the under eyes. I wake up for work every morning at 4 a.m and my co workers always mention how even though I wake up early I don’t have dark eye circles and how it must be genetics but in reality…. It’s this cream you’ll fall in love
