This is my guilty pleasure. I have rosacea and those flares can come at any time. This is the best cooling, calming spray that actually makes my skin feel and look better. Yes, there are lots of other rose facial mists for a lot less, but they just smell like rose and don’t do anything for my skin. One star off because it’s too expensive, even as wonderful as it is. I stock up during the sales. I wish there was a mini size for my purse. I have the tiny sample one but I’m constantly refilling it. Love it! 1 Star off for price.
