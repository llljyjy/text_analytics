I have combination skin with large pores, my skin can be dull at times and I have minor blemishes. I find this peel helps clean my pores and exfoliates my skin very well, my skin feels much smoother, my pores are clearing up and shrinking and not only have I noticed but others as well have noticed the glow and how moisturized my skin is.This peel has a light lemon scent, it isnâ€™t heavy on your skin and if you are looking for smoother, bright, moisturized and healthier looking skin This is a must have
