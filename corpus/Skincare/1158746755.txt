I’m not really sure that I like this eye balm. I like the concept of it being a a product that is portable and easy to use, but I don’t think this is for me.I don’t typically reach for eye skincare products in a stick form, so I don’t really have anything to compare this with. I do like that this product glides on very easily because I don’t like to tug the skin around my eyes. The eye balm doesn’t really have long lasting moisture, I feel like it’s more of a quick refresher, almost like a face mist but in a stick form for the eyes. The cooling effect is quite nice and it lasted for several minutes before disappearing. The part I didn’t care for was the brightening effect. It’s nice to add a gentle glow around the eyes but if this is a portable product that you can use to refresh the area whenever you want throughout the day, the glow is way too much. Even if I used it twice a couple hours apart, the glow was just too much, mainly because it was also a silvery white frost glow that showed on my skin.I received this for free from Influenster to try and I tried it for a couple weeks before writing this review nan
