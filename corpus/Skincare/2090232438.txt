I’m shocked by the positive reviews on here. This cream just sat on my skin and didn’t absorb nicely. Greasy to the point where I touched my face after an hour and could clearly see greasiness on my fingertips. I think it could be good for night, but no way would I use this during the day. And being on Accutane previously, I’ve dealt with a lot of thick moisturizers but this was the worst. Way too greasy
