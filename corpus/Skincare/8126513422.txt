I love how this feels on my skin! I use it not only on my face, but also on my hands and neck. It took my skin from dry, blotchy, and red, to clear and moisturized. I only have to use a small amount and my skin feels so hydrated for such a long time! The instructions said itâ€™s good for all skin but I find it dreamy for the face. Apparently it can also be used as a mask and I will definitely be trying that out as well! I love that it is multi-use! I highly recommend this amazing balm to  all! nan
