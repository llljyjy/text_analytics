The only reason I’m not giving it 5 stars is because of the price point but this is the perfect skin care item to spoil yourself with imo. This mask is perf to use when your skin is just feeling lackluster. I use mine 1x a week/every two weeks on my rejuvenation days, especially if I haven’t been keeping up with my skincare routine. The AHAs kind of clean up my laziness for the week lol. It definitely gives my skin that glow, though it broke me out the first few times I used it because my sensitive skin was getting adjusted to it. Def worth it!! Umm.. then UMAZING
