Hi Beauties! My name is Jamie and I am a licensed Esthetician as well as a hair and makeup artist based out of Los Angele. I have over twenty years experience in the business and I have a passion for discovering new products! I see a multitude of clients each week so I have the pleasure of trying these products on many different people with different skin and hair types. I am a huge fan of Kosas. I am totally addicted to their gloss and lip balms. I am also a huge fan of toners so when this product arrived I was excited to try it. I am also someone who is so busy I often have to skip some of my skincare steps to get out the door on time. Enter this Kosas spray on toner. I love love love that this is a spray on bottle. I know it sounds crazy that using a cotton pad would take so much more time but it really makes a difference for me on weather or not I will use it. I always feel a little dry after I wash and this is totally the solution. It moisturizes, doesn’t make me greasy, didn’t break me out and is quick to use. Love it! Makes my routine so easy!
