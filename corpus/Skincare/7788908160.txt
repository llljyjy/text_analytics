I absolutely love Farmacy products and this one is my favorite product they’ve come out with. I started using this probably 2 years ago started with the small size and immediately bought the jumbo when I ran out. I have super dry sometimes sensitive skin and this product is so hydrating. The scent is heavenly and subtle and feels like silk on the skin. Definitely my holy grail moisturizer and won’t buy anything else! Honey Halo Holy Grail!
