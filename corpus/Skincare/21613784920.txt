I received this product as part of a free sample program in exchange for my honest review. I have liked using this product I feel that it has helped hydrate my dry skin. I like that it has not broken out my face since I can sometimes be sensitive to new products. The only odd thing about this product is how you dispense it. I tend to spill some when I try to get some out. nan
