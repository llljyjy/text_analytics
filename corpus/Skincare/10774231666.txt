I absolutely love The Ordinary, but this one was a miss for me. I really do not like the oily consistency of this product (I knew it was going to be oily when purchasing, but this is greasy-oily and takes a while to absorb). Despite the 2% concentration, this is a slow-acting solution... my Clinique 1% Salicylic Acid treatment works quicker than this. Three stars for it being somewhat effective--with consistent, daily use--and for having an amazing price point for a 2% Salicylic Acid solution. I will be finishing the bottle since itâ€™s not useless and I hate wasting products, but sadly not a repurchase. Oily and not that effective
