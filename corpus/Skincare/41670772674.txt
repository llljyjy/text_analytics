I received a small sample of wrinkle correcting serum as a #free item from #trywithtopbox. Iâ€™ve only used it three times. The serum has a nice texture. It was not an oily and sticky serum. It is light and easily absorbed by my skin. Being fragance free was one of the best things for me. When I applied it to my skin, my skin became smoother and brighter, but since I only used it three times, I cannot say for sure whether it repaired my wrinkles and fine lines. Good serum
