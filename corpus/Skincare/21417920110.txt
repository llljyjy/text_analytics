This was new & different but I thoroughly enjoyed it!! The mask comes in 2 pieces and is super simple to apply if you follow the instructions. Upon placement it was cooling and it felt amazing!! I kept the mask on for about 15-20 mins. Once I removed it (which was easy/no pain) and rinsed any remaining clay from the mask! My skin felt refreshed and clean.  Definitely and improvement to the green clay mud mask!  I did receive this product complimentary from influenster in exchange for my honest review/ opinion. No mess!...Love it!!
