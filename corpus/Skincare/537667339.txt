I normally like this line, so I was surprised to find that I didnâ€™t like this spray. It was cool and hydrating, but a bit too sticky. Then, instead of the usual Caudalie scent, it was strong and had a chemical-medicine smell to it.  I need to exchange it for the Sephora mist. smelled too medicine-y not very grape-y
