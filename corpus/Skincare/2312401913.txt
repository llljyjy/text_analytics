I was excited to try this but it gave me a TON of milia (some on my lash line - my derm can’t remove them because they’re so close to my eye, she referred me to an ocular surgeon and who the heck wants to do that). Yes I use the smallest amount, I don’t rub, and I recently even started using just on my eye bags (ie avoiding the eyelid, waterline where I typically get bumps). Didn’t matter because nothing would stop them from forming. Regret using this product for this reason nan
