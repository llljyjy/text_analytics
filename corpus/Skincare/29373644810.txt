Don’t get me wrong - I like this product.  It’s something I could live without though.  I bought it on a sale, otherwise the review would be lower.  It does a great job with my blackheads, but I’ve never seen lasting improvement.  By the time it’s time to use this again, I’m right back to where I started.  I haven’t seen anything long-lasting, but it gives awesome immediate results. no long-lasting results
