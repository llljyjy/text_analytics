I do have combination and sometimes sensitive skin so I feel Tula works really good for sensitive skin. My favorite products were the night cream & the wrinkle treatment. These products didnâ€™t irritate me at all or made me break out, and I feel moisturized. The protect + plum hydrating face moisturizer had a weird smell but overall was a good product. Great for Sensitive Skin
