Maybe it’s too early to write a review after few uses but I have sensitive acne prone skin so anything that’s not gonna work shows from first use, I really like how it made my skin feels it’s also very refreshing and the scent is very nice, gave me clear and healthy glowing skin from first use and kept my oily skin balanced thru out the day and my and no break outs! skin felt plumped nourished and hydrated, even at the end of the day my face felt pampered and healthy! It’s definitely a keeper and I will purchase again. Get it and thank me later refreshing and does what it promises!
