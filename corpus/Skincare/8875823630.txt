This really works! I’ve been using ingredients like BP, aha, bha… none of them can quickly get rid off my hormonal acne. Every time when I see small red spot that looks like it’s about to grow to a big pimple, I put on this treatment at night after I washed my face with cleanser. When I wake up tomorrow morning, I can see dramatic difference. The pimple becomes smaller or even just goes away. Works faster than benzoyl peroxide
