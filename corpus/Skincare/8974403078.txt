I have used this product every night for a week and I can say that I absolutely love this product! I did not notice my skin getting better visually but one thing that I could definitely tell was that my base make up is great the day after using the serum over night! Especially since itâ€™s dry these days with the changing weather, my face tends to get dry, but I did not experience that when I used this product! nan
