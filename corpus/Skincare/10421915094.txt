I received this product complimentary from Korres and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This is a lightweight moisturizer with a very slight fragrance. It blends in smoothly into your skin without leaving a tacky feel. I love that it is vegan and silicone free. It works well under foundation as a primer as well. I received a .20ml sample so I didnâ€™t get a full 30 day use out of it, but I did see some slight fading of my acne spots. Overall, it would work best either as a summertime moisturizer or an am moisturizer. Lightweight moisturizer
