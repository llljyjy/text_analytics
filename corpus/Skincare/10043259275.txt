I love this serum, this vitamin C serum helps even out your skin. The consistency is heavier, more like a moisturizer so one pump is enough for me. Even though I have very oily skin, this serum is still great for me because it melts and is absorbed into your skin quickly. Iâ€™ll definitely recommend you trying this serum, I like the consistency because sometimes I like to wear a serum then only apply my SPF. Everyday skincare routine essential!
