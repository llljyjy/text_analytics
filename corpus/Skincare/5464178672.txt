I received a full-sized bottle to use and review from Influencer. I have combo skin and this product left my face “squeaky” clean after use but not “tight”. This product does burn if it gets in your eyes. I do have to extra moisturize after use hence 4 stars. This retails around $47 so I will be looking for a different product that I can give 5 stars. Very Effective
