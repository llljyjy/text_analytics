This product did a good job of keeping my skin hydrated and looking refreshed. I noticed some decrease in fine lines, but nothing major. It does give a nice glow though immediately after use. The smell is nice and light, and the product absorbs well into the skin. Iâ€™m not a huge fan of the packaging, but the concept of mixing the two products together is unique. Good product
