After the AB Rich Cream was reformulated I developed an allergic reaction to the product. I was so upset because the original formula had given my skin an exquisite glow. I also continued to use it. The reaction became so acute that I had to see a dermatologist. The irony, I purchased the Ultimate Soothing Cream and it completely healed my skin. If you have sensitive skin, mild skin issues, etc. this is one amazing product. MIRACULOUS!
