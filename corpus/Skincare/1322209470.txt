Amazing product for anyone with rosacea - In the past I wear foundation every day for the sole purpose of canceling out the redness on my cheeks - I am super hopeful to be able to switch over to this product fully. As much as I love this product I did deduct one star as a larger shade range would be good. Iâ€™m pale but even the porcelin shade is quite dark on me. Hopefully this will be a good match for my summer skin tone. As amazing as everyone says! Rosacea holy grail <3
