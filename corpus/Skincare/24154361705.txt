This sunscreen is really nice for a daily use. It’s not oil-free, but it doesn’t feel oily after applying. You will feel oily for 10min and the skin absorbs well and it looks great. I particularly prefer oil-free sunscreen, but I really likes this Fresh-moisture Sunscreen since keeps my skin safe and moist. It’s very light and mostly for daily use. Since is not water resistant it’s not good to go to the beach or pool.I received as a complimentary gift from Influenster and I love it. I am a shiseido costumer, and I already use their sunscreen. I loved to try this one since I’ve only tried the oil free one. Fresh moisture without oily skin.
