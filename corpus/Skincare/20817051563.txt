I’m a HUGE sunscreen user and have utilized so many this past summer - the main reason i really love this sunsreen is that it’s a MIST! Omg, i’m such a fan of not having to use my hands..i mean where have our hands been when we’re out and about. It does have a floral scent which i don’t mind, but just be aware of this. And also don’t spray directly 1 inch from your face, take your hand far out and spray and move your hands in a circular motion to disperse the spray around your face! Sunscreen mist - aka don't have to use my fingers!
