While this cleanser definitely cleanses, I felt it stripped my skin wayyy too much. For reference, my cleanser for the past year has been Peach & Lily Power Calm Hydrating Gel Cleanser. After I washed my face with this Glow Recipe cleanser, my skin felt tight and dry almost immediately after drying off my face. I never had that happen with my other cleanser, so I’ll be returning this one. Maybe it’s a good fit if you have more oily skin, but for my combination skin, this is a no-go. Also, I think the scent is somewhat overpowering. It doesn’t really smell like blueberries to me, but more like a powdered candy. I wish I had liked it though! I really wanted to like this...
