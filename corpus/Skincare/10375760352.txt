I was able to try this for a month and feel a difference in the smoothness of my skin. I’m out in the sun for hours a day during the summer and my skin stays hot even after I go inside. The cream has a cooling effect, but doesn’t feel sticky. I like that plastic surgeons and dermatologists are behind this formula to provide a super moisturizing anti-aging cream. It lasts throughout the night and doesn’t leave my skin dry or extra oily. The smell is a reminder of an Avon lotion, but the cream works. Works Oily+Sun Damaged Skin
