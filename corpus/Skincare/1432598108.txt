I am a huge Shiseido fan and have been using their products for over 20 years now to cleanse my face. While I like this product because it cleanses well, I feel it leaves my skin a bit dry. I do in fact have dry skin so perhaps this Microfoam is not the best choice for me. The pump makes it extra user friendly! Good product
