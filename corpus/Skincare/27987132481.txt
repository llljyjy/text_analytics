Very lightweight and I don’t mind the scent! I use it daily and have not broken out which is surprising to me since other sunscreens usually cause me to. There were a couple ingredients that the yuka app noted to be bad for you but I am sure it’s very minimal. I would most likely buy again! recommend!
