It does a great job of delivering moisture overnight and my skin still feels supple and hydrated the next morning. It also has a mild but pleasant smell. What I don’t love as much is the texture. It’s a thicker mousse-like cream that sits on the skin and doesn’t absorb very quickly. It mattifies the skin and when I have it on, my skin feels more textured. I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad thing, but personally, I prefer using Kiehl’s Ultra Hydrating Cream, which absorbs more quickly and feels better going on my skin.  I would still recommend this cream, especially if you prefer a more matte look and heavier feel. I also think that I’d likely prefer using this in the winter for more heavy-duty moisture than in the summer when I want something lighter that absorbs quickly. Quality Heavy Duty Moisturizer
