Chemotherapy left my skin dry and dull. Bettering my skin was something that i had as a small goal. After my health improved I began my search for a skincare regimen. I tried two drug store brands and didn’t like the results. I upped my price range and found a product that I still use as a back up but it wasn’t my ‘it’. I decided to visit Sephora and was overwhelmed by all of the skincare products. I honestly chose Tacha because of the display. It looked luxurious and classy. There were two formulas that i was interested in but the Dewy cream costs less. I don’t use any specific facial wash or serums. My simple face routine is the Tacha Dewy cream along with Olehenriksen banana eye cream. These products have completely turned my skin around. I get compliments on my skin all the time. I’m even accused of wearing foundation on the days I’m not wearing any. NOW, when you first put the cream on, it looks greasy aka ‘dewy’. But don’t fret. It melts into the skin leaving a soft healthy hydrated glow. A little goes a long way. I was too excited when I found out it was this year’s birthday gift. The sample consistency is not the same as the jar you purchase but i have gotten the same exact results. The full size cream has a thinner velvety consistency. The sample size was more of a balm texture. I feel like i found my ‘it’ product. I have no desire to try anything new. I absolutely love Tacha Dewy cream
