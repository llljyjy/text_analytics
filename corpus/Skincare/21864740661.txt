Never been an avid exfoliator due to sensative skin but I like this one. It’s very gentle. Removed my Medium coverage makeup with a little scrubbing but I have to temember to rinse this stuff off pretty well. It tends to leave behind these tiny white balls assumed exfoliating properties) if you don’t rinse them off properly. See image 2. But overall, using once daily for almost 3 weeks now, I’ve had no bad reactions but also not any very noticeable changes at all so far either. I’ll just have to wait and see Not bad at all
