I am someone who has never gotten breakouts/large pores or anything of the sort up until about a year ago. I had heard such great things about this product so I wanted to try it and it has not disappointed!! My pores are noticeably smaller after use and my texture/acne is almost gone. I have normal to dry skin and honestly I do not find that it dries me out at all, although I do go in with a thicker moisturizer after use. And I do recommend only using this product max twice a week because it is strong! overall I will definitely be repurchasing !! nan
