Well, I loved this product. But the amount of times you get it delivered and it’s past it’s expiry is unacceptable. I get it says it can come in any colour from blue to dark green.  But receiving a black product with moldy spots throughout it is very disappointing. Sephora needs to keep track of their products. It’s to expensive to always be getting moldy product. Is there any quality control for this product?
