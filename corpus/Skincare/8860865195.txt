i bought this feelin really hopefully after reading all the reviews. i have oily skin and i had finally gotten all my acne under control. i bought this just to rid my face of any dirty and oil after washing my face. this has made me break out sooooo badly. i did not have any acne before using this and iâ€™ve used it about 2 weeks now and this is just not agreeing with my skin. i have acne and red bumps under the skin all around my chin and mouth area. wanted to love it
