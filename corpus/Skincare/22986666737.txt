I liked this moisturizer. It matched my skin tone well, made my skin look and feel smooth. I like that there is sun protection in it. The only thing I did not like was the bottle itself. Unless angled perfectly (which was difficult to achieve), the moisturizer would not come out. It was frustrating every day. Otherwise I liked the product. Good moisturizer
