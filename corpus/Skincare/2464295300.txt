As many other reviews mentioned, and I somehow failed to acknowledge, the container came less than halfway full. The product itself was waxy and firm. Very difficult to get out of this tiny container without using my nails to break off a chunk sufficient enough to then vigorously warm in my hands and press into my face. The rose scent was too strong for my liking, as I prefer my facial products scent-free or nearly undetectable. Did not sink into my skin as others mentioned, but rather sat on the surface oily, waxy, and thick. Luckily I used it as a night time cream, but would never use during the day. Will not be repurchasing and am so offended by the amount of product for the price that I do not plan on purchasing any other CT products at all. nan
