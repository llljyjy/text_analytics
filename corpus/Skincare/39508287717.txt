I have very sensitive skin and my skin looked a bit red anytime I used it. I only used it 1x week and didnâ€™t really notice any significant change except mild irritation, but BHAs and AHAs usually irritate my skin. I might use it again to see/may try it on other parts of my body. Too harsh for those with very sensitive skin?
