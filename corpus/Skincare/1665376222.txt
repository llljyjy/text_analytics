love the product, very moisturizing, easy to blend in and a mineral sunscreen does not leave a white cast, but literally the most useless and horrible packaging. The dropper does not work, product gets stuck and doesnâ€™t come out of the dropper. you have to dump it out onto your hand great mineral sunscreen product, useless packaging
