Iâ€™ve re-purchased over 6 times & always come back for more. I do wish they would make the limited edition size permanent because it is pricey for 3.4 oz, if you have dry skin this is a must to combine with your lotion, it will leave your skin moist and very hydrated. I use this before I tan & I do notice my tan goes on even & no streaking. Worth the Splurge
