For months I’ve been on the hunt for a quality facial sunscreen. I’ve tried many brand and waisted a lot of money. This is now hands down my favorite one. It doesn’t leave my face looking greasy; it also doesn’t clog my pores, resulting in breakouts. I also love that it comes with a small spoon for sanitation purposes that makes it easier to share with others. My New Favorite!
