The Luminous Ceremony cleanser is a nice cream cleanser and is very nourishing. I have sensitive combination skin and my skin felt very soft after washing with this. I also like that it was nourishing and did not dry my skin out. It has a nice light scent as well that reminds me of roses. I like this product and would use it, but I lean towards cream cleansers that have more of a citrus/fresh scent. I only use cream cleansers in the morning as well, as I like to use an oil cleanser followed by a gel cleanser at night, but that is just personal preference.
