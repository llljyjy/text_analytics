First let me appreciate that this works on my sensitive/reactive skin without any irritation, burning or little dots popping up. Second, as a person sensitive to scents, thank you so much for making this with NO SCENT, as I’m sensitive to fragrance on my skin and smelling fragrances due to migraines. This might be the perfect serum for youth! This dried without leaving any sticky residue so you can continue with your routine and apply your other products. I can’t say how it does under foundation as i don’t apply foundation. It feels lightweight on the face, and one pump is enough for my whole face. I applied any left over on my neck and lips (waste not!). I very much like how it left my skin, nice and soft. I would definitely buy this product over and over! Bounce Boosting Serum
