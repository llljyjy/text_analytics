I can’t quite bring myself to give this full stars because it remains tacky on my skin--the tackiness fades a little by about the 10 minute mark but never fully goes away. This means that I only use it on non-work days...when I’m not going to be putting anything else besides sunscreen on my skin. I still do use it then, however, because it works. I have combination skin with a tendency toward sensitivity, but this does not cause redness or irritation (which most other Vit C products cause for me), and it plumps and brightens...I like to think that my 40 year old skin looks like it did in my 30s. : ) Good stuff if you can handle the sticky part. Great for Days Off
