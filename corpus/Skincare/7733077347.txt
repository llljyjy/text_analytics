I blame myself for believing this would be a soap cleanser. It’s truly a balm as the name indicates. It goes on oily and doesn’t fully wash off from the face. I had to use an actual cleanser to remove the oily residue. Not recommended for oily skin types, but a dry skinned person may love this. Too Oily
