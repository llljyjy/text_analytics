I didnâ€™t see results immediately at first. However, I have continued to use it now that it has gotten colder and it is my favorite. My skills feels radiant and it has faded old acne scars. I will most likely use this during the cold months and then use a vitamin c serum during warmer months. I only apply this in the morning with moisturizer and sunscreen and have seen a big difference. Perfect for Radiance
