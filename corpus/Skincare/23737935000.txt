Natural looking! First time using anything like this and I really like it. I use only 1-2 drops on each section of my body including my face and that’s just enough for me. I’m pretty fair and it gives me a nice sun kissed look. Just make sure you evenly rub it out and it won’t be streaky. Also wash your hands right after or the palms of your hands will be very tan lol. I wasn’t thinking the first time I used this. It lasts on me about 3 days maybe even 4 days. I’m going to continue to use this! nan
