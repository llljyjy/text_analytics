Love this! I’ve always wanted to love Laneige products but unfortunately the products I’ve tried always turned out too sticky (aka dewy)? I’m not a fan of having dewy looking skin, because my face gets oily way too quick. This serum is amazing, super lightweight and absorbs into my skin right after I apply it.  Random comparison but I’m a long time user of Tatcha and have always wanted to love their water cream, it’s lightweight but never sinks into my skin.  If you’re looking for a cream/serum that’s lightweight, give this a try! Super lightweight and absorbs well
