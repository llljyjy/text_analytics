While the packaging is luxe this is a no for me. I don’t really care for scented skincare. The rose smell was so strong and kind of like someones grandma honestly. And it is way too hydrating for my oily combo skin. It definitely made me break out. This may be for you, if you don’t have oily combo skin and aren’t acne prone and sensitive like I am. HARD PASS
