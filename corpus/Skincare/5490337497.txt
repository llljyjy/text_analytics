I got a free sample from Topbox for the Clinique Smart Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum. It was alright but I really felt the sample size was too small to really give an honest review. The sample really only lasted 3 nights for me. It is very light, and I find that it did hydrate my skin and absorbed quickly. I think for a better review, and sample should have been given for better results. Shows potential, but needs to be reviewed longer
