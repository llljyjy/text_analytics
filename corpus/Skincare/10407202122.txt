My dermatologist told me I needed a retinol. So, for the past couple of years I’ve searched and bought a couple things to try. As I have rosacea, I have to be careful with how I mix things. I bought the Peace Out retinol with high hopes. This stuff is wonderful! It’s not too harsh, works well with my other products and has really helped me get rid of the ‘rosacea acne’. I love this product and will try my best never to run out! I’m also investing in the under eye retinol stick! Totally impressed! Best Retinol Ever
