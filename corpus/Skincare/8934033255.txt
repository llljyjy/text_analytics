I used this brightening cream after cleansing and toning. It smells so good! Smells just like a fruit loop! The cream is very light and goes on well. It helped to brighten and smooth my face. My face was shiny after applying it! I would recommend it! Use the moisturizer after to get the finished shine and moisture. Great!
