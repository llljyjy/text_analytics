This mask is so gentle, and as soon as I take it off my pores are noticeably smaller and my overall skin texture is smoother. I normally hate clay masks because they’re so hard for me to take off, but I’ve never had a problem getting this one off. I love doing this on Saturday mornings before doing my makeup to go out because of how much smoother my skin is! I love how many uses I get for its price, too. nan
