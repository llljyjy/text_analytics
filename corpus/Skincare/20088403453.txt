Honest review: RECOMMEND I tried using this product every night and I’m almost out of it. I think if I used this product every night, it’ll probably last me 2 1/2 to maybe 3 months. Pros: 1. Reduce blemishes the next day 2. Brightening and glowing skin overtime 3. Good moisturizer 4. Good for all skin types 5. Skin did not purge Cons: 1. Have to use a bit more product ( I have combo but more on the dry side) recommend
