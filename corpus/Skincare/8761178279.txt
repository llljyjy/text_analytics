This cream is incredibly rich and luxurious feeling. It has a great floral scent that isnâ€™t overpowering. Using for a couple weeks caused me to lessen my usual breakouts as well as have healthier and glossier looking skin. The cream soaks into skin easily, leaving no trace or grime behind and is great as base before applying makeup. Beautiful and Effective!
