This is my first time trying a product from Clinique (shocking, I know) and I quite liked it. While the texture is very light and almost like a thin gel, it went on smooth, with almost a light silky feel. It also absorbed pretty quickly which I appreciate.My skin did feel hydrated, which was nice and surprising because I typically donâ€™t hydrators in a gel cream formula to be enough on their own.After using it a few times, I would recommend others to try it as well! Surprisingly refreshing
