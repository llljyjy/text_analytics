Retinol is widely recognized for its proven ability to help visibly diminish wrinkles and firm skin’s appearance. This is my first ever attempt to include retinol in my night skincare routine and it didn’t disappoint me. I have seen visible improvement in the appearance in fine lines over my forehead in just 5 days, as well as a reduction in deep wrinkles around my eyes. We can feel the refined texture after two weeks of nightly use. I have experienced the speedy results in my appearance. I love how unique the dispensing unit was. It allows us to freshly activate the formula by releasing a pure retinol powder capsule into an ultra-lightweight serum base which is pressed down to release the powder in to serum. That’s all it is all ready to use. I use it every night on my clean face just after moisturizing. Very much happy with this Kiehl’s fast release wrinkle reducing serum. It works!
