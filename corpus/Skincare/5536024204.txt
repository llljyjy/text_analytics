Got this as a sample, I don’t like/hate it. It pills off immediately after I put it on, and stings a tiny bit. The smell is nice and doesn’t overpower when on your face. It did make extremely glowy. After 1 hour it’s still on my top skin layer, and is greasy. I have oil skin so maybe it’s not the correct moisturizer for me. nan
