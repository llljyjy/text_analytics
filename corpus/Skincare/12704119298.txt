This is hands down the best lip treatment I’ve ever used!! I’m obsessed with lip masks, lip butters, lip balms… so I have ALOT of them. It’s very thick and a tiny dab is all you need. It feels very nourishing, stays on, and leaves my lips super soft. It has a very delicate vanilla scent. Also, how adorable is the twist up packaging… GENIUS! So much more sanitary! This is one I will forever repurchase. Highly highly recommend picking this one up! Best lip mask EVER
