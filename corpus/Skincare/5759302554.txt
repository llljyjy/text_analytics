ooooh, dreamy. I always have really dry skin right above my cheekbones below my eyes and this fixed that. If I tap that area now I can feel a bounce to the skin.  I researched peptides and they help create a barrier for future daily stress and pollution so even if you don’t see a difference (which I do) you should still consider this as a preventative. It’s white mousse like creamy texture. Dense too so you probably won’t go through it quickly. I’m pretty impressed. nan
