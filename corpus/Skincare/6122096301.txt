From the packaging to the using of this product, luxury and enjoyment is evident. The glass bottle with the iridescent hue and eye-catching box and lettering let you know this is going to be a premium product. The moisturizer works at least as well as my usual moisturizers plus it has anti-aging ingredients. I even noticed that my deeper forehead wrinkles were looking slightly less deep. I like that the product is “clean“ and especially liked how it absorbed completely and instantly. This is the first treatment product I have used that did not leave a tacky or greasy feeling on my face. Yet, I could tell it was moisturizing my skin. Another plus is that it is unscented and non-irritating to my skin. My only negative is the price point. I generally would not spend this much for this type of item. Luxurious enjoyment
