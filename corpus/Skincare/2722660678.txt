This neck serum is next level. I have been enjoying using this serum on my neck down to chest area for maximum hydration and sagging/wrinkle prevention. Although, I do not have any of what wrinkles or sagging yet, I do enjoy the extra hydration that this serum provides. Itâ€™s quite like a cream but gelish consistency and applies nicely on the skin. It sinks in after a few mins. It also has a light fragrance to it. nan
