After giving myself a couple weeks to use The Essential Energy Hydrating Cream by Shiseido, I can confidently conclude that I have finally found the perfect moisturizing base for radiant skin! This product feels deeply hydrating yet breathable as well as provides a skin-perfecting effect. Despite having eczema and acne-prone skin it hasn’t caused irritation or breakouts. I would consider this product worth investing in since it gives a double effect of soothing inflammation as well as provides a plumping effect to my skin due to it’s hylaronic acid content. I could definetly notice an improvement to my skin barrier since I haven’t had stinging, redness or flaky dry skin since I started adding this product to my regimen. I am so happy to have reviewed this wonderful product by Shiseido. Thank you for taking the time to read my review hopefully this was helpful in your search! Perfect moisturizing base for radiant skin!
