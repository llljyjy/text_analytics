I have been using this product for about three weeks, and I love the velvety smooth, lightly scented cream. Although I would prefer an unscented product, the scent is on the light side, which makes it tolerable. I have noticed a small amount of firming in my face. The cream is easily absorbed into my skin, and it leaves it feeling hydrated and smooth. The hydrating effect seems to be long-lasting. Compared to other moisturizers I have used, it performs better than some, and is comparable to a few others. I may or may not purchase this product in the future, depending on the results I see in the coming weeks. I would recommend this product to friends or family if they were looking to try another facial moisturizer. New Moisturizer Delivers
