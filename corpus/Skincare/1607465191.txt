I really wanted to like this. In fact, I wanted to like this so much, I randomly bought it twice within the span of 1 year, not realizing I had used it before and it caused me to break out.I’m a sucker for trying out new skincare products, and was excited for this. I like this Glow Recipe is a female Asian owned brand and wanted to support. Particularly, I was looking for a light moisturizer serum with ceramides & decided to give this a try given the rave reviews. I went to sleep with this, and the next morning woke up multiple white heads on my chin. Since this was the only new skincare product I integrated into my routine, I knew it was the cause, and returned it. Fast forward 8 months, and this time, I’m looking for something to soothe my rosacea + provide some much needed ceramides to my skin. I picked this up at Sephora. This time, super excited that this didn’t irritate my res skin, I went to sleep, only to wake up with a million white heads again on my chin. I then remembered that this only ever happened another time and pulled up my purchase history at Sephora. Sure enough, I had already purchased this previously and returned it for this exact reason. I’m sad this didn’t work out for me, given the great reviews. bought twice - same effects both times
