This product is very VERY thick. I have oily/combination skin and huge poems, and was SO looking forward to seeing results from this stuff! I’m unsure what exactly is going on, but every time I apply this other turns my face bright red for quite a bit. After that, it never seems to absorb into my skin. It feels like a mixture of vaseline and candle wax sitting on top of my skin. I used this without telling my s/o and he immediately asked if hadn’t washed my face, spilled oil/serum/etc due to the greasiness of my skin. This also settles onto my pores and makes them stand out way more than they do with no products at all. This may work for some, but for me, it did not and has not. The only results I’m seeing are clogged pores to high heaven. Made for some,NOT for all
