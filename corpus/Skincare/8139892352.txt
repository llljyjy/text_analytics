I don’t write reviews often, but this product deserves a good one. I’ve been using for a few months or so now, and I’m in love! I’ve been using it mainly as a nighttime moisturizer, but sometimes in the morning if I want a really glow-y makeup base. It’s such a perfect texture and leaves the skin so hydrated and glowing! It has a slight smell which smells nice. This is for sure something I’ll repurchase! So glad I splurged to try it out! HOLY GRAIL
