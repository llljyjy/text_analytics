Saw this product all over insta and tik tok and was so excited because I’ve used the isle of paradise tanning drops forever and thought this would be a great swap that didn’t involve getting it all over my hands. WRONG. Literally zero pigment develops (I have medium olive skin), the sprayer doesn’t push the product out far enough to actually hit your face - it just created a little spritz right by the bottle and sort of drips out. Going back to my tried and true tanning drops! nan
