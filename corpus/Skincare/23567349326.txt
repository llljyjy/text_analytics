I’ve been in the hospital the past week having various treatments including kidney surgery. I got home yesterday and my skin has been ravaged. I just now used my new Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream with hyeleronic acid and all I can say is that my skin now feels absolutely heavenly. Every bit of dryness and redness is gone, and even a rough spot near my mouth where the oxygen mask was placed is better now. Not greasy feeling, not so light that it’s gone the moment it’s placed—it’s just absolutely lovely. Even though my body feels broken, my face is healing. Healing after surgery
