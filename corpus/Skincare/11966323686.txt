I have been using this product for nearly 6 months (still on the same bottle!) and I wonâ€™t go back to any other cleanser. My skin was feeling so dry, irritated, and sensitive last winter and I bought this product in hopes to resolve my skin issues.  Since using, my skin is so hydrated (not greasy at all!), my complexion has never been so clear and smooth. Also used the moisturizer and the combo is perfection. Highly recommend and the price point is great IMO. Best cleanser!
