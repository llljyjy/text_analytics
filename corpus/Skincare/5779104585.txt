This product is light on my face, stayed on during my runs. It feels moisturized and I love the texture when I first apply it on my face, but turns chalky and streaky after a few gentle rubs. Unfortunately it didnâ€™t pass the UV patch test, my uv patch was half translucent but still shows color after application. nan
