I’ve been using this serum for a couple weeks now, so I have a better idea of this serum. I love how this makes my skin feel after using it- it feels so much more hydrated and radiant. In terms of any major changes, I don’t think I’ve seen anything significant. I do enjoy using the serum, but it is quite pricey for $80. nan
