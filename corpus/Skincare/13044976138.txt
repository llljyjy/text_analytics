When I bought this product just a month or so ago because of what it’s marketed for, I didn’t think this product was actually going to do anything and didn’t think I would actually see a difference, but I did! Textured skin has gone down, acne scars have started to fade, skin looks brighter and more even-toned, skin feels more plump and hydrated upon applying, and overall you feel your skin is healthier and nourished. The only problem I had was that it didn’t hydrate for long and by the morning, I would see dry skin again, even while using a moisturizer. Overall, it’s an amazing product and definitely recommend for troubled skin or for skin that has endured some problematic areas, environmental stress or any skin issue and is ready to heal again. This has helped me! nan
