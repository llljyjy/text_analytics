I love this product!! When I switched to this cleanser I didn’t know if it would make me breakout or disrupt my sensitive skin, luckily it did neither. This cleanser prevented me from breaking out, made my skin super soft! I love the texture of the cleanser too, at first it’s gel then when you rubbed it together it turns to a creamy/bubbly consistency. I have normal to dry skin and it didn’t strip my face or make it feel super dry, it felt just right. Would definitely recommend to friends and family! nan
