I had nice smooth skin before using this. I was just interested in starting to add to my skin care. This was the only product I added, so I know this product was the problem. It caused bumps all over my cheeks and jaw just as another reviewer had posted in her fotos. I stopped using it at the first sight of them a month ago. My skin has dried up and peeled twice and still has bumbs. Ruined my skin.
