I absolutely love this product. The consistency is perfect- not too heavy and not too light. My skin is so so dry and sucks up moisturizer immediately.. but I used this for one night and face felt so hydrated and smooth. It also made my face look a lot brighter overnight, as well! I can’t say enough good things about this product. You can tell immediately that it is of amazing quality. I just started using anti aging products in the past few years (I’m 33), and this is, by far, the best moisturizer of this type that I’ve tried. I don’t have many fine lines on my face, but what I did were smoothed out within just a few days of using this.  My skin has never felt so plump and hydrated before! I am going to have to give up a few other things and budget for this, because it’s definitely worth it! The best Anti aging moisturizer I’ve tried!
