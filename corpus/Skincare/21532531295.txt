I received the take the day off charcoal cleanser free from Influenster and Clinique. The packaging was beautiful and the lid works as a mirror! Also, you get a lot of product. The cleanser is 100% fragrance free which is what I look for in a cleanser! It also didnâ€™t leave my face feeling greasy or oily. Now for the not so good, this product was difficult to use. You are supposed to use dry hands and apply to a dry face but the balm itself is dry. It also made my face feel tingly and not in a good way, but I do have sensitive skin. I could definitely see this product working well for someone else! Good, just not for me
