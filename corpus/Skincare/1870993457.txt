I am a big fan of Dr. Gross products and this serum does not disappoint!  Vitamin C is such an important ingredient for adding glow to the skin and this serum has really helped to fade the hyperpigmentation (due to melasma) on my cheeks. Itâ€™s gentle yet effective and a product that I would definitely purchase again! Love this serum!
