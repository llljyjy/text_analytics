I sweat really bad under my eyes and they feel pretty raw by the end of the day. This is probably the first hydrating eye cream Iâ€™ve found that actually deeply hydrates. I love how it melts into the skin under the eye and instantly soothes. My only complaint is that the pump puts out too much and If you accidentally put too much on it just balls up and rolls off (why I gave it 4 stars) Truly Hydrating!
