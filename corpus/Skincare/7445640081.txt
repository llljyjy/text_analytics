I want to start off by saying I have combo skin that leans more on the oily side during warmer months. This moisturizer texture is okay and feels fine on. It has a very strong scent of mint and menâ€™s cologne but it does go away after a while. I stopped using it after 2 weeks since there are moisturizers I like more and are more effective. I feel like this would be better for acne prone or oily skin. nan
