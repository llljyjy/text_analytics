This is a holy grail for me bc it is very moisturizing while being **completely** non-irritating. My skin isn’t the most sensitive but it is quite dry and I love that this formula has no added fragrance (please never change that!!!). This is the first product I apply on my face after cleansing. I just put some drops on my hands and pat it onto my face. Leaving your face damp will help a lot with application. Sometimes I add another layer for more moisture. If your skin is dry like mine, you’ll definitely still need to follow up with a proper moisturizer, but this toner helps SO much with adding hydration to your skin AND it’s not irritating at all. I try to use drugstore products when I can but I have yet to find a toner so moisturizing while still being non-irritating, and that’s why I keep repurchasing. A little goes a long way, I use this almost every day once a day and a bottle will last me 4-5 months. I typically buy two bottles a year directly from the Laneige website because they have a good points system even if you only buy once a year like me. This toner far outperforms their other products (water sleeping mask, lip mask, regular moisturizer). Can’t recommend enough. Holy grail
