I received this product as a free trial to review. The only reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 at the moment is because I do not feel like I’ve had enough time to give this a fair chance and see the ultimate results it could potentially provide. However, the formula is very nice and smooth, it is not sticky or uncomfortable to wear throughout the night. I’m finding the skin around my eyes feel so much softer and have a smoother appearance. From my experience thus far, I would definitely recommend this product. Clinique does it again…
