I was skeptical at first because of the reviews. Don’t let it dissuade you. This lip scrub is AWESOME! I got the rose. I loved it so much I just ordered another rose and a vanilla to try. I’m reaching for this a dozen times a day. Leaves your lips so smooth and just the right amount of balm residue. For the ones writing bad reviews, they must be expecting Guerlain. Sephora products are excellent at the price point. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ROSE SCRUB!
