I have a lot of dark spots on my face due to acne scars so I had to give this product a try. I was gifted by Peace Out Skincare and I have been using it for almost 2 weeks now and instantly saw a difference in the spots. They visibly got lighter. It stings for the first 2 times that you apply but after that its good. The only thing I donâ€™t like is how it smells but but its not really a problem. Would still recommend nan
