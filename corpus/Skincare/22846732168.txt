I was a little nervous buying this without being able to test it first, but luckily it worked out. The smell is great, the mist is fine, AND it doesn’t sting my eyes, which has been a problem with other sprays since I have super sensitive skin. I haven’t applied over makeup, but I have not experienced any breakouts from this. It can look slightly greasy if sprayed too close, but it doesn’t feel greasy at all. nan
