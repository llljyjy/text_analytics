I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox to try for free. This is a brightening glycolic night cream that visibly evens & smooths skin texture. Itâ€™s a thicker cream, which i like because I feel like my undereye areas are actually moisturized. It absorbs well, leaving the skin non greasy. A little bit goes a long way, so a jar of this will last a long time. Night cream
