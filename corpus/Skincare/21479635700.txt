I got this product for free from Influenster for my honest review. When I first started using this product it did make my eyes water and burn a little bit after a few times using it now it doesn’t bother me at all. I love the package and the twist open top. I can’t tell any results just yet but it definitely doesn’t take a lot at all and I absorbs Nicely. I had no idea it was this expensive so Im surprised I’m not more impressed by it. Love the packaging
