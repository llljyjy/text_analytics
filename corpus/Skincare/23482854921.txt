I was skeptical of this product at first, but after using it for a few weeks, I can absolutely notice a difference and so can my wife. It is extremely easy to use; simply apply to your face nightly after washing your face. Only “issue” I would mention is that you have to wear sunscreen daily as this product raises the risk of sunburn. I see this as a positive though because it forces me to wear protection each day which further protects my skin. Pleasantly Surprised
