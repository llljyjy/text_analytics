It has become my favorite cleanser! I have very dry and sensitive skin, it is interesting because it PERFECTLY cleanses and at the same time does not dry the skin. It has a pleasant smell, it is also very pleasing that it does not contain sulfates, it is economically consumed. I would give 1000 stars instead of 5 if it were possible! Best❤️ The BEST!!!
