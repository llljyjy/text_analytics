Everything about this product is amazing, except the price. However, I find it worth the price tag because I have cystic acne, and regular lip balms break me out around my mouth. This lip balm is hydrating, smoothing, and it feels wonderful. The scent isn’t too strong, so you won’t taste the smell when you wear it. It doesn’t break me out either, which is always an added bonus. The tint is also very pretty and natural. Highly recommend! A Must-Have for Those Who Struggle w/ Cystic Acne!
