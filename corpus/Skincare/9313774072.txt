I really wanted to like this product but it was such a disappointment. I took these pills for two weeks and each day I would wake up with severe cramps and stomach aches that lasted for hours. When I stopped taking them I felt immediate relief. I think Iâ€™ll just stick to taking a probiotic. Cramp-O-Mania
