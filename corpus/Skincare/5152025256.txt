PHA + AHA + BHA = a rare and wonderful product! The feel of it on your skin is light, the smell is refreshing, and it’s relatively gentle! I use it every other night and my skin has been totally fine (easily damaged moisture barrier). It’s so nice to not have to Choose which exfoliant you want since this has all 3! Perfect Blend
