Iâ€™ve had this for a little over a week. I get it now... This is not your typical daily sunscreen in my opinion, and if you are expecting it to be that, you will be disappointed. Consistency: If you do not shake it, and I mean shake it vigorously for like a solid minute, then it will be chunky gold flecks and oil. And even after you shake it well it will be a bit chunky but it will dispense more blended than if not shaken. Color: I am a light brown complexion; think Sanaa Lathan. And this is beautiful on my skin. It adds a healthy glow. Not too shiny, and not glittery. Obviously I cannot say what this looks like on other complexions, but if you are similar to mine this should look beautiful on you. Quality: This does not pill on me. With or without makeup on top, I have not experienced that at all. If you are oily, you will likely be oily by the end of the day with this on. Reapplying was not an issue and I did feel it protected me well against the sun when I wore it outside.All in all this is the sunscreen you wear if you want to be seen. You wear this if you want to look extra good, show off a bit, either naturally, or in addition to makeup. A day date, brunch, day party, rooftop , etc., this is the sunscreen you wear. This is not sunscreen you wear to go hiking. Would it protect you, yes, but there are more options that require a bit less maintenance. This is a special occasion sunscreen. I love it and will continue to use it as that AND plan on buying the body version when it drops =) Ok so boom...
