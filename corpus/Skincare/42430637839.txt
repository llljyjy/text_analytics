I received a small mini sample of this product from #trywithtopboxcircle for my honest review on this product. I  was impressed by the lack of fragrance and how light this serum is. I put it on before bed and it absorbed into my skin right away I do also love the fact that there is retinol in this product as well. I was only able to use this product once so I didnâ€™t really see any results but I do like the texture of this product and that it is light weight and scent free. Scent Free and Non Greasy
