The fact that they’re charging over $60 for this product is insane for the amount of product you get… I’m quite pale shade 120N in Fenty, 130N in rare beauty, 112 in Maybelline fit me. While this is a very light coverage tint, it’s still far too pigmented to have only 3 shades. At first, it blended in nicely and matched, but it oxidized like crazy after like 10 mins and looked orange!! It’s truly pitiful that the range is this small…However, despite the texture and ridiculous price, it does feel really nice on the skin it’s a very thin formula that gives a very radiant non greasy glow that I think most people would enjoy (if you’re oily like me, powdering the t zone is necessary). I would’ve really loved this product if it were more like $45 and had a bigger shade range. over priced and not nearly enough shades
