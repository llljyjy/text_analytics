The product itself is OK to good - I was trying to cut down the steps in my AM routine and a combo Vitamin C and SPF seemed great. The texture is a little odd - it doesn’t look mixed correctly when it comes out, but I mix it in my hands to apply. It doesn’t leave my skin tacky, sticky, or shiny which is a miracle for SPF! However, the worst part of this is the packaging. The tiny little pump means product spills either all over the bottle or sprays all over the counter and my clothes. Whatever way it’s distributed inside, I was barely halfway through the bottle and had to tilt it to get product out our it would pump dry. Awful packaging. I tossed the other half. Decent product, awful packaging
