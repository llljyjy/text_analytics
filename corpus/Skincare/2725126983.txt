I was excited to try this product since I’m fair skinned. It came at the perfect time. It is lightweight and non greasy. It has no discernible fragrance. It doesn’t leave a white cast to the skin after application and it layers well with other products and makeup. I will definitely be repurchasing when I run out of this sunscreen. Love this sunscreen!!
