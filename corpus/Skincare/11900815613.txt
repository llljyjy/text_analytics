Been using this for a couple weeks now and Iâ€™ve been seriously enjoying it. I had a little bit of texture on my cheeks and after consistent use, I have a lot less texture and my skin is so much more smooth. I love the consistency and how smooth my skin feels after. Just remember, to use it a couple days a week at first to build tolerance! nan
