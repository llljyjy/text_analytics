I am a big skincare junkie, especially when it comes to sunscreens. I just received the Supergood! Daily Dose Bioretinol + 100% Mineral SPF 40 and I am genuinely surprised. It is a serum like consistency which makes it so lightweight on the skin and the best part is, there is no white cast to it because of the tint of the product. I love the multi use when it comes to this product with the sun protection and the anti aging. 10/10 recommend!! Supergoop did an amazing job with this product!! Sun protection and anti aging? Yes please!!
