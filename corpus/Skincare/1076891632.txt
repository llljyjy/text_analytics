16 nights ago I applied Kiehls Retinol Fast- Release serum for the first time. The product was unique in that I mixed the active ingredient into the base solution. The dispenser is easy to use and you get the correct amount with 2 gentle pumps. The serum easily smoothed over my skin and was absorbed quickly. I have followed it up each night with a thick moisturizer. One morning I noticed a bit of dryness at the edge of my cheek near my nose which cleared up with a little exfoliation and cream. I have taken before and current pictures and while they don’t show any significant change, I feel that my skin is firmer/less crepe-y and that there are beginning signs of Wrinkke- reduction on my forehead. I am 47 years old and I do have prominent ’11’s’ between my eyes and some horizontal wrinkling on my forehead. I also have discoloration on my cheeks which I think this will help with! All in all, I’m very much continuing the use of this product and looking forward to greater skin! Excited for the future
