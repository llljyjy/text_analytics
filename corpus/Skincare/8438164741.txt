I’ve had trouble finding a nice toner for years. I have dry, sensitive, and acne-prone skin. Every toner would either burn my skin or make me break out. I was honestly skeptical about buying this toner because of the price…but I am SO glad I did. It feels amazing on my skin and a little goes a long way. Also I think the best way to apply would be to pat directly onto skin with your fingers. The milky texture makes your skin feel so hydrated & smooth! BEST toner ever for sensitive skin!
