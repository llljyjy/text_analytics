I’ve probably been using this for about a month now to really reap the full benefits of this serum. It comes in this cute red bottle with a pump that distributes the perfect amount of product at once. The smell is heavenly reminds me of sweet roses! The product has a milky liquid consistency and from the moment you make contact it’s all hydration. I incorporated it into my nightly skin care routine and found it works really well along side my other products. After a few weeks I started to notice it made my skin feel smoother, particularly around my under eye area.  When you first put it on you truly feel the plumping affect and if used in the mornings it gives you a radiant glowing look for the day. Plumped, Hydrated and Glowing
