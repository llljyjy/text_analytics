So… I was so excited when I got this cause I wanted to try Lancôme products for a very long time. I’ve tried genefique serum (too much alcohol), I now have the renergie serum which is actually really really nice, and this. Let me start off by stating positives:The feel of it underneath your eyes is beautiful. It feels so silky and luxurious. That’s all for positives. Let get to the negatives:Pricey. Why does this have to be $99 for 15 mls???The fragrance is so strong. I usually like Lancôme’s skincare fragrances but the one in this ESPECIALLY FOR AN EYE CREAM is just ridiculous and unnecessary I haven’t been using it for too long so I’m not sure of how well it works long term, BUT that being said…This has mica right? So much of it actually that of course it’s gonna make your under eyes look brighter because there’s light reflecting on the mica glitters. Like I will put this on and I’ll turn my head to the side and see a bunch of like bright blue mica specs underneath the eye. It’s not the cream that’s making your under eyes look visibly brighter, it’s glitter lol. The reason I gave this 3 stars is because I think it would be gorgeous underneath the eyes under makeup. That’s all maybe not
