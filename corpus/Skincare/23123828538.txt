A bit pricey, but I love this primer. The only thing is that my skin is VERY DRY. With extreme hydration and prep underneath, this primer makes my skin looks like a beautiful matte canvas lol However, I noticed this may be more for people who have oily skin or who donâ€™t have dry skin problem. It does leave my skin more dry and I do notice a bit of cakiness at the end of the day. However, if I prep my skin well, this works so well! I bought a second bottle, but had to return the second bottle as I found more hydrating primer (in case you are curious, Illuminating Primer by Rare Beauty) : ) Still has my first bottle and will be using this when I have the time to properly prep my skin. Love it, but needs a proper prep for dry skin
