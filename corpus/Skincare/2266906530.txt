I got this mask in the fall vib sale as a part of set and used it few times in the colder months and now again that the weather is getting warmer. Works well for me in both seasons. Itâ€™s not overly drying. I love the light scent and the entire experience. U need to rub it gently , let it dry n then wash off with very light scrub. I particularly love the fact it has Turmeric which really does brighten the skin. Will be repurchasing in next fall sale.. I wish Kora would do a set with this n the overnight mask . nan
