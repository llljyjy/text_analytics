I received this Laneige product from Topbox for free in exchange for a review. I was excited because I don’t currently have an eye cream in my skincare routine. I like using it at night before bed. The cream applies easily and doesn’t smell too strong. In the morning after I wake up, I’ve noticed that the skin under my eyes look better and less puffy. I would recommend the eye cream to anyone looking to improve puffiness and dark circles. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Great eye cream
