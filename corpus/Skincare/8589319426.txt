this is my new go-to cleanser, I bought it on a fluke along with the dr.jart cleanser solely because of the price. I was planning to use the dr. jart one as my daily cleanser and this as one to use on occasion when my skin is feeling congested but this has become my daily cleanser! It provides really gentle exfoliation without drying out my skin at all. It literally loosens up the dead skin cells on my face and when I rub my face with my hands they just flake off. I alternate it with the cerave hydrating cleanser in the evening, just to be on the safe side and make sure it really doesn’t dry out my skin/irritate my skin barrier from the daily use, but the way it’s transforming my complexion is blowing my mind. best cleanser of all time on god
