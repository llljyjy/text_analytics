I like it, it makes my skin feel soft and smooth. It reminded me of when I used to use St. Ives scrub, but these physical exfoliants (beads) were finer. The only reason why I deducted a star is because I’m not a fan of the scent - seems kinda strong, maybe like grapefruit but not in a pleasant way? I was gifted this through Influenster, and will use it up, but I’m unsure if I will repurchase or try something else. It seems a little strong, so I would use caution if you have very sensitive skin Good but not for the smell
