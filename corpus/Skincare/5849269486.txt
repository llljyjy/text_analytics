I never wear full-face makeup (or even BB creams) unless it’s a special occasion due to having to deal with breakouts afterwards. I have only used this product a couple of times, but haven’t had any breakouts so that’s a huge win for my easily-clogged pores! Also love the subtle glow and shimmer. nan
