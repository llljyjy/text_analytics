After using this product for the last few weeks, my skin has transformed. Most moisturizers can be boring, but with alpyn products they always find us fun way to make their serums moisturizers and eye creams. I love the hot pink color and the consistency and texture is extremely fun and I love the way it feels on my skin. The name is super fitting because it is extremely bouncy lightweight moisturizing making the skin feel hydrated plump, radiant, glowing and visibly brighter!  Clean skincare is really doing big things in the beauty world! Donâ€™t sleep on any of py products! Do your skin a favor and check them out. Your skin will thank you Holt grail
