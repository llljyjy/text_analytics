I love the Dr. Dennis Gross alpha beta peel pads so I thought I would give this a go. Honestly, nothing wrong, probably, with the cleanser. BUT....I just can’t with the texture! It is so thick and goopy that it doesn’t really feel like it’s doing anything. Additionally I like a cleanser I can use to remove my eye makeup and this says not to go near the eye area with this so I was super stressed while using it that I would hurt my eyes. Just more hassle than it’s worth in my honest opinion. Meh
