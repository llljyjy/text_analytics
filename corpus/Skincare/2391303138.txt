The name says it all! Confidence in a cream is true for this IT cosmetics product. This product costs about 50 dollars but, a little goes a long way.  I wore it first thing in the morning and first thing at night and I didn’t even use a quarter of the product. In addition, I caught my spouse using my product as well so with two of us using it, it was still plenty. When I wear It overnight, I wake up with radiant skin. The moisturizer is very light and doesn’t feel sticky or greasy. It has squalene, peptides, and niacinamide and from experience, the products that I have used that have squalene, always leave my skin looking younger. I wear it all over my face and neck. After 4 weeks of using it, I did notice my skin looked tighter but hydrated.  My skin type is dry so after it dries, it feels like it gets absorbed into the skin so I add additional moisturizer to seal it. Confidence in a jar!
