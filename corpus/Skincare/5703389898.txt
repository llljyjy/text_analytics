Are use the product over a month packaging was OK sleek and modern looking felt more flimsy then the pump I received  with another product, no strong odor sometimes with resurfacing products I get a odor I feel like this helped smooth the lines on my forehead and remove the texture around my nose which is some thing I struggle with in a very dry climate I would purchase it again because it does a good job without drying me out extra. Great for softening texture on the skin Would purchase again - used product x 1 month
