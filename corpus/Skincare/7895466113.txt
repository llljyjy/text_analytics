I really wanted to like the beyond triple serum SPF 40 however it caused me to breakout. The product does apply really smooth however it leaves a greasy feeling when the skin coverage is very very sheer I tried to build it up and it still wouldnâ€™t show.By the end of the day I looked like a big grease ball I would not recommend this at all. nan
