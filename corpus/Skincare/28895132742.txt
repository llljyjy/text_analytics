I’ve been using this a few days now and really like it - it rubs in nicely, and I’m not finding pilling issues at all like I’ve seen others mention. however it’s VERY ’dewy’ feeling and doesn’t really absorb at all - even hours after applying , I can still feel it kind of sitting on top of my skin. gives a very glowy look as described, but I can’t imagine this working well at all for people who already have oily skin. I tried it both with moisturizer underneath and straight onto dry skin, and I didn’t find much difference. on the plus side, I feel like it’d be great for people with dry skin or those who want that dewy glow! very dewy
