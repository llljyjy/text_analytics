I received this product from Influenster and so far 1 of the 2 products I only like from the set that I got. The texture is light and smooth. The only thing I did not like is the scent but it makes my skin feels soft and plumped and brightened. I have a combination skin and this retinol is good for all skin types. I just wished that the price is a little more friendly but I guess itâ€™s worth to try. Not perfect but my skin kinda likes it.
