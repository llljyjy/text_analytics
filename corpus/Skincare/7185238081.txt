This serum is an absolute triple threat! hyaluronic acid, c+ niacinamide and feurolic acid. The bottle is sleek and tall and the pump dispenses all the serums in one small drop. This is perfect if you aren’t sure what serums to use/mix and/or want to do your skincare routine quickly! The serums took a bit of getting used to as my skin is sensitive but I felt it immediately plumped up my skin upon application. The only issue I’d see causing a problem is that the serum is very heavily fragranced…I dont mind it but it is something worth mentioning! I have been using the product for about two weeks and I have noticed some improvement on hydration and texture! Triple Threat
