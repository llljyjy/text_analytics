I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!!I have combination skin so I get random breakouts ALL the time. This week I’ve been breaking out really badly because I’m on my period and it’s day 3, and my breakouts have significantly decreased. My forehead, chin, and temple are has cleared up. I don’t get breakouts on my cheeks as much but I have used them on my cheeks as well. Combination Skin friendly!!
