I am a huge fan of Ole Henrinksen Banana Bright products and this is the first time I am trying the eye crème and I am in love! It’s very brightening and helps smooth my under eyes too! So happy I was able to test this out and have found a daytime eye crème that works on my pesky dark circles. It also helps create a smooth base for my concealer too! Definitely will be repurchasing! nan
