I’ve been using this for a few weeks now. My skin has broken out and is the worst it’s looked and felt in a long time. I have not noticed a change in any of my dark spots. The packaging is unique, but it doesn’t work the best. Pumping the product out of the bottle is not easy and only works sometimes.Overall, I don’t think I’ll be using this product again and wouldn’t recommend. Led to Breakouts
