I like this product, I really do. I have very dry skin and it definitely loves this product. It takes way less than you are expecting to use as a moisturizer (I use it every once in a while before bed). It is the thickness of a balm without all of the weight. It is a little strange, but your skin quickly soaks it up. The only issues I have are the price and the smell. It has a plasticky smell that warms up into a light chamomile scent. It’s gross but I am not super sensitive to smells and can easily ignore it. I would definitely be wary if you are sensitive to smells. The price is high. Yes, the product will last a while but I can’t justify the price. Not with a tube this boring at least. It is a designer item with a designer price-tag but it lacks any elements of showing itself to be designer, which is arguably the reason to purchase designer in the first place. Maybe?
