I would use this as a sunscreen over a moisturizer, though it is extremely moisturizing. I absolutely hate the typical spf smell and this doesn’t give off that same smell, instead it gives off a very citrusy/ lavender mixed with lemon smell that is really strong and lingers throughout the day. This would’ve been perfect if it didn’t have such a strong smell, would’ve been able to use daily. Would’ve been perfect if not for the Strong Smell
