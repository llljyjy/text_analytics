I was super excited to see this great product come across my dashboard! The cream has a airy, lightweight texture and feels silky smooth on my skin. I’ve been using it daily as an added layer of skincare routine including my Retinol cream making it an added bonus that it has the SPF 20 protection. The cream is quick to absorb into my skin and doesn’t leave me feeling greasy or oily. Shiseido was also kind enough to provide not just 1 but 2 jars allowing me to share this great new product with a friend. I received this product in exchange for review from Influenster. Lovely Lightweight Day Cream
