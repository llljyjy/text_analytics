It’s fun. I wouldn’t get this if you are looking for any serious results. I noticed no visible difference after use. But there was a difference in the softness of the skin. I got it to use with my bf and we had a lot of fun. It’s pretty unique and fun to play with. I would only get it if you are looking for something fun and different, not to have visible effects. The magnet came in the small size as well. I feels almost tingly when the magnet pulls off the mask so it’s definitely a one-of-a-kind mask experience. I enjoyed it. Definitely Very Different
