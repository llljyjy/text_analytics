this is my favorite lip balm, i have one in practically each bag and corner of my house! it is creamy, tastes amazing, stays nice, and has a great hint of color perfect for a casual lip look with makeup. i also love using the plain vanilla one on days with no makeup for all of the benefits above with just a glossy finish! obsessed! daily use!
