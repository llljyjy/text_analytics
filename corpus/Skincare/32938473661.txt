This is complimentary from Algenist. I have been using this toner for more than 2 weeks nowand I can see some improvement on my skin. I am a sucker for any product that helps my skinglow and feel smooth. This did not disappoint. I have been using this in my nightly routine since I think it works better to leave it overnight. For the price and the size of the product, I would give it a try! Love it!
