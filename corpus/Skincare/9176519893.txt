I haven’t really noticed a huge difference in my skin while using this. I have not broken out from it which is a plus, as I have sensitive acne prone skin. It is a little sticky like some reviewers have mentioned before, but that would make it a good base for your makeup. If you are not wearing it under makeup, definitely follow with a moisturizer. It is very lightweight and thin, which I enjoy. I think the design of the dropper is a bit odd but I think it was made to get as much product out as you can. While I haven’t noticed much of a difference, it is moisturizing though. Probably better suited for someone looking to reverse aging signs while I am on the preventative side. nan
