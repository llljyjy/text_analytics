It claims to improve your skin within 10 days but I did not notice much of a difference. I do like that it’s a lightweight serum and my skin does feel good after but I don’t think I’d pay $100+ to add this to my skincare routine. It didn’t make me break out but did not affect my skin positively enough for the price tag. Not a “must have” product for me. Not worth adding to skincare routine
