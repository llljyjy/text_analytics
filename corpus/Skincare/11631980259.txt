The artificial fragrance is so unbearably strong. I’ve used it several times but threw the rest out today after I found the texture had clumped and become granulated - really gross and not stable product. it does feel nice going on, but I worry about the strong artificial fragrance and unnecessary chemicals on my face all night. Besides that, this felt okay going on but honestly is NOT as good as Belif ’s overnight mask. That is the most hydrating mask ever and not with irritating unnecessary ingredients like this one. Also would recommend Kiehl’s overnight hydrating mask but that is a different type and feeling. Belif’s mask is closer in the texture of this product but with better (and lasting)  results in my experience. Better go with Belif
