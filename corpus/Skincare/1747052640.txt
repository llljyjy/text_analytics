Was excited to support and try a product made for POC being an Asian gal who struggles with hyperpigmentation/lingering scars after even the mildest break out. I’ve been using the product 2x/day for 3.5 months and saw not even a little improvement. (I’m pretty diligent about reapplying sunscreen every couple hours too). I decided to try using my mom’s leftover Kiehl’s dark spot serum as a comparison and was surprised to see my sun spots and several scars lighten within a couple weeks!Also, as everyone says, this dropper design is frustrating. Eadem’s recent IG tutorial video on how to use it better helped, but it seems like a tutorial shouldn’t be necessary for something so basic?! Ultimately packaging design, lack of effectiveness & price don’t make it worthwhile for me. Tried to love...but just don't!
