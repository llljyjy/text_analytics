Overall, I really enjoyed this product. I have combination skin that is a little bit sensitive and this was a good, gentle exfoliator for me. My face always felt soft and smooth, but not stripped after using it. I also only use it a couple times a week instead of daily. I took 1 star off because the scent was a bit off-putting for me. It reminded me of citrus scented household cleaners, but the scent doesnâ€™t linger once you wash it off. Nice, gentle exfoliator
