I really love this cream. It doesn’t  feel sticky or tacky after applying. My face felt moisturized through out the day. It’s not too heavy or greasy. The only thing that threw me off at first was the scent. From the jar, it’s extremely strong. Once you apply though, you don’t notice it as much anymore. This has definitely become my daily moisturizer and I love it the glow of gives me. The amount given in the jar is amazing! A little goes a long way! nan
