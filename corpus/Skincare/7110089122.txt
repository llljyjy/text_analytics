I wasn’t sure about this at first, but now I’m convinced that this moisturizer is the way to go. I’m late 20s, with generally good skin that is dry as the Sahara. Regardless of what I put on at night I wake up with tight, dry skin. My routine is CeraVe hydrating cleanser, active (2/3 of the time), hyaluronic acid serum, lotion, then a thin layer of aquaphor. Previously my winter lotion solution was CeraVe pm lotion, then their heavy cream, then aquaphor. I’ve tried oils and they just wipe off while I sleep, so the aquaphor seems to work better as an occlusive layer. It was working… ok. But my skin still felt tight when I woke up and I didn’t like just how many layers I had to use to get a mediocre outcome. Cerave is amazing, but I felt like I needed some bigger guns for winter. Swapping out the skin fix cream in lieu of the CeraVe lotion+cream combo has made a difference. It took a few weeks, but my skin isn’t tight when I wake up and it just looks more even. I was expecting instant gratification because that’s usually how lotion works, but in this case, for me, it took a little time for everything to work its magic and improve my skin barrier. I definitely have to use the aquaphor with it, but it works excellently. I would recommend anyone give it a try! Perfect for Winter
