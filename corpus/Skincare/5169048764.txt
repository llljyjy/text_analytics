I’m really impressed with this sunscreen. I am very fair skin that burns easily, so a good sunscreen is really important to me. I also have very dry skin, so moisture is important to me too. Thankfully this product handles both of those concerns. I feel like it gives me good protection from the sun, I haven’t burned while wearing it. It also is very easy to apply, and isn’t greasy at all. I don’t even have to wait for it to soak in in order to apply makeup on top like I do with other sunscreens. It keeps my skin from drying out too much, and it really feels just like a moisturizer both with its texture and once it’s on my face. I didn’t notice any white cast, but I’m not the best judge of that because my skin is very fair to begin with. Great for Fair, Dry Faces
