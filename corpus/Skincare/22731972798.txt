Iâ€™ve been in the market for a long lasting moisturizing face cream for a while, but the common issues I found were that many others are not heavy enough or pill up when used with other products in my skin care routine. I was very happy to find that this cream had none of those issues. It left my skin feeling nice and supple throughout the night, with a healthy glow in the morning. The only reason I am giving it 4/5 is because of the scent. Its just a little bit too strong for me, so I avoid using it in the morning, and instead just use it at night. My Skin Loves It!
