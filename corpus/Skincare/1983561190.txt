I love this Kiehl’s Fast Release Retinol Serum. I love how you mix it together which helps keep it fresh & effective. I keep mine in my fridge. I’ve been using it for almost 3 weeks - my “elevens“ are not as deep, fine lines around my eyes are diminishing & my pores appear a bit smaller. My skin feels plumper & more radiant. I’ve used retinols for years so I didn’t experience any redness or dryness. However this stuff is potent & you truly only need a pea sized amount. If you’re new to retinols, I recommend using it a couple nights the 1st week & building up to more. Make sure you wear sunscreen during the day too! Potent & Actually Works!
