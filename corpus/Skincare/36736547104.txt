I really like this #free product from Topbox that I received in exchange for an honest trial. I have dry/sensitive skin and used this serum after cleansing, as part of my night-time routine.  After reviewing the ingredient list, I was quite impressed - especially with the Hyaluronic Acid, Retinoid and CL1870 Laser Focus Complex (used to boost skins natural collagen). Considering the size of the small sachet sample, that only lasted a several nights, I found this product to be quite hydrating as it left my skin feeling plumped, smooth and refreshed. I also liked how my sensitive skin tolerated this serum. I believe this product could live up to the claims of it being as effective as one laser treatment, on fine lines and wrinkles, after 4 months of use. Hydrating Serum
