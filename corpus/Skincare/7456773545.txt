I give this product 5 stars for makeup removal. It removes makeup effortlessly in 1 wash and that is not always the case for full coverage. It does have added benefits, such as the probiotic, but I don’t notice any significant skin improvements because of it. Also, I love the gel, jelly texture. It’s very soothing to the skin and a little goes a long way. I expect for this bottle to last me for quite some time. It does the trick if you are looking for a clean face without stripping your natural oils! I also have oily skin and it does a good job at balancing my skin to where I have not been super oily! Great Makeup Remover and Leaves Face Squeaky Clean
