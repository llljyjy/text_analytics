I have combo skin my first application left no white cast but the shine this causes was a little too much for me but I decided since there’s no white cast I can work with it. Fast forward 5 hrs later, which is way past suggested time to reapply sunscreen I know, my face is still shiny but not sticky so I reapply & BOOM white cast, so it doesn’t really work for us brown girls. So I will be returning and continue my search. nan
