For those looking for the old, great formula for this lip balm that got changed to a horrible one—look no further. The difference between the nasty waxy ones and the buttery smooth ones is hidden in the number on the clean label. The waxy ones are made with 90% clean ingredients and the nice ones are made with 97% clean ingredients. Thus, if you order from this listing you should be safe—but beware the other lip balm listing!! They brought the old formula back!!
