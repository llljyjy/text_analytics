I’m in love with this glow hydrating mist. It was the missing piece to my makeup regimen. It really brings out my makeup more and makes it last longer throughout the day. I spray before I start and after I’m done. Which I believe seals the deal. If you’re not using Gucci Glow Hydrating Mist. Then what are you doing what your life This seals my makeup perfectly
