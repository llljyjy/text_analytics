I think this is a great product that would work well for a first time user or someone with sensitive skin. I did not experience any irritation or peeling when using this. I have not used it long enough to determine whether it was effective for wrinkles as I think this needs more time to do itâ€™s thing. It did however help reduce my raging forehead breakout. I would like to continue to use this product and add back my regular actives to see what it can do. nan
