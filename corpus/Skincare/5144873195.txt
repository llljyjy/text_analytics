I received this Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream for free from Influenster for my honest opinion. I use this every morning.  The cream has a nice texture and feels very smooth going on. It absorbs quickly. While I feel like it moisturized my eyes nicely, I did not particularly notice the brightening or fortifying that it promised. It is not my holy grail, but I will continue to use it to see if anything changes. Itâ€™s ok.
