As many of the reviews previous to this one, I can genuinely say the new formula is a disappointment. I used to use the original formula for 10 years and absolutely LOVED it. I used to buy it in bulk because I genuinely loved it. Sadly I had no idea the formula was changing and really hoped this would not be as bad as the reviews, but every single review saying it is 1. Hard to wash off 2. Not foaming at all 3. Does not shine your skin like before - was RIGHT. Definitely no longer purchasing this facewash. I tried the Orange extract and if you are a long term customer like me - it is the closest replacement. New formula change - HORRIBLE
