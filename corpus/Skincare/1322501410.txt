This balm makes my skin so soft and moisturized, but takes the makeup off (even waterproof mascara and 24hr. foundation) with ease.  I do like to remove any residue with a light face cleaner such a Cerave just to have the fresh feeling.  I find this products works better than Micellar Water or regular cold cream.  There is a soft and light rose scent, but not overpowering.  The ingredients do not aggravate my sensitive skin.  The look and feel of the product reminds me of coconut oil. Soft and Creamy
