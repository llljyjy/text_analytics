Completely in love! My skin started to turn on me when I started using Tretinoin, I was peeling and breaking out. I normally was doing 5-6 step routines. I saw the ad about going back to the basics, and figured it wouldn’t hurt to try! I picked this up in store and it’s been calming down my skin. I’m still a little dry, but the breakouts have stopped. I’m going to keep using it and hopefully the dryness stops too. I also grabbed the niacinimide night moisturizer and expression line cream, I think those two are my favorite products from the line! super gentle
