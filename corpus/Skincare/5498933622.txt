I usually feel like eye creams don’t work for me, but I was pleasantly surprised by this one! I feel like it actually helped brighten my eye area, reduce my dark circles, and made me look more awake! I love the cooling sensation from the applicator and the packaging (very compact for eye products).The reason I took away a star is because of the dispenser/dispensing mechanism… there’s waaaaay too much product that comes out. For me, half pump is more than enough for both eyes. By doing this, it sometimes dries up in the dispenser part which is annoying. I hate wasting product. Almost perfect
