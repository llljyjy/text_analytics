I received this product from Sephora Collection in exchange for my honest review--Definiteiyl, recommend using this once a week to start off. I use this before bed with a lot of moisturizer. This peel is really great for smoothing out dead, bumpy skin. It leaves a nice new layer of skin in the morning. And i love how my makeup applies. Donâ€™t forget to use lots of sunscreen and moisturizer for your new skin. nan
