Some vitamin c serums are too strong for me so I break out or get irritated. This one was gentle enough to use daily and dried down nicely. I felt like it cleared my dark spots from hyper pigmentation the first night I used it! The only slight con is when you first put it on it has a slight tumeric smell but it goes away fast. I also really like the packaging it comes out of the pump really nice Great non irritating vitamin c serum
