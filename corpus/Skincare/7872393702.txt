I have combination skin, oily T-Zone and dry around the cheeks and chin area. Initially when I was using this cream I thought it was good for the winter because my summer moisturizer couldn’t keep up with the cold winter and the winter was drying out my skin. However, I noticed throughout the day wearing this cream it wouldn’t hold on my face, my cheeks which are naturally dry would feel irritated. I ended up getting a hyaluronic acid serum to use with the  cream to help retain moisture in my skin because the cream wasn’t doing that for my cheeks. But it works really well for my T-Zone on its own. nan
