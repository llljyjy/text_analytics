Bro, don’t do it. I’m so lazy when it comes to self-tanner so I thought this was brilliant. While the tan does look alright, it was SO STREAKY!! It’s hard to apply a tanning butter flawlessly and it left me scrubbing my skin afterwards (and I already had done so before applying). I’ve only used this once, and don’t think I will again unfortunately. I don’t hate it by any means, the application could be part of the problem ofc, but won’t repurchase. nan
