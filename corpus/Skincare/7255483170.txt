I was so excited to receive this in exchange for my review. I really enjoyed sampling this cream but I have such mixed feelings about it. I absolutely love how hydrating and good my skin looks when using it but if I miss it for 2 days then you instantly lose that plump hydrated look. There’s something about the scent that reminds me of a skin so soft product my grandmother used her whole life. I just wish the effects didn’t diminish so quickly. Must use daily
