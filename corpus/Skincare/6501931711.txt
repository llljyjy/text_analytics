I received this product for free from Sephora and exchange for my honest review and I think this is an OK product. This is really thin and texture and doesn’t feel like anything on the skin and I’ve noticed this to be true for most of their serums. This is an anti-aging serum so I don’t expect it to hydrate. But for those of you who don’t layer different serum‘s like I do this might be a problem for you. I didn’t see any improvement on the very fine lines on my forehead but I do think this product unfortunately broke me out along with the other ones from the Sephora collection that I have been trying in conjunction with it. I don’t think this works maybe in a more long-term use I could see more results but it was not the serum for me. Honestly it didn’t do anything for me.
