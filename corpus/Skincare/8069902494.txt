I was really excited to try this cream - it has decent list of ceramides. What else it has? WAX. This cream clogged my pores so badly just in a few days (less than a week!). My face got covered with tiny little bumps. I ditched the cream and they were gone in a couple of weeks. DO NOT RECOMMEND. DO NOT RECOMMEND - PORE CLOGGING
