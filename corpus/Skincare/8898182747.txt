This is my first time using a make up remover that actually takes off All my makeup.  Currently I use one of those magic cloth makeup removers that just use water.  It does an ok job, but I feel I have to rub too hard around my eye area and I never get my mascara off.  Enter this IT brand melting makeup remover.  First, a little goes a long way!   It looks hard in the container, but just rub your fingers on the top and your body heat starts to melt the product.  Use your fingers to rub into your face.  It smoothly rubs in and removes your stubborn makeup in an instant.  It’s oily but I didn’t think it felt heavy on my skin.  It has a pleasant rose scent that smells really nice.   It easily rinses away This product can be used 3 ways depending on what you want.   I used it as a makeup remover but also as a hydrator  by leaving it on my skin for 10 minutes.   You can also add a little water to it and use it as a skin brightener.  My skin is on the dry side, so this product seemed to really help when I left it absorb a little into my skin.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a gentle makeup remover.   I hope that they will also come out with other scents as I’m not really a rose fan. I would love a vanilla scent or brown sugar. Great makeup remover!
