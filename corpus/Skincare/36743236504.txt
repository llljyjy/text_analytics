I really wanted this product to work, seeing as it saves me a step by combining moisturizer and primer. Unfortunately, it didn’t. I have combination skin (oily T zone), acne, and large pores—this didn’t improve any of those things. My face was extremely oily/shiny by mid morning, and my foundation didn’t sit or last well either. I thought I was putting too much on at first (it’s pretty heavy), but even after applying the absolute bare minimum layer, my face was still after a few hours. I don’t want to smother my face with powder every hour, so I think it’s time to find a different product. I’m sure there’s something cheaper that will get the job done. This would probably work fine for you if you have dry to normal skin, but if you’re even a little bit combo/oily, you might want to look elsewhere. Not for Me :(
