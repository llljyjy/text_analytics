The hint of color is really nice and is perfect for medium/darker skin tones, but it’s not really a lip balm. It’s more like a lip gloss and it’s kind of sticky. I find that it doesn’t last very long either - lips feel hydrated while it’s on, but once it wears off, they feel dry again. I wouldn’t recommend it if you’re looking for a lip balm. More like a tinted lip gloss
