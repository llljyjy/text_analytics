This moisturizer is definitely more like a thick cream. It is creamy enough that it feels like it provides a barrier between your skin and the elements. Although it is quite protective, I donâ€™t know if it was moisturizing enough on its own. I needed to layer a water cream before it to make sure my skin felt supple. nan
