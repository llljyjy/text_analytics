I’ve been using these drops for a few years now. They’re great, however, there are a couple things to keep in mind to achieve the best results.1) mix WELL with moisturizer. I just use my finger. Also, I find 2 drops of the medium tanning drops with 2 pumps of my moisturizer (this will differ for everyone based on the moisturizer you use) is perfect for me. 2. Your skin needs to be hydrated. You won’t get an even tan-look if you have dry patches that aren’t hydrated before using these. Make sure your skin is well hydrated for a couple weeks before using these.3. Rub moisturizer tanning drop mixture in to your skin WELL. For at least 30 seconds. If you don’t, you will get dark patches. Also, pay close attention to the laugh lines or other lines around your mouth and forehead. The mixture will sink in to these lines and make dark spots. For example, right around my chin I have a few lines and I get dark patches from the tanning drops if I forget to rub the mixture in really well. You could also use a clean makeup brush for these areas.4. Avoid getting any of the mixture on your eyebrows or lashes!! It will lighten your lashes and brows, similar to how bleach lightens your hair. So unless you want light colored brows, steer clear.Hope these tips help! :-) These dr are great if you follow some simple steps
