This is my second bottle of this and it has become one of my favorite day creams. Itâ€™s got a great lightweight texture, but is still moisturizing enough for my dry skin. I also love how well it wears under makeup and is even great to mix with a little foundation for a quick tinted moisturizer. This always leaves my skin feeling healthy and protected and I highly recommend checking it out! Great Day Cream
