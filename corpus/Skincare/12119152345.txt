So I wanted to love this, but I just didn’t see it producing results. The positives. It goes on smoothly and has no fragrance that I noticed and no funky colors. The negatives. I didn’t see any reduction in puffiness or fine lines. Now I only used it consistently for about a week, but still I just didn’t even see the beginning of a result. I also felt like it left my eye area a tad bit sticky and didn’t absorb well. When I washed by face after using it, I could feel it kind of sliding off if that makes sense. So that leads me to believe it wasn’t being absorbed by my skin. I think this product could use some work in my opinion. Not for me.
