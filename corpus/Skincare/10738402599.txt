This has been a serious staple in my skincare routine, I love it so much. I have very sensitive skin, and this gentle cleanser really removes the dirt and makeup out of my pores at the end of the day without being too harsh on my skin. Lather is nice, and a little goes a very long way! My Favorite Cleanser
