I have been using this product along with the moisturzer and the face mask for about 2 months now and OMG my skin has never looked this good. As a college student I deal with a lot of stress and less than ideal conditions when it comes to my skin. This has been a lifesaver for me. I use it morning and night as part of my skincare routine and itâ€™s just overall a great product. Great at Removing Makeup
