I really wanted this product to work for me :(( I originally tried this due to receiving a trial size version and I loved the way it made my skin feel, so I ended up buying the bigger version only for it to make my skin constantly pile. I tried to minimize the amount I put on and even changed the technique of application by dabbing it in inside of rubbing but it just never changed. I even tried it on without anything else and it still piled. I work just this product on my face to work and every time I accidentally touched my skin i would feel the product pile off. I changed my skincare routine as well by ensuring the other products I used were not the cause of this but still didnâ€™t help. I really wanted to love this product, seeing as the trial size really did wonders. product piled off :(
