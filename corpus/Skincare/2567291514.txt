This stuff is SUPER oily. Even for someone who has dry skin, it was too much. I tried to put some powder after applying the sunscreen but it looks Cakey. Doesnâ€™t work well with some make up products, and tends to pill. You also have to be careful to not apply too close to hairline, otherwise your hair will get so greasy. :(Might use another super hoop sunscreen but this was def not it. nan
