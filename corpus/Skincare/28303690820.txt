I think this is a very nice product! It it very hydrating, it doesn’t peel, and doesn’t leave any white cast. The only downside is the smell! For me, it has quite a strong smell, but it does eventually go away. It also leaves the skin looking a little greasy after application, almost like it’s wet. Some people may like that, and some people might not. Finally, it is a very small bottle for how much money it is! If you are going to get any sunscreen from supergoop, get a different one. But once again, this can totally work for you!! it’s alright!
