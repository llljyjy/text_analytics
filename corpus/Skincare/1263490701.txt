This spray has really been helping the redness I get on my cheeks from using retinol. Itâ€™s refreshing and cooling to my skin.My cats also love it. The spray gets in my hair a bit, and they love smelling my hair and rubbing their faces and bodies all over my head. So be warned that you might start attracting cats. nan
