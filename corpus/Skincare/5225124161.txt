I’m not sure how more people aren’t mentioning this but this product STINKS. I washed twice after just to try to cover up the scent. Yes my skin felt softer after using but it smells exactly like Hair removal products or a perm, and the scent lingered for an entire day even after using lotions with a scent to try to cover up. The only reason it even gets two stars from me is it did show a noticeable visual difference ; but at what cost?!? the SMELL
