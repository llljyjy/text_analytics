I  receive honey wake up honey eye cream gifted by farmacy in exchange for my honest opinion, I love the packaging , it’s heavy and durable glass like with a magnetic with a cute spatula to spoon out your cream with just the right amount of product.The scent is just to die for , it’s mild and sweet like honey but it’s not overpowering it elegant and sweet without being overpowering, this eye cream is quite rich and super hydrating is very gentle enough for your sensitive or dry skin I would highly recommend this for you! It left my skin soft and plump after one use and after using it for a few days I my under eye seems softer and hydrated I’m looking forward to constant use and  long term results . Love
