I’ve been using this product for a little over two weeks now and I can definitely tell a difference. The first thing I noticed within the first 3-4 days was the glow! My skin just had this radiance to it that I love! I then started to notice a change in my gesture. My skin seemed a lot smoother and definitely more hydrated. It just looked super healthy. I definitely recommend trying it. The serum itself is very lightweight and is quickly absorbed into the skin. It’s not sticky at all nor does it have a scent. I absolutely love it! Delivers a great glow!
