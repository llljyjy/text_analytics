This is another good product from Drunk Elephant. I love the brand and have tried almost all their products. This goes on smoothly and absorbs quite quickly although it’s on the thicker side. I’ve noticed that my under eye area is more hydrated and brighter than usual. Not sure if I’d purchase this for $60.00 but will continue to use this daily AM and PM to see if it’s really worth the price tag. Packaging is also on point! Great eye cream
