I’ve been searching for a good vitamin c serum for a while so this was my first time buying this product. I am a big skin care critic and I am very careful about applying “just anything“ on my face. I’ve been using this serum for about 2 months now and let me tell you, this serum is perfectly light weight and makes my skin glow! It doesn’t clog your pores and it’s very breathable. I live in Florida and have dry skin so you can imagine how difficult it is to find the right type of moisturizer esp when I’m outside on a warmer day. This item is pricey IMO compared to the size of the bottle but the product works wonders. I highly recommend this product and will be purchasing again. glad I made the purchase!
