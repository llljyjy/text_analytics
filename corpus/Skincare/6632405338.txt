This cleanser is exactly what the glow recipe family was missing. I find their blueberry cleanser a bit harsh for my skin so I was happy to see this is much gentler. The texture is velvety and doesn’t strip my skin. It also removes makeup effectively, including my mascara. After a week of use, the only complaint I have is that I have to use quite a bit since it doesn’t foam up. An option for sensitive skin
