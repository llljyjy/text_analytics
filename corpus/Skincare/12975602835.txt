So after reading reviews I was a little skeptical about this product. However, I did receive it as a free sample and used it for a week. Within the first week I saw a difference in my skin. The texture wasn’t as heavy and it did look brighter. So I bought the bottle! After 2 weeks I noticed that some of my dark spots were starting to lighten up. now after 4 weeks I see a change my makeup lays smoother on my skin and while my dark spots aren’t 100% gone, I would say they are at least 60% gone. It was definitely worth the money for me! Give it time it works
