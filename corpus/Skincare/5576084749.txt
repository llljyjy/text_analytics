It worked as described. I have combination skin with an oily t-zone. I paired this with the superberry dream mask and did not have any adverse reaction. The only gripe would be the yellow color rubbing off on fabric. The product stained my white robe, but washed right out with no issue. I recommend allowing the product to dry completely before dressing. Overall, I like it.
