I am giving this only 2 stars because,  although the cream is nice,  there is so little in the bottle that if you use it every day (only once) it is gone in 21/2 weeks.  Plus, as one of the reviewers said,  you cannot see how much is left when it is then all gone.  This makes it very expensive. Nice eye cream but the bottle is tiny.
