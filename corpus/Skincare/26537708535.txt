Tried switching to a cheaper sunscreen, broke out and hated the feeling compared to this. Back to buying this one. Great matte finish and adds a bit of light coverage. Perfect since I’m not a makeup person. Just wish I could buy a bigger bottle. Four stars for this reason; it’s expensive for the size. Favorite Sunscreen
