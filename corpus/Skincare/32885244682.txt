I’m currently on my second round of accutane and I have been left with red scaring. My dermatologist Recommended this product and suggested it was safe while on the medication. Ever since I’ve use this it’s only been a week and I see a significant difference in the redness on my face and the scarring in general this is very gentle and is something I’m always going to keep into my routine AMAZING
