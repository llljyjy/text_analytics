Its great if you’re looking for a rich moisturizing cream for under $20. There is a small amount of fragrance but not perfumey, my skin does feel super soft after use but I’ve finished the whole bottle and not noticing anything special happening with my skin - Mind you it’s not breaking me out either. I loved the packaging but the pump was faulty and i had to find alternatives to apply the cream so I didn’t have to put my fingers inside, i hate having to put my hand to take the cream from the jar and specifically bought this because it had a pump applicator. For that alone I’m giving 3 stars instead of 4. good product but faulty pump
