I love all my other Kiehl’s products and find them to be great for my combination somewhat sensitive skin. However, this specific product burns when I apply it to my face. Specifically around my nose and jawline. I’ve tried using it several times and I cannot get past it. It’s so uncomfortable. I’m surprised because I do not have any issues with the eye cream version of this. I received the product as a gifted item so will see if any of my friends can use it without irritation or I plan to just use on my neck and décolletage. If you have sensitive skin I recommend trying to get a sample before committing to a full container. Irritating, Stinging Sensation
