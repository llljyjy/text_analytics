I think that this eye cream is good for what it’s supposed to do. It’s very hydrating, it feels nice around my eye area since that part of my face is sensitive, and it may be a bit watery but nothing too major. Overall, this eye cream gets the job done.However, the one thing that I will knock off a star for is the scent. I understand that it’s supposed to have a cucumber scent, but to me it smells like wet cardboard. Literally, imagine grabbing a cucumber and rubbing on a cardboard box, that’s what it smells like to me. nan
