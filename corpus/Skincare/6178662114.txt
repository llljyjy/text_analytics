I have been using this for about 5 months now and I love it! It is on the pricey side, but I do think it is worth it for my super dry and acne prone skin! I use it in my morning and night skin cycling routine and it leaves my skin glowing! It has such a rich, creamy texture and feels luxurious. I like that doesn’t absorb too quickly, but it doesn’t just sit in on top of the skin and make me feel oily. I did find it a little heavy for summer, but it didn’t break me out or anything. So good!!
