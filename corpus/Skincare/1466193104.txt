I loved the “Buffet” product without added Copper. But after finishing it, I decided to try this one (with Copper). Unfortunately, it caused me breakouts after just one time use. I rarely get breakouts (almost never) because I’m on Tretinoin but after using this product one time I woke up with pimple on my forehead. Skipped few days, Pinole went away and then used again. Next morning, I woke up with breakouts on my cheeks. Will be returning. Breakouts
