I have incredibly dry skin and this product is amazing. Before this purchase I had never spent so much on one single product. IT IS WORTH THE $. It is very thick so I like to use it in the winter, sometimes twice a day. I find the pump dispenses more than I need for one application, so be aware. My skin feels soft, hydrated and I have seen an improvement in fine lines. nan
