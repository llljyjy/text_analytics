I received #freeproduct from Topbox in exchange for my honest review. I have acne prone combo skin and Clinique has always been a brand that works for me even though these days I prefer to get products that have more natural ingredients, clean and are cruelty free.Having actually used full sized Smart line products before (in my late 20s) I know it works, however, the new sample they gave me is simply too small to tell whether the quality is still the same (now in early 30s) so hopefully they are as I found the serum rather moisturizing without strong scent and it did not cause breakouts. One thing that deterred me from buying is the price as it is rather pricey. nan
