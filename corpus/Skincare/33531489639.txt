This is the 1st Fenty product I’ve ever tried, & I am so happy with it! I can honestly say I was not let down, or disappointed. I’ve tried a lot of face masks over the years, but cannot recall any one product standing out over any other.. until now. I’m not able to say anything negative about this face mask. It’s wonderful! I enjoy how you activate it on your skin, & it changes colors (letting you know it’s working). I’ve always had difficulties with my skin, especially my face. It’s sensitive, my pores clog easy, & are noticably larger than I’d like them to be, it’s breakout prone, have had issues with redness, & my face cannot seem to make up it’s mind whether it wants to be dry or oily (combination skin). This mask left my skin looking, & feeling refreshed, clean, smooth, as well as hydrated, but not shiny. It did it’s job, as described, & did it really well. I know I shouldn’t be as surprised, or impressed, as I currently am for a product’s description to accurately describe it, but I can’t help it, I’ve been let down many times by other brands/products, & unfortunately, started to assume that was going to be normal for me. Not anymore! I’ve already recommended this mask to my friends, & family, & I plan on being a loyal customer from now on. Finally!
