not a huge fan of these wipes. they do a decent job taking off face makeup, not great around the nose, but decent, but theyâ€™re just not good enough to take off even mascara. i usually have to put lotion or other makeup remover on them to make them work on my eye makeup, and even then end up having to go back with something else. medicore
