As soon as I put this on it instantly makes my face feel slimy. It’s so slick that I can’t tell when it’s been absorbed or not, doesn’t absorb fast, and makes my already oily skin feel oilier. I was excited to try it because it has tons of great reviews, but I guess it’s just not for me. A shame, because $48 is a lot for a tiny amount of product, save your money. slimy & greasy feeling
