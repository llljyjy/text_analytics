I received this product for free as a tester. The packaging is super cute and handy for traveling. I took this set on a trip with me and it was perfect. The peel is gentle and my sensitive skin didnâ€™t react. They have a pleasant fragrance that while not overwhelming, may be undesirable to some. The fragrance did not bother my sensitive skin. It provided enough hydration but I was in a more humid climate than usually dry Alberta, it may not be intensive enough for drier climates. Great for traveling.
