I love the application of this serum, the dropper style is very hygienic. Easily applied, very smooth and absorb fast without the sticky feeling. My skin does feel firmer and smoother the day after. Not sure about if it helps with fine lines because I haven’t used long enough. I will put it as a part of my skin care routine to see how effective it is with fine lines but overall I like it a lot. The only minus star is that I don’t like the smell of it. It is not that bad or anything. It smell fine at first but the second it touches my face it becomes a herbal smell that I am I not fond of. But in my years of using skincare products, the one that does not smell like perfume usually work better. It is tolerable to me now so I will see how it goes Good serum
