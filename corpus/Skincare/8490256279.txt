A mineral sunscreen that does not leave a white cast. I am brown skinned (Mac nc45) and I got this on a whim just to see if I would like it. Consistency is watery or serum like minus being super thick and “siliconey”. When on the face it is similar to any other .. you feel like you have something on your face. This doesn’t bother me because it makes me not touch my face which I think helps me to not pick at breakouts or cause breakouts in general from constantly touching my face. The only thing in the price point… it is quite pricey and if worn everyday this probably won’t last long.. a month give it take with daily use. If you have the money it is worth the splurge to protect your skin and not look like a ghost. Try it, I think you will like it! brown girl friendly
