I received this as a #freeproduct to try. This serum has no scent which is a huge win in my books. I used it as part of my nighttime routine and it worked well with my other usual skincare products. I didn’t have enough product to test long term so can’t comment on improvement in fine lines but it did feel hydrating on the skin. I did feel like I needed to use slightly more product in comparison to my usual routine to get good coverage. No scent! Hydrating.
