I LOVE this. I was having a lot of uneven texture and tone on my skin so I decided to incorporate some vitamin c into my routine. This completely transformed my skin. Everything is smooth and even, and my pores are also less visible. I’m also very sensitive with acne prone skin, and had no reaction to anything in this! Highly recommend!! The bottle seems to also be lasting a long time as well as a little product goes a long way. 10/10 Don’t sleep on this product!!
