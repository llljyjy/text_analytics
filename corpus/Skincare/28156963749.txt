I’m very picky about my face cream, and I have to say, I liked this product! It wasn’t too heavy or greasy feeling once it absorbed, and I was able to wear it under my makeup without it causing any issues. I was out in the sun all summer, and I truly believe it helped keep my skin soft and protected, along with my spf.It really is a great product, and I will continue using it. Recommend! :)
