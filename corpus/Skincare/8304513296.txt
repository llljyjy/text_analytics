I have this a try on multiple occasions. What I liked: the color is a nice sheen nude color that was nice to apply as SPF that did not leave a white castWhat I disliked: it pilled into little balls every single time and left me with streaks of flaking every single time!!! I applied it alone and it still pilled and flaked! Therefore, because of this alone, I could not wear it. i probably will never buy again
