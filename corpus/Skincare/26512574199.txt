It’s very light weight. Almost more of a gel than a cream. It feels almost like a serum. I do not recommend if you have very dry skin. I don’t have dry skin but this does not feel moisturizing enough- especially if I skip a serum. It’s not greasy at all and goes on smooth. I haven’t noticed any difference in skin appearance. If you’re on a budget, I’d recommend something cheaper. It’s just okay
