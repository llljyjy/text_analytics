If you’re a person who’s never been able to use a cleansing balm/oil or face oil without breaking out this is for you. Over the years I’ve realized any product with an an oleic rich oil  breaks me out no matter how dry and dehydrated my skin is or for how little amount of time it is on my skin. Unfortunately almost all cleaning balms/oils have such oils ( rice bran, sweet almond, olive, almond, apricot, moringa, marula, camellia japonica, and macadamia, just to name a few). So I was delighted to see this has none of those making it great to massage into the skin for as long as I want. I wouldn’t say it breaks everything down but it breaks it down enough to be washed away completely during my second cleanse. If I’m drunk and lazy I’ll just  use this without the second cleansing and it rinses off pretty well with minimal residue so when I wake up the next morning I’ll have little to no pimples. For this who break out from cleaning balms/oils
