This was the first product I’ve used where I had to mix potions together, so that was fun.  It’s a little bit runny once it is mixed, but soaks in without being super sticky like a lot of treatment serums.  I have seen clearer, brighter skin immediately, and subtle changes over the last month using it.  I like that you can see how much is left in the bottle. nan
