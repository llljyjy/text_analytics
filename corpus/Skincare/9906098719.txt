I mean, itâ€™s a decent product and it does make my skin feel smoother and makes it glow more. With that being said, I do think this product is incredibly overpriced. The same results can be yielded with other products (I like the sweet chef vitamin C toner; not sponsored or anything, I think it has similar results for a fraction of the price). I may honestly buy this again just to feel rich, but not because the results are so incredibly good or whatever nan
