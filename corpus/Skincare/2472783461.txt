I received a small sachet as a #freesample but unfortunately I didnâ€™t see much of a result. I did really like the texture and I do feel like it was hydrating, but it had no effect on my wrinkles. I feel like if I were to use it for a longer period of time, I would be able to tell more. This was lightweight and silky and had a light fragrance. nan
