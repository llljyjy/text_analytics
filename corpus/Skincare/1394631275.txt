This was between a 4 and 5 for me! But, I received this complimentary and want to give an honest review. The bottle is so well designed. As my photo shows, it comes with a metal like dispenser that is cool and soothing when using. It is its own depuffer and would probably be amazing if I had a small make up fridge to keep it in. I saw results too, within the first week. Less bags! It did leave a bit of a sticky residue under my eye though, so I used it at night. My only flaw for the product. But the dispenser makes up for it! Amazing dispenser bottle!
