The Fresh sugar lip balm in Peony was everything I was looking for in a tinted lip balm. The balm is nourishing and not overly thick or too thin. It glides on the lips beautifully, but also not in a messy way. I donâ€™t find it slides around and the tint opacity is just perfect. It makes my lips look better and more defined, making it perfect for everyday wear. This was gifted by Fresh, and I will definitely be restocking on it. nourishing tinted lip balm
