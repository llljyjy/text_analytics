After seeing great reviews, I was so excited to try this product! However, WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE SMELL?? I’ve only used it a few times and have gagged every time.. it smells like burnt hair mixed with some weird cheese! I’m going to try to continue using it but just beware if you’re sensitive to smell, like me! smells awful
