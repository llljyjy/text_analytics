I tried this product thanks to Influenster! Let’s start with the packaging. It looks super cute and original, I was really surprised by this sample. But when using it, it becomes very difficult to extract the serum. It comes out more from one side than the other, it is very difficult to make the “mix“. Leaving this aside, the times that I managed to combine them and put them on, I liked the result and what it feels like on the skin. It feels moisturized and smooth, and it really looks like it’s working. It is a shame not to have been able to test it well due to the logistics of the packaging. nan
