I was gifted this Silk Rice Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil by DAMDAM.  I love that this product is very effective for removing makeup and is gentle on my skin and eyes.  I use it regularly for cleansing and unclogging buildup in my pores.  Itâ€™s very good at hydrating my skin leaving it looking radiant without feeling greasy.  I do like that this product is vegan, gluten-free, and cruelty-free. Great Cleansing Oil
