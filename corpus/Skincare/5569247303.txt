This product can be tricky, but you can have good coverage without pilling. The trick is time. Simple, I know. I do all my usual morning skincare, then walk away for at least five minutes before you come back to apply the sunscreen. The more hydrating my moisturizer the longer it needs time to absorb. After waiting 5-7 minutes, I apply the two fingers of sunscreen and walk away. I need to wait between 10 and 15 minutes before applying makeup. If I still see the cast, I know it’s not ready for makeup. I can say  it always makes my skin look great, but I’m not sure it’s worth the time it takes. Is Worth the Time It Takes
