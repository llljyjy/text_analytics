This product was somewhat unusual/not what I was expecting, but itâ€™s awesome! It comes out as a thin liquid and smooths on with a soft velvety texture. My face was extremely soft and a bit shiny after applying, so recommend doing this one before bed and letting it all soak in overnight. Used in the winter and applied moisturizer over it. Skin is super soft and finally feeling moisturized. Recommend for winter! nan
