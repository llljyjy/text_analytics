this product probably works I noticed it worked well under my eyes it’s just that the texture is so gross I grew to hate this product and never use it. It’s this weird slippery dry oil texture that doesn’t absorb into the skin and when I would rub it in it felt like it was pilling up. It always felt greasy and heavy and I would want to take it off every time I wore it. Feels Horrible
