I received this product in exchange for my honest review. My opinion is my own and based on using this product for 18 days. I really struggled to rate this cream! I have extremely reactive skin that does not normally tolerate a variety of ingredients (especially botanicals and plant oils) and this product had a few I’d never tried. I patch tested first on my arm and face and was thrilled when I didn’t have a negative reaction. That alone makes me want to rate this a 5 out of 5 stars. It’s a beautiful texture and absorbed well. That said, I didn’t notice any of the other benefits listed.I really enjoyed using this cream. As I said, the fact that it helped my dry skin with no irritation is really impressive. I’m not sure the price is justified since I didn’t feel like it provided any increase in radiance, decrease in redness, or reduction of wrinkles or hyperpigmentation. For the cost, I want more than just hydration! Very $$$, For Super Dry Skin
