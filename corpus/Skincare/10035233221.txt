I have to let you know, it’s my first time checking out Retinal. It does have a yellow-ish tint, but that’s normal. they even tell you this on the bottle. It is easy to use, easy to apply. I apply it before bed and then put on the Youth to the People “Superberry Dream Cleansing Balm“ which is a great nighttime mask. First time using it, I wasn’t sure the impact. As I continue to utilize it, I notice each time that it improves the feel of my skin and keeps those wrinkles at bay. Would recommend it. I have oily skin. Check out Retinal!
