This is specifically about the watermelon wipes. They were rough on my face and caused irritation. They had some foam or soapness to them. You definitely need to wash your face afterwards so not great for on the go. I felt like it left a residue on my skin. And it didnâ€™t do the best job removing makeup. Super disappointed. Back to Neutrogena. A million times better. Nope nope nope
