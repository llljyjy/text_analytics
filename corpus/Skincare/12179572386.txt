love love love, i have combined skin(more oily than dry) its hard for me to find a good moisturizer because it turns my skin very oily, and makeup wears off, even when I use a good primer, the base for good makeup starts with your skin routine, and a good moisturizer, and this is amazing, even though it feels tick it blends intoyour skin very well, and looks amazing under makeup, will be buying on my own as this was given to me for free from influenster amazing!
