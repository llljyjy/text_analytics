I am loving this serum that was gifted to me from Sunday Riley! The ingredient list is clean, so I feel great using it on my skin! After a few uses, I have noticed the texture of my skin looking smoother and my pores looking smaller. The only thing is that this serum is a little liquidy and runs out of the dropped but overall a super nice product! Super clean formula!
