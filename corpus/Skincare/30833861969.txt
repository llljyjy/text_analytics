Don’t buy waste of money!! So hard to see where you are spraying the product as the product is clear liquid. It left my skin feeling oily and sticky and also gave me and totally uneven tan. I have been self tanning for awhile so I know what I’m doing this product is very hard to use and the bottle to me felt like it was not even spraying well. Do not waste your money on this. I was very excited to try isle of paradise and am still considering buying the drops but definitely don’t buy this!!!!!!! waste of money
