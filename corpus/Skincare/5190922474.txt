This stuff is not playing around! It definitely feels a little spicy on your face the first couple times you use it, but itâ€™s VERY powerful like I was scraping off rolls of dead skin in the morning after the first use. I saw visible lightening of the discoloration on my cheek after two!! My face also feels a lot smoother to the touch which was unexpected but nice Powerful and effective
