I have been using this oil for over a year. I have worked in skincare as an expert for 17 years. I can honestly say that is a fantastic oil that delivers what it promises! I layer it as a last step before SPF or a as sleeping mask, and it seals in the moisture and keeps my skin hydrated and glowing! This also keeps my micro biome in check. This is, hands down, a must have. When I put this on I am J. Lo in Versace! Glow Like J. Lo in Waiting For Tonight - For Real
