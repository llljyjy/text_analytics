The texture of this sunblock is really nice if you’re wearing it underneath your skincare! The scent is not the best, almost a bit earthy, but it does feel nice when applying it. The formula doesn’t work well under matte liquid foundations, but it seems to work fine with gel-like foundations like Chantecaille’s Future Skin. There’s no white cast and is very breathable which are the two most important qualities in an SPF in my opinion. I tend to be acne-prone and this didn’t cause any breakouts for me. This is something I’d probably use when I’m on the beach and wearing minimal makeup! Or before an outdoor workout. Great for the beach or outdoor workouts
