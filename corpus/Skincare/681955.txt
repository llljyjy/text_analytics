Dr. Zenovia Skincare Bakuchiol Hydrating Cleanser has been a miracle worker for my dry winter complexion. Just a small pump is enough to lather and cleanse my face and neck. It cleanses my skin and removes makeup without stripping oils and making my skin drier. I like the light botanical scent, which is vaguely citrusy. Within just a few days, I noticed my face no longer feels tight after I wash it, and my fine lines are less obvious even before I put on moisturizer. This cleanser contains a host of powerful active ingredients, including Resveratrol, Vitamin E, Green Tea, Bakuchiol and a plant-dervived photoestrogen. All I know for sure is my skin is reacting positively to this product. I love that itâ€™s cruelty-free. Beautiful packaging, too! nan
