I received this product complimentary in exchange for an honest review. I love the creamy texture and how my skin feels. I have very sensitive skin and usually retinol leaves me dry and flaky- so far this hasn’t done that. I’m slowly integrating started at once per week and then every 3 days and my skin is taking well to it. Definitely recommend if you have sensitive skin and are looking for a retinol product. Love so far
