I’ve never seen packaging like this before! It’s a tube, but has a pump on the end. When I first applied it took me about 3 pumps to cover my face and didn’t leave a white cast. For the first few minutes after I felt this hot/ cold feeling as I moved my face but wasn’t hurtful just felt kind of weird. After about 5 minutes it feels like a primer rather than a sunscreen. Great for under makeup
