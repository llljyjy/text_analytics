I’ve always liked Herbivore, and I thought this would be awesome because I’ve liked most of their products with blue tansy. I don’t know what it was about it but I disliked it so much I returned it. Usually I might not love something but I will give it one try. I made it a week and decided I just can’t do it. It doesn’t keep my face from getting super oily, and I think it’s partly due to how it would feel like it never absorbed into my skin. It felt like it just sat on top. Just not for me. Won’t absorb and made my skin oilier.
