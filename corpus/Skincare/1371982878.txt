All my life I have promised myself this cream when I could afford it. I finally bought it about 6 months ago but am disappointed. It has not done anything for my skin and I think it caused some breakouts. Also the whole rubbing it between your fingers thing  is way too much work- I don’t have time for all that! I have dry skin so I thought this would be great but it didn’t even make my skin feel super moisturizer. Disappointed
