Being someone who has naturally pale skin, I have tried many tanning products but have never been satisfied with the outcome. However, the St. Tropez Tan Luxe tanning drops gave my skin a beautiful looking tan with an added lovely glow. I also love how product contains niacin amide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C and E which are all key ingredients that are beneficial to the skin and doesnâ€™t clog my pores. Lastly, I enjoy how this product allows you to control how tan I want my face and body to look by the amount of drops I decide to mix with my everyday face moisturizer. I highly recommend this product. Tanning Must Have!
