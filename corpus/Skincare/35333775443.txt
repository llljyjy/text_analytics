Do not use if you have sensitive skin. If its burning it’s not working, it is irritating and damaging your skin. I used it on my skin for 2 months and my acne turned from a couple of blemishes to a face covered with painful red bumps. While I saw immediate results for the first few applications it really destroyed my skin barrier over time causing more breakouts and since Ive dropped it my skin is starting to look normal again. Everyone’s skin is different so what may work for someone else may not work for you and vice versa. If you want to try this product use very small amounts first. NOT FOR EVERYONE
