I have been using this product for a few weeks and while in the beginning wasn’t a huge fan, I have since realized I was just using way too much product & thus it wasn’t being absorbed completely. So I start this by saying that a LITTLE goes a LONG way and you do not need to use a ton of product for it to be effective, actually I would even say that less works better for me. A finger dip in once is plenty for my face and neck. Just make sure you are allowing your skin to breathe as well. The texture is thick and has no smell at all which is amazing. Container is heavy & made with quality as usual with all Caudalie products I have! Definitely an amazing moisturizer that will hydrate your skin very well. I use it morning and night all over face and neck. This will last me a long long time since I do not need much product. #tryitwithtopbox #freeproduct nan
