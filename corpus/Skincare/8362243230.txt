Super excited to try, because everyone is raving about how smooth and close the shave is. I’ve watched the video multiple times and seem to be following the instructions, but it is not a close shave at all, even after a few weeks to try and get the feel. At this point, I’m having to shave daily to get any sense of smoothness. I do love the concept and the shave pillow is awesome, so I plan to try a little longer, but I suspect I’ll be going back to the disposable razors, those at least give me a close shave that lasts more than a day. nan
