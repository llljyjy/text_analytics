I have very sensitive skin, so when I find a product that my face doesn’t react negatively to I stick with it! This face cream is one of those products. Initially I was a little worried the first time I used it because of the fragrance. I don’t usually do well with facial products that have fragrance. To my surprise though I had no reaction. I’ve been using this in my night and day routine. When I wake up in the mornings my face is so incredibly soft! It has not caused any breakouts. It is is not heavy or greasy which is also a plus for my combination skin. Overall I am happy with this cream and will definitely be purchasing it again! AMAZING!! Definitely a must!
