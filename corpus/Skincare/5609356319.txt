I started using this product and within about a week my mental health plummeted to being absolutely terrible, I didn’t think much of it, just assuming that I was having a stressful time and was depressed so I didn’t see a link to this lip mask, but when I stopped using it all my stress and depression went away, but I also went through the worst most painful dry and cracked lips of my life from withdrawal from it that started a day after quitting, so the benefits weren’t even worth it because you are basically committing to it daily for life.  Shea butter works better than this. wish i could rate it zero stars
