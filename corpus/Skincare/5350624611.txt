I’ve been using this for a couple days and this is a very nice eye cream. it’s very nourishing and plumping. I’m looking forward to seeing its results with my dark circles. it comes with a little stick to apply the product which is a nice touch and great for avoiding putting your fingers into the product. the laneige products I have tried have always been really nice and feel luxurious. #trywithtopbox #freeproduct lovely eye cream!
