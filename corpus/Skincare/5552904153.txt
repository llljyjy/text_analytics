I spent so much money on this product. I was hoping that it would live up to the reviews but it’s sticky, doesn’t soak into the skin, just leaves a greasy mess on the surface. It’s pretty much like any sunscreen. Not special at all. I could have purchased coppertone at the pharmacy to get this result. Do not recommend. Just like any greasy sunscreen
