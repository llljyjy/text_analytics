I got the sweet candy, and the thickness of the mask didn’t feel the same as the Original Berry that I got as a mini birthday gift last year. It felt thinner putting it on my lips, and felt almost like a lip balm rather than a mask. I woke up to my normal lips, it wasn’t moisturizing over night but on the bright side, it smells delicious, you almost want to eat it. However, scent fades quickly on your lips. If you want something aesthetically pleasing and well scented, buy this, but if you want a thick overnight lip mask then I wouldn’t recommend it. Will be returning. meh
