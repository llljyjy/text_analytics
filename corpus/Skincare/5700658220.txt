This is the best vitamin C serum I’ve used hands down. You get noticeable results in a couple uses. It lightens your skin, evens texture and tone, and brightens. But it smells like campfire and barbecue and it is horrendously sticky. The smell never fades nor does the tackiness. I can only use it on days I’m alone at home. I’m sure the powerful ingredients give it the smell, and I’m one that can usually tolerate smells, but it’s just too much. It’s like I put barbecue scented maple syrup all over my face, will not be purchasing again for this reason alone. Otherwise it works super well. Perfect.. but the smell OOFF!
