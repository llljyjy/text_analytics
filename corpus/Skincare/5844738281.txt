I am actually surprised by the bad reviews. I had a sample of this stuff and couldn’t believe how beautifully my foundation looked over this and stayed on perfect all day long. I sweat so bad in the summer that my foundation slides around and comes off, not with this stuff. I use alittle bit and is not greasy on my skin at all! I have dry skin in the winter and super Oily in the summer. This actually makes my skin feel and look matte in the summer. It might actually be to drying in the winter, I’m not sure yet. I have a ton of skin care and Moisturizers and this Is by far my favorite!!! I have tatcha both dewy and water Cream, Clinique, charlotte tilbety magic cream fresh, Dior, and the list goes on and on. I will work out side in the heat all day come home and my makeup has not moved. I like the smell it’s light and not overpowering. I can’t have a strong smell in any of my skincare or makeup. I never leave reviews but was shocked when I saw the bad ones, so I figured I’d share my opinion My favorite absolutely love
