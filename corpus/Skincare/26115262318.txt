I am 50/50 on this product…I have sensitive skin, especially around my eyes, and surprisingly this product did not cause any reaction, which was great, and made my skin feel hydrated! It also wore all under concealer. However after 1.5 months of use, I did not notice that it visibly brightened, or diminished dark circles/crow’s feet. So, if you’re looking for an eye crème that’s is hydrating, this is a good option but there are other cheaper options available for that. nan
