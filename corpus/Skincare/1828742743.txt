I’ve wanted to try this for over 2 years & finally bought it... I am returning this. I am really disappointed. The taste/scent is delicious & yummy -- not too overpowering but also not too weak. I love the smell/taste. But that’s all I love ... this just isn’t worth $22. Does it work? Kinda, but it’s not exceptional & it doesn’t live up to the hype. I’m actually really really bummed about this because I have been wanting to try this for SO LONG. I normally don’t return products, but that’s how disappointed I am. Not worth $22
