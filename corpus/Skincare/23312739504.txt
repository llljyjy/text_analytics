One of the best creams I’ve ever used as far as feel. I put it on my hands after I’ve put on all of my lotions etc. post-shower. I do this because it feels so nice as a top coat. I don’t think it hydrated my skin all that much however, nor does it last for a super long time. I just use it for how incredibly good it feels on my hands. So smooth! luxurious feel
