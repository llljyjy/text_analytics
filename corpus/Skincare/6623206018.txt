I really really wanted to love this so much! Here are the pros, it is an Amazing moisturizer and isn’t greasy or have any weird smells to it. The bottle has such a cute and unique design and that’s a little plus. But honestly besides moisturizing it doesn’t do much else.I have used it for over a week to see if I notice a difference and so far I don’t BUT I’m not giving up yet, I’m going to continue to use and hope to see results soon! I really wanted to love this!
