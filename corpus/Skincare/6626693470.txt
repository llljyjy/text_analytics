I have been battle acne since masks were implemented. I work in healthcare and still have to wear a mask daily. I have very sensitive skin and have never been able to use much on my face. I grew up never having acne my friends always referred to me as having “glass skin” I have spent hundreds of dollars on skin care products since Covid and these outbreaks on my face. These are the biggest game changer to exist. The holy grail. I put one on go to sleep wake up and it’s been completely gutted. Adding the serum to this takes pimples away within two days. Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! The Holy Grail! AMAZING
