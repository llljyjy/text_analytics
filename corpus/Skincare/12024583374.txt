I received a sample of this product in exchange for my honest opinion. Although this sample was small, a little bit went a long way and I was able to get a few days use out of it. The first thing I noticed is that this cream is thick and moisturizing. After applying it at night, my skin felt soft and hydrated the next day. I have combination skin and am prone to milia so I need to be careful of heavier creams. In the short time I used this, it didnâ€™t seem to cause any issues. I would need to use this for a longer period of time in order to truly decide whether this is the best for me. nan
