i absolutely love the Cleaner, Toner/Serum, SPF Moisturizer, and the Bedtime repair Moisturizer. Been using for 2 years now (After using MaryKayâ€™s Timewise set), and the Fenty Skin products win, hands down. I get SOOOOO many compliments on my skin, and how I look 25 (I am 47 yrs old). My skin looks, healthier, refreshed, and plump...side bar: drink your water too! Fenty skin is the best so far!!!!! I used to be a MK girl!
