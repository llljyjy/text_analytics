This serum provides the extra hydration my skin needs during the winter time. I’m surprised how the serum is so lightweight yet it is so moisturizing. I use the serum after toner and before moisturizer and I’m liking how my skin looks—moisturized and plumped. The packaging is beautiful and the dropper makes it to easy to get the right amount of product out. Would definitely repurchase. nan
