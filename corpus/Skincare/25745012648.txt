I am ordering my second bottle.  I love the lightweight, cooling gel.  I have noticed that my lashes look healthier.  I have an eye condition that gets exacerbated by thick creams and this product doesn’t irritate my eyes.  I feel like it does brighten my surrounding eye area, though I don’t have dark circles so can’t comment on effectiveness for minimizing this. nan
