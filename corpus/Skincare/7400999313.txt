I have dry sensitive skin that always feels irritated and tight especially when i come out of the shower. I put the balm on and it helps relax my face so it doesnâ€™t feel tight and my skin no longer feels so stressed! I also love how it is multi-use, I have tried it on dry areas on my hands and it helps soothe my skin while moisturizing it. I would definitely recommend this product especially if you struggle with tight stressed out skin and dry skin as well. versatile balm
