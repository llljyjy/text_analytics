First things first; the consistency is like water. But don’t let that fool you.Review; the Ultimate Essence is far more powerful than the “regular” essence. I had been using the lower intensity of pitera for years in SKII’s Essence. Last year, I took advantage of the 20% off discount and bought the Ultimate. I won’t go back. Though expensive, it truly evens out the fine lines, pores, and texture of the skin over time. You will not notice an immediate effect. But, after 1-2 months, you’ll begin to see a real change in the smoothness of your facial skin. Your skin will become noticeably softer.Hint; get a 1 or 2 ounce eyedropper bottle and pour the product into it. It lasts much longer and keeps the remainder fresh. I use 6 drops over my whole face twice per day- morning and night. The whole bottle then lasts 8 months plus. Powerful and Effective
