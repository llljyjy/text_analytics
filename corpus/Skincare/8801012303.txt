I absolutely loved using this cleansing balm on my face. It cleans it wonderfully and my face feels so soft afterwards. It gets off even the most stubborn makeup, like my waterproof mascara. Itâ€™s super easy to use. I grab a little on my fingers and massage all over my face. I add a little water, massage my face a little more and just clean with some water and my face is clean and refreshed. Clean and Clear
