I received these Peace Out Salicylic Acid Acne Day Dots in exchange for my honest opinion. One thing I love about these is that they have salicylic acid AND retinol in them! Most are just Hydrocolloid which doesn’t really do much to help. I used one last night and my pimple was practically gone by morning! I also like the fact that they are listed as being 61% thinner so you can wear them over makeup. I’ve tried to do these with others in the past and you could always see them. All in all I absolutely love these! I will definitely be buying more when I run out and have already recommended them to others! A must have!!!
