I have bags under my eyes and I love this product because it gets rid of my bags and tightens my skin under my eye.  my co-worker said i look 10 yrs younger and she went out to buy some for herself as well !    however,  the one thing I do not like about this product is that it continues to give me a white film under my eye and its noticeable because most of my co-workers tell me there is white powdery film under my eye.  I try to wipe it off, but then the product comes off.  I try to rub it in as best i can when initially applying it.  i do not wear makeup and so I cannot cover the white film.  sometimes its not so noticeable but some days I have to try over and over to reapply it by taking it off and starting over.  I know you cannot use cream base makeup for this product over it,  but a powder is ok,  but again I dont wear makeup.  but I wish they made this so no white film shows up under my eye.   but the produce works Great !!!  so if you use a powder makeup this would be great for you . ! Tightens my under eye skin
