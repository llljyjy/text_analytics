I received a free sample of this to try out. I enjoyed this it had no fragrance.. It was quite a small size so I canâ€™t really see the long term effect but I did feel it was pretty moisturizing for most of the day. It had a slightly strange consistency but not greasy. I always prefer my moisturizers to have spf but you would have to apply your own sunscreen sadly. Good.
