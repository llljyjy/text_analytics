Pretty gentle as a scrub but just what I was looking for. I was hoping for both physical and chemical exfoliation so I decided to try out the mini version. I really do think my skin looks and feels better, and the smell is lovely but not overly chemical-y. Iâ€™ve been using around twice a week for a few weeks now. Very happy with the product and will likely purchase the larger size. Pricey but my clear skin is worth it to me. Would repurchase!
