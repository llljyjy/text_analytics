Been using for a week and love so far! My skin is very dry so I don’t mind the oily texture this has but just be aware of this if you aren’t into oily skincare. I have been using every morning with a drop of hyaluronic acid and no irritation whatsoever which I am surprised by since my skin is sensitive! I did some research since the ordinary has so many diff vitamin C options and am very happy that I chose  this one. nan
