Now Rhianna...you know dang well “our skin“ needs 50 spf and up, come on now. This would be the perfect lotion/sunscreen if it had enough spf to protect “us“. And we won’t be mad if you put some vitamins or peptides or some’n in there. Girl do better. You a millionaire on our dollar (eye roll) Total dissapointment. You might as well put hand lotion on your face....
