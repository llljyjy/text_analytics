I received these products for free from Influenster and Target in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using this for about 10 days now and have seen a noticable difference in my skin. It’s more hydrated and my pies are almost invisible. A little goes a long way. This formula is not great at all and super lightweight. Very moisturizing without being heavy
