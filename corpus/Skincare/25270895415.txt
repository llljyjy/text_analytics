I received the Estee lauder revitalizing Supreme to test from influencer. This is supposed to lift firm strengthen and radiate your skin. It has a lot of great ingredients like moringa extract, hibiscus morning bloom extract, cactus stem cell extract, hyaluronic acid, and their collagen boosting technology. So for me I liked the product. My skin definitely felt hydrated. The product did not feel heavy on my skin and did not leave it looking or feeling oily. It felt silly and absorbed into my skin well. After a few day I really did feel like my skin looked more healthy. I plan to buy this product again and to keep using it to see how it works on my fine lines cuz I feel like it is helping. Plan to use again
