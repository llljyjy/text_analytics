I LOVE this for my super dry skin. A lot of facial SPFs dry me out, but not this. I use squalene oil already to moisturize my skin, so I love that it’s a main ingredient in this. It leaves my skin hydrated with a nice, dewy glow for a couple hours. The tint blends in nicely, even though it’s not the perfect shade, and covers my large pores nicely.  Highly recommend for dry skin - would not recommend for oily skin. nan
