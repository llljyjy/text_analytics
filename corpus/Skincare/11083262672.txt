This product was easy to use. It absorbs fast and has a soft serum like texture. It was easy to implement at night after washing before moisturizing. It’s made my face bright and reduced the few spots I have on my face. It’s reasonable and works well. Par for the corse with the inkey list. Love how reasonable yet effective their products are!
