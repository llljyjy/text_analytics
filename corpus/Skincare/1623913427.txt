I hated the smell of this product. The fragrance is so strong and lingers for a long while after use. I usually can get over smells, but I couldn’t for this product. The packaging is nice, the texture of the cream is good, and it does sink into the skin nicely. I don’t think that it is worth the price and I probably wouldn’t buy it again even if it was fragrance free. My skin didn’t look or feel any better using it. I also like my “night” moisturizers to be a little thicker. Floral Scent Lingers on Skin
