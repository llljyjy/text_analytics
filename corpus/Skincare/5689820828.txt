I have been using this moisturizer for a few weeks and it is amazing. For context, I have mixed oily dry skin and a mild seborrheic dermatitis and for the past couple of years I have not had any luck with any moisturizers. I am not sure if its just because of this moisturizer, but my skin is hydrated and the redness is not there. Also, it doe not cause my skin to be oily. Honestly, I wish I had found this earlier. Best moisturizer
