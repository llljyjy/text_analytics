I didn’t notice any positive effect after 3 days of using this morning and night. I did however notice that very mild sunspots became large dark patches of hyperpigmentation in that time…. In the middle of winter. It’s been 2 months and they still haven’t faded back. Definitely aged me a lot as I now have age spots! Apparently copper can do that to some people?! nan
