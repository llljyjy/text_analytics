I have very dry skin, so I thought this would be very effective based on the raving reviews. But I found it to be nothing special. It didn’t work well with different SPFs I tried, didn’t really sink into the skin, and didn’t give my skin the moisture it needed. Definitely not worth the price, and I feel you can get about the same or better results using other basic drugstore moisturizers for dry skin. nan
