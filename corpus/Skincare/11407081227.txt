I loved the product when I first bought it. I have been using it every day for the past 6 months and its finally starting to feel empty. I have noticed that I love this product so much more on days when I am wearing makeup. On the days that I don’t, my skin feels sticky. The product feels greasy in your hand, but once on the face, it does not. Nowadays I don’t wear makeup, so I will likely not repurchase this product. I am looking forward to trying the UNSEEN SPF from this brand. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good SPF that will give them a glow under there makeup! Great for under makeup
