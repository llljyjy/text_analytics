I’m very skeptical of any acne treatment because I have very sensitive skin but thought I would give these a try since I got a free sample.  I couldn’t believe they worked!  No redness with the first application and only minor drying when I used a second dot on the same place.  the drying subsided in 24 hours.  I love these! nan
