Love this! I use it 2-3 times a week this summer as I’m out in the sun a lot. Helps to keep the face fresh after sunscreen use and sweating. I have mature skin, in my mid 50’s but I can still break out if I don’t keep it exfoliated properly without drying out.  I use very little...size of half a pea, with water on my hands. This takes care of both face and neck combined. Important to moisturize afterwards! So love this scrub/cleanser!
