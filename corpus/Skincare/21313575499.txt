I honestly don’t understand the hype with this lip mask. For $22 a jar, I was expecting a more luxurious feel and noticeable replenishing results. This is suppose to be super hydrating, but I find I wake up with my lips peeling and they are sensitive as a result. I spend the rest of the day applying a good $5 petroleum based lip balm from the drugstore that gives me better results. However, it smells amazing and the packaging is cute. Too bad that’s the only 2 good things and it doesn’t justify the price. Don’t buy the hype
