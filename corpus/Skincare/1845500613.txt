I have been using this product in the morning and at night for the past 6 weeks and have found that it has brightened up my skin especially coming out of winter. I like that it is not very greasy and absorbs well into my skin leaving it feeling hydrated. The light citrusy scent is nice and not overpowering. I also like that this is a clean  and cruelty free product. The only thing that I didnâ€™t love was the pump mechanism as I found it difficult to control how much product I received, although eventually I was able to adjust the pressure I used to get the right amount. Overall, I liked this and would consider purchasing in the future. nan
