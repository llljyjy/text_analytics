I received this product to review for free but this does not affect my opinion. I am a light skinned gal, with extremely sensitive skin. I religiously use their moisturizer so I knew I needed to try this. I love how it goes on(slight white cast until you rub it in for about 10 seconds then it’s gone.) it’s creamy, soaks in well, not sticky at all! Wears wonderfully under make-up. If you are looking for a wonderful zinc sunscreen here it is! Give it a try! wonderful!
