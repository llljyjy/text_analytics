I was excited to try and add a “green” product to my skincare. Unfortunately this did nothing for me. I don’t usually break out and if I do it’s hormonal but I feel like this emphasized my break outs and made them worse. I have normal-oily skin and have other cleansers that never did this to me. I heard great things but I just don’t think this is the cleanser for me. Made Breakouts Worse
