So to get a few nitpicky things out of the way first- the packaging could be better, mainly because I prefer skincare to be dispensed in a way that doesn’t require me to stick my fingers into it. And the name, to me, is just a bit silly? Confidence doesn’t come from a skincare product, no matter how brilliant it is. That being said, I do really like this moisturizer, so let’s move on to all the positives- I *love* the texture. It’s thick and it applies very nicely and feels soothing on my skin. It does have a faint scent, but I actually don’t mind scents in my skincare, and often prefer it. This one reminds me of the smell of the old school cold creams my mom would apply when I was a child, so it’s honestly kind of comforting. (Your mileage my vary, of course.) I have been applying it at night before bed for weeks now, and when I wake up in the morning my face feels so soft & plump & incredibly moisturized… I’d even go so far as to say it gives skin a youthful glow. It hasn’t caused me to break out at all, and it plays well with makeup (full disclosure- it might help that I also use IT Cosmetics Nude Glow CC Cream as my foundation right now) which is really important to me. I have a full skincare routine and will definitely find a place for it (likely in winter as I think the fact that it’s heavy & very moisturizing will be perfect for the dry harsh conditions here in the Midwest) but I think CiaC would be *especially* great for someone who wants a multitude of benefits from one easy step. I would absolutely recommend this moisturizer and I am excited to try more IT Cosmetics products in the future. It’s giving baby soft glow.
