I received a sample of this product in exchange for my honest review through Influenster. This moisturizer is lightweight, hydrating, and wears well under makeup. It has a pleasant refresh scent. I love the way it makes my skin feels and how it is lightweight under my makeup. The reason I gave it a 3 is the packaging. The sample was a tube but when I went to buy it is jar. I am not a fan of the jar packaging as it leads to more to cross contamination. I have sensitive skin so jar packaging leads to my skin having more up breaks. Packaging Made Me Say No
