I received this free product in exchange for an honest review. I got 7 days worth of samples and used them regularly. It does not have a very strong smell which is a plus for me. It brightens my skin and keeps it soft long after application. I have combination skin that is slightly sensitive to harsh products. Clarins double serum did not have any adverse reaction on my skin. While everything sounds great, I think the price point of the product is way too high for the quantity. A great product but misses the mark on Price
