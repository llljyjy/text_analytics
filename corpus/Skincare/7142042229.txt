I absolutely love this sunscreen. I have combination skin and I’m always scared to try new things for my face especially if it’ll make my face oily. But after trying this, I’m hooked. It’s not tacky, and it applies very nicely. Even putting my makeup over it, it doesn’t pill. Highly recommend! Perfect Face Sunscreen
