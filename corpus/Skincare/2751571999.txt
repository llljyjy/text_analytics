This cleanser is definitely not for people who don’t like fragrances in skincare. It has a very strong floral scent that lasts on the skin after washing it off. I kind of like the scent though! As for the product itself, you only need a little bit for it to lather very nicely on the skin and it leaves your skin feeling very clean, but not super drying. As for the price point, it is high for a cleanser, but not absurd for a high-end brand. I’m not sure if I would purchase this again, simply for the fact that I prefer a more hydrating cleanser for my dry skin. nan
