It’s a nice thick cream that applies smoothly, and it smells kind of like an orange creamsicle. It’s also strongly tinted—so much that you can see orange streaks in the jar after using it a few times—and leaves me looking like an orange creamsicle, too. I didn’t notice any positive effects beyond what I’d expect from any moisturizer. I look terrible in orange clothes, and this isn’t great for me, either. Maybe somebody who’s not so pale would have better luck. Orange you glad you didn't buy this yet?
