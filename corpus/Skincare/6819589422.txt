I bought this mask with my own money during the Sephora sale. I’ve been using it aggressively with my skincare routine since receiving it in the mail with my order. It’s your standard Tatcha product, so it’s nice, but overpriced. I like that it’s actually moisturising rather than drying for a clay mask. It’s also a quick wear, 3-5 minutes. However, I’ve seen no changes in my skin. For the price, I expected more. I’ll continue to use it until it’s empty, but I won’t repurchase. Nice but Overpriced
