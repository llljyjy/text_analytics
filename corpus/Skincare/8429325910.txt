This cleanser is wonderful! It’s a cream cleanser and it’s very hydrating and soothing.  After a 12 hour shift my skin is still so happy and healthy! I love the blueberry cleanser but I needed something more for the cold winter months and this is perfect. It has a barrier to protect your skin so even with the harsh winter weather,  my dry, red, irritated skin is now hydrated and nourished! The smell is plain and neutral instead of the great fruity scents of other Glow products but it applies easily, lathers well and rinses so nicely.  My skin is instantly soft and smooth and my fine lines have improved. Great for dry skin!
