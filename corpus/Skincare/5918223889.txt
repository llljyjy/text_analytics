This product is amazing and just in time for the warmer months! The applicator is amazing, it conforms to the lips well and is a jelly like texture which is soft on the lips. The scent is also a warm vanilla which is very pleasant, even if you’re not the biggest fan of vanilla. The shine on this gloss is also phenomenal. Plus the biggest thing of all is that this gloss has no chemical taste! Going to make this a staple product of mine for sure. Glossy Goodness ✨
