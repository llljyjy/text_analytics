I got this with my besuty points and I tried it. At 1st I thought it was too “heavy“ and yes I got a pimple. However, I noticed that I 1 put too much, a little goes a long way. and 2 I used it in the wrong order in my routine. After I figured that out, WOW!!! Because I initially loved it and knew I wanted to purchase one, the sample was amazing. The sample didn’t break me out so I was like yes! So I didn’t  get discouraged when I broke out, I knew I was doing something wrong. Me personally. Because when I get a sample I put the tiniest bit on or as recommended as it’s so small lol. But then I got the big one and I went to town!! lol. So it’s a beautiful formula and consistency. I really enjoy it and it penetrates the skin so well. I recommended as I’ve studied skincare and the ingredients are efficacious, the ingredient list is amazing as it has a lot of beneficial blends that are great for the skin. so it’s a yes for me. Amazing product!
