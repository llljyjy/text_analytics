I LOVE this moisturizer. To start, I love the packaging and the clean fresh scent. It is quite luxurious and the cream absorbs very quickly. It does not leave a FIM on my skin or leave my face feeling sticky. It has helped to reduce the appearance of my fine lines and has kept my dry skin very well hydrated. I will continue to use the sample I received and when thats gone, Iâ€™ll be order this along with the awesome serum. This cream is amazing! Amazing
