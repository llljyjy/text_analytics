I bought this because I was dealing with hormonal acne flare ups and I finished the bottle and my face looked the same if not worse than when I started. I stopped using this product for a week now and my face is less irritated. I donâ€™t usually have sensitive skin but I think the essential oils irritated my skin. Nothing Special
