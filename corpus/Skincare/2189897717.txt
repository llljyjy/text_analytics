I have used the old version of the It Cream in the winter months. The new version is thick like the old one. As such I would use this in the fall/winter instead of summer. The confidence in a gel lotion is better for my skin in the warmer months. That said this product was provided to me in return for a review. I do like that this newer version is packed with tons of actives. I am always looking to simplify my routine. I have used it for a few weeks and so far, so good. Although it is thick, it sinks in quickly without leaving a residue. I cannot think of any negatives. I canâ€™t speak to long term claims at this time and will probably hold off of using the remainder until it cools down a bit. I have always had positive results with It skincare and I would recommend this product. Great Thick Moisturizer
