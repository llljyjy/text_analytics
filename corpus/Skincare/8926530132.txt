Okay FYI when u first open the product it had a strong scent. Not fragrance, it’s just the smell of squalane. But I promise you it goes down after a while and doesn’t smell. Just overwhelming at first. Such a great mask for dry skin in winters!!! I use it every other night and my skin has been loving it. No need to use a moisturizer on night you use it, it can replace it. SO GOOD!!! Can never go wrong with Kiehls. intense hydration for dry skin
