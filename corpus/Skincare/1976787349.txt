I just happened to be looking for a new moisturizer for nighttime when I saw this was coming out. I bought it instantly. I started to regret that decision a little bit when I saw some reviews stating it would clog pores, as I have always struggled with acne. I tried it once a week and didnâ€™t have an issue, so I started using it every couple days, and finally every day. No issues with acne at all! My skin had gotten very dry for some reason lately and this completely solved the issue. It seems like acne marks are going away faster too. Another win from iNNBEAUTY! (I should say that I have had nothing but good experiences with all their products, so maybe this is just the best brand for me.) nan
