Will definitely not consider buying this product in the future.   It is hard finding a mineral sunscreen that is affordable.  I was happy I received this VoxBox because I would not have heard of this brand otherwise. For the pros....  No harsh smell and very light to wear.  The only con and very important for me is having a mineral product for darker (African American) skin tones. I am dark skin but closer to the medium dark brown tone. This does leave a horrible cast especially if you sweat. I tried applying this in thin layers and no matter what it left my skin looking bluish grey...not good. Not for brown skin
