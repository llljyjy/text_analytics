This moisturizer is simply amazing. My skin really just absorbs it right up when I put it on. It goes on so smoothly and it’s not greasy afterwards either. I hate moisturizers that do that. The actual cream feels really good and luxurious to me. It feels so good when I rub it on my skin at night. It also doesn’t have much a smell either. Honestly since I’ve started using this my skin has felt so much better. My skin is always so dry that it actually flakes off which is super embarrassing for me so this moisturizer has been working really well for me so far. I also noticed that with this product that a little seems to go a long way which is a plus so this product will last a while. I have acne as well so of course I have redness on my face and it seems to have calmed some of that down as well. I honestly haven’t had any problems with this cream so far and looking forward to what it will do long term. nan
