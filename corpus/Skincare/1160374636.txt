This moisturizer is very moisturizing, but I have combination skin that leans more toward oily. It makes my skin really oily. If I put a blotting paper on my face, it would be completely transparent. I wish it had SPF in it as well. I didn’t really see much of a difference in my skin with the supposed anti-aging benefits. If you have dry skin, this would be good for you. If you have combination or oily skin, I wouldn’t recommend this for you. nan
