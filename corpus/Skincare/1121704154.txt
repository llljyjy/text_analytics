I jumped on the chance to get a sample of this product as a Beauty Insider reward but was totally unimpressed.  The product absorbs easily, doesn’t have an unpleasant scent and didn’t irritate my skin but that’s all the positive review I can give.  For a product this expensive the results should be almost immediate and visible. I could find something similar in a grocery store beauty aisle. Unremarkable
