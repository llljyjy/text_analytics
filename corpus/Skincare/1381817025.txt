I received this product as a test from Influenster and honestly I didn’t think it was worth the price. I have extremely sensitive skin, as in, some products in the past by other companies have given me chemical burns sensitive. I tried this product out for a small amount of time and I fear my skin is just too sensitive. I had a immediately wash it off because I felt my skin start to get irritated. I gave it two stars because it seems like I’m one of the only people that have had this reaction and everyone else seems to rave about it.. so figured it’s done some good for others but just not me. not worth the price
