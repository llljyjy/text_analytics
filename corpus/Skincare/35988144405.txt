The feel and weight of the packaging of the Bakuchiol Hydrating Cleanser is impressive. It says to pump a “small amount“ onto damp skin. It would be helpful to say how many pumps should be used. I used 2 pumps as 1 pump seemed not enough. The cleanser has a light scent but it may be the scent of the ingredients and not added fragrance. I can’t be sure. After cleansing, my skin was plump and hydrated, but it had a dullness, almost as though there was a layer of product that hadn’t washed off. This just didn’t work for me. nan
