I have combination skin but lately it has been on the dryer side due to climate changes. After my first use I noticed a softer, hydrated, and supple skin difference. The moisturizer felt light and the texture was easy to spread. I wear it underneath my makeup so it did not feel thick or sticky. My skin stayed hydrated the whole day. nan
