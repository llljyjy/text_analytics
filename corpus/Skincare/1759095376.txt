Iâ€™ve been using this toner for for almost 2 weeks and I can definitely see some improvements on my skin. Some of my acne scars are lighter and overall my face is a lot clearer. I knew the first time I used it I would really like it. It felt so nice on my skin and left it smooth with no dryness or stripping of natural oils. I use it now every morning and evening and am loving the results. If you use in the morning make sure to use an SPF. This is such an great exfoliating toner. I would definitely recommend it.
