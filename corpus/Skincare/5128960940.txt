I truly love this moisturizer, I have tried many over the years & this one has become one of my favorites! I have seen a different throughout the month, my skin has a more noticeable glow & my neck looks more taught. This cream is very thick, so a little goes a long way, I apply it before bed, after washing my face, & Iâ€™m still moisturized in the morning. I definitely recommend this moisturizer. IT cosmetics is actually one of my favorite brands, lots of great products! Confidence in a Cream!
