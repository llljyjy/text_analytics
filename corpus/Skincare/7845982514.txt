It /is/ oily and runny. The base is made with squalane oil which I have found to be a really good hydrator for my face but is also oily and runny. I personally don’t mind this I just noticed other reviews mentioned this. I really enjoy the finish. It’s feels so smooth on the skin and does not appear oily. I haven’t used this for long enough to see results but I know my skin reacts well with Salicylic acid and squalane so I give four stars. I took a star off because of the smell. It reminds me of the smell of mildew and I noticed the smell does not dissipate while on your face for a while. Hope this helps
