I got this as a sample and used every day, one to three times a day for about a week. I found that it dried my lips out. I really loved everything about it (look, feel, smell) but not the drying and it’s not cruelty free. It brought more color to my lips and seemed to make them look a little bit plumper/fuller. If it was cruelty free and not drying I would purchase it! I would recommend if you don’t have sensitive lips. nice but drying
