I was gifted by Dermalogica sampling, at first I was skeptical (I’m not going to lie) but This is the first product that I’ve  used in a long time that actually left my skin feeling so clean and smooth. I live in warm weather so they will definitely be my go to especially after being outside all day. Not only did it exfoliate my skin, it cleansed it as well. Well done Shocked!
