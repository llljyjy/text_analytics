I received this product for free in exchange for my review. At first, this cream felt more like a serum and I wasn’t convinced it would do much for my dry skin. Not only was it very moisturizing, it seemed to firm my skin and definitely made my fine lines less noticeable. It also works incredibly well as a primer under my foundation. The downside- the price. As wonderful as it is, it’s quite steep in price, coming in at around $175. nan
