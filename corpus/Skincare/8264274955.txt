I love this Urban Environment Fresh-Moisture Sunscreen Broad-Spectrum SPF 42 by Shiseido, the scent is light not like other sunscreens that irritate my eyes because of how strong the scent is, I like that absorbs fast and doesnâ€™t leave a greasy feeling or residues, perfect to wear under makeup, sunscreen is always a good part my skincare routine and I am so happy I was able to find this one! Awesome sunscreen!
