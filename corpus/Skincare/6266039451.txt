I’ve been using this for about a month and I am very impressed with how it sits on my skin. It gives a dewy finish that is really lovely but it doesn’t leave my skin feeling tacky or oily. One star deducted only because there seems to be an added vanilla scent and I would prefer no scent. Dewy without feeling oily
