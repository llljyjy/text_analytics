Okay - this is for anyone over 60 or who is mainly interested in disguising all the damage - sun and otherwise.  It’s nice to have young skin that merely needs some enhancing, but the real challenge for self tanners is to find one that evens out scarring and skin that spent way too long tanning by the beach or pool.This is by far the best I have found.  I use the dark because I have Irish reddish skin, not that I’m a redhead but that kind of skin that is slightly freckled and never even.I have used every self tan out there - like I’m searching for the holy grail.  Other than an airbrush tan, this is the best!And it doesn’t fade in that dotted way that airbrush tans seem to do. nan
