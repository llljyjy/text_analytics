Wow, I wasn’t sure what to expect but after using this for a couple weeks, I really love this sunscreen! Its not heavy on the skin. When applied it goes on really smooth and is not sticky at all. A big issue with a lot of sunscreens is the white cast they give off. That’s my favorite part about this product, NO white cast. I was very excited about that. I have acne prone skin and it hasn’t seemed to negatively affect me. It sets well under makeup which is another important aspect. My makeup looked beautiful on top of this. Overall, very very impressed with this sunscreen primer! Very impressed
