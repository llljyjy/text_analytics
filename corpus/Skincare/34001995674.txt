This product has a genius formula. I have super dry skin with cystic, hormonal acne and I have a really hard time finding products that exfoliate effectively but don’t destroy my skin. This is it! I’ve been using it on night 1 if my skin cycling routine and my acne has cleared for the first time in over a year. The squalane is super moisturizing and doesn’t clog my pores. Additionally, the concentration of salicylic acid is perfect. nan
