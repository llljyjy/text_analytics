When I received the Goop Glow Screen product I was skeptical of how it would work. The first time I applied it to my skin I was surprised at the coverage, it gives a pearlescent hue and makes my no makeup makeup look more polished. However, the second time I applied the product I applied too much and it gave my skin a weird glow that was overwhelming. I am still figuring the right amount to apply to be effective as a sunscreen and not overpowering given the highlighting nature of the product. It may work better for people who do not have melanated skin, like me. It overall is an okay product but I am unsure that I will be able to apply the right amount of product for the spf to be effective without an otherworldly glow. Pearlescent
