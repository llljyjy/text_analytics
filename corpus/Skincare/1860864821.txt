I took home a sample of this to test out and I’m glad I did.  I got the fair-light shade and it was a little chalky.  For reference I wear 1.3 in Tom ford traceless cream stick foundation, BR12 in Chanel, and 6 in Pat McGrath foundation.  The product consistency was a lot thicker than I expected.  I had to apply a lot in order to cover up some of my acne scarring.  The ratio of how much I needed to apply versus how much was In the packaging makes me feel like this would run out a lot faster than other tinted moisturizers on the market. It did even out my complexion alright, but it ended up emphasizing texture on my dryer areas of my face and around my pores.  I do have combination skin that is sensitive and it didn’t trigger irritation.  I tested for flash back and surprisingly there was none.  I’m guessing this may work better for oily skin and would be suitable for remote meetings, but I found the appearance to be unflattering in person for my dryer and problem areas.  The package itself feels nice, with a beveled plastic end that takes away any sharpness that usually accompanies tube packing.  Overall this did not work for me. Emphasizes texture
