I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I like the consistency of the cleanser and I feel like it does a good job cleaning off makeup. It leaves my skin feeling pretty moisturized, but the scent is extremely overpowering. I think it’s a little too expensive. I didn’t feel like this cleanser had any special qualities that my usual Tula cleanser doesn’t have. nan
