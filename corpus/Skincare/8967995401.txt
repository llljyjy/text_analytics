Absolutely a no no for me. First, it irritates my eyes so baaaad! And that is the first reason I used balm cleansers, because I used makeup everyday and my eyes are always my focus point. Even for a no makeup type of day, mascara and something in my lids are my go to. Back to this product, don’t eliminate all my mascara (and I don’t used water proof), always live my eyes red and I have to go back with several layers to removed all my makeup (and I don’t wear a ton). In the rest of my face, is a meh product, leave a feel that I don’t care because I do wash my face with another cleanser to eliminate everything. The other thing for me, was the smell. Is pure oil smell. If you don’t care, go for it. For me, my all skincare process is a spa type of feeling, and this smell ruined the vibes. Plus, I live in CA and in a day that was like 80 degrees, this stuff started melting all over because, again, is pure oil. So, hard pass! Nope! a hard pass!
