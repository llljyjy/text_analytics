I got this to try as a cheaper replacement for my favorite supergoop sunscreen and i am pretty satisfied with it. i donâ€™t get a white cast as i did with the matte formula. the feeling is like a milky light liquid sunscreen and it has the generic sunscreen smell as well. Do note i got some eyelid irritation when i put it on. it made my eyelid itchy and a slight bit swollen. I avoided putting it around my eyes and it solved the problemotherwise, i will most likely purchase again as it hurts less than buying the 40$ supergoop.. good cheaper alternative
