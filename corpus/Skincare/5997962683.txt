I have extremely dry, sensitive skin so I’m always looking for moisturizers and masks that can keep my skin moisturized, especially during the winter. I’ve been really enjoying this Kiehl’s mask! It has a balmy texture which really helps lock in moisture. Though it’s recommended to use alone, I’ve also been using it on top of my regular moisturizer because my skin is so dry right now. It actually reminds me a lot of a facial balm I used to get from Kiehl’s, which was their moisturizer for super dry skin. I think it’s now discontinued but this has been a great replacement, and I’ve even used it during the day too. It sits beautifully under makeup and I personally don’t find it too heavy or greasy at all (though of course, this is only for my skin type). My only complaint is that the smell is a little weird but it doesn’t last long and the lack of added fragrance is probably better for sensitive skin anyways. I’ve always been really impressed by Kiehl’s products and this will stay in my regular skincare lineup. I got this as a sample from BzzAgent but will purchase for myself once I’m out of my sample! Definitely recommend! So good for dry skin
