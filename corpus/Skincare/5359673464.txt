I really like this product. Itâ€™s great for sensitive skin. It takes off all my makeup (I do not wear waterproof makeup as a quick note). After using it a few times, I think it works best when you use two pumps, thoroughly wash your face, and then wipe your face with a wet washcloth at the end. That really takes everything off. Great for sensitive skin!
