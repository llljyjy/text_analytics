I’m a huge fan of retinol, and I’m a huge fan of this stick because I don’t have to touch the product. I literally swipe this all over my face and it takes two seconds. I have no sensitivity to it nor it’s irritating to my skin. If you’re not used to retinol, I suggest using it once or twice a week and avoid the eye area as it can get sensitive. nan
