I’ve been wanting to try Retinol for a while now, and I’m glad I did.  This product has become the star of my skin care routine.  Especially during the winter.  I have very dry skin and this product has helped me a lot.  It helps my skin look healthy and hydrated. I love the way my skin looks after I started to use this product. Love it!
