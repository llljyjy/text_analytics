This cream is really nice. I love that it’s light and not to thick. It feels really nice on my face and great hydration. The smell is really light not harsh at all. I haven’t been using it that long to really say to much about the affect it has as far as wrinkles and firming but I have high hopes for this and I will do another review. I highly recommend this cream so far. nan
