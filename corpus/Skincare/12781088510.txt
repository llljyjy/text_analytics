I received this product for free from Influenster and so far I am very happy with it. It makes my face feel very soft and I havenâ€™t had any issues with break outs. The only downside is this is a more expensive product. My skin was already in pretty healthy condition, but I would be interested to see how well this product worked during one of my dry spells. I will definitely continue using and integrating into my regular routine. Moisturizing without Breakouts
