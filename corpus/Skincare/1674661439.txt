Bought this to try as this was much cheaper than Tatcha, Vivier and Bao Laboratory’s Vitamin C Serum which i’ve all tried. this serum does not produce the initial warming effect that you get from the Vivier or Bao Laboratory serums (those 2 work amazing, but are expensive and oxidize pretty quickly). I didnt have too high hopes for this but it still worked pretty well in terms of evening out my skin tone after a long summer vacation. I would recommend this over the other serums given its price point and how it worked. Great product for the price
