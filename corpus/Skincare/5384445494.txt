If you have dry and sensitive skin, this is great for cold Canadian winters even for summer nights. I’ve been using this balm for a little over 1 year and it’s worked wonders, it is quite oily but I usually let it sit for 1 hour before heading off to bed. I have used it during the day, but find it’s too oily for the day.I have a oily T zone, but dry everywhere else. SUPER sensitive skin, with demographic. Dry Sensitive Skin
