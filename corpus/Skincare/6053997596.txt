I had struggled with dark spot that would be left behind from acne. I try to use many on spot treatments but, the dark spots are stubborn. When I was finally able to get my hands on Milk Marvel, it was like magic. My dark spot went away and my skin became smooth. I also struggled with texture skin, with this product, the little bumps on my skin went away. To the point where I no longer have to use a silicone base primer to apply makeup. My friends have completely me on my skin and are amazed by it. I totally recommend this to anyone who want there skin to feel as soft as a babyâ€™s butt. No more dark spots
