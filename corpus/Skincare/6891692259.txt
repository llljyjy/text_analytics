I have oily acne prone skin and I really like this product. I’ve used other acid treatments and they tend to irritate my skin, but not this one. This is a very creamy light consistency. It also smells like strawberries in the best way possible! My skin fills more tight but in a good way and it has more of a glow to it. It pairs well with my moisturizer to make my skin feel more hydrated. I will continue using this product I really do think it’s made a difference in my skin. Good acid treatment for sensitive skin!
