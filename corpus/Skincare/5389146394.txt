I received this product as a gift, and I’ve been using it consistently for about three months. First thing I noticed was the scent which was kind of strong but I didn’t mind the smell. It did pill under make up so this is best used without makeup, and it also caused me to breakout on my chin and neck. I continued to use it since it was the only moisturizer I had but as soon as I stopped using it my breakouts went away. nan
