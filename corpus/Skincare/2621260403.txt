I enjoyed this cleanser. It smells great to start. A little goes a long ways. And it does a great job of foaming to help with cleansing. My face foes not feel dried out when using it. I will continue to use it. My only disappointment is that I donâ€™t think there is hyaluronic acid or some of the things known to be good for our face care.   I received this product free for trial through influenster Great foaming cleanser
