This is my absolute favorite sunscreen. I have dark skin and this is completely invisible. It does not leave my oily skin feeling greasy. Thereâ€™s a slight matte finish. In comparison to Black Girl Matte Sunscreen, this has a similar texture but way less oily. BGS left my skin feeling like I put on a layer of Vaseline. Both are invisible but this one works for my skin. Totally worth the $40. Great for dark skin!
