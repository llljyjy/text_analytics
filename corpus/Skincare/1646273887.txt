Love this product! It has left my skin so hydrated and feeling so soft. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because I am not the biggest fan of the scent but it does go away after a little while. If you have combination skin and looking for a good hydrating moisturizer... this one is it! my new favorite nighttime moisturizer!
