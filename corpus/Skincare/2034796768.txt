I’ve loved this product for years. It’s one of the few OTC skincare products that works. However since they changed the formulation it has been a disaster. Twice in a row the product has turned to gloop or the pump stopped working within a few weeks of purchasing. Very disappointing. Still giving this a few stars in hopes they change the formula back Loved it - before they changed the formulation
