I’ve received Charlotte’s Magic Serum as a free sample from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. The first thing you’ll notice is the beautiful packaging. The box is pretty, but the bottle just looks like a magical elixir. It reminds me something a Disney princess would have on their dresser and use everyday.The texture is thicker than a lot of other serums I’ve used and I like that it feels like I’m slathering my skin with something that is going to soak in and plump and hydrate my skin cells.My skin looks brighter, plumper and feels smoother. It would be fair to say it feels like magic in a bottle. The only thing I disliked was the fragrance. It has a slightly stronger rose scent than I would prefer, but it wouldn’t deter me from using it in the future. Magic serum!
