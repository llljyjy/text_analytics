For this price this product gets 1 or 0 stars. It did minimal regenerating. I really thought La Mer was the only hope to fix horrible dark scars I had for many years that would not go away. However a good quality retinol did the trick and totally cleared my skin, while a whole bottle of this incredibly overpriced product did nothing in comparison. This did not transform my skin, heal it or get rid of bad scars. Instead a retinol at night did the trick and cost about two percent the price. This product was a major disappointment to be honest. Did not regenerate or heal dark scars
