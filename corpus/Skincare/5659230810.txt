This is literally the only Fresh product I’ve ever found that misses the mark for me. I don’t hate it, it just doesn’t do much. I have incredibly dry skin. My go-to night routine before this was Deep Hydration Rose Moisturizer, with Seaberry Oil over top. Not sure why I thought I should fix what wasn’t broken, but this product did not do as good of a job moisturizing my skin as that combo. My skin is peeling and flaking from dryness, which I had under control with my previous routine so I will be switching back to that. Fresh is still my favorite skincare brand under the sun! Not enough for my super dry skin
