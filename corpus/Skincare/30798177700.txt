Firstly the packaging and dispensing button is genius and high quality. I wasn’t sure about mixing the powder and the serum at first but the directions were very easy to follow. If the product still feels gritty after mixing,  just keep shaking.  I’ve been using this product for several weeks now. My skin looks clearer,  smoother, and more even. I did experience some dryness as with most retinols. So I pair this with a great moisturizer.  After about the 4th week my skin experienced some purging but it quickly cleared. I highly recommend this product. Great retinol product
