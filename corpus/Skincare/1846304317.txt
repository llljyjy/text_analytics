Love the compact size and honestly the iridescent bottle! I have been using this every morning before applying makeup (not saying that is right) and I find it adds the right amount of moisture right where I need it. I donâ€™t find it greasy, my skin absorbs it and I am able to apply makeup right overtop instantly. nan
