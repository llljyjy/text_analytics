I love this product, I have been using it for a little over 2 months now and I love it, it leaves my skin and eyes feeling smooth not greasy or sticky. I have received many compliments about how smooth my skin looks.  I use it every morning and right before I go to bed.  I also pair it together with the moisturizer.  When I first saw the bottle I thought this is not going to last but I just finished my first bottle, and I as I said I have been using the product for just a little over two months.  I highly recommend The Ordinary products, great quality items and easy on the pockets. nan
