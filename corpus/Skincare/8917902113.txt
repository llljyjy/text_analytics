Horrible product! Does not melt makeup properly. I was left with oily skin feeling like wax and needed to wash it off at least twice with cleanser and makeup wipes. Product does not have fragrance yet my eyes were burning after using this. For 34 dollars I would expect better quality. Only positive thing about this product is the packaging. Horrible product
