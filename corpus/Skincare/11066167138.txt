Received the sample size of this as my Sephora birthday gift, and upon first use I determined that it wasn’t for me. The texture is more like an ointment rather than a thick, moisturizing cream, difficult to pick up and push around the skin. The product is tinted purple and includes shimmer, which seems like a lot for a skincare product. Most importantly, however, is the way my face felt after applying it—I wouldn’t say my skin is sensitive, but it definitely felt warm and prickly after applying it after my usual skincare products. The end result does produce a  dewy look but I would attribute that to the “ointment” texture that I mentioned and the shimmer… really hoping it doesn’t break me out terribly in the morning like other reviewers have said. made skin feel warm and prickly
