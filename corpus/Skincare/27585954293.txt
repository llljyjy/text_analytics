Bye Bye Makeup 3 in 1 makeup cleansing balm definitely surpassed my expectations! I have not had good experiences with past balms that are messy and difficult to remove without scrubbing your face. This was an easy application and it melts the makeup off my face and allows you to wipe it away with ease! It was messy as makeup blended (lipstick, foundation, smeared eye shadow), but does it really matter when it is all coming off easily? The best part is that it was not irritating to my face where it can be sensitive or over-dry with makeup removes! I will definitely continue to use this (and have daily for the past 3 weeks!). I highly recommend this to anyone with difficult makeup to remove! Say Goodbye to Raccoon Eyes and Mascara Pillows
