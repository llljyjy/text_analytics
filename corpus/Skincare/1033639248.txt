First I’d like to share that I received this product to sample for free. That being said, I took my sweet time testing this product daily for a month. Let’s begin with my overall hot take: it’s a cleanser with with texture. It smells like 100% natural citrus zest/rind, and in fact the texture of the scrubbing particles feels just like that. It feel like I’m cleaning my face with a natural, almost homemade product, which many will love! This is overall, a great product that does a job well. It cleanses and exfoliates. That’s it. If you’re looking for a difference in your skin after using this other than “it’s clean” look elsewhere. If you’re looking for fresh feel and a great base for your other products, this is it. For my late 30’s combo skin, I think I need to stick with a total routine, as this was bit too much exfoliation for me daily. It is what it is: a solid exfoliating cleanser.
