Love this moisturizer!  It is thick, but absorbs so well and makes my skin feel so healthy.  I have sensitive skin that is acne prone with visible acne scarring, and this cream does not irritate.  I use it heavily at night and just a little before my spf in the morning (if I feel like I need a little more moisture). Loveee this moisturizer
