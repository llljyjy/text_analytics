Glow on shot serum smells really good, it has a citrusysmell. My favorite part about it is that it brightened myface instantly. It feels very oily, but my face has never felt smoother.This is a fragranced product, but it’s a very light smellthat you don’t even notice it unless you directly put your nose on the product. Love
