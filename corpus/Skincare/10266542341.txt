I am quickly becoming a huge fan of Kora Organics products!  I have really sensitive fair skin and have difficulty with many products, but these don’t bother me. This is a thick cream - a little goes a long way. I find it to be very natural- thus why the scent and color can be off putting to some.  I feel the results far outweigh the scent - which I’ve actually come to like.  My skin is soft and has a slight glow after using. A good product for middle aged skin in my opinion.
