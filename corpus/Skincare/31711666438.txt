The Dr. Zenovia Bakuchiol Hydrating Cleanser lives up to its name--this cleanser hydrates skin immediately after use and leaves it feeling soft and smooth. After continued use, I noticed that my skin looked generally clearer and less congested. Although this product is more expensive than my usual cleansers, I do think the price is worth the clinical-grade formula and solid packaging. I will consider buying this product again and recommend trying it out. Love this cleanser!
