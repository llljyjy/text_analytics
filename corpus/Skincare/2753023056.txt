This is probably the first sunscreen that didn’t make my eyes water but I didn’t love this. It was super thick when I applied it after my other skincare. It also peeled some when applying it and putting on makeup. I also felt like it took a while to rub in, the purplish tint took some work to get rid of. I returned it. nan
