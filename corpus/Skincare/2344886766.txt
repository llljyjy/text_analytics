I received a sample size of this product in return for my honest review.I received my sample a week before I stood up in a wedding for a friend - I was really excited to have a new “treat” to try! The instructions on the back say to use this after the companion serum, which I did not receive, so I applied the cream after my already owned different brand serum. Because the cream is so thick, I felt that I could apply less cream and it glides on beautifully. My face felt soft and supple and even in the morning it felt nice. I wouldn’t use a lot due to the thickness; it would be far too much for my pores. I can’t speak to long term results because the sample size was so tiny, but it was definitely a nice hydration boost for my week prior to a wedding. Nice Little Sample
