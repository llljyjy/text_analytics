I got to try a 7 days sample of this product from Butterfly/Chick Advisor and was excited as I love s√©rums of all types. The two different serums had  very different textures and feels, so it was evident they were two totally different products which is pretty amazing. Absorbed well with a nice feel and texture. I like the scent and overall sensory experience. After using for seven days, I can see increased firmness and brightness. I love the inclusion of turmeric and all its powerful antioxidants in this product! Luxurious Serums with Beautiful Texture
