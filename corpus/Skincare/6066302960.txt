I received this product from Influenster to test in exchange for an in depth product review. Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Day Cream has been an AMAZING addition to my skin care routine! It is thick & somewhat heavy at first but my skin literally drinks it right up & feels SO good afterwards! It moisturizes without making my skin look or feel oily/greasy. A little bit of the product goes a long way, so I feel like it will last me a long time, making it well worth the price. nan
