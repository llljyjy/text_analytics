I’m giving 4 stars because I haven’t tested it long enough yet. But so far I’m really liking this glow serum. When you pump it on your skin you can see the formula separate since it is a mix of oils and various serums. As you rub it into your face you first feel the more liquid serums being absorbed and finished by the oil. It gives my skin a dewy finish and leave it feeling plump. I’m definitely going to continue using this product. Make sure to read the instructions on the back! Hoping this is my fix to the winter skin blues!
