Using this cleanser has improved my dry skin significantly.  I was a bit hesitant at first because my skin is sensitive, I have to be careful with the products I use, but glow recipe has never let me down. I immediately felt the difference. The creamy texture, basically no scent and how clean my skin felt when I rinsed, it was amazing! After 1 week of using this cleanser, my skin has stopped flaking. I even got asked by someone if i got a facial because my skin was glowing. So if youâ€™re looking for a cleanser that will leave your skin squeaky clean but not at all dry, this is the cleanser for you.  Your skin will thank you! Glowing and Hydrated
