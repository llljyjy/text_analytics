I thought I had relatively bright, moisturized skin until I tried this. My skin has never been so smooth, illuminated, moisturized and glowing. I was shocked when I took the mask off and it looked like I had just emerged from a racialist.  Truly such a huge difference!!! My skin loves Dr Jartt products. Unbelievable results!
