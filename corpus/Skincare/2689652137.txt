I am a lipgloss fanatic and beauty professional of over 15 years and I’ve tried my fair share of glosses. This clean gloss is definitely on the line end as it is Super hydrating, naturally plumping without too much drama and no stickiness, and it plays well with others. I love that this gloss can go directly on dry or chapped lips. Some glosses I feel toy need to first out a layer of balm if your lips are super dry, but this gloss works as an actual lip treatment and lip finisher. I’ve also tried this gloss on top.of lipstick and loved the natural glowy finish, and I’ve even been able to layer a more vividly colored gloss on top and thst was beautiful as well. This is honestly in my top 5 favs when it comes to glosses and that is saying a lot. A little goes a long way, and I will definitely repurchase! Must Have Gloss!
