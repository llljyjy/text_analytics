Don’t believe the 5-star reviews on this… it’s all hype because they got a free product. The OLD formula was absolutely amazing but this one.. not so much. It has a very strong scent, the packaging is very cheap plastic, and it does not make your skin feel moisturized. I had to reapply 3 times with more and more product because it just left my face feeling like I had put cheap scented body lotion on it. Take your money elsewhere with this one. it’s a no for me
