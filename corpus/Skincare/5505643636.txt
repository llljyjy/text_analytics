I never struggled too much with dry skin or allergies until I moved to NYC...when suddenly my skin started cracking and flaring up, and my sinuses were not happy. I started using the Canopy Humidifier every day, and it has SAVED ME. My skin calmed down and retains hydration much better, and I feel like I can breathe more easily. I also love the aroma feature, so I can lightly scent my room without worrying about leaving a candle or incense burning. Super easy to use and it looks cute too. Definitely recommending to everyone I know!!! Can't live without it!
