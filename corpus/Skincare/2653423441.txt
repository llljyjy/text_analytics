I’ve used this serum for years because I like the results - even though it truly does smell like hot dog water! But the new packaging is so incredibly horrible it’s not worth it anymore. It’s hard to assemble and leaks everywhere. I feel forced to buy another brand due to the serious issues in the packaging redesign. They need to fix their product! Good product, horrible packaging
