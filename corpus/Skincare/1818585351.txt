This is like a toner so I’m not sure why it’s called a lotion. It does feel extremely hydrating however upon application. It’s not like a toner that feels drying. I also like that the ingredients are made to help support the micro biome of the skin. I can’t speak to the long-term effects because I received a sample size to try. Overall it’s really comfortable and hydrating product nan
