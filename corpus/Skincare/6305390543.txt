I really like this lip mask from Fenty beauty, it has a light vanilla scent, and the packaging is very cool. As somebody who is a huge fan of light masks, I am well familiar with many different brands and the textures of them. This packaging is different because it keeps the product well sealed, and you only crank up enough for you to use. However, it can be kind of tricky, because you have to use everything that comes out. Great product
