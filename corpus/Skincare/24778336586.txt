This is the second time I bought this and i am utterly disappointed. The packaging seemed ok. Upon opening it wasnt a balm like consistency. Infact it was all water as if it had melted. I tried keeping it in a cold dry place too just so it would become ok. But it dint work. The smell was no where close to what it usually smells like. Not sure what went wrong. Was so disappointed that literally trashed it after trying to fix it for a week. Disappointment
