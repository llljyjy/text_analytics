Lancôme is name of trust for me. I have been using Lancôme makeup products for over 5 years now. I have been Lancôme Renergie HCF Triple Serum for over three weeks and my skin has improved a lot. This serum is thicker than other serums I have tried but it absorb quickly and doesn’t feel greasy. My skin is acne prone but no breakouts so far. This works wonderfully plumping lines even toning, makes you look fresh. Getting freshly mixed product with every pump is great. The best part is how well it works. I have a new favorite yet again from Lancôme. Luxurious Skincare-love the combo effect!
