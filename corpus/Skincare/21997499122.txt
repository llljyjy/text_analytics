I had high hopes for this product dealing with dark circles under my eyes due to lack of sleep. After 3 days my eyes became dry but I persevered thinking I would get used to it. After 5 days I had been bumps under my eyes I couldnâ€™t hide with any primer or foundation. Took two weeks to get back to normal. nan
