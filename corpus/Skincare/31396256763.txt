This product is my holy-grail. I’m 22 w/ combination skin (leaning on normal), minimal acne, and I didn’t use sunscreen as a child/teen. My face is damaged, ya’ll. I have fine wrinkles on my nose, forehead, and on the sides of my mouth. I also have sunspots, an uneven skin texture (large pores+scarring), and an uneven skin tone. I’ve been using this for about 2 weeks and have noticed that my skin is GLOWY, the wrinkles have already started to dissipate, and the texture of my skin is noticeably smoother! It also seems to have evened out my skin tone a little bit(subtly). I feel like my face is more plump/youthful.This serum is so gentle. I’ve never used any retinal product before but I was able to apply this  every other day without peeling, sensitivity, redness, or breakouts. My skin didn’t need to adjust which is saying something because my face is so finicky. I think the niacinamide definitely pairs well and counteracts any of the negative side effects of retinal. The formula is strong, when I pump it out and put it near my face my eyes begin to water a little but that goes away quickly. At least I know it’s potent! The yellow does leave a slight tingle on my skin but I just wash off the excess in the morning and it’s fine. This product didn’t do anything to my sunspots which I’m fine with because I like the way they look anyways lol. My only complaint is that the pump on my bottle kind of sucks, and I always end up pushing out more product than I’d like because I have to press down so hard for it to work. I may have just received a faulty top though, and it’s not a deal breaker anyway. Just something I wanted to note in case it’s a quality control issue.I’ve never had a serum work so quickly. Two weeks in and I feel good enough take pictures of my bare skin! Thanks YTTP! Shocked at the results
