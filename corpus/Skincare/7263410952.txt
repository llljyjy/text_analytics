It is a beautiful sunscreen, minimal citrus scent, no crazy white cast and not oily. That perfect medium. Texture feels like a light moisturizer. I have read a few comments about people breaking out but it could be the fact that it is a chemical sunscreen? I’ve had small cheek breakouts here and there but honestly, could be due to my hormones and not the sunscreen. The price point I think is what makes me come back to this sunscreen!! I’ve bought three tubes of this within the last few months. I keep one at home, in my purse and at work lol (I can’t be the only one.) In my opinion this is a really good spf staple for everyday, maybe not for extreme sun exposure and hope they never mess with the formula. The only thing I would tweak in my “perfect” world would be for it to have no fragrance! GREAT EVERYDAY SPF
