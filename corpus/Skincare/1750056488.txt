Honestly love this so much. I moved to the Midwest from Houston, Texas and nothing could moisturize my oily skin in the winter months. Everything else would leave my skin looking super dry especially my forehead or it wouldn’t absorb and just sit on top of my skin. This product however absorbed into my skin and made it dewy and moisturized!!! My skin looks soo good! I can’t live without it! It’s not greasy just leaves your skin super soft and deeply moisturized. Doesn’t clog pores, it’s like your skin drinking water!! Love love!! absolutely amazing!!
