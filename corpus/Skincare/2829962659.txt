This double serum is packed with many ingredients.  It’s good for all skin types but dry skin would benefit more since it’s oily and hydrating. Personally, I am not a fan of the scent in the product. It was too strong for me. Also, my face broke out after using this serum. I recommend this product for those with dry skin or looking for anti-aging properties. nan
