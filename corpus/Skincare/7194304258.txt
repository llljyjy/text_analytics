I love this oil it takes off all my makeup and doesn’t leave residue behind. Sometimes with other cleansing oils I notice on my towel there are traces of makeup left which is frustrating. I don’t worry about that problem with this oil. Also I have sensitive skin and this product doesn’t irritate my skin. nan
