this is the only retinol I’ve tried - and I probably won’t try another one. I had the sample size and just ordered this mini one since it lasts a long time! Plus retinol is better when it’s ~fresh~.Best product I’ve used that clears my hyperpigmentation and leaves me glowy and smooth!! minimizes pore and fades dark spots
