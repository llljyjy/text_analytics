I’ve been searching for a clay based mask for a while now. This is my first time trying this brand, and I really like it! This product is clarifying, not drying, and doesn’t seem to crack and tighten uncomfortably when on the face. The texture is creamy, and spreads easily. Afterwards, my skin was clean, soft, and helped tame the onset of my hormonal acne. Great Clay Mask
