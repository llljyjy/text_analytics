Initially I thought this was just an ok product—I liked that it didn’t make my face shiny. But then I used all of the product and had to go back to my previous face lotion. My face stung (as I suddenly remembered it often did when applying any product) and with the renewed sensitivity and dryness, my skin looked less smooth and more tired. So I guess what I’m trying to say is that I didn’t notice any difference until I stopped using it. Great for Sensitive Skin
