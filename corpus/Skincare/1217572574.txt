There is a light scent to this that I love. It’s a gentle floral scent. But, there is a slight sheen to the formula that I do not love. The pearl powder is very pretty, but I’m a Greasy Gus. The last thing I need is to add on glow! It’s a light fluid, I think even sunscreen haters would be willing to apply every 2 hours. nan
