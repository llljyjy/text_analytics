ABSOLUTELY love this eye product. It has a really nice fluffy whipped like cream texture. Just a few touches to area around your eyes and it blends quickly and smoothly into your skin. It has helped to lighten the dark circles under my eyes, calms puffiness for I suffer with allergies, and smooths the skin. Itâ€™s very hydrating and great for dry, normal, oily, and combination skin. And lastly,  it is minimizing my fine lines and wrinkles as well. I do recommend this product. Great for eye areas
