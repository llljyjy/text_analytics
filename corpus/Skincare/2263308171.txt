Sunscreen is a staple in my skincare routine, as a pale person living in SoCal I burn within 15 minutes of stepping outside. Chemical, mineral, natural, spray-on, lotion, stick; I’ve tried all the formulas and variations. This is the first product from Tula that I have tried, and it won’t be my last. Even though I need to wear sunscreen on a day out I always worry about my skin after, 75% of the time my face either breaks out or I still manage to get sunburned. This sunscreen is formulated without parabens, sulfates, silicon, and fragrance, all things that I have found may have been the cause of my post-sunscreen breakouts. While I do love that classic sunblock smell, not too sure I want that absorbed into my skin. Even though it’s fragrance-free I find it still has a scent, like a light spiced- pineapple smell. It has pineapple, papaya, & ginger formulated into it, so it’s nice knowing that the fragrance is natural. There is a slightly weird texture to the sunscreen, it’s almost chunky as you can see in the picture. It easily smooths out though once applied, and the shimmer creates a healthy glow. To give this product an authentic review I wanted to wear it a few times and see how it performed. So far, I have not gotten burned at all while wearing this sunscreen, and I have not broken out either. It absorbs into the skin so nicely, it doesn’t feel greasy or leave a chemically matte finish; my skin just feels like skin. My face gets a little pink after applying it, but that’s most likely just from rubbing it into my face. It doesn’t leave a white cast which is lovely too. This sunscreen lives in my purse now, I take it everywhere. Five stars! Shimmery Skincare At Its Finest!
