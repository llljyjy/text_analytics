I was wearing this every day under my foundation and found that I worked really well l. My makeup didn’t flake. However, it felt heavy to me, almost like it was suffocating my skin. I switched to using it at night and am much happier with the feel of it. The smell reminds me of cucumber melon, it’s not a super strong scent, but more than other moisturizers. nan
