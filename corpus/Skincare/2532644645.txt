I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. The scent is nice and light, doesnâ€™t overpower or seem too heavy. The product felt thick and heavy when scooping out but felt light and absorped quickly on the skin. Skin felt hydrated right away and not tacky after application. Would definitely recommend as a supplement to regular moisturizer especially during winter months when skin is more dry. nan
