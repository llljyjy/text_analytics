I’m always so scared to try new products because I have acne prone Skin but none of Rihanna’s Fenty line have broken me out. I recently broke out horribly on my forehead area and this came in the mail just in the Knick of time. Now I’ve only used it for about two weeks so far, so no my redness and hyperpigmentation is not completely gone but it has improved quite a bit. I know with consistent use it will definitely get rid of the discoloration. The way it dispenses is really innovative, you have to push the bottom upwards and if dispenses from the top. I think that’s really cool and you can control how much comes out easily; no mess like a lot of other products. I like that it “clicks” closed. It absorbs into the skin nicely, it is a nice silky milky consistency, not heavy on the skin at all. I would buy this product myself when this empties, which might be a while because you don’t need a lot of product to cover a section of your face. I would definitely recommend to my family and friends. Silky
