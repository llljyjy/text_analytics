I fell in love with this product right away! I love how small it is, perfect to throw in your purse. Ive seen a few complaints about the packaging but if you’re like me and hate dipping your fingers inside of a container this is definitely more ideal. You only need to twist it up once after you get the product to the surface. I would definitely say it’s a lot more moisturizing than the Laniege so if you have extremely dry lips  this will do the job perfectly. I’ll be stocking up on these for my car, desk, and purse!
