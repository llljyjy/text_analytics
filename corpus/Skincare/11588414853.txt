in the beginning, my face would kinda sting in some areas AND I wouldn’t see any changes to my skin (acne, oiliness). took a break from it and continued with niacinamide. then, I picked up the 10% version of this product and it finally yielded results. my advice would be not to be afraid to drop a product if it’s not working (which seems obvious but can be difficult to do) and to not be afraid of switching to stronger products like I did. not many changes, 10% is better
