It does its job exactly as its supposed to! It melts my makeup off super easily and you don’t need to use much of the product. It leaves me feeling a little oily before I wash my face, but at the end of my routine I don’t feel oily at all. Just make sure to cleanse your face after applying!! The texture of the balm feels almost like coconut oil? But it does its job very well, its honestly also a fun way to take my makeup off! The size of the product is underwhelming for the price though.. (I put it beside my nyx gloss for comparison.) But overall I think its very worth it and I recommend!!! Small but great
