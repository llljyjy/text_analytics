I love this sunscreen. Years ago I worked for a cosmetics counter that is as next to Shiseido and I always loved their products. This has been improved and is amazing in your skin. It’s a fluid, so it only takes a few drops to spread all over your face. Apply daily after your moisturizer and you’re good to go! As someone who uses Retin-A is a necessity to me. Note: I am very fair skinned, on me there isn’t any whiteness from the mineral, but I am not sure if the same can be said on darker skin colors. It seems less white than other similar products (Clarins used to make even me look weird). I took a photo after rubbing it it into my hand to show how this one disappears on me. nan
