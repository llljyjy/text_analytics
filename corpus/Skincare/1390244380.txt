Within the last few months I’ve had the pleasure of using a few of Kosas brand products. I like this brand as it contains clean and effective ingredients as well as offers fun and eye catching, vibrant packaging. Not only does this line consist of cosmetics but skin care options as well. Regardless of your skin type or concerns there is something for everyone within this line. Recently I was able to try out their Plump & Juicy Spray-On Serum. This serum is formulated to be vegan as well as fragrance, silicone, paraben and mineral oil free. It is perfect for any skin type especially those with sensitive skin. I really enjoyed the fresh, clean feeling of this product when applied onto my clean face. I also really appreciate its pretty glass bottle and the fact that it’s a spray on option. There’s no doubt this spray on serum helps sustain skin health while providing hydration and softness. You can feel it work instantly. Pro tip: Shake well before application. Apply in the AM & PM.
