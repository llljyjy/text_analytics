Sephora Collection gifted me to this product, but the opinions are completely my own based on my experience. I appreciate how this cleanser is not strong to where it feels as if it is stripping my moisture away from my face. It also has no strong lingering scents which I prefer. Lastly, a little bit goes a long way. My New Go To Face Wash!
