I received this product complimentary to review for my honest opinion. The first thing I noticed was the consistency of the product. It reminds me of calamine lotion, it leaves a white cast on the skin. Aside from that, itâ€™s a broad spectrum sunscreen with SPF 42. This is great for those with oily skin types. Good Stuff
