I’m a big fan of HUM in general for nearly 5 years. I’m nearly 30 and I try to keep my collagen in check. So this one really helps with that. My facial esthetician just told me that my skin got better last time I checked in w her. She said my skin shows more elasticity. And I feel like it must be an impact from HUM collagen that I’ve been taking. I can show pics before and after just so you see the difference. I’ll be definitely getting some more of this supplement soon and will recommend to my family and friends :) Must have if you’re about to be in your 30s
