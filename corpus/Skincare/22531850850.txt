This stuff works you have to be consistent and I know everyone is tired of that word but if you use it twice a day on your dark marks and of course use sunscreen you will see results but it dose take a few weeks . I’m on my second tube and I had this large dark mark on my forehead and it’s gone . I believe I first purchased this back in August and I was consistently using it for 3 months then I got lazy because I ran out and then I brought another tube . I promise it’s not like ambi or them other drug store dark spot correcting creams . I use this whit Paula’s choice retinol and it has changed my skin nan
