I love this lotion! I was expecting it to be a little bit thicker since it is described as lotion, but I use it more like an astringent, applying it on a cotton ball and then rubbing my face with it. I like to use it at night time as the night cream. It moisturizes my face well and calms down the breakouts/redness over night. I would definitely  recommend this to anyone who has breakouts and dry skin. Great soothing lotion
