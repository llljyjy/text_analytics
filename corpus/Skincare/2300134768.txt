I received this awesome product in return for leaving an honest review! I thought this eye balm was quite nice! It is easy to apply and immediately makes my eyes feel cool and refreshed! I do notice reduced puffiness and dark circles when I use it! I donâ€™t notice any improvement of fine lines or wrinkles but I like it for the puffiness and dark circles for sure! I also like that it has no scent because scented things on my face always bother my sinuses! Would definitely buy! Very refreshing!
