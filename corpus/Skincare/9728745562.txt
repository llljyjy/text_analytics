After trying so many cleaners, finally I found what my skin needed. My skin feels clean, refreshed, and hydrated after using this cleanser. The product texture is so good, for the best result, leave it 5 minutes after massage. It has a refreshing, cooling sensation, and efficacy in makeup removal. A must-have in your daily routine.
