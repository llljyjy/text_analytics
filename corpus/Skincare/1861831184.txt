I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I love Estee Lauder products. They are pricey but great quality and the results speak for themselves. I was so excited to receive this small sample to try. My skin is dry, and I’m 39 so I have plenty of fine lines, etc. Moisturizer is a part of my daily routine, both morning and night. I take good care of my skin and take my regime serious. My skin absolutely drank this formula up. I wish I had more to be able to truly give a good before/ after opinion, but the truth is, I had to use so much of it that the small sample barely lasted a week. Pros: love the smell! Super hydrating and feels great. Would I buy? Maybe, if it was on sale. I have so many great moisturizers, and I didn’t see a considerable difference in my skin After a week. But the formula is perfect for dry skin. A great formula for dry skin!
