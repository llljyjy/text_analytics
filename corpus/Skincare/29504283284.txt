Clarins did it again!! I am obsessed with this mask! Its so creamy and buttery in texture! Itâ€™s probably one of the best mask I have used so far which works on puffiness ! The smell and texture is luxurious ! Love the packaging and it is also quite big than I imagined! I would definitely buy this again , received free from clarins to try and review luxurious
