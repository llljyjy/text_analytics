I am glad to see an affordable anti-aging serum as most alternatives are on the pricey side. Pros include that it is vegan, it is Clean at Sephora, and comes in recyclable packaging. Overall my first impression is that it is a good quality product without being expensive. I am giving it four stars now because I haven’t seen results yet, which isn’t uncommon for this type of serum. The ingredients, especially Bakuchiol (extracted from babchi seeds) seem so interesting to me. So far I haven’t noticed any breakouts or bad reactions from this so I am definitely going to keep using it and testing it out. nan
