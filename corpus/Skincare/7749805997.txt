This cream goes on smooth and creamy without feeling greasy, heavy or slick … and doesn’t dry my skin down to a stiff feel like others I’ve tried. So many times I’ve been caught buying a product that starts off so nourishing them leaves me feeling dry. I received this as one of my b’day gifts from Sephora and since then, this has been part of my day/night routine. It’s great under makeup and even bettter alone! I love loove loooove this so much that I went back to buy the biggest size just so I won’t run out! It’s a bit pricey (def more than I’ve ever spent on a face cream) but sooooo worth it! I’m hooked!!! Never Have I Ever
