Since using this moisturizer, I’ve honestly fell in love! I’ve been looking for a moisturizer that will combat my combination skin during the winter. This has fit in perfectly!! My skin feels hydrated and plump after using it and honestly I haven’t used any moisturizer since receiving this one. I really love the ceramides and squalane in this product that keep my skin protected on the daily. I find it to be lightweight but hydrating enough to keep me going throughout the day. I would love to see how it holds up in the summer but I think I may have found my new favorite winter moisturizer! My new favorite moisturizer!
