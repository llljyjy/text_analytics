I received the Dior cica recover and repair multi use balm to try. I have dry, sensitive skin and alot of products just don’t work out for me. I was  pleasantly surprised at how well that my skin felt. I didn’t get any breakouts.  It feels so smooth and soft. I think it has made my wrinkles less obvious. I highly recommend this balm it will be my new go to products. Really works
