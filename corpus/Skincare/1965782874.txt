I used this product for LESS than two weeks and it already ran out. I used it twice a day, each time using about the size of a grain of rice, or even a lentil (itâ€™s eye cream, you know the amount...) and it is already out. I reached out to Sephora, thinking it must be defective. The first person I spoke to said eye creams should last 6-8 weeks with proper use. The second said that it should last at least a month, but basically told me not their problem! They told me they were sorry I was disappointed. Well, I am extremely disappointed. I wanted to like this product, but I did not even get to use it long enough to learn if it worked for me. Extremely disappointing. This product is a scam (and you can't return!)
