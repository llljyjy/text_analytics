I actually love this sunscreen. I see all the reviews saying it pills badly, but it really doesn’t for me. I should note that I don’t wear a lot of makeup or other products. I use a simple moisturizer, let that dry, apply this sunscreen, let that dry, and then use an under eye concealer and that’s it. Makes my look and feel glowy without being greasy. Also I’m obsessed with the scent of this one!! It’s a mild watermelon scent but I absolutely love it nan
