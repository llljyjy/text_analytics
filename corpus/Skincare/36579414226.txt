I’ve been using the Brightening Eye Cream for about a month. I think it works fairly well, and I enjoy using it most at night. However, it doesn’t seem to absorb that well into this skin. Even if I’m using a small amount of product and let it sit for a while, if I use it in the morning under makeup, my concealer will crease and just sort of pill on top of the cream. Might be best for those who don’t use undereye makeup. Really wanted to love this
