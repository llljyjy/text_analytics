Not only does this take off all of my makeup in one wash it also leaves my face hydrated. Itâ€™s foamy and lathers up really well to take off all of my makeup and residue I have left from all day of wearing makeup! Would def recommend to someone who wears a lot of makeup and has trouble taking it off! Also it prevents breakouts since it cleans the skin really welll best non drying face wash
