This moisturizer is amazing! I have combo/oily skin so my skin loves more lightweight gel cream textures like this one. It also has niacinamide & zinc pca which help curb my sebum production. The gel cream also feels nourishing without the tacky or greasy finish. Definitely a great all year round moisturizer. I also love the airless pump packaging so you get every drop. Great Moisturizer for Oily/Combo Skin
