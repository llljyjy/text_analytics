A little goes a long way with this powerful moisturizer. It goes on thick but feels light and not at all greasy. Citrus-C feels wonderful on my dry winter skin, leaving it feeling moisturized and happy. The scent is not too powerful or overwhelming, which is lovely for my sensitive skin. This is now a regular staple in my everyday routine. Powerful and light moisturizer.
