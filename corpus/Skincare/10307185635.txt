I tried every astringent, mask, pore strip, expensive pore vacuum, steamer and acne wash known to man. I could never clear white heads and black heads on chin and all over nose. I have (genetic) huge pores on my nose . They have terrible white heads. I had to use painful needle sharp tools to scrape them off leaving my nose bloody and swollen. They were so bad , if I smushed my nose down a little or side to side they would all pour out by the dozens. No matter how clean i kept my face , the disgusting white heads stayed. I gave up till I took a chance on this after researching products on google . The white heads disappeared in 3 to 4 days of initial use. I smush my nose to look for them and nothing is there!  It also works as a zit treatment and even fades the dark spots from my terrible blemishes that used to stay on my face for a month after i had a zitWarning though! It says not to use with retinol products at same time. Also!! You have to use it religiously for results!! Once in morning and once before bed! I don’t personally use over entire face . I only spot treated problem zones. If I forget to use it even one day the white heads will return little by little. So if anyone says this doesn’t work, I would question their consistency of using it because you cant take a break and expect the pores to stay clear.Also. If you cake make up on every day, your results might not be as good as mine or others. I stopped using foundation and use tinted moisturizer and powder . A lot of days , I dont wear anything but moisturizer. So, this probably helps the process and I have less stuff clogging my pores. I’m buying my second bottle so i dont have any downtime when my first runs out! This is a permanent part of my routine now Miracle Product!
