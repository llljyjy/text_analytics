Has a very fine mist that absorbs quickly. You should apply outside or over a towel since my tiles got residue on it from spritzing 7 times.  Has a very strong smell so do not breathe in immediately after application.  If you like the smell of cucumber, this is for you.  It seems to protect well against the sun.  The finish is slightly oily. nan
