If I could give this product more than 5 stars I would! I have mild acne and I use to use Proactive (before I found out it was horrible for your skin). I tried for years to find a face wash that would clear up my painful acne, but it seemed like everything I tried made it worse. Until I found this product!! I swear by this face wash! It can be a bit drying but nothing a good moisturizer cant fix! A GODSEND
