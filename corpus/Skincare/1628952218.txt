I have really sensitive skin and prefer to use some sort of relieving serum after washing my face. First, I don’t like the smell of this, it is synthetic/perfumy to me even thought I don’t see synthetic fragrance in the ingredients. Second, there is something about this nozzle that every time I pump it, it literally shoots across the room. I’ve wasted so much product because the nozzle acts as a projectile. I also really don’t see a difference in my skin. It feels nice putting it on but I get more relief from my FAB products. I’m going to use this up because it was pricey and doesn’t irritate my skin, but I will not repurchase as there are better alternatives out there. Not my favorite
