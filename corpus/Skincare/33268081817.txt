I received this product for free from Influenster & Gucci exchange for an honest review. I am absolutely loving this hydrating mist. It has a subtle and light fragrance, which I appreciate and works perfectly for setting makeup. I also have been using it throughout the day for added moisture since it contains hyaluronic acid. Def recommend grabbing this one and incorporating it into your summer skincare routine Summer skincare essential
