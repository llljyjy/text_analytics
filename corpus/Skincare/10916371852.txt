I received this product for free from Influenster and Augustinus Bader in exchange for my honest review.  I liked this item but was not blown away. The things I liked were: there was no fragrance, it went on very easily and left a smooth feel, not sticky, pretty container and made my face so soft. Some of the things I was not impressed by: although this made my skin feel smooth, it really didn’t do anything more than a lot of other products I have used, the retail price is extremely high. I would not buy this due to the cost and that it didn’t do anymore for me than other cheaper comparable products. I would consider purchasing if it was 1/3 of the retail cost. Was just ok for me
