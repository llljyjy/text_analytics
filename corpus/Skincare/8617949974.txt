I think this cleanser is great! I really like the packaging and how there is a pump. I also really like how you can use this cleanser two different ways- to remove your makeup or just a regular cleanse! It does foam but it does not leave my skin dry after. Overall I really like how this cleanser make my skin look and feel! Great cleanser!
