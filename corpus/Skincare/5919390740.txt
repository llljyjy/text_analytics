The old formula of this moisturizer was a 5 star holy grail, only moisturizer I needed in my life type of product. I repurchased this product this weekend and was devastated to discover that not only is this now fragrance free, but the consistency is now completely different. This used to have a lively scent, ine I would honestly live to have as a perfume. Very juicy. But, I guess I could live without the scent. However, this is now nowhere near as moisturizing and it leaves my skin feeeling tight. I guess I am on the hunt again for a nee holy grail. Will not relurchase unless they bring back the old formula. Why Farmacy?!
