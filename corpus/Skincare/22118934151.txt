I was gifted Clinique “Take the Day Off“ cleansing balm from Clinique and Influenster for my honest opinion. My expectations were high and it delivered what it said it would. This balm is for combination/oily skin to dissolve makeup and impurities. They nailed it! I tried it on foundation lastnite and followed the instructions using your finger to rub it in on dry skin. Than I swiped it once to see how that went and wow! Surprised me with ONE swipe! I than washed it off. I checked one more time with a cotton pad and it was CLEAN! It didn’t leave my skin greasy after and I loved that is fragrance FREE! I truly am happy with this product! It’s so easy to use and works! It works GREAT!!!!!
