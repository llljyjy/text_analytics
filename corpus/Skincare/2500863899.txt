This is the first time I have ever put something on my face and have really seen an immediate result. I was suffering from massive breakouts and I was switching up my moisturizer. I got a sample of the niacinamide cream and used it and immediately when out and bought a jar of it. My acne calmed down, my skin looked overall better. It was like magic! Magic in a jar
