Honestly, the best sunscreen I’ve bought. Smooth finish. Makes skin look even and bright. No scent. Mineral sunscreen (plus for me, I hate chemical because it breaks me out). Sinks into skin IMMEDIATELY- i was shocked. Price tag is the issue. Not enough product to justify using this as a daily sunscreen. That said, I would 100% buy again and use this as a makeup base, or if I just want a smoother complexion when out and about. Ps - it’s very liquidy, so wouldn’t worry about squeezing out the last drop. It just pours out of the bottle!! the best
