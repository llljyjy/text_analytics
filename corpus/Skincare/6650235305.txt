s an Arizona native I deal with chapped lips on the regular, and nothing looks worse with your lip products than dry, cracked lips! As a beauty advisor and expert from more than eight years I have tried an endless amount of lip balms to lip masks. What makes this product by KOSAS So special is the clean ingredients! It is loaded with peptides, fatty acids, hyaluronic acid & jojoba oil! The product itself is hypoallergenic, vegan and my favorite cruelty free. I personally use this all throughout the day, before bed and whenever I need a little extra moisture to my lips, especially before a matte lipstick. I also love the packaging as it is so beautiful and the price point is on point given the amount that you get in one little tube! I noticed my lips were definitely juicier and more plump but mainly no more chapped crusty lipsâ€¦ This is a game changer for anyone who wants some extra plumpness to their lips or deals with dry lips on the regular! Definitely recommend! nan
