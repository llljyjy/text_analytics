This product makes for a light moisturizer that quickly absorbs into your skin. It isn’t too bad but I also wasn’t entirely blown away by it either. It would be perfect for the summer or someone with more oily skin. The scent to it also isn’t bad either. It made my skin slightly tingle though upon use. I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. nan
