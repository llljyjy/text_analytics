It’s not bad, honestly. I thought it would be sticky (since the texture seems quite goopy), but nope. It goes on smooth and dries nicely. It doesn’t smell like watermelon though…more like cut up vegetables or real cucumber. I doubt that would deter anyone from getting it, but wanted to mention that. If you need a regular toner, this is not a bad choice (esp since it’s cruelty free). Good, but doesn’t smell like watermelon
