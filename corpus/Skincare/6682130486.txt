This serum applies smoothly and absorbs quickly with little to no scent to it. I love the milky texture, it doesn’t leave a sticky or oily residue like some serums! I also love that the ingredients are clean and that it doesn’t contain retinol. I’ve been using this for a couple weeks and my skin feels hydrated and healthy. Not too sure how well it actually works for deep wrinkles, but it does seem to be a great product to try. nan
