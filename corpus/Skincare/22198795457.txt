LOVE this product. It is amazing for my skin dry skin as the weather changes, and I also use it in my daughter’s room as a humidifier when she sleeps. As a new mom with a baby with has asthma, quality is everything and I feel this humidifier really passes the test. I don’t have to worry about mold or chemicals, it is just an all-over-quality product. Plus the green matches her nature-themed nursery so it works out perfect. Perfect for my skin and daughters nursery
