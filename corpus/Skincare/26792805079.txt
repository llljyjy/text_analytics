I have used this product for about a month or so now and I have seen a bit of improvement in the fine lines around my eyes.  My skin feels more smooth and I fell a bit better about my skin for the most part.  I was worried I received a bad batch as the product is actually colored a bit yellow and not pure white like most moisturizers I have tried in the past.  I read others reviews and that is just the product no issues.  I did not break out in any way and I will keep using the product and I would recommended it to others.  I received this product as a free sample. Works well and no breakouts
