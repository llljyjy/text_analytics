it feels a little greasy on the face and its smell is strong but despite this I gave it a chance and when I woke up I noticed that my face does not feel greasy and the smell disappears, it does not leave residue, the true if it has good results because the face looks fresher and feels soft, I really like the ingredients because they are perfect to combat environmental damage on the face and it is cruelty free, so as a recommendation I would say not to use much since It is thick and a little is enough, apply it after cleaning your face for several nights so that you can see the results.
