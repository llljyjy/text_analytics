I am in love with this moisturizer, consistency wise is not too thick nor light but has a quite silicone feel to it. Sorta reminds me of the ceramidin cream of Dr.Jart but with a light feel. Itâ€™s really hydrating and great to put underneath makeup specially under matte and drying foundations. Definitely would buy it again. Best hydrating cream
