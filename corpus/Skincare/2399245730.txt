I received this product for free from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review. This sunscreen is pleasant smelling, does not feel greasy, and is lightweight on my skin. It works well for daily use as well as for longer durations in direct sunlight. It was my first time using this brand and I will definitely continue to use it. nan
