I received this product free to test from Influenster. The packaging is nice and the product has a good  consistency. I like that it includes spf as my regular moisturizer does not. It feels good going on, and seems to help my dry skin. It felt a little greasy going on and I was more aware of it on my skin than I’d like to be. My main issue with it is the scent. It’s not unpleasant necessarily, but it is very noticeable if you’re sensitive to fragrance. I could deal with it except that it took a long time to fade, making me even more aware of the product on my skin. No breakouts so far and I will continue to use it, but I’m not sure if I would purchase due to the scent. Although if I can get used to it over time this could be something I continue to use. nan
