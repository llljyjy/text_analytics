This review is based on a free sample I received from Influencer. This is a nice, hydrating basic facial cream. Product is moisturizing, absorbs nicely, and feels refreshing after applying. I enjoy using this facial cream and typically only apply it at night. HOWEVER, I just cannot justify the high price point for a repurchase. I have found and used many cheaper options that have made a similar, if not better, impact on my skincare. nan
