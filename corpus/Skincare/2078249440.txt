I applied this lotion morning and evening for 5 days and showered once a day as well. I noticed a really nice slight tan between application and my next shower, however, I didnâ€™t see much of a build over time. I took a picture of before the 5 days and after and the difference was only slight. With that said, I thought the scent, hydration and evenness of application were all perfect. Great Scent
