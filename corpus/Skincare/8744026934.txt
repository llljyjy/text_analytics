Absolutely terrible. First off as you probably read already, it has an extreme white cast that it leaves on the face. The worst part is, it looks HORRENDOUS under makeup. I usually put my sunscreen on after moisturizer. Whether I let it sit for a long time or do my makeup immediately. makes no difference... starts patching and being irritating. WORST SUNSCREEN.
