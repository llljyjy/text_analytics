I was given a trial size of this from Influenster to give my honest review.  I used it almost nightly for about 2 weeks and have noticed the most change in my under eye area.  My circles are less pronounced and my skin is more supple.  The cream is very silky smooth and absorbed into the skin very well without leaving that greasy, sticky feeling.  I would recommend to others.  I subtracted a star only because I would prefer it to be scented, but other than that, I am pleased with it. Great feeling and good absorption on skin
