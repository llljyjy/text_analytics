My skin is very fair and sensitive. I definitely overlooked the word “balm“ in this cleanser’s name otherwise i wouldn’t have bothered to purchase this because for me, balm only belongs on my lips and not my skin. It felt like a thick globby greasy mess even after rinsing it off with as much water as possible(even with an exfoliating style wash cloth).I also would get a film inside of my eyes that made my vision blurry, this stuff is like literally washing your face with Vaseline. It also smells rancid altohugh i believe it may be due to the oat ingredient which smells similar. This is a highly rated top selling product but it unfortunately wasn’t for me. I purchased the Inkey List Salicylic Acid cleanser which is a much better fit for my Skin. Greasy and Smelly
