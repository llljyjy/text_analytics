First of all the packaging is so pretty and luxurious it looks so nice on a counter. Second, the formula is so rich and amazing quality, hence the price, that I loved it. My skin feels like I have gone to a spa after using. I only use serum at night in order to rest and let it sink in for hours. I use 2-3 pumps for face and neck. I have normal to dry skin and my face feels smoother, soft and pore less in the morning. I don’t mind the fragrance in it at all. It hasn’t broken my skin out and I haven’t had any bad reaction to it. It is a bit pricey but if you like results and don’t mind why not? I’d totally recommend. Loved it
