So Iâ€™ve been trying the new IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream Hydrating Moisturizer for the past two weeks and have definitely seen great results! My face/neck area definitely feels more moisturized and I love how easy the cream rubs in with no residue. It smells nice and really is calming before sleep. I put it on after washing my face clean and then when I wake up in the morning my skin feels so soft! Love the clean packaging as well. Two thumbs up!  :) Amazing cream! Works magic
