This is the best mineral sunscreen I have found thus far, and I’ve bought the jumbo version for me and my mom. We’re indian, and have a medium skin tone and this does not leave a white cast on our skin as long as we rub it in well. Something odd was that both of ours has different textures - mine is very liquidy and hers was like a cream.I wish they had a waterproof version for pool or beach days, but for day to day non-waterproof is totally great. Love it! Will buy again
