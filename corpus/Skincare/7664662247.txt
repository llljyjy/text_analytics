I’m a boxycharm member and many other subscription boxes and Ive tried almost everything. Paula’s Choice has great products but this right is amazing! I thought no way when I saw how cheap it was but I was AMAZED! It has made my skin 50% better & I’m not even joking! Everyone should use Niacinamide in their beauty routine it’s a must. This was the golden ticket for my skin. I’ve tried a few other brands but this one beats them all & at $6!!! A MUST HAVE!!
