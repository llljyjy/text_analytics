I tried this product for free as a free sample from PinchME and after my first application i wasnt so sure. Well its been almost a week now and what i can say is that when applying the product it feels greasy and makes you believe that it will leave your face oily. However after applying my face had an almost dry look and the product has some caking. Needless to say, the feel of my skin was definetly noticeably soft and smooth. Not too shabby...
