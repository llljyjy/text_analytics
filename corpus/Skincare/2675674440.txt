I love this product! Seriously have been using this every day since I first got it. As someone with sensitive, dry skin this stuff is a life saver!A spray on vegan collagen serum sounds like an absolute dream! I always apply this when I have freshly washed skin while it’s still damp during that “magic minute”. I love spraying it generously and my skin loves it. After it dries down it’s a bit tacky to the touch but I love that!It provides a nice base for my skincare to apply onto. It really does plump the skin and it feels so soft and supple. I love using it on a daily basis, it really is a nice pick me up.More importantly I LOVE how even it sprays onto the skin the mist is microfine I can barely feel it! It is so soft and relaxing it truly is a luxury experience. I love it!
