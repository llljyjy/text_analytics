Favourite skincare product ever!! I’ve been using it for over a year now and I can’t go without it. I had post inflammatory hyperpigmentation and whiteheads on my cheeks that would come and go for months. I tried a ton of products but this one was the best by far. I use it twice a day and noticed a difference within a month. In 6 months my hyperpigmentation was completly gone and helped my skin clear up so much. Very affordable as well, love this so much! favourite skincare product
