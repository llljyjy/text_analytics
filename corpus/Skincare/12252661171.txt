This mask is worthless. It makes no visible difference in my skin. My pores look the same, skin isn’t brighter, it’s just putting muck on your face. Caudalie as a whole is a very unimpressive brand that is overpriced. I sincerely don’t understand the hype. That’s all it is, shallow hype. There’s no merit to this brand at all. meh, not impressed in the slightest
