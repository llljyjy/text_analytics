I am in my mid 30â€™s normal/dry skin type (normally) and bought this product because I was looking for something gentle and hydrating for my hormonal skin. I was pregnant at the time and everything was making my skin red. This product instantly soothed my skin and made it baby soft! I continued to use this postpartum and have bought it 3 times since! This is perfect for summer because it is a light cream but you may need a serum to go with it if you have drier skin, especially in the winter. My go-to moisturizer!
