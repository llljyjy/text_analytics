Great at removing makeup. Really good balm makeup remover if thatâ€™s what your after. Unfortunately it leaves my skin tight and dry afterwards. I have sensitive skin and it feels like the balm is stripping too much every time I use it. I will still recommend this product for the people with the skin types that can handle it better. Definitely worth a try. leaves my skin dry & tight after use
