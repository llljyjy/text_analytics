I received this product for free from influencer and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review. First let me start off with the smell I love the little light scent of floral and the cream is not too heavy it makes my skin feeling nice and hydrated revitalized And the glow that it gives you. I would recommend this product if you haven’t yet. My new holy grail!
