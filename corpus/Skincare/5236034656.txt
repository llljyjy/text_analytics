I switched to this after I ran out of my L’Oréal glycolic acid serum (which is still great). That was 10% and super effective and fast. However, after using this for about four weeks, my skin is having amazing days every day. This one’s formula  really is special. If you’re on the fence, get the mini and give it a chance. I’m glad I did! Want perfectly smooth, creamy skin days every day?
