Backstory: I have a very light skin tone that damages easily. My skin is sensitive and reactive to most products. I get a lot of sun and need a sunscreen I feel GOOD wearing every single day. I only use mineral sunscreen. I’ve tried so many over the years from drugstore to luxury and all have failed me in one way or another.Until this!! This is my new favorite mineral face sunscreen, hands down. Other mineral sunscreens are too thick, leave a white cast, get stuck in my eyebrows, make me break out, and exaggerate dry skin patches. This does none of the above. Keep in mind my skin is very light, but for me, once rubbed in, I see absolutely no trace of white cast left behind (so refreshing compared to other “sheer/clear/LIES“ mineral sunscreens that still read white on skin). After its rubbed in my skin does look... evened out? Smoother? Almost as if I’m wearing a light diffusing cream or tinted cream. They claim the squalane in it gives you a “glow“, and it’s certainly hydrating... but whatever it is, I feel the need for less concealer when using this. DEWY is for sure a word I would use to describe this. If you absolutely need a matte sunscreen, this isn’t it. But it doesn’t feel greasy and just a touch of powder over the top sets it perfectly for me and my skin looks hydrated but not oily. I’ve been using it every day for weeks now--no breakouts or reactions (usually my biggest worry/complaint with new products) and my skin honestly feels healthier.  I buy the big 3.8oz bottle and it ends up being a reasonable price per ounce (~$12/oz) when compared to other mineral face sunscreens (SuperGoop-$25/oz, La Roche Posay-$24/oz, Neutrogena-$8/oz)I honestly look forward to using this every day. Also, Biossance!! Sustainable, clean, and partners in change. I feel good supporting them. I hope this helps anyone on their search for healthy, happy skincare. My new love.
