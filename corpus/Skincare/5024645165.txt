I wanted to like this so bad! It seems to work well for so many people. For some reason all it does to my lips is make them scaley and scabby, really dry feeling and uncomfortable like there’s a matte lipstick on them. Im curious as to whether or not anyone else has had this problem? Maybe I’m slightly allergic to some ingredient in it? Anyway, I hope it works for y’all but I guess be aware that it doesn’t work for everyone ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ simply didn’t work for me ):
