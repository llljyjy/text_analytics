I received a 7 day sample of Clarins double serum from @chickadvisor @thisisbutterly @clarinscanada for free in exchange for my honest review. This serum is a double formula that combines 21 potent plant extracts to boost the skin’s vital functions. I applied this serum nightly as part of my skincare routine. It is an oiled based serum that absorbs nicely and doesn’t leave your skin greasy. The serum has a pleasant scent that is not too strong so this would go well with someone who is sensitive to smells. My skin is definitely more hydrated and softer. I dont see any difference for my fine lines but it’s most likely because I was only able to use it for 7 days. Overall, it seems like a good serum and I would probably purchase it in the future to see all it’s benefits in a longer period. #DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare Good serum
