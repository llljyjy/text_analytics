I have exceptionally dry skin - we’re talking flaking cheeks and red irritation that just seems to soak up moisturizers within seconds.This soothed my skin and made it feel smooth and fresh without any irritation. It’s pretty light so I needed so layer a little more product on top for a sweet look but works amazingly as a day cream under makeup. Would definitely recommend! Smooth and refreshing cream
