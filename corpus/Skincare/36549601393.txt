I just got this product and when I tell you my mouth dropped. This lip oil is NOT sticky at all which is amazing. In my opinion, the product on the lips doesn’t even feel like a lip gloss. I’ve heard a lot of people comparing this to a lip gloss but it’s honestly not. The shine gives a beautiful and lasts forever. I took a nap for a couple of hours and it was still shiny and as hydrating. The scent is just perfect. The only thing I can really compare it to that you may know of is a cherry icee. It smells exactly like how a cherry icee would taste. It’s not overwhelming either. I literally cannot stop applying this product GET IT!! Even if you’re debating on getting it, try it out and see how you like it. It’s definitely worth it! Literally a must have.
