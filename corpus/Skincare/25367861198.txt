I love the way this feels as it cleans. I’ve been using it as a daily cleanser even if I’m not wearing makeup. (I rarely wear much) My sensitive skin has not had any issues with it! I’m not a fan of the scent so I’d love to see other variations available. It would be a 5 if not for the scent. It’s a citrus-y rose smell but mostly rose and for me personally, floral smells can be overwhelming. It really melts!!
