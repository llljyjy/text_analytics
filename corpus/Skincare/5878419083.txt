I’ve been trying out this new sunscreen and so far I’m a fan! The best thing is that it really is fragrance free, so I don’t spend the day smelling like sunblock. Also, no break outs on my sensitive skin either. I will say it is a bit thicker consistency than my usual Paula Choice sunscreen, but I actually like that for these sunnier months. My only issue was that the pump seems to get stuck sometimes depending on the angle I hold the bottle.I received this product in exchange for my honest review. Sensitive Skin Friendly
