I’m confused about all the mixed reviews. I love to travel with this cleanser and it’s also what I keep in my sink. (I prefer a pump in the shower).This is a great everyday cleanser as it’s gentle and always leaves my skin feeling hydrated. It also does a great job removing eye make ups when I don’t want to use a cleansing oil first and doing all the additional steps. Again my skin is left feeling smooth and hydrated. I always gravitate to this as there seems to be so many cleansers out there that strip ur skin and everything now has some sort of peel or acid.This is now my 3rd tube underrated
