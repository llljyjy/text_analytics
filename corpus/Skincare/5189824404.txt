I absolutely love this product. I’ve been using it for a couple of years now and have extremely dry skin. I always massage it into my face and apply it more heavily wherever my makeup is thickest. Massaging it in really helps with breaking the makeup down and also moisturizing my skin. Afterward, I just wipe it off with my microfiber makeup remover towel.IMO, this product needs to be used by being wiped off. You won’t see it work as well if you try to wash it off. Best MU Remover for Dry, Sensitive Skin by Far!
