Okay so Iâ€™m fairly new to self tanning. I tried the Isle of Paradise mousse and for whatever reason I could NEVER get it to be even on my skin! I have very very (like VERY) fair skin (Irish and Scottish descent) and it would always be splotchy and uneven after I properly prepped with moisturizer and exfoliation. I was in the Sephora store about the try the Isle of Paradise tanning water and a lady behind me in line told me to try this product line instead. This St. Tropez mousse worked so much better for my skin. It was more natural, smelled better and less than the Isle of Paradise stuff and also developed way quicker. The one complaint I have is that it does transfer to clothes and fabrics so be careful about that when you are processing. Otherwise, this is a product I will continue to buy! Much better than Isle
