This was my holy grail cleanser for years. A few months ago, I received a bottle of face wash that seemed off in consistency so I exchanged it and it seemed normal. Fast forward two months and I was suffering from the worst breakouts I’ve ever had in my life (I’m 33 and maybe get 1-2 pimples a month).  They WOULD.NOT.STOP. I had a new pimple every day, sometimes two. Finally, after so much trial and error, I stopped using this face wash and switched to an old sample I had that I use for traveling and sure enough, my breakouts stopped immediately. Except now I am left trying to heal all of these acne scars and sadly looking for something to replace my favorite face wash. The ingredient change was confirmed when comparing the ingredient list of my sample to the new bottle that was causing the breakouts. Updated formulation destroyed my skin
