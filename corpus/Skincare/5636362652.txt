I really enjoyed using this product the light scent is lovely, it has a nice feel and works well as a hydrating base for other products but... it EVAPORATES!! I honestly thought I was just using it really quickly but when I did finish the bottle, there was a bit left in it and I unscrewed the top, to retrieve the last drops, I forgot about it on my counter, and just a few hours later there was absolutely nothing left. It literally disappears... This product evaporates in the bottle.
