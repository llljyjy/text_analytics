I received a #freeproduct sample of this Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum from TopBox Circle in exchange for my honest review. The sample size provided was enough to give me three morning applications after my regular cleansing and toning routine. I only needed a small amount of the serum to cover my entire face and neck. It went on seamlessly and absorbed very well. There was no leftover stickiness which I despise in some other branded serums I have tried. My skin was smooth to the touch and appeared well hydrated before applying any cream. I didn’t notice any scent with the serum which I really liked- I do not like anything I put on my face to have a strong scent or chemical smell. I followed the serum with Clinque’s wrinkle correcting cream (both eye and face) which I was also provided #freeproduct samples of. Even with three applications, I can tell this is a good serum! I can’t say it will erase lines or wrinkles, I did find that it helped my face appear more smooth and hydrated, which is my main goal when using serum. I’m impressed with this product!#topboxcircle #clinique #freeproduct Lovely and Light Serum
