I’ve used this moisturizer for 2 weeks now everyday after cleansing my face in the morning and before bedtime. I was a bit worried that the turmeric might make my skin yellow but its lower on the ingredients list so it could be used to colorize the cream. The consistency of the cream is good, not to runny or thick and it was used during the wintertime and was enough to keep my face from drying. It does not have a residue that some thicker moisturizers might have. It did not lighten some of the brown spots I had but I have yet to find a cream that does. I like that it’s in a tube and stays fresh longer. The smell of the product is a mix of herbal medicine and lime and a bit of hemp but I like it. It’s not overpowering. Nice consistency and smell.
