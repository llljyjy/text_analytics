This is a very nice moisturizer and seems to help my skin look and feel more youthful. It goes on smooth and makes my skin radiant. It has a smell, slightly strong but not too bad. That being said, at 34, I donâ€™t see a reason to spend almost $100 on such a small jar, when there are plenty of other products at half the price that perform just as well. nan
