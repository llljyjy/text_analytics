Way better than farmacys cleansing balm and glow recipes ! I have extremely sensitive rosacea/acne prone hormonal skin and I have never experienced irritation from this. People say it leaves a film but that’s because you’re supposed to take your time washing your face. Also good if using retinol it helps soothe ! 10/10 for me and good price point nan
