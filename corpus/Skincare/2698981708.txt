I use this every single night and it has lasted me longer than I had ever hoped. Everything before this product is a blur. I’m planning on getting the largest size when this one runs out. It melts away my waterproof mascara in seconds and the texture is lovely. But I do notice my eyes feel a little gunky after rinsing so I dropped a star. I don’t know if it’s just me, but it’s kind of annoying and only happens with this product. Can’t live without now
