I really like that you are getting 3 products at once. The bottle dispenses a nice even amount with each pump and the texture of the products is very nice. I really like the smell but I wouldnâ€™t recommend it if you are sensitive to smells. It is a perfume-y kind of scent. I have used this product for one month and I feel like I can tell my skin texture is much smoother than it has been and some discoloration has lessened. The product feels moisturizing when applying but it is very important to apply moisturizer afterwards. I forgot one time and my normal-dry skin felt extra parched. Nice product!
