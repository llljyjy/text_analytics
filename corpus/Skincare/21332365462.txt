I got to try this product with a complementary sample from Influenster. I really like the consistency of these cream. It’s not sticky or oily and it’s super smooth on my skin. The price point is higher than I like typically, but it’s definitely a good moisturizer. I like using it around my eyes and along my brow where I have some worry lines Creamy and moisturizing
