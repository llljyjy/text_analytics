This product is okay. I already use the DDG peel pads but was looking for an alternative that could possibly be more cost efficient (I know it’s ironic because neither of these products are cheap lol) anyways, I used nightly for a month and didn’t notice any dramatic difference. I find the peel pads work better to keep my skin even toned and breakout free. The consistency of this serum is like a lightweight oil that absorbs very quickly although it’s not my favourite formulation. It also doesn’t smell pleasant either but I’m not one to discontinue using a product that smells bad if it delivers great results. However, this just wasn’t that impressive to me. just okay
