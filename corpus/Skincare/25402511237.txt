I have been using this eye cream for a couple of weeks and am so pleased! It’s lightweight, not heavy, and easily smooths into my skin.  I’ve noticed improvement in the fine lines beneath my eyes, they are smoother, and less visible. I also have found a couple of spots damaged from frostbite on my cheeks (below where my glasses sat) improving as well, they’re less itchy and irritated. Loving this eye cream
