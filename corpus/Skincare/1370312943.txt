Product is a lovely stable vitamin c, but I do not see any difference to my skin after quite a bit of use. Non irritating &  unscented which is nice. Applies to a very matte finish which would negate any “brightening” impact it may have. Nothing inherently bad, just doesn’t do anything for me. Meh - nothing bad, nothing great
