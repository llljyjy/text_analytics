I received a trial sample of this Soft Clean Infusion from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review.Well it’s a pretty nice product overall. I like the light waterlily fragrance. It makes my skin feels smooth and softer after each use. It also adds a nice glow after application. I applied it using about 5-6 drops on a cotton ball cut in half. The only reason I only give 4stars instead of 5stars is because it doesn’t leave my skin feeling moisturized at all... other than that though I really like this product. Great for the summer months! Nice Product
