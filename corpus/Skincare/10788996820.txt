I received this for free in exchange for a review. I’m trying to up my skin care game since I’m almost 30, so I’ve tried a lot of different moisturizers and serums. I like that this one doesn’t have an overwhelming smell or leave my face feeling sticky. I have noticed a firming effect after using this for a few weeks, so I would definitely recommend this to others. nan
