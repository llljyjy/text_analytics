I like this product! The Drunk Elephant bouncy brightfacial mask has been very good. I love using it as the last step of my routine before bed, it makes my face super soft and just overall feels good on the skin! I haven’t had any issues after using it, but if you have sensitive skin I would definitely recommend testing on a small surface first to make sure it’ll be good for you. Will continue to use! nan
