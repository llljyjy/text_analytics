I have mostly dry skin, and at first I had high hopes for this.  The texture is gel-like and feels really smooth going on, then gets sort of tacky as it absorbs.  I use other products (serum and face mist) before my moisturizer so at first I felt like this one was just nice, nothing special or stand out.  However, one night I was in a hurry, so I skipped my other steps and used just the moisture surge.  By the time I was crawling into bed thirty minutes later, my face felt dry, and I woke up to no sign of hydration at all.This is probably a great option if your skin is oilier or doesnâ€™t need much hydration, otherwise there are better options you can add to your regime for better results. Not For My Dry Skin
