This one didn’t really do anything for me. I have a combination skin and was skeptical about this. It was pretty costly for me and I kept rechecking it until one day I decided to give it a try. My bottle finished today and throughout my use I didn’t see any improvement. I really wanted to like this and really wanted to see results so I kept using and using.. I did my research and this was supposed to help me with old acne scars and red dots, it was supposed to resurface dead partciles and allow them to heal but none of that happened. Anyways, I’m pretty dissatisfied and disappointed it didn’t work. Didn’t work for me
