I received this product on December 24th & used up the deluxe sample size on January 2nd, so it was a 9-day supply for me. The pros were that I do feel like it softened the lines around my eyes, didn’t have a scent, and felt very whipped and moisturizing. It feels thick, yet not tacky. I really like the consistency, and the non-scent. I have one larger crow’s foot line on my left eye & it does appear reduced! Wish I had a little more to judge how much throat one particular line will disappear, so that means I’ll need to buy some. I’d recommend this product, as it did reduce my eye wrinkles & felt moisturizing to my sensitive eye skin. Great eye cream for diminishing fine eye lines.
