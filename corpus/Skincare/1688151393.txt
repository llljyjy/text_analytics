I loved this sunscreen! I have dry and sensitive skin and also burn easily. This sunscreen was moisturizing without making me feel greasy and dried down nicely on my skin after a few minutes. It worked well with my skin and didnâ€™t cause any irritation or blemishes like some other sunscreens tend to. I would be happy to use it again! I received this item free for review. nan
