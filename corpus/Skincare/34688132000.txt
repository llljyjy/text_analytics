I got this moisturizer as part of the YTTP skin routine set. At first I was underwhelmed - it didn’t seem to make much difference in my skin. Then I ran out, and now I can tell a huge difference in my skin’s moisture level even though I’m still using a moisturizer. I have a fairly deep line in my forehead that had smoothed out quite a bit but is now back in full force. I will be getting more when my current moisturizer runs out! Didn’t think it did much until I ran out
