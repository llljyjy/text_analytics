I love DDG products, use Vitamin C serums daily and also love Lactic Acid so this serum is a winner for me. I like that it has a good concentration of L Ascorbic Acid and is suitable for all skin types. I also like that it comes in a bottle that blocks the light and with a dropper so it is easy to apply without risk of contamination or degradation.I haven’t been using this long enough to notice its firming effect but my skin tone looks bright, even, and healthy. I have been using it with a HA and SPF in the mornings, once it’s colder I will add a moisturizer to this routine also. It layers well with my other products, is fast to absorb, and spreads nicely on the skin so that you only need to use a couple of drops. It does have that typical chemical/smoke Vitamin C type scent but it doesn’t linger. I’m very happy with this one overall! Very Good!
