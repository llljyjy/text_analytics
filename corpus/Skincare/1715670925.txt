Really wanted to love this, but it was a total no go for me. Love the idea of minimal coverage that targets redness for those days you don’t wanna wear foundation, but I am just way too fair skinned for this product. I could possibly see this working for medium skin tones and normal to oily skin, but it pretty much made me look like I had jaundice, and it also tugged on any peice of dry skin on my face making my skin look patchy. I am naturally a redhead with fair skin that is practically translucent, so for anyone who can identify with that and wants to see how this looks I’ve attached a swatch photo. Wish it had different tint levels. Made me look like a flaky Simpsons character
