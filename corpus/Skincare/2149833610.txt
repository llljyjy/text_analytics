I received this product from Influenster for free in exchange for my honest opinion. I’m a long time Estée Lauder fan! I religiously use their Advanced Night Repair line and that will probably never change! However, I wasn’t super impressed with the results of this crème. I love the thick, rich texture and the perfumey scent but I really didn’t notice a difference in my skin. Maybe I didn’t use it long enough since this was a sample size but I’m just not that impressed. Still LOVE Estée Lauder!!! Meh
