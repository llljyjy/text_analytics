I tried this thinking it wasnâ€™t going to perform any miracles, but let me tell you- my fine lines and even bags are pretty much unnoticeable now. My pictures speak for themselves. The first one was before I started using it and the send picture is from using it only at night after 3 weeks. It does burn a little off you use any retinol first, but not that bad. I will definitely be purchasing more of this to get the maximum benefit of using longer. Miracle cream!
