I LOVE this moisturizer for my combination skin, but the packaging is TERRIBLE. The old jar was perfect, it allotted the perfect amount mess free. This new packaging just does not work. It is okay at first, but once you get half way through it’s impossible to regulate dispersal wasting too much product. I am not going to buy this again if they don’t fix this issue. Terrible packaging, please go back to jar!
