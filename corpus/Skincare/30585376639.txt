I received this product complimentary from TULA and Influenster in exchange for my honest review.This is one of the best creams I have tried. The smell is subtle and fruity, the texture is thick and soft and it absorbs super fast without leaving an oily sensation. My skin is super dry and much more during winter, this cream help me to hydrate my face so much, it just feels so good on the skin, and the effect last a lot. Itâ€™s a really good product, i really recommend it :) One photo is before (night time) and the other after in the morning. Love love love
