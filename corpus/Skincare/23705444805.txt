Love this product, helps mask my ruddy complexion.  There are things to note when using this though, make sure your face is moisturized and only use a tiny amount.  Like a really tiny amount, I just tap my finger on the cream then tap in on my face then blend.  If you use any more than that it can give you a masky look.  I think this jar will definitely last me a year. Great product, just use a tiny amount
