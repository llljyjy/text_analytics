This is great. It really hydrated and soothes. Only giving it four stars because I wouldn’t call this a mask. It’s more like a moisturizer to me, it doesn’t make sense why anyone would rinse this off because it soaks right into the skin. It’s really lovely, it really feels great on the skin but I’d say this is more like a night cream than a mask. great! but not a mask
