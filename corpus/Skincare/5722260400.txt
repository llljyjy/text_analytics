I got this product from influenster to do a review: The texture felt smooth & silky & I absolutely love foaming cleansers like this. The product works great, it’s great on my sensitive skin. I didn’t notice any skin irritation or redness after using it which is a plus for me. It left my face looking healthy & refreshed. I don’t really like scents in skincare but this fragrance was actually nice, it was not overpowering it felt clean. I do have dry skin & felt like it kinda left my skinDry after using it. But compared to other cleansers I’ve tried before this didn’t leave my face feeling extremely dry or anything like that. I also was able to use serum & moisturizer after the cleanser & my face felt hydrated & looked nice. It felt like it did a great job as a cleanser it got dirt, oil & makeup off, everything off my face it was like feeling the benefits of having a deep cleanser without abrasiveness or skin irritation.  I also love the bottle it’s pretty huge for a face cleanser it kinda looks like an classy yet simple packaging. I recommend this product I think it does a great job as a cleanser it felt nice on my skin, it felt like my skin had a deep clean, I was able to remove all my makeup, skin oil & dirt. It worked good on my sensitive skin & didn’t cause any irritation. The scent actually smelled good & wasn’t overpowering Those are my main reasons why I liked this product and would recommend nan
