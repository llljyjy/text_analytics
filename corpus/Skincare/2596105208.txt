Honestly hasn’t been a product I’ve used by clarins that I didn’t love. I have a few of their products I use in my daily/ night routine. I was beyond excited to try intensive facial wrap cream . The texture is nice and thick and not to runny . My biggest concern is ski. Firming and de puffing areas . Goes on nice and creamy and set it on in the morning while I got ready. When I washed it off very much visual difference in my skin. Was super soft but also puffy areas had decreased quite a bit. Loved it. Great de puffing mask
