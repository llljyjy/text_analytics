Such a hydrating product. 10/10 made my skin feel so smooth and clean. I personally struggle with oily skin and this product felt so light on my skin and didnâ€™t make it seem like there was too much on my face like some serums make my face feel. I have been using it every morning and my face feels so much brighter throughout the day. Overall l, I am obsessed with this product and I plan on using it everyday. nan
