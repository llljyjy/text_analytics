This eye cream is honestly one of the best I’ve ever tried. It’s luxurious, creamy, thick, smells amazing, is gentle on the eye and melts into the skin seamlessly. I really like that it’s great for day and night. It applies well under makeup and keeps my eyes hydrating and brightened through the night. It doesn’t irritate my eyes, which I’ve struggled with before. Also, I’ve noticed a little goes a long way which makes the price more justifiable. Overall, I really love this product and would recommend to anyone looking for a versatile cream that hydrates and brightens! Luxurious eye cream
