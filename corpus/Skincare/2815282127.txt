I received this product  from Influencer in exchange for my unbiased opinion.  Overall the I love the product. I have normal to dry skin. The biossance made my skin feel super soft and it does feel  moisturize. When I first started the product I did have a bit of peeling around my nose. But that normal for a  retinol product. This one was a win.
