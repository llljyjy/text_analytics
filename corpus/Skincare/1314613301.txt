As someone with fairer skin, I’ll pretty much try any and all ’clean’ SPF products. I liked the convenience of this, and that it was on the translucent end so it wouldn’t leave a white cast like traditional sunscreen. But that’s about all I liked. Every time I give this a go I regret it, push it back into my cabinet, come back some time later for another chance and regret it all over again. Almost immediately after application this turns my face SO RED, and it’s a surface irritation that lasts all day. Even after color correction and some gentle coverage I look like I’m trying to hide a deep sunburn. I missed my return window because I was so determined to make this higher SPF product work for me. I wish I paid more attention to the negative reviews than the glowy influencer ones... Not for me.
