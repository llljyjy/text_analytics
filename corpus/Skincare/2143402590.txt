Great product. This was gifted by Peter Thomas Roth to experience and honestly review. And it was a pleasure to wear on my skin. I applied it at night to bare skin. I wasn’t sure at first if I should moisturize before or after or at all. So I opted to apply this after cleansing. It went on easily and absorbed quickly. I waited a little bit to see how my face felt naturally after application and then I added some of my regular moisturizer to prevent any dryness. I don’t usually use this type of face cream but I will keep using it for good results. The next morning my skin looked refreshed and balanced. I didn’t experience any side effects to it as my skin has been known to be sensitive in the past. I’m definitely looking forward to positive longterm effects while using this. When you’re 48, a good quality product like this is a must! My new skincare staple to my beauty routine!
