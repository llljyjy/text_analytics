Very delicate and soft application. The chalky solution after rising with water was a surprise. I was expecting it to dissolve into a soapy solution. My skin did not feel stripped or dry, and I am definitely adding this step to my makeup routine. Less waste compared to using cotton rounds. Gentle on skin
