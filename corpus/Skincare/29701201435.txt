I’ve been using this product for a little over 2 weeks now in my morning routine. I have to admit that I love the texture of this stuff. It’s just so lightweight and feels great on my skin .I only use a tiny dot and it covers my whole face so the product lasts a while. Plus there isn’t a noticeable fragrance that is great for people with sensitive skin!Now, onto the results, I have noticed my skins overall complexion has been looking amazing! I normally have a rather rosy complexion, but I’ve noticed it’s been more even since using this stuff .I’ve also noticed that my texture on my skin has been much smoother .Now, I can’t say that it has helped reduce the pores around my nose completely, but I’ve been liking the results so far and plan on using this to further see how it helps my pore size nan
