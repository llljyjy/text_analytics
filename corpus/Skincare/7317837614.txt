I was hesitant to buy because of the price but this is the absolutely only thing that soothes my skin with having bad dermatitis. There is also so much extra serum in the package after using the mask that you can almost use that as it’s own serum it’s amazing. One mask lasts me almost a week! Amazing for dermatitis
