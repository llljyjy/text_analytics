I have a very sensitive and dry skin. When it comes to moisturizers they have to be super hydrating but also not too heavy so it does nor irritate my skin. This product has been working so well for me. I use it in the AM . It works as a fantastic glowy and hydrating primer underneath make up as well. I also notice it keeps my skin hydrated for the majority of the day. nan
