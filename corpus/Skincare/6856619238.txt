I’ve been using this product for about a week now and it has been fantastic! There’s no smell, (fragrance free) and I can put it on my face and it won’t bother my rosacea, which is a big concern for me. I ONLY use First Aid Beauty Products with my overly dramatic sensitive face and this will officially be added to my daily routine. I am so happy I finally found a winner!!! Finally!!!!
