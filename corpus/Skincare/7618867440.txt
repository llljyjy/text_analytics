First time ever user any type of self tanner and I got the light one to try because I’m naturally either stark white or bright red lol so I thought I’d give this a go to prep for my wedding. Works awesome! I honestly used very little and did one area at a time (arm, leg, stomach, etc) with the spray and rubbed it in with the mitt. I only have one spot on my arm that I apparently missed but everywhere else is perfect! Just looks like a very light tan to take the stark white away, so not to overpowering or noticeable at all, but just leaves me with a bit of golden colour. I love it! Will definitely keep using! first time self tanner and I love!
