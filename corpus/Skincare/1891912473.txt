I’ve been using the Confidence in a Cream for a few weeks now. I have noticed a slight improvement in fine lines, which I’m assuming will only get better with continued use. My skin tone is more even. It’s very moisturizing and a little goes a longgg way! I love that it’s clean and vegan. It smells nice, too. Definitely recommend. nan
