I can’t rave about this sunscreen more, it’s one of my favorite face sunscreens!!! I’m very picky about what I put on my face, especially when it comes to sunscreens. I live in AZ where the sun is very strong. This sunscreen is very lightweight and I love the slight watermelon scent. It has a tiny bit of white sheen but completely soaks in. YOU NEED THIS PRODUCT FOR SUMMER!!!
