Really nice lotion. I use it on my face and hands. Smells really nice like tea. It’s a little heavy on my face but I like to use it on my dry patches and I think it does a good job of moisturizing. It hasn’t broken me out either. It is a little pricey so I’m not sure if it’s worth the price. It’s for the body as well but the bottle is small so it feels like a waste to use as a body moisturizer. nan
