I’m super picky when it comes to facial products. Only the best ingredients and performance. It’s too important for healthy skin. This eye cream is super impressive! Thick and creamy, but rubs in nicely. Leaves my under eye area feeling noticeably smoother and moisturized. I also love that Drunk Elephant uses clean, non-toxic ingredients that I can be sure are safe. All around great product! Fabulous eye cream!
