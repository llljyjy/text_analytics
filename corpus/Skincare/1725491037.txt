I have really oily skin and was happy to try out a new moisturizer. I tried it after showering and applied a dime size amount on my hand. I used my ring finger to apply the moisturizer onto my face. The moisturizer was lightweight and it felt like I had nothing on my face. My face wasn’t oily at the end of the day compared to other moisturizers I’ve used in the past for oily skin. There’s no scent which was nice. nan
