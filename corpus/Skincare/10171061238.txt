i have tried all the masks in the world but this is my absolute favorite. it makes my lips feel so soft. i live in a super dry climate and my lips are always chapped and sometimes crack and bleed. this has helped so much. the laneige mask is okayyyyy but this is elite. there isnâ€™t a strong smell either! Laneige who????
