This serum at first was amazing. I used it every morning for about two weeks and it left my face glowing, but then it started to make me break out in acne all over my face. I wasnâ€™t sure what it was first so i left out the serum from my usual routine and my face started to clear up. I have sensitive skin so beware before buying this product. nan
