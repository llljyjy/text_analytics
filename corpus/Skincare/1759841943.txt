I received a sample of this in exchange for an honest review. It was too small to see the long term effects of the product, but I definitely noticed a difference in how hydrated my skin looked and felt. I tend to get very dry when the weather starts to get colder but this definitely helped keep that at bay. I thought the event was light and really nice, and I am usually sensitive to heavily scented products. I especially love that a refill pot is available to save on packaging waste. The packaging is lovely has has a luxe look to it as well. Excellent hydration
