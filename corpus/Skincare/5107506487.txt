This product is just OK. I will say that the texture squeezes out of the bottle really chunky so that weirds me out however it does easily smooth out on the face and does not leave a residue. It is a very nice shimmer, but I preferred the shimmer on my collarbone and shoulder area. I do have oily skin so I don’t like a shimmer on my face except for a slight highlighter. However, even though I do have a oily skin this did not dry me out or make me produce even more oil. If anything, it was pretty complementary to my normal skin routine. So, if you have oily skin and you like a nice under shimmer and then this may be the product for you! This one just wasn’t for me, but that doesn’t mean it’s a bad product. I did receive this product as an incentive to write a review. if you love GLOW
