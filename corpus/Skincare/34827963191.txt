I received this as a gift from Influenster. To be honest, I didn’t care too much for this mask. I found it difficult to put on with the double layer of plastic and then it stuck to everything. Once it was on, it felt like your average sheet mask. It was nice but I didn’t notice any significant difference to my skin after. All in all, it was an okay face mask. nan
