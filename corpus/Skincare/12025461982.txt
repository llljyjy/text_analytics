I waited to write this until I had used the entire tube and I just have to say I for sure love this stuff. Literally about to buy a jar. It’s light but hydrating. Perfect for during the day and made my skin so smooth. I’ve noticed a difference since I’ve been out. Worth every penny! Great light moisturizer.
