This toner was an interesting product to try out! I hadn’t tried a milky toner before so I wasn’t sure what to expect. Overall I enjoyed getting to use this product and thought I noticed some positive effects from it. The container itself confused me at first- this product comes in a plastic bottle with a twist lid that you pour/squeeze to dispense the product. This product is a liquid with a botanical and faintly  fruity scent. The toner made my skin feel soft and over time I felt like it helped minimize my larger pores. This is a great product is add into your everyday routine. Milky Toner
