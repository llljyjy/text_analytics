My new favorite AM product! It’s been so hard to find a moisturizer/sunscreen combo that works well with my other skincare products. This doubles as a lotion with SPF and isn’t greasy, doesn’t make your face sting like some sunscreens…it just feels like lotion. It’s unscented and won’t make serums or other products pill underneath it. It’s very creamy and makes your face feel super soft, I love it!! Best SPF out there
