Due to an injury, my lower lip gets dried out very easily, and lip oils and moisturizers have been my saving grace. When I saw fenty had come out with one, I got so exited and purchased it immediately. This is a lip gloss. It’s extremely sticky and doesn’t really moisturize your lips in any meaningful way. It’s be fine if that’s what you’re looking for, but if you’re expecting a lip oil, look elsewhere. Not a Lip “Oil”
