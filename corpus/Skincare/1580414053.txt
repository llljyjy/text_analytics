The packaging felt nice and substantial without being gratuitous that I feel like they’re being ecologically wasteful. The product felt nice on my face. Unfortunately, it made me break out. I’m no stranger to retinol containing products so I don’t think that is why. I know other people have used and enjoyed this product. I may just be one of the unlucky few who had a reaction.I received this complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my review. Not for me.
