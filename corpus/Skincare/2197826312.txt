I have to say after a couple days using this serum, my skin does look brighter. It meshes really well with they exfoliating toner, moisture whip, night mask, and oil. Can you tell I love YTTP products? I have their deep moisturizer and the cleaning face wash too! Those which I did not receive for free. Bought for my mom too! Need to try the rest!
