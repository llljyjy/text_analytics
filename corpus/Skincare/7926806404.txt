I have tried so many mineral sunscreens the last few years, it’s like trying to find a good natural deodorant. This product as an SPF is amazing, does not have that tacky feeling most mineral sunscreens have. Even though I got the tint free one, it almost gives my skin the texture of wearing makeup. This applies best if you use a moisturizer first. It claims it can be a moisturizer, though I don’t think it’s hydrating enough, even for my oily skin. Most of the negative reviews of this product seem to be that many people bought the tinted version and it was too dark. The ‘cool’ toned option does not have a white cast so should be fine on lighter skin tones even if you have a tan. Can end my mineral SPF hunt here
