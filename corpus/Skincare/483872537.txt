I am 51 with mature, combination skin. I do have hyperpigmentation due to age and few wrinkles. I do not have sensitive skin and have never used products without fragrance. I received this Dior balm from Influenster to try and review. This balm has a very light Tea scent and is very thick. It does leave my skin very greasy after use and feel I need to reapply throughout the day as my skin feels dry after a few hours. I have used this on my hands and legs after shaving. It feels greasy on the hands also but does wonders for my legs. Not sure that my skin feels “plumped” after using though. This just seems too pricey for what it doesn’t do….. like for lines/wrinkles, just seems too pricey for a basic moisturizer and could find something cheaper for something so basic. I would recommend for others to try but I would not purchase in the future. Too pricey for something so basic
