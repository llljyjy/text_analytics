I received this product for free - full honest review. I tried this product for over a month to give it an honest review. I will say it isn’t for the oily, acne prone, and textured skin. I love the way it applies at first and the coverage is perfect but after some wear time it starts to emphasize on my textured skin. I think it clogs my pores as I developed some breakouts the following morning. I also don’t like the way it sits on my skin like I have a thick moisturizer on and it won’t soak in, I couldn’t wait to take off my makeup. I expected it to feel “like-skin” but it didn’t. I was hoping the product would work for me as I’m a retinol user and it would be perfect for my skin cycling “recovery” days as it has niacinamide. Not for the oily, acne-prone, textured skin.
