I was disappointed in this product. I have very dry skin and was excited to try this oil, but it did not work as promised. It did not feel hydrating and did not soak into my skin. It also came onto my skin as orange and my face looked orange/redder than normal. My skin is prone to redness so this was also unwanted. My skin started to flake using this. I used it as indicated for 4 days and then returned it. The $12 Hyaluronic Acid serum from the Ordinary worked much better than this. Did not help my dry skin
