The only thing I liked about this sunscreen was the texture. It’s very smooth and light. But that’s where the positives stop. The “glow” is more like a sparkle/shimmer. My first thought was I felt like the tin man meets a twilight vampire when they sparkle. It’s not a good look. It also has horrible pilling. All I had on under was vitamin c and moisturizer but it pilled like crazy and even after minutes of trying to get it to rub in, I had globs of it on my face (see pic). I returned it and went back to my trusted Paula’s choice tinted sunscreen. Not good
