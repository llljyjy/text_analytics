This cream is rich and very moisturizing. I am crazy about floral scents  this cream has! It also comes in a pretty rose color cream. I not only love the scent of this product, I like how it makes my skin feel silky soft instantly on absorption. It also plumps the skin, almost like a boost of collagen and gives my skin a gorgeous glow. It did not irritate my combination skin and worked well under my makeup.A little goes a long way, so the jar will last you a while. Also the cream is rich enough to used as a day cream, as well as a night cream. As for container, I am impressed with the innovation of the refill pod which is better for the environment and also saves me cost. Very moisturizing and rich!
