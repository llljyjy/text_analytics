First off, this cream is moisturizing! My skin tends to be on the drier side and when applying makeup, it can look cakey with the dryness on my face.

When I tried the Shiseido energy cream, it applied smoothly and I could feel the instant moisturizing effect. Dry patches on my face that had trouble staying hydrated now lasts longer. I honestly love the way it makes my face looks that I stopped wearing foundation. I know everybody will get different results but so far I like what it has done for me. Another biggie for me is that it contains SPF 20 and feels lightweight on the face instead of heavy. Creamy and lightweight
