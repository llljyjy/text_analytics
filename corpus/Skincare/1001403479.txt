I tried using this in place of toner and also in addition my normal toner, and while it is very hydrating and absorbs well, I can’t say that I’ve noticed any difference in my skin’s appearance. I also find that the bottle design (at least the one on the deluxe sample) is horrible because the mouth is too wide and allows too much of the product to come out. For something at this price point, I would expect a pump design to prevent contamination of the contents. nan
