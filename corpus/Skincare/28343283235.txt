I have never been a fan of Estee Lauder, however I have to be honest and good things are recognized.  my first impression is that the moisturizer gives excellent hydration without being thick, it is rather light, it has a delicate aroma, for me it is fine but if you are one of those who does not like aromas in skin care products, better skip it.  the scent just disappears soon.  skin feels hydrated, and luminous without being greasy.  I canâ€™t say anything about its main function which would be rejuvenation because that would be using it for some time, but if the first impression is that good, it will surely live up to expectations. My first Impression: Wow!
