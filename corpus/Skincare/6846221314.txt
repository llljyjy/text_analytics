i live in a really dry state, and i usually use the really thick cera ve or vanicream to moisturize in the winter. i got a sample of this from sephora and used it to prep my really dry skin for makeup and it didn’t do anything weird under sunscreen, concealer and all the other stuff i put on my face. i didn’t feel tight or dry until way later in the day than normal for me so i know it helped to retain moisture throughout the day. i also have some slight lines and bad darkness under my eyes and i notice this perked them up a little bit so i always appreciate that. would recommend as a day and night moisturizer for someone who’s skin is as dry as mine (or who also lives in colorado) great for makeup prep and dry skin in general
