I love this serum from the bottle to the scent. The bottle it comes in is beautiful. I use this serum right after I cleanse my face. The consistency is like a light moisturizer. It does have a fragrance but it is very light and it does not linger once itâ€™s on your face. I love this serum because it gives my skin hydration and leaves it plump and soft after I use it. It feels like a light moisturizer and it absorbs quicky into the skin. There is no stickiness nor heavy feeling left on the skin. I go in after with my regular moisturizer and I have no problems. It works well under make up also. I have not had any reaction to it at all either. I love it!
