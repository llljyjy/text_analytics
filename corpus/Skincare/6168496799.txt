The Kosas collagen spray CRM was an instant winner for me. They really thought about the pump spray size and it is truly a fine mist which a lot of brands missed the mark on that small detail so I automatically appreciated that when you spray it is truly a fine mist. That being said this works both as a Primer to your skin As well as a finishing spray. I love using this throughout the day as a refresher whenever Iâ€™m feeling a little bit parched or just feel like I could Use a little pick me up and it gives me an instant boost of moisture that I need and really helps liven up the plumpness in my face almost immediately. Love it
