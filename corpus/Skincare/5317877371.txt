This has become my favorite moisturizer after using it for a couple of weeks. I also tested it in the warm Florida climate and the cold New York winter. It worked perfectly under both conditions, leaving my skin super soft. My face felt great without having to reapply. I highly recommend it! Perfect for all weather
