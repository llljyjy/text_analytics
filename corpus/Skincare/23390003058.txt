Half of bottle is full of air when you take off the seal but it is inexpensive to purchase. If you think of it as a 25ml product then it’s pretty good. Doesn’t leave skin feeling uncomfortably tight, a great product to add into double cleanse routine. Inexpensive for what you get: actually 25ml bottle
