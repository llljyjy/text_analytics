There’s some weird reviews like maybe people didn’t haven’t the right skin for this or are salty about the cost. I’ve tried every dream under the sun and this product has single handedly eliminated wrinkles for me and changed my skin. Every time I try to be without it (bc of cost) I regret it. It’s worth every single penny. I also have dry skin, so if you’re oily this rich cream may be too much and would try the other version first! nan
