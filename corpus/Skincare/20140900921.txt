Really love this cleanser for my sensitive skin. Still trying to figure out my skin type, but during this hot summer my skin has been pretty much of a combination. Gave it only 4 stars because there isnâ€™t any significant thing it does or changes. This is just a good cleanser that smells good and feels comfortable and refreshing on the skin. Great for makeup removal and not stripping at all! nan
