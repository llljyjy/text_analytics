This is terrible.  I like their other products, especially their cleanser, but this is terrible.  It leaves your skin chalky after applying.  It’s more like a straight out mineral sunscreen.   Not very moisturizing either.   I can see why someone with rosacea liked it - the chalkiness prob toned down redness.  I don’t recommend, even on sale. Yuck.   Chalky finish.
