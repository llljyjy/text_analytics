Overall, I will be using this in the future. My full review is on glow recipe because sephora has character limits. Trying this was a bit of a rollercoaster. The first time I used it I was not very impressed. I did not really notice anything as far as smoother and hydrated skin. In fact the morning after first use my skin felt tight and dry to me. I did not (and still donâ€™t) like the way it feels on my skin; it feels filmy and sticky, which is unpleasant to me. I still have some of the OG watermelon night mask and I always felt like my skin looked great the morning after using it, more hydrated and smooth than when I used this new night treatment, so I decided to do a literal side by side comparison. I did half my face with the OG and half with the new treatment. The smell of the OG is better, the new treatment smells kind of alcohol-y and not nice and watermelon-y, to me at least. What I discovered in the morning was what got me though. The half of my face with the new product was definitely more lifted and toned looking. Having it on only half of my face made me realize the difference. And that difference stayed for the whole day as far as I checked (because yes I kept looking to see if I could see a difference, duh, I wanna if the effect lasts more than just when I first woke up). The side with the OG of course had the gel piling but it did leave my skin more hydrated and bouncy. The firming and toning effect alone though is enough for me to want to keep using this product. If I am honest I kind of wish the OG was still around and that this was just released as its own, new serum and not as the successor, so to speak, for the watermelon glow sleeping mask. I do really like the firming and toning effect though, so I plan on using this in the future. Surprised by the results for firming and toning
