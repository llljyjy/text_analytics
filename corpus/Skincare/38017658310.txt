I received a sample size from Estée Lauder and Influenster in exchange for an honest review. It has a delicate rose scent and I like it. I put this after I wash my face. I may like the softness of my skin after I applied it but it wasn’t enough. As long as I don’t have any pimple pop up that means I can use this product. I would recommend this to anybody to give it a try. Just fine
