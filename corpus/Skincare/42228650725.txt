Although I only tried this for a week, it has left my skin feeling super soft to the touch.  It goes on super smooth and smells so nice. I found the sample packages a little difficult to get the serums out of. The darker coloured one seemed to come out a lot and the clear one only a very little bit. But once I got it out and applied it, I was super happy.  I would totally consider buying the whole bottle if it werenâ€™t so expensive. But maybe I will one day, who knows.@thisisbutterly @chickadvisor @clarinscanada @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor @clarinscanada Smells so nice!
