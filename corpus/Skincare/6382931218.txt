I’ve used this product 3x times , once per week and this is a game changer. I use it with the Caudalie Vinopure Serum and my skin has never been any clearer. It does tingle a little after cleaning it off. I’d put it 4 stars if it wasn’t that effective, but it definitely brightens and clears my skin. I do have a tendency to pick at my skin so that definitely slows down the healing process. New skincare favorite
