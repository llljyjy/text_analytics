I have really enjoyed this eye cream! I waffle on whether I actually need an eye cream separate from my face cream, as most of them don’t seem to do much beyond what my face cream does -- the Kiehl’s Avocado cream feels amazing and is hydrating, but is mostly just face cream, but heavier.But this! This eye cream feels amazing. It is not greasy or too heavy and absorbs easily. I’m not sure how it’s working as far as correcting my eye area, but my undereye skin is visibly plumper right after use. But that’s not the really important part - it makes me feel awake without feeling cold or stinging my eyes (even the time I got it basically in my eye)! I have an infant who could be better at sleeping, and this legitimately makes me feel more awake than I am. The placebo effect it provides -- since I have not actually gotten more sleep or had more caffeine -- is honestly changing my mood. This sounds like an exaggeration, but I genuinely feel more awake when I use it and that helps everything get better. I had a similar experience a while back with the Clinique Pep-Start eye cream, but that’s the only benefit I got from that one. This makes me feel awake and has benefits beyond basic moisture. Will buy again. nan
