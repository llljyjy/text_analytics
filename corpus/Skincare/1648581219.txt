I love this product. For my sensitive skin, I really have to be super careful as to what I put on it, otherwise I can end up looking as red as a lobster. This cream doesn’t irritate and moisture my skin well enough. The only issue I have with the mini size is that the container is a bit misleading. It looks like it is filled with cream but once you open it, you see the raise bottom and realize that there’s not much cream in there. nan
