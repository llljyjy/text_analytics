I actually really like this moisturizer especially for a hot summer day. It didn’t feel heavy on my skin but it is a little tacky when it dries down. That was a plus for me, it doubled as a primer for me. There isn’t any synthetic fragrances in their products so some people might be put off. That’s not an issue for me. The price point is great and super affordable. Used as a primer too
