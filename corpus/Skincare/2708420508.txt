not sponsored. bought on my own. this is a great hydrating mineral sunscreen. it leaves an undetectable look on the skin. It is not dewy nor matte it just melts onto my skin. my skin feels smooth after application.i have south asian medium to tan skintone and I mix clear and warm which is annoying and good at the same time as I can customize as my skin deepens throughout the summer. the warm shade is quite orange hence the warm name. its great for mixing with other sunscreens that are too light or mixing with the clear one. there is also a deeper shade for deeper skintones which is great because a lot of times the tint on other sunscreens still show up too ashy on me too. there are very few mineral sunscreens that work for darker skintones and this is one of them! i am so happy that this works for me nan
