Great product, terrible dispenser. The product reduced the allergic redness and puffiness under my eyes more than anything else ever has. But when you press down on pump to get product out, it stays down, and gives you very little product. So you have to pull it up, and often top comes off altogether. Then you have to start all over again. Once product does emerge it often shoots it half a foot away. It’s ridiculous. I hope they fix this! If the product was not so good, I’d return it. both great and terrible
