I chose this as a sample with a recent purchase and fell in love. It’s a very gentle formula that packs a big punch. My skin wasn’t irritated or red and I was able to use it daily (until I ran out...about 3 nights worth). It drew clogged pores to the surface without creating a breakout. Definitely recommend for acne prone skin, uneven textures, and fine lines. My skin felt renewed! Pore magic!
