I was gifted this product to review. My honest review after using for a couple weeks is that within the first night using the next morning my face looked brighter. As for the fine lines I didn’t see any difference I’m not certain if it has to do with age but definitely loved how my face looked and felt. I’ve been using YTTP for some years now and absolutely have loved every product of theirs and love being able to try out the samples. I use yttp face wash then apply their eye cream then apply the retinal followed with their moisturizer. clearer face
