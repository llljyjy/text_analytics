I got this sample from #freeproduct of #topbox. It was a very nice serum as it moisturized my face area. I used it on some wrinkles for a few days didnâ€™t see much difference as the sample had small amount, but the texture was good enough to leave the brightness into my skin. Would definitely recommend this serum for daily use. Nice serum for wrinkles
