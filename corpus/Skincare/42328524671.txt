Hydrates well and leaves my skin plump and feeling soft and smooth.  It has a nice and pleasant fragrance and a little of it goes a long way.  I’ve only been using it for a month and haven’t seen much if any improvement to wrinkles and fine lines but it states that best results will be obtained after eight weeks of use so we’ll keep using it and see what happens.  I know it’s not meant to treat acne but I’ve noticed fewer breakouts than I had in the months prior to using this.  That tells me that it doesn’t clog pores. I’m happy with it and will continue to use it and hopefully we’ll see better results. Hydrating
