I like that this is a 3 in one peel. It is a Deep Pore Cleanser,  Cell Renewal Exfoliant and  Skin Brightening Glow. I was expecting it to be a bit thicker for a mask and I don’t like that it starts to roll as soon as you start to apply it. On the plus side I leave it on for a few minutes and then rub it off and even use it on my lips. I love how soft my face and lips feel. It leaves my skin glowing after. It’s slowly reducing a dark spot I have, hopefully the spot will be gone by the time this tube finishes. Soft Glowing Skin
