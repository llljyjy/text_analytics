I thoroughly enjoy this mud mask! I have dry skin, but this is the only one that doesn’t leave my face feeling tight. I’ve used comparable mask and those exfoliating bits tend to scrap, where as this one buffs and then desolves. It also helps that this one is meant to be Marge in instead of spread on. I also notice a big difference around my chin area where I get ingrowns. The area is less inflamed and painful. My only gripe is that it may be less messy if it were in a tube or a spatula was included. Clearer skin and less pimples!
