I typically use micellar water as a pre cleanse for my makeup wearing and non makeup wearing days and it would still do the job BUT this pre cleanse is that GIRL. I use this on my no makeup days as well when I just want to remove the particles that land on your skin just on a everyday basis being outside. I love the feel of this product on my skin, how it goes on as an oil to loosen the makeup and dirt prior to using wet hands. It turns milky once you add water and you can feel your fresh breathable skin afterwards. I also follow up with the Dermalogica Special Cleansing Gel and It is a heaven sent combo for my combination/sensitive skin. Honestly What Iâ€™ve been missing !
