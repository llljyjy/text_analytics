The first thing I noticed was the light floral scent, it was quite pleasing. I like how the 2 products had to remain separated until right before application, i thought it was clever marketing! Left my eyes feeling very hydrated and more awake. Zero puffiness, but the dark circles remained after the short 7 day sample. I have quite severe dark circles, and maybe with continued use they would have diminished. I’m seriously on the PROWL for a product that actually WORKS! …on the PROWL…
