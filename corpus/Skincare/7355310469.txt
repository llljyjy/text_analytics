My usual Chanel moisturizer was finished and I needed something while I got my next bottle. I had this as a sampler and I tried it. I knew I would love it the minute I applied it. The texture of my skin changed immediately, it was glowy, soft and velvety and it did a wonder on my pores. It was perfect under my makeup and my skin was fabulous the whole day when I didn’t wear any makeup the following day. I bought a bottle immediately and it was just delivered. I’m in love! Liquid Magic!
