I am OBSESSSSSED with this lip mask. My lips are always chapped and nothing seems to help. I typically use just plain aquaphor and for a while liked the laneige lip sleeping mask. This is so much better. First of all, it smells amazing. Second, it doesnâ€™t leave any gross residue which I felt like other lip masks did. I used it before bed and woke up with moisturized lips and continue to use it a little throughout the day because it has such a nice glossy look. Love love love this, so happy to have it in time for winter. OBSESSED hydrating and smells amazing
