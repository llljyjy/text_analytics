I’m thoroughly impressed. I’m 33 and neglected to moisturize my neck until it was too late- I had some deep lines in my neck that I figured would be permanent. I decided to give this product a shot, figuring what’s the worst that could happen, and wow! I’ve been using it once a night for a little under a week, and the lines on my neck have definitely lightened up. nan
