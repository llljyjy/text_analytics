This is probably my new favorite sunscreen!  It comes out thick but when you apply it is so smooth and weightless.  I was super impressed.  I typically get a little color in my face even with sunscreen and this kept me protected 100%!   I am fair skin, red hair, freckles and have tried a lot of sunscreen.  The consistency of this is high end and the price point IMO is worth every penny! My New Favorite Sunscreen
