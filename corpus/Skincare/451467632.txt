I have the 100 point perk and I purchased the full size before I used it several days in a row. I loved the fact that it was a moisturizer with SPF45, since I live in Florida.    I knew I was very oily from it, but my skin is oily so what can you do?  But I woke up to 2 large pustules on my chin this morning, and that hasn’t happened to me probably since my teens and I’m 53.  This was the absolute only thing that could have caused it.  It was the only new product and the only thing I used on my chin.  So of course I will be returning it. Broke Me Out
