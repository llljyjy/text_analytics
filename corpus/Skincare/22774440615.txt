I received this product for free from Influenster and Olehenriksen in exchange for my honest review. I can honestly say that I love this moisturizer that it replaced the moisturizers I was using. This moisturizer is packed with peptides, ceramics, collagen, and hyaluronic acid. It’s so rich and creamy. It’s not heavy or leaves my face greasy. My skin feels soft, firm, plump, and hydrated. nan
