I was sent this product for a honest review from#trywithtopbox. When I am given a product to try I like to give it a good 2 to 3 weeks to see results.  It is a light serum,not heavy. I used it in the morning and evening like it suggested.  It goes on very smooth and does absorb easily. I do have fine lines, deep lines and some age spots as I am 60 years old. I was very excited to try this with the reviews I have read. Unfortunately I have not seen any positive results on my face. I have not seen any change with my age spots or the lines under and around my eyes or forehead.  I did notice my skin is softer but that was all. It did not seem to brighten my complexion either. That is not to say it doesn’t work or have better results with someone else. For the price, I just don’t think  it is worth it.  Unfortunately it just didn’t work for me#freeproduct. Didn't work for me
