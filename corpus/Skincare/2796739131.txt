Awesome AM moisturizer! Heard that it was a dupe for another more expensive water cream and I would definitely say it matches up! I use under my makeup and itâ€™s perfect for glowy but not oily looking skin! Read other reviews about a bad smell and it has no smell to me. I have repurchased several times and will continue to do so. nan
