I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I was so excited to try it because I’m always looking for new sunscreens to try. I find this to be a very good sunscreen for everyday use. It isn’t greasy or too thick in consistency. It is an oil free formula. It doesn’t burn my eyes when I use it and it doesn’t leave a white cast. I’m very happy with the formula overall and I will definitely be repurchasing. nan
