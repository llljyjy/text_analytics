Iâ€™m very impressed and pleased with this cleanser. It lathers up very well and that is something that is a positive for me. A little extra work to rinse your face which is no big deal for me, and my skin feels so clean much cleaner than my previous cleanser. I love the cooling effect I love the gel texture and I will be sticking with this cleanser Impressive
