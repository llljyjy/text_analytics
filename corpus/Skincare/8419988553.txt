If you want a gentle exfoliate this is definitely a good choice. The scent is a very light orange. The little exfoliating grains are very soft and don’t feel like they are scratching my face at all. I also love the packaging. The push to open lid makes it easy to use, and it hasn’t caused any breakouts. I’m really liking it. nan
