The first thing I like about this particular moisturizer is the fact that the scent is not overpowering. If I am going to put moisturizer on my face I donâ€™t want to be breathing in a heavy scent all day.  You get the faintest smell of mint like a spa but just super faint which is really nice. I particularly liked it around my eyes and my cheeks it gave me a nice little glow. The moisturizer is not too thick not too thin it goes on super smooth would definitely recommend it.
