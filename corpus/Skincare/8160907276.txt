Love. This cream is luxurious and thick and rich. It makes my face feel hydrated and moisturized. I’ve never used Lancôme products before but have tried other high end face creams. This has been my favorite. I love the smell. The texture. A little goes a long way so it will last me a long time. I have dry skin. Once I apply my face makeup you can usually spot dry patches on my face. But not since I have been using this cream at night. My skin has been soft and moisturized. It does say that it is a day/night cream. I personally wouldn’t use it during the day as I feel it would be too much under my makeup. But at night I love it. I received this product to try as a promotion. Love. Would recommend!!
