This is one of the more watery oils I have used and I really liked that! This oil isn’t overly greasy so although I usually use oils at night, I could actually see myself using this in the day time. It doesn’t look or feel greasy. It has these tiny pearls that pop when you apply it. The one thing I didn’t like is the scent. I’m okay with scented products but this one was strong and perfume like.I received this product free of charge in exchange for my honest opinion. Fast Absorbing Facial Oil
