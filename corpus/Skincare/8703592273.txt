Great when not expired. I purchased this peel mask 10 months ago. I checked for expiration date, it had none, so I assumed it will be okay to store for a while. I was wrong. When I opened it today, I found out that it turned brown and has an unpleasant smell. Beauty products should have an expiration date stated on the packaging or be good to use for at least a year since purchase date. I called Sephora support, and they told me they canâ€™t help me. I will not be buying anything from Sephora ever again. Expired product, Sephora wouldn't exchange.
