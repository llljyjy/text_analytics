I love how luxurious face serums can be and Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum did not disappoint.  The only downside was a sample size too small to determine any long-term benefits - hence the four stars.  I used it as part of my evening skincare ritual and loved its light silky texture - my skin was craving this.  The appearance of my skin was improving along with a reduction in my fine lines.  I will be adding this to my skincare toolkit for sure!  #freeproduct Luxurious Serum!
