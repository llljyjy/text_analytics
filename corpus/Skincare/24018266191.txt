Not usually one to write reviews, but after purchasing this moisturizer for the 4th time it is definitely needed. I honestly owe my clear skin to this moisturizer. Whenever I stop using it, I begin to break out. My skin loves this stuff. However, with every single one of my bottles, the pump stops working towards the end of its life. Do wish this didn’t happen because there’s always a huge amount of product still left in the bottle. Minor inconvenience but it won’t stop me from repurchasing!! Clear skin in a bottle!
