I have tried a lot of different cleansers - some of them pretty expensive ones like tatcha. I love this cleanser because it is so gentle and gets the cleansing job done without ruining barrier. Word of warning - I have found a pump of this product is way too much for me and enough to be drying. A half pump is plenty to get the job done. Pricey but best cleanser Iâ€™ve ever tried
