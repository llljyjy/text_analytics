I received this product for free from Influenster & the brand in exchange for my honest review.This was my first retinol eye cream. My initial reaction to packaging was pretty! but wow such a small amount. The fact that container can be “refilled“ is nice but at a $6 discount is more of a gimmick than anything else. Once applied it does have a nice cool refreshing feel and the fragrance is very light. I used it nightly for over one month.  I did try it one morning also but once I got to work I still had shiny eye orbits so I tried to wipe it away/in and didn’t do that again.Which brings me to its effectiveness. Other than initial 30+ min “shine“ once applied I did not notice any lightening effects. Nor did I notice any help with baggy/puffiness or fine lines. The box has claims to improvements “after 5 weeks“ as tested by a whopping 30 people but I have not noticed anything and would not recommend. nan
