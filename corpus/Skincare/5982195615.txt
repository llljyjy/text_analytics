This is one of the best moisturizers I have used. I do have combo skin and it can be a little thick especially if it’s quite hot and humid but I normally use it at night and there is no issue! Love that they are cruelty free and vegan and that they recycle as well. It’s a little more expensive than my other moisturizers but I think it’s worth it because it lasts a while. Also to mention it is a pump so it gives you a good amount and it has a vacuum on the bottom to push the product out and when I finished my first bottle I broke it open to finish it and there was a sliver of product at the top! Great design, great moisturizer and great company! Best Moisturizer
