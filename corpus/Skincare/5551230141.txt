I really love this product, I’ve been using it nightly and it’s really helped with the appearance of my pores on my nose and the area around. It also makes my skin more even toned since I’m very fair with rosey cheeks. My face is a smidge greasy in the morning but it could just be because I used too much of the product. Once you wash your face it looks refreshed, it really sets your skin up for the day. Love this!
