I really wanted to love this product because I love all my other Summer Friday’s products (gel moisturizer, eye cream, jetlag face mask), but I’ve tried using this product on numerous occasions and every single time, my skin breaks out with little bumps everywhere. I don’t have sensitive skin nor do I have acne prone skin. I’ve tried not using the product for 2-3 weeks at a time and trying it again in hopes that this wasn’t what was causing the break outs, but unfortunately it was. BREAKOUTS LIKE CRAZY
