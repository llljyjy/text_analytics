I am usually disappointed by all lip balms. The only thing that seems to soften and truly hydrate my mega dry & chapped lips is a cheap generic petroleum jelly, even the Laneige lip mask I find mediocre. But this Farmacy beeswax balm is amazing!! I love the effect on my lips even after the product/stickiness is “gone” it leaves my lips so soft. So glad I mindlessly grabbed this one while waiting my turn to pay at the store. Love!!
