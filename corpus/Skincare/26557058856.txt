I received this product by being gifted by Dermalogica sampling in exchange for my honest opinion.   This a product that is very unique a  microfoliant that turns a powder into a frothy paste.  My skin loved this. The paste does become a little dry and it sort of takes some time to figure out how to get the portions correct. However it is worth it my skin has a beautiful glow or brighten and it is very smooth. This product is perfect for those day my I feel my skin is dry and dull looking. A Unique Experience
