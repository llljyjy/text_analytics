This triple threat does the trick!  Every other vitamin-c serum I have used made skin greasy looking and caused my make up to look even worse.  The combination of hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, & vitamin-C helped even out my complexion and I noticed more hydrated skin; even as the temperature dropped!  I would recommend this my family and friends! nan
