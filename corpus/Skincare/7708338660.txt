Recommended in store to help glow from the inside out and tackle some new texture that’s been popping up. After less than a week it’s already made such a difference! It smells naturally lovely and hasn’t overwhelmed my often sensitive to fragrance skin. Would definitely recommend if you’re looking for a vitamin c! nan
