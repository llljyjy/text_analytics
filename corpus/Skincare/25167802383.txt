It’s only been a week but I’m in love with this cold cream cleanser. I wear makeup almostevery day so this has become a must in my cleanser routine. The formula smells good and leaves my face smooth, fresh, and hydrated. also exfoliating with those jojoba beads feels so luxurious and divine.Plus the packagingis so beautiful!I would definitely recommend this to my family in friends. The Best Luxurious Cold Cream Cleanser!!
