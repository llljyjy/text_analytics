A good moisturizer and actually left my skin feeling soft and moisturized BUT today, I opened it up to try and get more product out and was so upset to see not even a fraction of the promised and advertised 50ml. The clear plastic container was filled with less than even a shots worth of product, which is most definitely not worth $14. The tiny little cup is the only part containing the moisturizer which is so disappointing. They even make the container FEEL heavier so you think there is more product inside. I’m super upset by this because I was really starting to enjoy this moisturizer, but there is no shot I’ll be paying $12-$14 for not even a sample size :( has anyone else noticed this? Not actually 50ml…not worth the money
