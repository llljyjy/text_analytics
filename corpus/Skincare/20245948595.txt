This night cream by Tula feels very hydrating. It has a strong, floral scent which I find pleasing. It is also uniquely packaged and the cream comes out of a pumper, which is super convenient and hygienic. It is a very heavy night cream so a little goes a long way. Iâ€™ve been having dry skin lately and I find using this cream at night before sleeping has helped me wake up with less dry/flaky skin. I received this product for free from Influenster and Tula in exchange for my honest review. Very hydrating, good for dry skin!
