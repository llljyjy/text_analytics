When I tried a sample of this the patches were so saturated in the serum and they were amazing. However after purchasing the full size, I realized the tub initially arrives a bit dry, keeping in mind eye patches do not get used every single day, by the 3rd time I got to use them they were too dry. They need to fix this problem 75 dollars is too much to pay for a tub that comes dried up. Meanwhile there are others on the market for less than half the price and stay saturated for more than 3 months like pixi. SERUM AMOUNT NEEDS TO GET FIXED ASAP
