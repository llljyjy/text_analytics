This is a review for the Vitamin C mask...I am a huge fan of this mask! First, it is delicate so follow the instructions and donâ€™t tug on it-- just slide it around to move. Do not talk or chew while wearing it, check on it to ensure it is where you prefer it. Great product IMO very moisturizing and I will be buying more in the near future (think NOW lol). A New Customer
