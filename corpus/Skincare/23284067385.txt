It was love from the first time I tried it. Its so smooth and absorbs into the skin quickly, leaving face hydrated and glowing. My skin appears plumper after every use. The fragrance is not overpowering. I use it at night after serum and it works well with all my products as well as makeup. Even my acne prone skin loves it. #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox Lightweight Moisturizer
