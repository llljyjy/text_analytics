Very nice packaging. There is a slight fragrance but it is not too much or noticeable after application. I enjoyed the fragrance myself. The cream is a very typical feeling to what one expects from an eye cream. The pump disperses just the right amount. The cream soaks into the skin very easily and plumps the dry skin. I saw results while using and was very happy with the results. nan
