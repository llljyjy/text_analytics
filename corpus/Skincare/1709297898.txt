This is kind of on the thicker end of the moisturizing spectrum but luckily it is not gloopy or sticky but melts into skin well. It has a little more fragrance than I’d like but I’m sensitive to that. My skin did look firmer and was well moisturized after using it for a week. I got this item complimentary so I only had enough to try it short term. I can’t speak to its anti-wrinkle effect but it’s a solid moisturizer and what I’d expect from this brand. I’ll be buying some for my mother for Christmas. Solid moisturizer
