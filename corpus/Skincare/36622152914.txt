I bought the 38 and 41 prior to a beach trip to share with my mom. We loved the ease and lightness these sunscreens offered. Tried the new 39 and it is BY FAR my favorite scent! So lovely and delicate and just fresh! Love knowing that I can pull this out of my back pocket and be protected. Whether it’s a refresh or a way to finish my routine. It can be a little oily at times, but I have naturally oily skin and haven’t noticed a dramatic increase when using it. nan
