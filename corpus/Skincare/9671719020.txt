I’ve been using this for a while now and I really like it! I got it because I read about niacinamide being helpful for discolouration/dark spots caused by acne and I think it has slowly helped to lighten them and also help prevent new discolouration from any new acne. I also think it has helped control my acne. I have always had very difficult acne to control but I think this has helped to manage them and made any breakouts I do get not as big or intense. You have to commit to using it for a while, it won’t be an overnight solution to discolouration. Paired with wearing facial SPF every day my discolouration has faded. I wouldn’t say its the greatest at helping reduce oilyness but it is good for acne and discolouration. nan
