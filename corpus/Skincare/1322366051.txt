The texture of this eye cream is so refreshing. It glides on so smoothly without feeling greasy or too heavy, but is adequately hydrating. My concealer applies so much more nicely over my under eye area after applying the eye cream. I do notice my under eye area looks smoother and brighter after applying too, probably from the hydration. Although this was given to me to try for free as a sample from Influenster, I would absolutely purchase the full size. There is another brand of eye cream (starts with an L) in a little black jar that has a gel cream texture that I also love, but the Est√©e Lauder one has a richer feel to it which I prefer. I really enjoy this eye cream!
