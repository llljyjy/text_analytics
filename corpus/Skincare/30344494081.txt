I have dry skin to the extent that in winters I would apply a moisturizer and it is absorbed in no time. I have been trying this for the last 1 month now and I can aver it is one of the best no nonsense smell best moisturizer I have ever used. Itâ€™s consistency is kind of similar to vasline and is absorbed in skin pretty good. I can see that when I get up in the morning my skin is still fresh and moist... Just as I like. Excellent moisturizer & skin repair
