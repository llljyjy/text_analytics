I have oily skin so I am extra cautious about the Tara Haper moisturizer. This one is amazing. First the packaging is amazing. It’s set up to where you don’t have to put your hands in the jar, yet you push it down and product comes up on the case that’s covering the moisturizer. So less germs and a great sustainable packaging. It feels so smooth on my skin and gives me a great glow. It works great under my sunscreen and makeup. I was gifted by Tata Harper skincare from Tara Harper for my honest review. nan
