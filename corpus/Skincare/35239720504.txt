This product works pretty good, I have combination skin and it dried out my skin a little bit but with a good moisturizer I was good to go. A little bit goes a long way so I know this will last me some months. It works great at taking off makeup too. I deal with acne on a regular basis and I havenâ€™t had a new pimple since using it. Great Face Wash
