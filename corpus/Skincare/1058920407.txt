I was fortunate enough to receive a sample size of this product from Estée Lauder and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Using twice a day as directed, the sample was enough to last for one week. Therefore I cannot speak to any long term benefits of this product. This review is based solely on my experience after one week of use.Even though I am almost 40, I still get occasional acne and have extremely oily skin. (The positive of that is I have no wrinkles or fine lines.) This cream is much richer in texture than what I am accustomed to using. It has a lot of top quality moisturizing ingredients, but ultimately was just too moisturizing for my skin type. My skin was more oily than normal, which I didn’t know was even possible. Around day 5 I also noticed tons of tiny bumps forming all over. If I hadn’t used up my sample and continued to use the product it might have lead to a major breakout problem. This would be a better product for those with a normal or combo skin type. I’m not sure if it is rich enough for anyone with dry skin.The formula is unique in that it is a gel, but when applied feels very rich and more like a thick cream. I found it easier to spread this product if my skin was damp, so I applied after using a facial mist. I needed to use a lot less product this way and it absorbed into my skin more effectively. It has a very light scent, kind of like powdery sunscreen. It was very pleasant and not detectable while wearing. I did notice my skin felt slightly sticky while using this.The only positive difference I noticed while wearing this product was a very nice glow to my skin. It leaves just enough sheen to look healthy and radiant, without looking greasy. I actually really liked the way my skin looked while using this product (before the excess oil and bumps occurred, of course).Overall this is a nice quality basic moisturizer that I would recommend to anyone without oily skin. It is definitely worth a try! Not Ideal For Oily Skin
