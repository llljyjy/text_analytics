A quick background on my skin, I’m 41, some fine lines, some melasma and hyperpigmentation and texture due to sun damage, post pregnancy and other factors that attribute to aging. I have combo skin and have some dry patches but during testing this product out, I’m experiencing more dullness than dryness.  Currently my skin is between normal to oily due to summer. THE REVIEW: I started testing this about 8 (6/15) days ago and I’m thoroughly impressed! It’s fragrance free, and it doesn’t sting at all even with daily use.  As you can see from the photos, the texture and large brown sun spots along with hyperpigmentation has been significantly reduced by day 8 (6/23). Overall results, my skin is less dull, brighter and more even toned. I also feel like with these improvements, make up looks better on my skin.  The product hits all its claims: exfoliating, resurfacing, clears pores and locks moisture. It definitely exfoliated my skin in a very gentle manner, my pores are still there, but they look tighter.  Every morning, when I wake up, I do feel that my skin is softer and it’s such a nice starting point for makeup application (after proper skin prep).My holy grails for this type of product is usually from Pipette or Kate Sommerville but they can be aggressive for sensitive skin so you kind of have to dial back usage to 1 to 2x’s a week therefore, it’s harder to see fast results.  I’m really excited to see how this product performs further after I finish the bottle. Although I received this for the purpose of testing, it may replace one of my go-to’s since it’s garnering faster results. She HUSTLES for sure!
