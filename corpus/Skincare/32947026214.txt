Sensitive skin folks, look no further. My skin reacts to virtually everything (even so called “hypoallergenic“ brands), but with this cream I HAD ZERO ALLERGIC REACTIONS. No acne breakouts too!Noticed my face is fresher, glowy, and very moisturized the next day. FYI it’s also a very rich and thick cream (my boyfriend always teases me that I’m so shiny after putting this). But since it’s a night cream, it’s fine. Seriously my new forever night cream. nan
