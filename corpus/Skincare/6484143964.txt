This is my first time purchasing a neck/decolletage cream and I might be forever spoiled! While I have only just started using it I have found it is truly a luxurious and beautiful cream. The experience alone makes me look forward to my morning and night skin care ritual! Everything Tatcha does comes with a truly pleasurable experience when applying but this so far is my favorite. While it’s a bit pricey the amount needed will allow for use for several months. Its worth it to me too as it makes me feel beautiful just applying. I am excited to see what results I will get with this cream! 33y/o F with combo to dry skin in case others are wondering! I bought this more for prevention than anything else. I do have some lines on my neck and I’m curious to see if they will fade with this. All in all the review is for the experience alone! Its magnificent. One of the most beautiful creams I've ever used
