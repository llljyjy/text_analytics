Let me just preface this by saying that I love the individually packaged version of these. They are my go-to after flights and they leave my skin so plump and hydrated. Since I was doing more traveling than usual this summer, I decided to buy the bigger pack to be more eco friendly, but these are such a disappointment. I have to strategically cut them to make them lay flat around my eyes and nose. Itâ€™s really frustrating because you would expect them to be identical just with less packaging. Two stars because the serum on them really is amazing. Not the Same :/
