I have oily skin almost dull, this exfoliate has improved my skin, and I have really super sensitive skin. Itâ€™s a mild exfoliate, it adds brightness. Smells so great and makes skin feels awesome, it removes makeup as well.The only downside it gets clumpy and hard to come out if left in a humid area. This product was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. Awesome exfoliater
