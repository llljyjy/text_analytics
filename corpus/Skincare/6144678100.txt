I never write reviews, but this stuff is seriously holy grail. I searched for HOURS for an ultra-hydrating, clean moisturizer that worked for sensitive, dry, very acne-prone skin. I use tretinoin, I live in a super dry environment, and I for sure could be drinking more water... so I need something that puts in work. In a WEEK this stuff has changed my skin like nothing else I have ever used. If I could buy 10 for safekeeping I would. Reading these other reviews, I’d say a) who cares how it smells if it works this well and b) the reason it isn’t that consistency everyone wants is it’s bare minimum, good ingredients. I still think it’s super usable. If you have any issues like me BUY THIS STUFF. Holy Grail
