First off I want to talk about my skin type. I used to suffer from adult acne which left my some nasty acne scars. I since been working on getting rid of them and have been pretty successful but of course it takes time. You can see in my video I still have scars. I do have some texture and my skin type is kind of a mix of combo/normal, which I know is weird but I only get oily on my t-zone after a very long day otherwise I’m usually normal if I put moisturizer and dry rarely. So when I got the Dior serum to try out, I was pretty excited because it’s. Dior LOL. On the card they sent, it claims the serum will give hydrating, plumping and firmness and reduced wrinkles to the face in 4 hours (based on a trail where 55% experienced this). After a week skin appears firmer with radiance and in 30 days, reduced look of unevenness and loss of elasticity. I’ve used this serum for about 3 weeks now and I haven’t seen any of those claims honestly. The serum itself is pleasant. It has a nice luxurious feel and smells like perfume but not over powering in my opinion. I don’t have wrinkles but I do have unevenness in color and some texture and I was focusing on any hyperpigmentation on my skin. My skin never felt firmer or radiant or plump. When it comes to hydration, I didn’t feel hydrated like how a nice moisturizer would feel but it didn’t make me feel dry either, it just felt like a serum on your face. Maybe I wasn’t the right candidate but I would expect atleast some radiance. I used Peter Thomas Roth a Vit C serum and I LOVE that serum and won’t change it unless I find something better. For me, this Dior serum didn’t do much for my skin concerns. I’ll continue to use to see if I see a change after the bottle is finished. My review for the Dior Capture Totale Serum
