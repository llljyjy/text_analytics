This was my first purchase from Glow Recipe and I was super excited to try their products, but unfortunately was massively let down by this cleanser. It broke me out in most areas of my face, especially along the jaw and hairline, but Ikept using it hoping my skin was just adjusting and I would eventually love it. 4 months of using it and I finally gave up, I hadnâ€™t struggled with breakouts in 2 years before using this cleanser so it was a big let down. A week back on my go-to cleanser (Youth To The People!) and my skin is already clearing up. Not impressed
