Such a smart idea to have SPF included in this bioretinol serum! This product includes bakuchiol and a tinted mineral SPF. It has a milky serum consistency that spreads and absorbs really well, especially for a mineral sunscreen. There is just a slight tint. I’m not sure that I’d depend on this as my sole SPF because of how thinly it spreads but it’s nice as an extra layer of protection. nan
