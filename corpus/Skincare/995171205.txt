There’s a reason this product is always among the top of anti-aging beauty products.  I have very dry skin that has fine lines, and often isn’t the same tone throughout.  I’m also starting to get a little saggy.  People asked me what I was doing because after awhile my skin was looking so much more youthful, toned and plump.  It’s great texture is easy to apply, absorbs fast so you can apply makeup afterwards without pilling.  And even though it dries fast it still provides a ton of moisture.  My skin tone looked more even, and my fine lines looked smaller and made me look more youthful.  But no wonder my skin looked so improved because it’s power-packed with the best moisturizers and nutrients.  Even has ceramides which can restore your moisture barrier.  I liked that it also didn’t cause any acne breakouts.   I would recommend this to everyone, but especially those with dry skin. You will get skin confidence
