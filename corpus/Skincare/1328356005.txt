This is probably the strongest niacinamide treatment I have ever used, but it did not irritate me as I have been using niacinamide in higher concentrations for a while now, 10% and higher. If you are a total beginner to niacinamide, I would definitely start with a lower concentration and sort of work your way up, or mix this one into your moisturizer or with another serum Until you get used to it, because niacinamide can cause some people to flush. It’s not harmful but it can feel strange. Now on to the review. This is an instantly smoothing, potent treatment. It’s one of the best serums I’ve used of its type, because while it is concentrated, it is also Easily absorbed and does not leave a sticky finish. I love that it contains Soothing Panthenol and licorice extract, and vitamin C for extra brightening power. I have not used this long enough to see dark spots fading, because that takes months. But in the short term, it definitely smooth texture and minimizes the appearance of pores. In fact, I put this directly on my tea zone before I do my make up, under my primer, and my makeup has never looked so good. Excellent smoothing serum, potent and effective
