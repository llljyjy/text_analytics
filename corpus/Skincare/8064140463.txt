As someone who as always dealt with very oily skin and huge pores especially around my T zone, i love this product. it is lightweight and a little goes along way. it isnâ€™t sticky and absorbs into my skin right away. I have been using for almost a month now and I have skipped maybe two days and my face just gets extremely oily without using it. this is definitely a staple in my skin care. If you have oily skin!!!
