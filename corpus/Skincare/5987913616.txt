This lip balm is incredible!! I had very dry lips this winter and quickly realized Burt’s Bees chapstick was making my lips even drier. This does the opposite - after sliding this on, my lips feel moist for hours, and my lips are no longer peeling. I love the consistency - it’s thick, but not sticky, and goes on clear. Must buy
