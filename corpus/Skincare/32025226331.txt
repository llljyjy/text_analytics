I have been using retinols for years but this is the strongest I’ve ever used. I was applying it nightly every other night which was surprisingly too much. I had to stop using it for awhile and start back again slowly. It works but just be aware you’ll need to take it slowly at first. For those who don’t notice it working, maybe they are layering this on top of something else? This works! Ease into this.
