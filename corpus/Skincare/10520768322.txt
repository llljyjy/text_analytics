The Resurfacing Peel Pads are great! Theyâ€™re thin and easy to use. I used one pad and it was enough for both of my legs. These are great because my skin is dry in the winter and chemically exfoliating the dead skin off one way to make your skin look less dry. I love that there are 60 pads in one jar and I anticipate using them once per week or more! LOVE!
