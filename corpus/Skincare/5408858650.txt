I don’t like this product. When i apply it I get a slight burning sensation. I have dry skin and found that this product alone is not hydrating/moisturizing. I see a lot of dry patches the next morning. It’s ok, when i use it in combination with an oil. But overall, it’s not for me. Not Good For Very Dry Skin
