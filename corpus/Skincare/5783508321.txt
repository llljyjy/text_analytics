I received a tiny bottle from Estée Lauder to review this treatment lotion (see photo for size reference). First of all, this is some expensive water, it is not a lotion at all. I’ve tried quite a few essence treatment waters like SK-II and Tatcha The Essence and for the price the results are almost non-existent. It’s a nice toner, but for the price, it won’t chance your life. I looked at the Estée Lauder website and the cheapest one is $70 for 3.4 oz. I would say the scent was mild and pleasant, which was surprising since I find Estée Lauder skincare super fragranced. Maybe this works in undetectable ways by protecting your skin’s moisture barrier and reducing redness, but I can’t say I felt a huge difference. If you like having a 10 step skin care routine and you want to splurge maybe I would too, but for the money I would rather get a serum or a moisturizer. Nice but not for that price!
