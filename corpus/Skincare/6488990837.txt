Fabulous moisturizer. It’s lightweight but still very hydrating and definitely plumps the skin. You will look very dewy & glowy after applying. It’s a little pricey for the amount of product but definitely does it’s job. I’ve tried all of the Olehenriksen moisturizers and you really can’t go wrong with any of them. I’d buy again. Exactly as advertised
