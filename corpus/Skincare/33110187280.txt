I was lucky to have been chosen from Topbox Circle to try this #freeproduct. I have super dry and sensitive skin and this feels wonderful. It has a light scent  but it fades quickly. It is very luxurious and feels soothing - it sinks into your skin pretty quickly. This white cream is thick and has a somewhat waxy finish which works well with my dry skin. It works even better when you use this with the cream toner. My skin just drank this up and it feels so smooth and supple now. Would buy!
