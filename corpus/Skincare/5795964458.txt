I tried Clarins Double Serum for about a week and noticed a smoother skin and better hydration. I noticed the serum was not quickly absorbed by my skin after application if I was using it on it’s own so I usually used a second type of lotion on top of it, and it makes a great base/primer. The smell was very light so I appreciated that, I don’t like harsh fragrances on my face. Great product. nan
