I loved the silky texture of this neck cream. I also liked that I could squeeze out the appropriate amount and not get my fingers into the man supply. I used this all over my neck and decollete and found that my skin was definitely firmer and more supple. I gave it three stars because I felt the scent was way too strong and I am sesitive to scent. Enjoyed this product
