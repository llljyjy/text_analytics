Works so well under makeup and doesn’t make my eyes sting, obviously for the price this is like my occasion makeup base go to, literally FLAWLESS but if u are more fair toned it does leave a bit of a tint so I can see why people who don’t wear makeup don’t like this but the mattifying effect is not drying but if u have dry skin this may not be the best REBUY ❤️❤️❤️
