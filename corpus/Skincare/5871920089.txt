I think I’ve finally found my holy grail primer! For whatever reason it’s always hard for me to find a primer I like or get my foundation to lay nicely on my dry skin. This product kind of solved all my issues at once. So far I’ve used it under the new Kosas Revealer Foundation & also with the Tower 28 SunnyDays; and it looked amazing with both! It really gives a nice bouncy moisturized dewy glow, primes so well & seems to extend the wear of my makeup. Virtually no scent. Best clean silicone-free primer ever! =D This is THE ONE!
