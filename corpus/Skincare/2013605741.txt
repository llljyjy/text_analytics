This is a nice moisturizer with a light, almost whipped texture. It feels really good on my skin and sits well under the stick concealer I normally use. It doesn’t leave any kind of sticky residue and my skin feels supple and hydrated for hours after using. I would call its scent cucumber-like and it’s a little strong but fades after about an hour or two. Lightweight moisturizer
