I really like this stuff. It’s very similar to the day cream. It even smells the same. They both have a faint sunscreen smell. I really like it. My face definitely feels super soft in the morning. I’ve been using this one at night and the day cream in the am for a few weeks now. It’s it had definitely made my cheeks baby soft. It feels weird when I’m washing my face. I haven’t had a product make ny skin feel that way. You also get a ton of product for the price. So the price tag is totally worth it! Good price
