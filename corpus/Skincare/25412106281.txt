The title speaks for itself. This is by far, the BEST facial cleansing bar ever!  Not to mention itâ€™s the best product at removing makeup. Way better than foaming cleansers or other types of cleansers that commit to removing all makeup. This one does it - and it also shows up everything else that you once thought did a pretty decent job. Lasts approximately 3 months when used by two gals (mother and daughter) at the end of the day, every day. Fab find. On 2nd bar now and will order more over time. Not switching. Ever. Worth Every Penny
