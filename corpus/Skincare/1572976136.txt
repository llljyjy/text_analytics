If I could only buy one skincare product, this would be it! I always thought I had oily/combination skin and feared moisturizer, except a tiny bit under makeup. Little did I know, I was over-drying and under-moisturizing and ruining my skin. Between this and hyaluronic acid, my skin has never looked or felt better. What I thought was awful hormonal acne or dermatitis from wearing masks for 12+ hours/day is GONE after a few weeks of using this. A little goes a long way, it is light and not greasy, has a nice texture, and absorbs well into the skin. Love love love love. Best skincare product Iâ€™ve bought in years!
