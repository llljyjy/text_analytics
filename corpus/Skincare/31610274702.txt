I use this as my daytime moisturizer and it is my absolute favorite. The scent is clean and fresh and the texture applies like a gel but then dries to lock in the moisture. I use all products from Farmacy except toner and so far I really like the results. My eczema has reduced greatly and skin is looking clearer day by day. Highly recommend this brand! Best for sensitive skin
