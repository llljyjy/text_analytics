More like 3.5! I have oily/combo skin that I’ve been able to control. I got this bc of the peptides. It’s make my skin feel tight but I realized it’s really good at replaced any lost elasticity. But not super great for moisturizing. I would keep this on rotation but this would work better using 2-4x per week alternating with other moisturizers (probably works best at night, but I also use it under sunscreen during the day at it helps keep me matte). nan
