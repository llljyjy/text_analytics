Have been using this product in my evenjng bedtime routine for the past 11 days. It definitely is hydrating and does not sit on top of your skin but I have seen little results in improvement to the circles under my eyes (hence the 4 stars). A little product goes a long way, I have enough product to last me another 9 to 10 days in the sample packs I received from #topbox for my honest review. If you are looking for a eyecream that hydrates and are open to trying something new then I would say give this one a try for the texture alone. Hoping I see more of a difference in the days to come!#freeproduct #topbox Great hydration...too soon to tell
