I’m so happy that I received the Water Lock Moisturizer complimentary from Tata Harper for my honest review. My skin is combination to oily types and I love the fact that cream which contains skin smoothing peptides didn’t make my skin oily. It’s light weight and glides well and absorbs very well too, leaving my skin super smooth and very well hydrated. I love the packaging and that it comes with a sustainable refill makes it my more favorite! Light Weight Gel/Creamy Moisturizer
