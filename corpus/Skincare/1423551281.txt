This treatment is so powerful that I should have mentally expected it to work. Because it did! I had this acne under skin bump that I just had a hard time with - even with a pimple patch. I added a dap of this treatment and overnight it was flat and less red. I continue the treatment for an extra day or two depending on the severity just to keep that area clean and acne at bay. It’s a pricey one but you don’t need a lot. nan
