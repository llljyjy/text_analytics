Recently I’ve become more interested in finding cleaner, more natural skincare to add to my daily routine. When I came across this Sephora Clean Skin Gel, I absolutely had to try it! This gel has proven to be one of my new favorite cleaners, as it is lightweight, doesn’t foam excessively when massaged into my skin, and it doesn’t have an obnoxious smell like many other cleansers have. This vegan gel cleanser leaves my skin feeling cleaner, fresher, more. hydrated, and best of all, it doesn’t make me break out or irritate my skin afterwards! For someone with sensitive skin, I highly highly recommend this product!! One of the Best Gel Cleansers out there!!
