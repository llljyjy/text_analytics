I very much enjoy this retinoid and think itâ€™s a great deal for the price. I feel like it has really helped my acne but full disclosure, like other retinoids, this definitely caused me to break out for about 2 weeks before my skin cleared. Sometimes it gets worse before it gets better? If I could change one thing about this formula, it would be to make it slightly less sticky. Other than that, good product overall. nan
