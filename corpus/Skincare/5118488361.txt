I tried out a small sample that I received complimentary from Influenster and it lasted almost 3 weeks. I’m sure a full size bottle would go a long way and be worth the splurge. I loved the thick consistency it’s not too watery which makes it easy to apply. The product has a nice clean/floral scent which I liked. I was confused about what this product was because there’s not really any instructions on the bottle, no indication on how to apply or how to tie this into your skin care.i looked it up and with the first try I noticed a difference in my skin’s hydration it wasn’t stiff like it usually is. I have dry combination skin and even though I tend be oily in some areas this didn’t make me oily, it just makes you look hydrated, don’t expect to look matte. It definitely made a difference in my dry areas I would deff recommend if you have dry skin! Great for dry skin
