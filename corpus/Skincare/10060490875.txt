I was hesitant but desperate for better results when I bought this. I have the classic jade roller from Mount Lai and I’ve had other brands and they allllll break. I’ve read tons of reviews about the ‘stone’ breaking but mine all come apart where the metal holds the roller and let me tell you…it’s a painful experience. They are all so pricey too so I was grateful that this one paid off!! Get it now. I have absolutely horrible allergies and puffy eyes every morning. I put a tiny bit of moisturizing oil on my face and as soon as this amazing cold (refrigerated) tool touches my face I immediately feel relief and my lymph decongesting. Best De-Puffing Tool out there
