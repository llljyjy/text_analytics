It does not pill! Initially when it goes on the skin it looks like it’s pilling, but it’s not. You just have to continue rubbing it in. I tested this on freshly washed skin with no other skincare products then put my Kosas foundation and concealer on and it was perfect. I have very oily, acne prone skin and this kept my makeup on all day, through a workout and nap. Give it a go and if you hate it, return it- But great for oily skin! IT DOESN’T PILL!
