I received a sample in exchange for an honest review.  These toner pads are super easy to use and they smell amazing...like a spa!  I have sensitive, oily skin and I find that my skin feels tighter after using them, but I haven’t noticed a huge difference in redness.  The pads are a little thin, so it’s sometimes hard to pull out just one. I am happy that they are free from a lot of harmful chemicals also! nan
