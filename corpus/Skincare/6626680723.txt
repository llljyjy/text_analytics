I had been eying this night cream for awhile after I started including a retinol in my night time routine. I use Tatcha’s dewy skin cream and even if I switch off I always go back. I have been using this cream on and off for about 4 months. There is a noticeable difference every morning when I wake up. My skin is more refreshed and my fine lines less visible. It works even better when I do use my retinol and stay consistent in use. Do I think it’s worth the cost? Not really, but I like the feel and the result and until I can find a cheaper version I may continue to use it. A lot goes a long way and I have about half my container left. I’m 35 and have a lot of laugh lines around my eyes, I put the majority of the lotion on them. Does the job for a high price tag
