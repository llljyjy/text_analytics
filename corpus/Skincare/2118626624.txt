My main issue with this product is that after several months of light use, the applicator detached from the product so it cannot be used as intended. Sephora couldnâ€™t offer any help with this issue. I have not seen much results yet with the product in terms of wrinkles, but was keen to keep up my usage for consistency to see if it helped. Beware of this packaging defect. Not worth the packaging defect
