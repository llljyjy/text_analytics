Ugh it pains me to say this but I have been trying to place the VERY odd smell of this product and it FINALLY came to me - its the smell of the basement of a REALLY old house. Its so unfortunate because I love the way it makes my skin feel (note, like someone else mentioned it doesnt melt into skin but rather feels a little “clammy”). But honestly I dont know if I can get over the smell. I put this on at night and the first night it kept me awake it was so aggressive and unpleasant - and I am not particularly sensitive to smells. So thats the 2 star deduction. I’m hoping to get used to the smell because I do really enjoy how it’s making my skin feel so far. Jury is still out on longevity with this because at this rate I don’t know if I’ll be able to make it long. STRANGEST smelling product ever
