I got the Lancôme HCF triple serum courtesy of Influenster and Lancôme. I am a fan of everything Lancôme and this was no less. I applied it for more than two weeks and I loved the effect it has on my skin. The formula is a bit heavy but If blended well, it doesn’t feel greasy on the skin. My skin feels very well hydrated, brightened and plumped up. My dark spots seem to have lightened slightly and I’d love to keep applying it so I can get the results I’m hoping to get. The serum itself has a slight fragrance and I liked it. The packaging was okay but for the price, I do wish they would improve the packaging that gives a very plastic feel. The serum was easy to dispense as I would always invert the bottle for at least half hour before applying. I would repurchase this product unless I find a cheaper alternative that gives the same results. Works like magic!
