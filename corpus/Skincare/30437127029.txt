I really like using Dior Capture Totale Super Potent Eye Serum.  It is very easy to use,  just squeeze the tube and gently massage with the cool metal applicator.  The only issue I had was that it was kind of difficult to get just the right amount of Serum out of the tube. I would either get way too much or very little on the applicator.  This really helped smooth out the fine lines around my eyes and lightened my dark circles. Works great
