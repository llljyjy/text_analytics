I use this product at night after cleansing and before applying moisturizer and facial oil. I like the texture, which is like a very light cream that sinks right in. It doesn’t pill with other products at all. The ingredients look like good moisturizers and antioxidants - hyaluronic acid, green tea, bakuchiol, vitamin E, reservatrol. Genistein has some early clinical research that shows efficacy in moisturizing post-menopausal skin. I also like that the product is fragrance-free and truly has no scent to it. I didn’t notice any big change in my skin, but I had no adverse effects either. If you’re looking for a good all-around anti-aging serum, I think this is a good one. Lightweight anti-aging all-rounder
