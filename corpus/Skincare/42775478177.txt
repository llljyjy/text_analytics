This product is my go-to moisturizer in the winter and summer! The cream is lightweight, yet super hydrating. The texture is not too thick and absorbs nicely into the skin. I posted above a before and after picture using the product, and as you can see my skin glows and is less red than before! I highly recommend adding this cream to your daily routine! I struggle with acne and it never breaks me out! Lightweight and hydrating!
