I’ve been using this product for over 3 weeks, I might not have notice any wrinkles being corrected per say, but not a big deal. The first week I did break out a bit but once my skin got used to it, I did not have any other break outs. The scent is nice, smooth, does not feel greasy. I did notice my skin tone corrected, which is quite nice. Also, I did notice that my skin was not begging for a moisturizer after my showers, which I loved!! Because that means that even though the cream has been removed it’s still and has nicely moisturized my face perfectly.  I do recommend the product. Smooth
