I believe this is probably a wonderful product but I wasn’t able to truly get the full experience. My bottle got contaminated while I was staying in a hotel for work after 1 week of use. I’m writing this to warn buyers to be cautious with how you handle this product so you can avoid contamination and wasting your money like me.I knew it was contaminated when I saw discolored clumping moving around in the bottle and white clumps in the solution. I originally wanted to deny that it was contaminated but I could no longer deny it once I saw the discoloration. Wasn’t Able to Try Due to Contamination
