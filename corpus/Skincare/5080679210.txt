I don’t use Lancôme products much and I was excited to receive this night cream as there was so much hype around. I absolutely love this cream. I have dry skin and this cream is very moisturizing and makes my face feel fresh sand hydrated in the morning. It’s not too thick or oily. It does not make my screen breakout. It feels so soft on the skin and has a subtle amazing smell which makes you feel refreshed. It absorbs in the skin very nicely. Only down side for this night cream is that it’s expensive. I would definitely be looking for the promotions to purchase this cream over the next few months. This is a must try!! Must try!
