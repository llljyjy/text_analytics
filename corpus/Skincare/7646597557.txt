I love this toner!! I started using this while I was on Accutane because it is super gentle, without any harsh astringents or fragrances. I kept using it even afterwards for the same reasons. It is lightweight but definitely makes a difference in my skin. My face feels more supple after applying and goes great under my Vitamin C in the morning and under hyaluronic acid/moisturizer at night. Tip: At first, I was using this as like a cleansing toner with cotton pads. However, I saw a TikTok saying that rubbing cotton pads on your face, despite whatever good product youâ€™re using them with, can CAUSE acne due to the abrasive texture. When I stopped using this in a wiping motion with cotton pads and started putting it directly in my hands and pressing it into the skin I saw a huge difference. Highly recommend that method!
