Iâ€™ve been using this serum every other night and I am already start to see a difference in the smoothness of my skin. The formula is gentle enough to not cause irritation for my sensitive skin but also still produces results. Since you only need a pea size amount each time, the bottle should last a while. The only con is the color of the serum gave a weird yellow tint to my skin but not a huge deal since this is only for night time and I can wash it off in the morning. Overall, I would recommend! nan
