I really like this product as an all around cleanser. It’s more creamy that traditional micellar water, which I think helps with makeup removal, and I end up using less as it isn’t splashing out of the bottle. I do have to take a little more time with my mascara, but if you let it sit for a few seconds, it removes it well. My skin always feels soft after using, but it does feel like there is a little residue that it leaves behind. I usually use a mild toner after to help with that. Overall, great product, I ended up buying two. Great all over cleanser
