I’m a huge fan of merit lip oils and mascara so was really excited when merit launched this glow serum! I’ve used it for a couple weeks- it feels light on the skin and creates the most beautiful glow. It has also played well under foundation for me and is so hydrating without making me oily!*gifted Glowy effortless skin
