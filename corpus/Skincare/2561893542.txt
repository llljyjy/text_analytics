I am newer to the serum club, but I fell in love with this product. Because I’m on the drier side, I used this under my moisturizer, but definitely felt a boost in hydration and it lasted longer than with my moisturizer alone. I really like the jelly texture and how quickly it absorbed into my skin. As always, I appreciate that Summer Friday’s continues to make such great products that are clean and make my skin look fresh and young. This is a winner! Your new serum BFF
