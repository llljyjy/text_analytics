I liked the Estée Lauder 24hr Moisturizer. It felt great under my liquid foundation. I found it the perfect weight for spring/fall. The texture is very nice- not sticky or heavy, but not completely insubstantial either. The slight SPF is nice (15) although I’d want something a little higher in the summer. No off putting odor/fragrance, and the little bit it does have disappears quickly. My only complaint is this: although I didn’t have this moisturizer to try on the middle of winter, it doesn’t feel as heavily moisturizing as I typically need in super dry Ohio winters. I’m eager to see. Great high-quality product for normal/combo skin
