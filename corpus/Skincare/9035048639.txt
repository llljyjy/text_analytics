I usually can’t stand anything on my lips for over 20 mins or so..However, I love using this at night & wiping my lips off in the AM. Before bed, I like slathering it all over my lips after applying an overnight face mask. The next morning everything feels a little more supple. the consistency is like a velvet-gel-cream. Not sticky at all.BTW— it’s not the same unless you apply the lip mask with the little applicator wand that is included in the full size version. I have the berry flavor & the grapefruit one as well. LOVE THIS LIP MASK.. I even use it during the day.
