The Caudalie Premier Cru Anti Aging Cream Moisturizer  is a wonderful product. Everything I have tried from this brand has worked great for me and this has also. I like using it at night because it is a rich, creamy consistency but not greasy or too heavy. It is slightly fragrant and pleasant. It has not caused any irritation or breakouts on my skin. When I wake up in the morning, my skin looks very hydrated and plump. It is especially perfect for me this time of year because my skin gets very dry and dull. This product has helped to restore radiance and I look forward to more results with continued use. #freeproduct Lovely anti aging cream
