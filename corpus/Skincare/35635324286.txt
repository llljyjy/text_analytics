Overall, I enjoy this new product and I will continue using it, in combination with it’s product pairing. I received this #freeproduct in exchange for my review. I am 35 years old, and I have normal skin. On the first day of trying the cream, I used the combination of the firming cashmere cream and the instant firming serum. After washing my face in the shower, I applied these products. My sensitive skin didn’t turn bright red, the scent was pretty nice, and it felt luxurious on my skin. I was taken by surprise when I could feel my skin slowly tightening up just minutes after the first application of the combination. This combination gives me super smooth skin, and I can already see my pores appear smaller. Additionally, these two products leave a nice shine. To note, I added my foundation primer and foundation on top, and this canceled the shine. The downside was that my foundation was sitting in my pores rather than blending amongst them. I will use these creams on no makeup days. In summary, my face looks younger in that it appears taught. On day two, I used just the firming cashmere cream. The scent is fine, and my face is extremely soft to the touch. The singular product doesn’t get my face as tight as the combination of products, or as shiny.On day three, I used just the instant firming serum. I again feel that pairing the two products results in when you feel the most tightening on your face. Alone, this product provides a light shine and a light fragrance. On day four and beyond, I used the combination of the two products without foundation, and I’m happy with them! Nice!
