I received a sample and decided to give it a go as it’s been very cold where I live and my skin has been very dry. After one use the moisture to my face recovered and my face wasn’t wind whipped anymore. Very hydrating. Loved it so much I bought the full size balm and made it a part of my winter skin care routine. The smell goes away when applied. The balm is very thick, but would expect no less as it is a honey balm. Dry skin savior
