I really like Ilia’s triple serum SPF. It’s a really smooth base that you can apply before putting on heavier make up or wear is just as it. A lot of sunscreen eventually burns my eyes but this one doesn’t even when working in my yard in 90 degrees Texas. Only complains is that the container isn’t very intuitive. Make sure to shake it hard and point downwards. Great for base or minimal coverage. Doesn't bleed.
