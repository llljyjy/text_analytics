My unbiased review in exchange for free from influenster I have dry dehydrated skin and this Guerlain Abeille Royale Double R Advanced Serum feels so amazing on my skin. I use it after my toner but before my moisturizer and my skin is so hydrated and supple. I noticed my fine lines and hyper pigmentation is so much better.  On nights I’m super tired I can even skip moisturizer and my skin still feels great. I am obsessed with the texture of this product it is not sticky at all it absorbs well and you don’t need as much as you think. I am definitely adding this to my routine. I love this
