I received this free from Influenster to test and to give my honest opinion. I do not have wrinkles, so I decided to apply it to my lids, as well as under my eyes. The way my eyes are shaped, I have a bit of a fold when my eyes are open. Not exactly hooded eyes though.I tried the product for 7 days, applying once daily and I was quite impressed with the before and after! Clinique, for years has cornered their market on skincare - no question! If it’s from Clinique, it’s right!I recommend this if you have wrinkles, or if you don’t, as a preventative solution. At $55.00 per container, it should last you a while, since you only need a little at a time. I'm impressed after only 7 days!
