I received this complimentary from Influenster to test and review. First of all, I love the light citrus scent. It makes my skin feel really soft and hydrated and it absorbs quickly with no greasy feeling. I love the subtle glow it gives to my skin after applying, it just makes my skin look so healthy! I canâ€™t wait to continue using this in my skincare routine! I love this moisturizer!!
