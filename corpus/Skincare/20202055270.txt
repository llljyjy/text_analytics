A surprisingly nice product! A little goes a long way, i love how much it foams up! It leaves your skin feeling nourished and i also love the natural ingredients in it. I was fond of the smell at first but now after a few uses it really started to bother me. Not to mention it burned a little when it got onto my lips good but the scent!!
