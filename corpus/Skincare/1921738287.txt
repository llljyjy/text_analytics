I received a small sample packet from TopBox for review. It wasn’t enough to see any results but it did feel nice upon application. It was very lightweight and a little goes a long way. I don’t have a ton of wrinkles but would be willing to give this a try again if that became a bigger concern of mine. I usually like Clinique skincare and think this felt nice on the skin and sborbed quickly. It left my skin feeling lightly dewy and hydrated without being sticky. Lightweight
