Omg as a girl that lives in the sunshine state, the heat is BRUTAL so you need to always wear a sunscreen to protect your face. This not only helps to protect your skin because itâ€™s SPF 30 but also helps smooth my pores which makes me feel super confident walking out of the house with no makeup and just my Luxury Sun Ritual Pore Smoothing Sunscreen SPF 30! The BEST Sunscreen!
