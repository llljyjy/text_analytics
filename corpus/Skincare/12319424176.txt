I usually use the “100% plant derived squalane“ oil so i decided to try this one instead for a change. And i personally prefer the “plant derived squalane“ much more. This one is very watery which i’m not the biggest fan, i feel that it is not very hydrating and doesn’t absorb very well on the skin like the one from “100% plant derived squalane“ does. However,  i did really like this one for the hair, when i apply it to my hair, it makes my hair soft, gets rid of frizzy hair and doesn’t weigh my hair down or makes it oily. Would i buy this again for my face? Probably not. but will i buy this for the hair? Yes! Love it for the hair
