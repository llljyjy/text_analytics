I’ve been using this product since it came out. Extremely easy to use. Results are fantastic.  I’m 75 and my under eyes look great! It lasts forever, so it’s worth the price. Pump a small pea size drop on your finger. Use half for under one eye and half under the other eye.  I’ve never had trouble getting it to come out of the bottle. I love Kate’s products.  Exfolikate, Quench, and Under eye line release and lifting eye cream are my absolute daily essentials. It’s the BEST product on the market. It’s worth every penny.
