I received a Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle correcting cream sample free with #TopboxCircle #trywithtopbox #freeproduct. The product is light weight with a smooth and silky feeling. It has a pleasant light fragrance. I used the Correcting Cream at night and the Correcting Eye Cream along with Correcting serum in the morning. While I liked the feel of the product, the sample size was far too small to determine if it had beneficial qualities. Nice Product
