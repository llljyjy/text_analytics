Really confused about the flurry of great reviews and how they got here. I’ve never looked older since I started using this. My under eyes are so incredibly dry and it’s created this crepeiness I never had before. Fine lines are exacerbated and my concealer now looks like plaster. Needless to say I’ve stopped using it and my skin is finally starting to go back to normal but WOW, it’s not gentle at all and after 3 weeks of use it never stopped giving me that “hasn’t slept in days” look. It’s basically the kalteen protein bar of eye creams. Awful
