I received this product complimentary from Estee Lauder and Influenster in exchange for an honest review. I love the packaging, it’s beautiful and luxurious. The product is creamy and moisturizes well and sinks into my skin. Theres a slight fragrance which is pleasant bit doesn’t last too long. I feel that my skin enjoyed the product as it moisturized extremely well. I’d recommend 10/10 Creamy Moisture
