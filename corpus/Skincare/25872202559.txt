I recieved this product in a voxbox from @influenser and @shiseido for my honest review. Thanks so much.. I really wanted to like this sunscreen, as i love all shiseido products thus far. What i did like about it was that it did not smell like sunscreen at all. The texture was unique and hydrating. The product is extremely thin and feels more like a lightweight serum than anything.  But, overall i couldnt get it to work for me. I tried multiple kinds of skincare products to use with, and rearrannged my order including the sunscreen and every time it would ball up, peeling as you can see in my picture. Another down fall was the white cast. You really had to rub it in to get rid of it. As far as darker skin beauties go i wouldnt recommend this. After trial and error i did find that if i only put this on my skin after i wash my face, than proceed with makeup after letting it dry down, it did work out fine. But, I prefer to wear more skincare during the day. Shiseido sunscreen sun dual care
