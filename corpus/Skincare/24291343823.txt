I recently began microneedling my skin and using a Retinol serum to purge all the yuckies. What a transition period and NOT in a good way. Pimples, redness, dry patches. Blah. I started working this into my routine either using it alone on a clean face at night OR over the Retinol. Magical. Redness faded, no more peeling, some of the pimples cleared up. My skin began looking healthy.... Like really great! I don’t even use foundation anymore! I’ve just been going with SPF and a tinted moisturizer with a lil more SPF.If you’re on the fence .... Get it girl. Healthy, radiant, happy
