Meh. I wanted to love this product. The cream is very soft and spreads well. The rose scent is wonderful. But I’m suffering from terrible dry skin this winter - the worst it’s ever been - and this cream does nothing to moisturize. It goes on smoothly, feels nice, and then corrects nothing. I live in the humid DC area, so maybe it will be better in the summer when my skin is more naturally hydrated. Maybe good for summer?
