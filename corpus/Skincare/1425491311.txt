tl;dr hydrating, moisturizing, tightening, depuffing, no creasingI have dehydrated skin, and under my eyes specifically I get dry skin and flaking (this is the norm for me and gets worse when I use retinol). Clinique’s rich eye cream formula helps with dryness but its a bit too thick for day time under concealer; Origins has a brightening eye cream which helps debuff and brighten but its not very moisturizing; there are others as well, but none were just right... until this! I use this every evening and morning and found that it instantly moisturizes, hydrates, depuffs and tightens the eye area. It is also excellent under makeup, I dont get any extra creasing with my concealer. It also moisturizes all day - I used to get flaking by the end of the day and I do not with this. For for long-term benefits of reducing dark circles and wrinkles? I dont see it, but I’m okay with that. The short-term benefits are excellent and though I received this complimentary, I will certainly be repurchasing when I run out. Best eye cream yet!
