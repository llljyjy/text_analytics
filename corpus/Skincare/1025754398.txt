Great price, no fragrance, very hydrating, efficient packaging. My sensitive skin did not burn or redden when I used this.However, it gave me three blemishes after only one day. I never breakout except in response to product and this is the only thing new Iâ€™ve tried. Bummer. Not for oily folks. bad breakout almost immediately
