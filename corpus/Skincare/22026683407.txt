I waited to try it all before I wrote my review. I will say if you have dry eyelids you’ll love this. It’s not too greasy where it causes milia. It’s just right. I did notice a decrease in the look of fine lines on my lids, but I think it’s just from the hydration. Over all I like it. I will probably not repurchase, but I am glad to have tried it. Super hydrating
