I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. I’ve been intimidated about retinol for a long time. I decided to pick this one up because it looked easy to use and not too strong. So far I’ve been loving it! Warning, I did notice some dryness when using it on a regular basis (I think this is normal for beginning all retinols). I recommend to anyone trying to test out retinol but not knowing where to start! Great Transition Into Retinol!
