Okay let me begin by saying I left a not so positive review on the body butter. Shame on me and I can’t delete it. At first with one application it was a no from me but I applied a second layer and Omgosh it is the best self Tanner I have ever used. I just ordered 2 more to last me the rest of summer. It’s day four and it still looks amazing. My absolute favorite self Tanner ever. nan
