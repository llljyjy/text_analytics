In a moment of weakness, I bought this from Peace Out’s website.  Since they refuse to publish negative experiences with the product, I came here.  First off, it smells like...I don’t know, a BV infection??  I mean I only used it as spot treatments literally, I cannot imagine slathering this over my whole face.  I used it daily as directly for 8 weeks and no lightening, no miracles, just $30 lighter in the wallet.  I went against my own judgment after reading about how the dots didn’t spot treat but somehow thought the serum would work.  Nope.  And sorry, I can’t trust “incentivized“ reviews.  Even if a product is bad, people feel obligated to leave a good review and kudos to those who wrote the bad review anyway.  Integrity! Did absolutely nothing after 8 weeks
