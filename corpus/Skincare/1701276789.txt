A little confusing. This herbal anti-aging balm is super smooth and glides on thin but appears greasy at first, so it’s kind of confusing! Smells amazing but I didn’t feel comfortable putting it on my face due to the consistency. I actually put it on all of my inflamed skin, such as my arms and elbows after hair removal and my legs after shaving. I felt that it was nice and soothing after traumatizing my skin with those things. Smells great.
