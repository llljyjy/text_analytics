The balm itself was just ’ok’, it was definetly moisturizing but the tube was way too chunky and it became a headache to use. To be honest, I actually had better results with something my cousin gave me called Lipitude, it actually healed my lips overnight and it was all natural and  way cheaper than this balm. I love Drunk Elephant products because they’re clean products but honestly, this balm is just way too pricey when I can buy an all natural product from Lipitude that works better for WAY less. Just saying. Good but not great...found a better option
