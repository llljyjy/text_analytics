Love how this oil breaks down my sunscreen and mascara so well and then turns to a milky cleanser when water is added. The smell is wonderful! I follow up in the evening with a moisturizer cleanser to take off any residue, but I probably donâ€™t need to. The only downside is the price. Wish it came in a larger bottle with refill options. Does an Amazing Job!
