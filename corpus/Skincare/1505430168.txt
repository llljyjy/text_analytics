I had expected more given the “cult“ status of this lip mask.  It’s, fine.  The vanilla is fine.  The texture is sticky but fine.  I like that the tub is rather big and will last a while, I didn’t find anything special about it.  I have been using the tatcha camellia lip balm before bed for years, and it’s better.  This is quite sticky.  I’ll use it up but I’ll stick with tatcha for waking up with moisturized lips. It's Fine
