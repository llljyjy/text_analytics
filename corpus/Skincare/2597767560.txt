One of my favorite serums. It’s gone up a bit in price over the last year, but I’d still consider it worth the price. I use this in the AM after washing my face, before moisturizer or makeup and it has really made a difference over the last year or so. I actually really like the consistency and you don’t need a lot of product to be effective. It’s a cross between water and gel-like texture, but no sticky/ gummy or oily feeling left on your skin after application. Would Recommend
