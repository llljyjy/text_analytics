I’ve been using this for just over a month now. I usually use the ole henrikssen walnut scrub which has been discontinued. After having this product recommended to me I am very satisfied with this purchase. It is great with my sensitive skin, and has been helping with my pores and dry skin. Other comments complain about it turning “chunky“ but it says directly in the description it’s going to do that because it’s the impurities/dry skin being scrubbed away. I do find I have to use a little more product for it to be effective but I only use it a couple times a week so the small tube is lasting me. nan
