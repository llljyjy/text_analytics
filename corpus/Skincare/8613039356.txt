I got the sample as a birthday gift. The moisturizer irritated my skin so badly that I has to wash my face after a few minutes. Iâ€™ve built a pretty good moisture barrier during the past month using non-fragranced moisturizers and this little cream totally ruined it for me. Not suited for dry and sensitive skin.
