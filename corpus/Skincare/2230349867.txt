I received this complimentary product for free from Influenster and Esteâ€™e Lauder. As a review for this free trial, I did not have the expected results. My main concern was dark under eye circles. I used this product for a month with no change in the dark circles. I did apply the product morning and night. The consistency was great, very smooth and silky without the sticky feeling afterwards. The sample size was more than enough to last all month as a little goes a long way. The scent was not strong, but soft and pleasant. Even though I did not get the desired results for my under eye circles, it may work for wrinkles. I do not have eye wrinkles, so I am unable to attest if the product works for that issue. I had high hopes
