I received this product free from influencer and exchange for my honest feedback back. The cream is very hydrating and felt smooth on my skin only a small amount is needed for your eyes for your eyes. Personally, I use it more so at night as my skin is fairly oily throughout the day and while there has been no adverse affects Iâ€™d like to see long term how it affects my skin. nan
