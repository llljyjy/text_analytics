I have oily/somewhat sensitive skin. When I first used this face scrub I was not expecting the lovely smell! Smells like pineapple! I was surprised at how quickly the scrubby bits dissolve, but I’m unbothered by it. My skin felt smoothe after first use, and I’m looking forward to using some tonight. I’m going to get my husband to use this scrub, he would enjoy the smell and how his skin feels after! Surprise tropical!
