After reading the reviews, I thought, there’s no way this product smells THAT bad… But oh, IT DOES. Smells like rotten gasoline. Truly shocked at how bad it smells. The product does work but I don’t think it’s worth it for the smell. It’s a bit unbearable. Disappointing for Topicals because their mask is amazing and so I was hoping for something similar with this serum. Oh well! nan
