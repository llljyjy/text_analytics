I was surprised at how gentle this toner was on my skin due to the lactic acid, I was afraid it was going to irritate my skin but to my surprise it was actually very soothing. It was soooo satisfying to see all the junk that was exfoliated off my skin after using this on a cotton round. My skin felt very clean, refreshed, and balanced after using this product and made my skin feel rejuvenated and glowing. Would definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for a chemical exfoliant that is not going to inflame your skin and is great for acne prone skin types. Satisfying skincare
