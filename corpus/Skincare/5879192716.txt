The packaging is the biggest flaw. It’s a hard plastic you have to try to squeeze to get the product out. If you squeeze too hard, too much comes out. The metal tip is nice and cooling, but will drag if you don’t have enough product on it. The serum itself was nice. I found it hydrated my under eyes, but didn’t notice any reduction of wrinkles. It didn’t irritate my eyes and played nice with my skin. Nice product, terrible packaging
