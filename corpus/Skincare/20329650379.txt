I got this as a gift and I got the watermelon flavor and I love the scent of it! It’s very nourishing and kept my lips soft for a couple hours. It’s really affordable so that’s something we want. The size of it is very convenient and can be kept in your pockets. I really like this product Hydrating lip balm
