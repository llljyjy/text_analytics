I’ve got sensitive skin, and sensitivity to fragrance to boot. Fresh Seaberry Nutrition Booster was my go-to for a nice, light, moisturizing and uplifting serum for years, before it was discontinued. This product reminds me of it in a way because it’s the right balance for my very picky skin - it’s a hyaluronic acid so it’s moisturizing and the green tea seems to have an antioxidant effect (along with the benefits of caffeine). I have lots of serums, but this is a great option that feels as luxurious as my $150 serums but at a much more affordable price. It will be a recurring purchase. Feels so lovely!
