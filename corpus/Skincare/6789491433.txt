I haven’t tried this product long enough to say if I love it, but I do like it. It’s got a very nice consistency, doesn’t leave my under eyes sticky or tacky like some other eye creams I’ve tried. The applicator was very nice. It was metal, so it was cooling as it applied. I’m 37 and thankfully, I don’t have many eye wrinkles, so I’m not 100 percent sure if it made a difference with that. Nice Cooling Eye Cream
