The sunscreen itself is nice. It goes very well under make-up and applies easily. The issue is the bottle flakes terribly so that when you’re applying the sunscreen, you get flakes on your skin. I’ve bought this twice & had the same issue happen both times. For that reason alone I wouldn’t recommend this. For the price point, the bottle should have no issues. Horrible packaging
