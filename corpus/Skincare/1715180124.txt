I received a sample of this product in return for my honest review. This is not overly moisturizing, and definitely not meant for dry climates or winter season. My face felt dry and right after using this, not at all what I wanted or expected from a moisturizer. I would not buy the full-sized product and will not be using again. Not Helpful in the Winter or Dry Climates
