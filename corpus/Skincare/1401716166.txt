PLEASE give this a chance!!! Years ago I tried this a few times and it would instantly break me out even more than I already was. I’d immediately put it away. I’ve come back to it years later and it is single-handedly the ONLY thing that have SAVED my skin and reversed my acne. Don’t know how but it did. I started out using it once a week, now I use it twice everyday, morning and night. Within the first few days my skin was already looking better, and this is with acne around my chin and bumps on my forehead mostly. I used to have very oily skin and now I’m more on the normal to dry side, so maybe that’s why it works better now. I can tell a huge difference if I go a day without it, my skin craves it now. I don’t know if that’s a good or bad thing lol but it’s never leaving my side. It took me years to come back & give it a chance!!
