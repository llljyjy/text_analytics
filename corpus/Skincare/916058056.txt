Shiseido Urban Environment Oil-Free Mineral Sunscreen provides a broad spectrum SPF 42 in a mineral formula. The product is very light and can be used as a face primer under makeup or on itâ€™s own. Because it is mineral based, it does leave a light, almost whitish appearance to your skin, but it feels so smooth going on that it leaves a nice feeling to your skin. If you are used to typical store bought sunscreens, this will be different for you, but it does provide other benefits by boosting hydration in your skin while providing sun protection. nan
