I have always known Gucci for their purses so I was not entirely sure what to expect when it came to this facial mist. With that being said, I was FLOORED by how much I loved it. Upon spraying it, the very first thing I noticed was how delightful the scent was. I am very picky when it comes to fragrance in beauty products, but this scent is fresh and very light.  I also love that the formula is hydrating. This mist is now a part of my daily routine. nan
