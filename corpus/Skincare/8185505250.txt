I usually like to change my daily moisturizer in the winter, as I want a thicker barrier for my skin, that can truly hydrate in the drier months, and I want to say that this moisturizer is the perfect one! Keeps my skin super hydrated, and the thick layer allows it to stay soft throughout the entire day. I also love the percentage of Hyaluronic acid, as it is hard to find a true “rich in hyaluronic acid“ cream! 10/10 for me! Love!!
