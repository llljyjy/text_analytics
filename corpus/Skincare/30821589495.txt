This serum is actually pretty nice, it does what it says and hydrates. I have really dry skin and I like using this on slightly wet skin (I find that less is more) and that hydrates well. Iâ€™m probably gonna but again because I love it under moisturizers especially for my super dry skin but it is a little thick and makes me break out in areas where I have acne. If you want something of a thinner consistency and you have acne, than the marine hyaluronic might be better for you since it has salicylic acid but I like to layer a couple of hydrates and moisturizers (while avoiding acne prone areas, mainly applying it on my cheeks) since my skin literally flakes there. Does what it says!
