I have fair, extremely sensitive skin, and I’m not normally a fan of mineral sunscreen. I didn’t have great hopes for this, but it’s amazing! It doesn’t leave a white coat behind, I didn’t get any rashes or hives, and IT WORKS!!!! I was outside all weekend in the sun, and I didn’t burn at all. I highly recommend it!!! Great for sensitive skin!
