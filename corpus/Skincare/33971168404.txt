Decent Product. I have used it for a week now, without any other skin care. It helps with my dryness and adds a subtle glow to my face. however it did leave a lil white cast if not blended properly. rubbing into the skin is the key to help with white cast, atleast for my skin. smelled strong although didn’t burn my eyes, which is amazing coz alot of sunscreens burn my eyes. overall a decent product.. however, I am unable to give more than 3 stars considering the white cast and strong smell. Also, this didn’t peel on my skin like others have mentioned. it did work great along with makeup as well. Decent Product
