I have tried a few toners and this one is my favorite. It both cleans and moisturizes my skin. The smell is also amazing because it smells like boba tea! The only thing I don’t like is the packaging. The cap is not user friendly and I am not easily able to get the liquid out. Usually you can shake toners to get it out so you don’t have to keep dabbing it with your fingers, but this one you have to dab it a few times with your fingers to get it out. I don’t like this because it doesn’t get enough out at a time to spread over my entire face, so I have to do this process 2-3 times. Otherwise, the product itself is amazing and it will definitely be included in my night time facial routine. Great product but packaging not user friendly
