I have mixed feelings about it, I was given this product to review as part of an Influenster campaign and after trying it for three weeks here are my pros and cons. I didn’t like that it was a jelly substance as I am very used to foam and like cleansers that lathers up, this one was very much jelly like and I felt like it wasn’t doing much. The exfoliating agents did help in removing dead skin and making my face feel refreshed after use. The fragrance of citrus was there but it was also extremely strong not my cup of tea. I was able to get passed the smell by the 3rd use, most of my products are fragrant less. I use this in the morning 2 hours before I apply makeup and in the evening after I take my makeup off. I enjoyed using the product because it wasn’t irritating on my skin and I was able to use it twice a day. Incorporating it into my morning and night routine. I have combination skin where my t zone is very oily and my jaw area gets very dry and I’ve used several exfoliants that have left my face more dry where it doesn’t need to be and this product has helped both areas. It leaves my face feeling tight after use but not dry. This product has been doing what it says it does , removes flaky skin, leaves skin soft after use, feeling refreshed. Not sure what long term use benefits are. Pros and cons
