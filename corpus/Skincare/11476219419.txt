As a beauty enthusiast, a great serum is a must-have in my routine. The Kosas Plump and Juicy Spray-On serum is amazing. First of all, I love the beautiful ombre glass bottle packaging. This spray-on vegan collagen serum is formulated with Peptides, Microbiome-balancing plant probiotics, Artemisia flower extract, Proteins, Amino Acids, and Hyaluronic acids. These ingredients collaborate to deliver hydration, soothing, firming, lifting and plumping of the skin. This spray serum has fine mist particles that absorb quickly into the skin. It is fragrance-free and safe for any skin type. I use this spray serum in the morning and reapply it anytime when my skin needs it, and night time routine after washing off my skin followed with moisturizer. I love how it leaves my skin hydrated, plump, and firm upon application. This is an easy and quick way to apply serum without making a mess. I absolutely love it and highly recommend it. Hydrated and plump the skin
