I have always struggled with water to feel hydrated throughout the day, while addressing my sensitive skin (redness and dryness, but with an oily nose and forehead).

This was the PERFECT refresh for my skin, I use it in the morning, and then again throughout the day when I need a pick me up. Feels great even over makeup. A New Staple in My Routine
