I received this product for free from BzzAgent and Kiehl’s in exchange for my honest review. This stuff is the real deal. I can already see visible results in my wrinkles and fine lines starting to fade away. I’m super impressed with how well this works. I love the way you have to mix the formula yourself. This process lets you know that you have the freshest product possible. The bottle was very well designed too. I really like the way you push on the bottom of the bottle to get the product out. Very convenient and easy to do. The product itself is a little on the runny side, but it does blend into your face very easily and absorbs quick. It does however have a slight smell to it. More of a medicine like smell. Nothing overpowering or strong, just noticeable. Overall, I am very happy with this product and I will continue to use this in my daily skincare routine. This really works!
