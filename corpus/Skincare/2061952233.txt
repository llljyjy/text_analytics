I Quite Like The Formula Of This Serum. Most Serums Are A Liquid Formula, And This One Is A Whipped Type Consistency. It Goes On So Smooth, And Sort Of Looks A Little Matte. Also, A LITTLE Goes A Long Way.  I Have Genetically Dark Under Eyes, So Product Isnâ€™t Going To Do Much For Me In That Department, But I Definitely Noticed A Difference In The Texture Of My Under Eye. It Has Made My Under Eyes A Bit Smoother, And More Refreshed Looking. Also, Really Love The Packaging. The Pump Gives The Perfect Amount Of Product. nan
