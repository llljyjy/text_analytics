After 7 days of wear I can confirm that this product does deliver on its claims to provide smoother and more radiant looking skin. It has a pleasant scent and did not irritate my sensitive skin at all. It sinks into the skin beautifully and did not leave me feeling or looking oily or greasy at all. Definitely looking forward to continuing to use this product and see the results long term.Thank you to Butterfly and ChickAdvisor for sending me this product in exchange for an honest review. #gotitfree A beautiful product from Clarins
