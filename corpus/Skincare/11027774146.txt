I received this item free to give my honest opinion.  I have been using this product for a few weeks now and While I didnâ€™t see any results in my fine lines and wrinkles yet, I found this to be a great, hydrating eye cream. It paired well with my makeup, and kept my eyes feeling hydrated and comfortable throughout the day. Goes on easy without leaving a greasy feeling. Also like that it is unscented. Need more time to see improvements on wrinkles
