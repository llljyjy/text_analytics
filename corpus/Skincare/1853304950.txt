On my second tub and still loving it! The texture is creamy without being heavy. I have combination but because of the winter season my the dry area can be more parched. This does the job hydrated the dry area without making my oiler area more oily. The extra plus is the packaging. Itâ€™s super sanitary, just push down and it dispenses the right amount. Your fingers never touch the inside of the tub. I took it apart because I was curious on the mechanism and there was no leftover product. Money well spent! nan
