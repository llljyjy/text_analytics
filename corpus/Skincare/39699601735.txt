I got a sample of this for my free birthday gift. I had heard great things about Tatcha and had been wanting to try it for a while so i was extremely excited and hoping to love it. Right off the bat this has a fragrance. I’m not particularly sensitive to fragrances but it is worth noting. It is also EXTREMELY oily and greasy. It felt disgusting to have on my face. I was hoping this would go away as I worked the product in however that did not happen. The cream remains oily and never really works into the skin how a cream should. It sort of just sits on top. It’s literally as if I applied an oil on my skin. Overall this was not a good experience. I’m unsure if maybe I got some sort of defected cream. I see so many great reviews and was hoping to have a similar experience. I really did want to like this product and was even hoping on purchasing the full size but I’ve changed my mind. Don’t purchase this without having tried it first. Such A Let Down
