I have combination skin so I started using this twice a week in my skin routine and moved up to 3 times a week since benzoyl peroxide can be drying. I like that it incorporates hyaluronic acid to offset the drying effect of benzoyl peroxide and I did notice a difference in my existing breakouts. Squeaky clean face
