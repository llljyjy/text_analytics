Very nice creamy texture, out of all my serums I like applying this one the most. It goes well after more drying serums and right before the moisturizer in the morning. I think it does protect my skin quite a bit, it is a part of my routine that gives me very clear and plump skin at the end of the day. When I bought it for the first time I thought I would just use it for a bit (because of how many products I already use on my skin in the morning), but I couldnâ€™t bring myself to give it up after I finished the bottle, so I bought the second one. nan
