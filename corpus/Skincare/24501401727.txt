Ever since I turned forty, my skin has been dry and much rougher.  I’ve spent the last decade trying to find a night cream that would make a difference, and so far my search has been in vain.  I recently had the opportunity to try Lancome’s Advanced Genefique Night Cream, and let me tell you, my skin is loving it!  I had been experiencing very dry patches, and after the first few days of this cream, my face has been supple and smooth--no dryness to be found!  Additionally, it’s made my skin softer and smoother.  I’m incredibly grateful.  I would recommend this to anyone who has struggled with dry patches, or anyone who’s hit middle age and is seeing and feeling it in their face.  I’ve already recommended this to a couple of my friends as well as my mom.  If you’re hesitating because you’re not sure if it will work, I can tell you with complete certainty it works for me. A Much-Needed Night Cream!
