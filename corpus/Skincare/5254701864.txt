I received Dior Capture Totale Le Serum for free from influenster and Dior in exchange for my honest review. I have used the product for over a week now and I’m loving it!I’m 55 and have never used botox or surgery to improve my skin. I have tried to keep my skin youthful by using good skincare and most importantly a good serum. The first day I tried this new serum I immediately felt my skin tighten. My skin is definitely brighter, more plump/firm, and my lines have softened. The serum is lightweight,  absorbs quickly,  and has a pretty iridescent/pearl color. It definitely has a pleasant scent but is not strong.My skin can be sensitive to some products but I did NOT experience any redness, burning, or dryness using it. The only thing I’m concerned with is how fast I will use up the bottle.  I have been using the serum twice a day using 3 or 4 pumps and my skin just really absorbs the product quickly. Dior is one of the more expensive brands I have used and I don’t mind spending a little more on a serum because I really think using serums are one of the most important items for maintaining youthful skin but I wouldn’t want to be replacing it so quickly.I would definitely recommend Dior Capture Totale Le Serum. It has improved my skin after using it for a week. I'm loving this new Dior serum ❤️
