On my second jar of this eye cream, and will continue my repurchasing. My next purchase will be the dreamy eye cream, so I can make this last longer and have a nighttime one. Yet this one brightens beautifully, goes on thick so I push it up my cheekbones to give a nice base for my moisturizer, and doesn’t have any fragrance that might bother your eyes/nose. I use it every morning and night, and after two years now, and can’t believe how much it lightens my undereyes. Now I don’t suffer from major discoloration but do have a slight purple hue to my sockets, so this works amazingly on lifting that color and giving me a night light eye for my natural, everyday look. Yes...Yes...and Yes
