I received this product free from Influenster and Korres so that I could honestly review it.This skin cream has a light scent which I can’t make out but it’s lovely. This is called a cream but I’d say it’s more of a lotion consistency which I quite like. It absorbs into the skin well and I’m not sure it actually reduces the appearance of pores but it does leave my skin feeling smooth and soft to the touch. I would use it again and recommend it! nan
