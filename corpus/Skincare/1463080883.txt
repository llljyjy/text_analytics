I’m devastated. I have been buying the actual products from JLO company. But found it easier to buy at Sephora. It gets here faster. However, My jar of blockbuster cream was half full and not filled out to the sides. I’m thinking the machine screwed up and it slipped inspection. I’m disgusted. 58.00 plus dollars is a lot to get ripped off. I called Sephora and they couldn’t help. They didn’t package it. So I am buying another and if it’s the same, I break ties with JLO. I finally found a cream I’m loving at 62 years old. No one believes my age. So sad about this. I still recommend highly! But not if it’s half full. where is the 1oz of the 1.7??
