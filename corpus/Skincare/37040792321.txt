This cleansing balm is unlike any I’ve used before. It’s easy to manipulate - but doesn’t become a runny mess - and it’s easy to wash off. I dual cleanse with this cleansing balm first then differin/cerave cleanser after and my face has never felt so soft! I love how easy it was to remove waterproof mascara with this, it came off much simpler than makeup remover! This product is going to stay a part of my routine, I love it! Favorite cleansing balm!
