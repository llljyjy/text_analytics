I have combo/sensitive skin, so was a bit reluctant to try this out since it has microbeads for exfoliating. It felt a bit rough for my skin type but I massaged this gently across my face and surprisingly it did not irritate my face but did cause slight redness. This cleanser wasnâ€™t overly drying. The consistency is jelly-like which is pretty nice and soothing on the skin. I used this every night and my skin is definitely softer. I would recommend this to someone with oily or combo skin and enjoys the feeling of a microbead cleanse. Pretty good
