This product!!🥰😍 I  have dry blotchy spots in certain areas of my face. I was getting ready to seek a professional opinion on how to solve this issue until I visited Sephora and met this very knowledgeable sweet young lady. She recommended this product to me  and explained how it work with the skin. Even though I was very skeptical and the product was a bit pricey,  I decided to give it a try. No more dry patches and my skin looks amazing.  I love this product and will sacrifice to continue to have it in my daily skin care!! nan
