I was gifted by Laneige the Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer. I really really loved the packaging..The shape, the color, the little beads like particles, the cooling effect of the gel everything appealed to me..I also loved the fragrance. Overall the gel is hydrating but maybe I need more hydration. Maybe it is more suited for people with combination to moderate dry skin..I have extremely dry skin so I had to reapply pretty often.. nan
