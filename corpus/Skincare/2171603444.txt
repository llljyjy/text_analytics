After using this product I felt that it made my skin smoother to the touch and very soft. I usually have a problem with dry skin in my forehead and brow area during the winter but after applying this product my skin looked radiant and felt hydrated. I also noticed that the area under my eyes no longer looked like I slightly had bags and appeared normal. I really like the results I got but I canâ€™t say for sure if this product really works to eliminate wrinkles and the price I feel is a little higher than what I could justify paying. nan
