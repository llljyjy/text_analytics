Dr. Zenovia Peptide + Ceramic Repairing Moisturizer is an amazing find! Really does firm up your skin and help with dark circles, which are a huge problem for me. It has a nice bit of moisture, not too much and it isn’t greasy or oily after. Didn’t give me any breakouts and soaks into the skin perfectly.  I will definitely be using this as my go to Moisturizer from now on! Get it! You won't regret it!
