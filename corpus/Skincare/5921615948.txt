This is everything I want in an eye cream. It’s a little on the thick side but blends in SO easy and doesn’t leave a greasy residue. It gives a slight illumination effect once you put it on and looks beautiful. My eyes looks so much more awake with it, they also feel hydrated even in these winter months. I love it under my eyes before makeup so my concealer doesn’t look cakey. The illumination effect is so pretty that even without makeup I feel like my under eyes have a little something extra. This is my new go to for eye cream and I would recommend to everyone! This is a big YES!
