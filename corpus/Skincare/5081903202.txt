I love vitamin C and have tried countless types and brands over the years. The CC Me is by far my favorite! It leaves my skin so hydrated and fresh feeling! Some others give me a sticky residue and or oiliness throughout the day. This is one of the only ones I actually see and feel and huge difference in my skin. The texture is amazing! Will always repurchase. I love the whole Summer Fridays line! Highly recommend trying if youâ€™re ready for good quality skincare to see if it will work out for you! my favorite Vitamin C ever!
