I received this Est√©e Lauder product to try complimentary from Influenster. I have always liked Estee Lauder products, so I was happy to try something new. It is the consistency of a toner and I used it in the morning and evening. I normally have very dry skin, so I really liked how much this hydrated my skin. I would use it on a freshly cleaned face then apply serums or moisturizer. It locked in moisture and kept my face feeling moisturized and looking hydrated. It even went well under my normal makeup routine. I will definitely continue to use this product. 10/10 Super hydrating!
