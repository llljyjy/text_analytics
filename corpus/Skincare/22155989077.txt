I love this soap. The only reason for the 3 star review is I hate the bottle and the pump. It leaks everywhere, makes a mess, and is just a waste. Please please please fix the bottle+pump. I love this soap, but given how much leaks out it’s just a waste and I can’t stomach it. Bad Bottle, Great Soap
