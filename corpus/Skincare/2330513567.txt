So bummed, as I usually love Glow Recipe products. This broke me out. I don’t freak out easily, but I’ve had a few spot from seating a mask, so I bought this serum with high hopes. Sadly it caused a breakout everywhere I applied it. I tried it a few more times to get sure, so sad it caused pimple and irritation every time. Broke me out!
