Received Biossance Squalane + Vitamin C Rose Moisturizer from Influenster in exchange of my honest review. It has slight smell of rose which goes away quickly. Packaging is great and informative. Texture is very smooth and creamy.This moisturizer is highly hydrating. It feels heavy as soon as you apply it. Then immediately feels lightweight once absorbed. I have dry skin and I liked the way it felt on my skin. I loved the instant brightness it provides and face looks naturally glowing. Its good for oily skin mostly. I felt this is a great product with great ingredients. Looking forward to using it more. I recomment it for dry skin. Highly moisturizing
