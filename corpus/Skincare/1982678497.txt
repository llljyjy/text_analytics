Very glad I didn’t listen to the reviews on this one. I followed the directions, washed my face and left my nose wet, removed the plastic film from the strip and stuck it on. Waited 10 minutes and removed it and it worked great! I took off 1 star because there is only one strip in the pack. I guess for $3 you can’t complain but I wish they sold a value size at a better price. Follow the directions on the back
