This product is super watery.  Definitely not a gel.  It didnâ€™t work well to cleanse my face. After washing my face twice with this product I used the acne solutions clarifying toner and the cotton pad was super dirty after. This is definitely not a good cleanser for me. I expected better for the price. not for me
