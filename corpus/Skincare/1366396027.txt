It’s not the best product to remove make up. My mascara isn’t water proof and it still doesn’t remove it all. I find myself using a make up removing wipe after I use this pre-cleanse. I do like that it doesn’t dry out my skin and i feel like it’s moisturized after using this product. It also doesn’t burn my eyes after using this. I will keep it for these reasons mostly but I will continue to shop around for a gentle make up remover/cleanser. Moisturizing, but doesn’t remove make up well
