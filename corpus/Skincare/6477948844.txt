I received a sample of this product from Sephora. I have dry and sensitive skin and I only tried this once and immediately that night I got 2-3 small red bumps/pimples on my face. My face was quite itchy and irritated throughout the day after putting this on. With my regular skincare routine I never get pimples or irritation, so I know it was this product. Didnâ€™t work for my sensitive skin :(
