I recently received this product for review purposes (gifted by dermalogica). I have been using it daily in my morning routine and I’m really enjoying it. The consistency is perfect not too thick but still has a sticky feeling to it (in a good way). It doesn’t pil and is great under makeup. I definitely feel like it’s giving my face a more plump look and keeps it hydrated throughout the day. Great HA to add to routine
