I like the formula - itâ€™s great as a day cream and does have light reflecting properties that make dark circles less visible. But the packaging! I could give it zero stars - you can only open it if your hands are completely dry (which never happens during morning skincare routine). That cap is so hard to pull off, and when you finally do, you sometimes accidentally squeeze out more product than needed good product, terrible packaging
