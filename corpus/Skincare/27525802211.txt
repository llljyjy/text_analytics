Another amazing product from this brand! I have used a low strength retinol serum before this, but this one is even better and it didn’t give me any irritation at all! I have sensitive skin and I’m so impressed! The formula is fragrance free and feels like a lotion consistency on the skin. I have definitely noticed an improvement in texture in the few weeks I’ve used this! No irritation… just results!
