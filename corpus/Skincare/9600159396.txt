I love this brand and everything that they do. Was pleased to receive the whole jar of this new moisturizer for free in exchange to my honest opinion. The product is thick, but very easy to put on. It doesn’t create a greasy layer on your skin after application. I don’t mind the smell, it smells like a natural product, not artificial. I applied it before bed, and in the morning my skin wasn’t oily, which is great. My skin likes it! Clean Win
