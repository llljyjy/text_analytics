This product made me break out like crazy! I have never struggled with acne, but a few days after using this product, small bumps and whiteheads started spreading across my forehead and cheeks like wildfire! It’s been 3 weeks since I stopped using this product and although the acne started clearing up a bit once I stopped, but I’m still struggling with trying to clear up the affected areas. nan
