Overall, I think this is a good product, but I don’t know that it really worked for me. I’m super fair, so I’ve only been using two drops, but after about 5 days of use I don’t really see much of a change. It also made me break out a bit. I may keep trying it, with more of the product, since I do like how it feels. It easily soaks into my skin and doesn’t feel heavy at all. So, I’d probably recommend, just not sure it’s for me. It’s ok!
