Best Vitamin C serum—and I’ve tried most of them. It has a great consistency that makes it easy to apply/spread on your face. It doesn’t oxidize, turn colors, or develop a strange smell over time like many of the others do (as a result of being in a dropper bottle). The packaging works really well for this product and preserves it for much longer. Great Vitamin C & E product!
