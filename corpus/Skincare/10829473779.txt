I’ve been slowly introducing this product into my skincare routine over the past month or so after Influenster sent it to me. The liquid does a good job at giving me a glow and does not burn my skin. I’m not sure if I’ve seen a significant decrease in pore size or anything, but my pores do seen to be clear. The issue i have with this product are the pump and formulation. I would not say this product is a serum, its 100% a liquid, which makes it hard to apply to the face if not applied to a cotton pad first. If you’re going the cotton pad route, then there simply isn’t enough product to make it worth it. Would rate 5 stars if it came in came in the packaging and amount that the paulas choice exfoliation does. Dr. Jart+ Pore Remedy PHA “Serum”
