I felt sensitivity using this mask. So i checked the ingredients list.The  third item is propanediol. I found the following information about the elementAlthough propanediol is gentler than propylene glycol, it can still cause skin sensitivity, says Mian. A 2010 study also found that the possibility of skin irritation due to propanediol is minimal. However, its overall risk for skin reactivity is low, and side effects are uncommon.The 5th element is Caprylyl glycol as a humectant, meaning itâ€™s a substance that helps the skin retain water. It can cause irritation, though that is most likely to occur when used at a very high concentration. I am not sure the portion used in cicapair mask is safe or not as its the 5th element as per concentrationI am not using it anymore. Sensitivity
