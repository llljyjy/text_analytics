I received Clinique smart clinical repair wrinkle correcting cream free from Influenster and Clinique to try for a while then give my honest opinion of. I have to say that immediately my face felt and looked smoother. It made my skin unbelievably soft. I usually have a very prominent line between my eyebrows because I always, I guess scrunch them, but I have to say although this did not take it away it did make it a lot less prominent. Definitely smooth out around my eyes. Overall this worked really well in. Definitely smooth out around my eyes.
