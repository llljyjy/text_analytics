After using this soap for about a month, it’s more of a base soap. It’s not moisturizing at all; it feels how the Dr.Bronner’s castile soap feels after using it; super drying. It has a really soft smell nothing strong at all. I wouldn’t buy again but will use until it’s done. Could be more moisturizing!
