On par with other drunk elephant products! As usual, the packaging is adorable and feels nice in your hand. The dropper is easy to use and I haven’t experienced any issues with the seal.The retinol worked in my case. I experienced the normal skin purging after a few uses, and then my complexion cleaner. The addition of oil keeps the retinol from being too drying, though I’d still follow up with a moisturizer if you’re new to retinols. nan
