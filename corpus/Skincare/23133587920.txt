Best cleanser hands down. I have oily combo acne prone sensitive skin (a mess) and I absolutely love this. IMO it would be good for any skin type even on my dry winter or chemical peel days. Great foaming and you only need about a pea size. No residue leavs your skin soft. Iâ€™ve tried so many different cleansers but none have come close. Worth the money You should buy it
