I received this a sample from Influenster but omg this moisturizer is DELICIOUS. It’s creamy, absorbs quickly, and left my skin feeling hydrated all day. I do think it’s better suited for dry skin and as soon as the weather cools off and my face turns into the Sahara, I know I’ll be reaching for it. nan
