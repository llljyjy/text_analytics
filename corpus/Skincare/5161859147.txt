Kiehlâ€™s has to be one of my new favorite skin care brands as it has high quality ingredients and is perfect for even the most sensitive skin. This ultra facial cream is definitely no exception! Upon my first use of this product I was blown away by how hydrating it was but how lightweight it felt when applied to the skin. It melted in almost instantly and did not leave behind any sort of a greasy after feel, which is an issue I found with a lot of other ultra hydrating moisturizers. Not only does it feel great upon initial application, but it leaves my skin feeling moisturized and baby smooth for the entire day! Seriously such a great product and I also love that it has no distinct scent! Usually in the winter I struggle with really bad dry patches, specifically around my nose, but this product has been one of the only things that has kept that at bay and has overall improved the texture and appearance of my skin. I highly recommend this product to anyone and everyone, especially if you suffer with super dry flaky skin. This seriously works miracles and I will be gifting it to everyone I love this year! Holy grail!
