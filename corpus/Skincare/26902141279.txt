I have tried all brands and different types of sunless tan products. I have always been partial to tan luxe but was hesitant to purchase this product because of mixed reviews and the price tag. But holy moly, it does work! The next morning I had a dark, even, glowing tan! No other tanning product I have used has given me such a dark tan. In between uses, I use the tan luxe mousse. The price may be high, but it is worth it if you want a long lasting dark tan. best self tanner out there
