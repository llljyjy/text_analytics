I recently discovered this cleanser and I have to say, it’s amazing. It’s not too soapy and lathers so smoothly on to the skin. I love really hot showers and I feel like the steam opens up my pores. I’m not left with any redness or dryness. It’s been one of my favorite purchases all year. highly recommend!
