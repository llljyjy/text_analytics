I made an account just to review this product LOL. So I’ve been using this for the past 3 months and have been loving it! At first, I was combining it with a moisturizer right after and it made my eyes burn (products don’t get in, just fumes and/or scents). I got rid of the moisturizer and boom, burning all gone. However, although I love the product, the “hydration” isn’t very strong. But for me, I only need some hydration after a cleanse. The rest of the hydration, I leave it up to my body. TLDR: Long story short, it’s perfect for some and those who combine it with a light moisturizer. But on its own, not super strong. But I find it perfect as I have a more naturalistic approach to skin care Perfect for me, but not super strong “hydration”
