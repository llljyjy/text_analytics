I really enjoyed this vitamin C serum. I definitely noticed an improvement in my dark spots and redness discolouration from old acne spots. I do think it is a bit pricy for the size of the bottle however you only need one or two drops for the whole face. I like how bright and refreshed my skin looks nan
