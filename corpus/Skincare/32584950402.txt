I really like other Tula products like the moisturizer and cleanser. This one doesn’t impress me as much, maybe because it doesn’t seem as necessary in my every day routine. Pros: menthol cooling effect, perfect size for traveling, looks great on its own with no makeup, can even be used as a highlighter for cheekbones Cons: hard to blend with makeup- would end up taking my makeup off when worn on top of makeup and clumping near my lower lash line if worn underneath makeupOverall, I only end up using this when I am going without makeup! Perfect for a no makeup look
