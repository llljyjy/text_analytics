I will admit I do not use this every night. But when I do I see a slight change after a few minutes but when I wake up in the morning, I see a huge difference. I have an almost 3 year old and a 4 month old so sometimes I have those sleepless nights and wake up with dark eyes but when I use this cream, it refreshes me! I can only imagine if I used it everyday as recommended. So if you’re on the fence about this, it’s worth a try. I know everyone’s skin is different but give it a shot. Give it a try! It’s worth it.
