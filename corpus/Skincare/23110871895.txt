My gifted by Dermalogica Sampling daily microfoliant is a really great exfoliant, especially if you have sensitive skin.  After use there was some redness but no burning or tingling.  I use it as part of my facial routine and because it is so gentle it can be used daily, I love the smell of it and how soft it feels on my skin and as a result my skin looks brighter and feels smoother. Great product
