This is my first time trying out a retinol product. I’ve heard that you have to start off with a small amount because you might be sensitive and it takes time to get used to retinol. But with this product I had no sensitivity issues at all. You get a lot of product in the bottle and a little goes a long way. I didn’t take a before and after pic to compare. However, I will continue to use this product though because I feel like it does help my skin feel firm and helps reduce my wrinkles. I’m 41 and the little bit of wrinkles that I had aren’t noticeable anymore. Great product!
