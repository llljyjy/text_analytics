I want to start off by saying I am super pasty. Like shade 1 level pasty and this was the first fake tan that didn’t splotch somewhere on my skin. I usually used a mousse (from another brand) and even if I did all the works before I still would be a little splotchy somewhere! I’m guessing it’s because of how moisturizing this stuff feels on! Feels better than my favorite lotion. && it probably took me 4-5 minutes to put on which is insanely easy. 10/10, so moisturizing
