I saw a dermatologist I trust recommend this product, so I purchased it. This cream was fantastic, especially during the cold dry months. I loved that it had a whipped texture and was very nourishing. The applicator is nice because you press down on it to get out the portion to use. You donâ€™t have to dip your finger in and get the cream dirty. I would repurchase, but I wish it was just a little cheaper. Very Moisturizing, Fantastic!
