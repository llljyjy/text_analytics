What I love about this Retinol is that It absorbs quickly, it glides like butter, leaving a smoothing sensation right after. Retinol at night has been my bestie… I’ve been using it over two weeks now, every other night…my skin feels smoother and brighter! Consistency is the key and what like about this one it’s also that I didn’t experience any irritation or peeling the next day. I’ve sensitive skin and it works perfectly! my skin feels smoother and brighter!
