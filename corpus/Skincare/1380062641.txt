Two stars for moisture but this migrated to my eyes and burned. No matter how far down I applied or how little I used. Even after I wiped it off it still burned. I had to use eye drops and a cotton bud to clean out the inside of my lid.  Going back! And yes, I actually paid for this with my own money. Burns worse than sunblock!
