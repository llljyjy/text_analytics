I love herbivore. I circulate through all of the serums and oils depending on how my skin is acting. I love every product they make... except this one. don’t get me wrong, the texture it nice and light, absorbs quickly, brightens skin, and sits well under other products, but I just cannot tolerate the smell. I have other skin care products with tumeric and I love them. I drink raw tumeric and ginger tonic every morning for years, but this smells SO strongly I could not take it. My husband, daughter, and friends couldnt even stand next to me, they all said it smelled “gross“ and “dont use that anymore“. I am so thankful it was a sample and I didn’t spend money on it. if the scent doesnt bother you, it comes with amazing benefits, but its a hard pass for me. Can't get past the scent
