The cream is great and practically melts on to the skin! I also like the citrusy scent to it, it’s refreshing. Although I like how it feels on my skin, I wouldn’t recommend it to someone with very oily skin because it is a little on the heavier side.I received this product to try from influenster for free. Good for people with combo or dry skin
