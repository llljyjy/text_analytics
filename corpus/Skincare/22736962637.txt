I have been using this cream for over a week now.  I’m very impressed too!  I used it both morning and evening after cleansing and toning my face.  It has a very light pleasant scent that wasn’t overwhelming at all. Each morning my skin has a nice dewy sheen.  I will be purchasing this product when I run out of this very generous sample! A Definite Must Have For Me!
