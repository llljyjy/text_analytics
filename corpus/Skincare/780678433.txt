Product is good.  I use it nightly and it does a good job.  My issue is with the packaging.  How can a brand that markets itself as Clean use all this plastic.  Further, the pump stopped 10 days ago, implying I was out of product.  But I am not.  I have plenty left.  Two weeks and counting,  So the brand is hoping Iâ€™ll throw it away and buy more, using more plastic.  For this reason I will not buy again. OK product, way too much packaging
