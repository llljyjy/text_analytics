This is a must have item for all skin types. I have combination skin which can be difficult to find something hydrating enough but wonâ€™t leave my T zone oily. This product left my skin baby soft, plumped with hydration, and with a subtle glow. The product is thicker than a normal face moisturizer so a little does go a long way. I would recommend this to all skin types for the multi added benefits. Must have for daily routine
