I received ILIA CBeyond Triple Serum for free from pinchme in exchange for my honest opinion. First off I really like the container and the top that Dispenses the serum. Makes it super easy to use without wasting a bunch. To me it does have a light scent but goes away quick. I love how lightweight this serum is. And absolutely love the glow it leaves. Since I have been using I am starting to notice my skin tone seems to be evening out more. I find this to be pretty hydrating.I like to wear it alone but it does go great under my make up. I like it
