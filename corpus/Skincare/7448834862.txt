I don’t like wearing make up all the time and this is perfect for that. I do my regular skin care routine and put some of this on and it has spf 30 and evens out my skin tone/tones down the redness. Love it, I’m on my fourth jar! Goes on green and melts into the skin to match your skin color. staple product for me*
