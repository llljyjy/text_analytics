I got this from Influenster and was a little hesitant about it at first. I have oily skin and usually thick moisturizer doesn’t work for me. This is super this and creamy and smells like lemon balm. I was pleasantly surprised that it works really well with my face! It doesn’t make it overly oily. It moisturizes well and works well with my other products. I didn’t notice any pilling or anything! 10/10 would recommend! Surprisingly great
