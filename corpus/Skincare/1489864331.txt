This is my go-to travel moisturizer! I love the gel like formula after a day of sunbathing on my travels. I don’t use a serum when I travel so I love that my skin is getting everything it needs from this moisturizer. I use it at the end of the day when I’m going to bed after I washed my face. Perfect moisturizer after a day of sunbathing
