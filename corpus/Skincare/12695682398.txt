My last jar of this was slimey and gross. I think it had seperated. There was all this liquid that seperated from the produced and when I tried to pour it off the product fell from the jar in one gelatinous glob. I’ve used thus stuff for years and typically love it. I should have returned it immediately and got another, but I was all out. Won’t make that mistake again. Bad batch?
