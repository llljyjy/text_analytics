I use Kiehl’s avocado creamy eye treatment so I compared the Clarins treatment to that! The Clarins eye serum is much lighter and melts into skin better. It smells fantastic and is made with super high quality ingredients. You only need a TINY amount for each use. Overall I think it’s equal to if not a tad better than Kiehls! nan
