I am not someone with sensitive skin. I use intense actives every day and have no irritation but one week of this product and my skin barrier was destroyed. Over several days my skin got super dry (this is weird because I have oily skin), red, and irritated. Even my soothing moisturizer burned when I applied it. I stopped using this and my skin got better. I yet again tried this out (because I did not want to waste it and it was too late to return it), same reaction. It destroyed my skin barrier. I ended up throwing it in the trash. I know this works for some people but I recommend caution with this cleanser. Destroyed my skin barrier!
