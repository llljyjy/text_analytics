My skin is combination oily/dry. I wear glasses and so my nose tends to be in the oily side but my cheeks on the drier side. I have fine lines around my eyes, nose and mouth, which I try to minimize with wrinkle creams. This moisturizer has a very pleasant smell and light but effective moisturizing effect. After application, my skin felt very moisturizer and clean. I used this product about two weeks (I received a smaller size and that was all I had to use)-and in that time I didn’t really notice any visible difference in my fine lines. However, over time I did notice that my skin felt better moisturized—I had less issues with dryness. I would recommend this product for those with dry skin who are looking for a product to really moisturizer their skin. I received this sample for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Really moisturized my skin
