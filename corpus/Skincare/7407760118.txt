This is the only sunscreen that has not broken me out in irritated bumps/closed comedones (besides olay sensitive skin mineral spf15, 25+ years ago). I have extremely sensitive skin and the finish this sunscreen leaves is absolutely divine. I no longer use highlighter or flawless filter because it really does have a perfect glow with no other products. I did have problems with pilling initially, directly over a water based toner, but I now use a serum on top of the toner that somehow stopped the pilling and now it absorbs like a dream. When I did have pilling before, I just didnâ€™t have time to wait for layers to dry etc, but I noticed that rubbing in the pills more would just work the product into my skin and disappear.
