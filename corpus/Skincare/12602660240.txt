I have dry acne-prone skin with discoloration. I replaced my low dose retinol for this lactic acid in high hopes that it will brighten and shrink my pores.  This product is lightweight and easy to apply all over. I have noticed my pores are starting to shrink but I have experience over-exfoliation with dry/ flaky patches on my chin and cheeks. If you have dry skin I recommend cutting down to 1-2x a week. I have received this product for free from Influenster. Lightweight
