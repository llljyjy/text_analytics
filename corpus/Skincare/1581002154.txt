I received a sample of this product from Influenster for my honest review. Light weight eye cream. I love the gel texture and consistency of this eye cream. Now that summer is here, I prefer using skincare that is a gel consistency and light weight since I have extremely oily skin. I love how this eye cream feels on the skin. It’s refreshing. I noticed some brightening around my eyes after using it from the night before. Hopefully with continued use, it’ll help with my dark circles. nan
