Finally writing my review after continuous use for 2 months and I’m really happy with the fact that my sun spots from the summer have faded significantly and I don’t need to use 2 products like I did before this. I used to use a glycolic serum and a moisturizing sleep mask over it so i wouldn’t wake up with dry skin (I have combo/dry skin) my skin is smooth and moisturized in the morning. This is the best of both worlds and I’m actually saving money with just this one product. I like high end products and I’ll be getting another one when I run out. 2 months of continuous use
