This product feels thin and hydrating like a serum.  Goes on nice and thin, spreading for extra coverage with minimal product.  Doesn;t leave my skin feeling sticky or weird at all.  I just add it to my daily skincare routine and put it on after I put on my facial serum.  Really feel like this will be very beneficial in preventive care. Love the texture of the product
