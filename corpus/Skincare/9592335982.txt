My eyes are watering as I type this. I got a lux sample of this eye cream and every time I use it my eyes start burning and watering within about 20mins. I usually don’t have this problem with eye creams. It’s a very light, fluid feel on the skin and is designed to be also be used on the lips. I was hoping it would be rich in texture like the cream from this line. But the irritation makes it an absolute no for me. nan
