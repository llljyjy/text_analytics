The texture of the sunscreen is nice and feels good on the skin, but if you’re hoping for any evening out of skin tone, it doesn’t do much at all. The biggest fail here is the packaging. The printed on color on the bottle doesn’t stand up to being stored in a toiletry bag and flecks of lavender paint chips off everywhere, even sticking to your hands and face when you’re applying it. I don’t have time to pick pieces of peeling/chipping paint from my skin, so I tossed it out. Packaging a real problem
