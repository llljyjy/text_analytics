I really liked this moisturizing day & night cream. Iâ€™m always on the lookout for multi-use products and being able to incorporate this into both of my routines was great. I found that this cream left my skin feeling soft and hydrated. I think the lack of fragrance and other additives could potentially make this a good option for those with sensitive skin or fragrance sensitivities. I received this product from Influenster and Tula in exchange for my honest review. Awesome for my day and night skincare routines...
