I’m very surprised at how much is loving this gel moisturizer! I have combo skin and with the weather changing, this product ended up doing a great job at moisturizing enough for both days and also being used as a night cream. It sinks in well and doesn’t leave a heavy tacky feeling that’s noticeable. The only gripe I have is with the design of the jar. I noticed that it twist to open, but doesn’t twist all the way off. It twists about halfway and then you have to pull up on lid to completely remove it. I struggle every now and then, because I forget it doesn’t twist all the way off, which is different from other products, but does take an extra few seconds to remove. I did receive this product complimentary from Laneige in exchange for my review. This did not sway my opinion, but I am very thankful for the opportunity to try this moisturizer. nan
