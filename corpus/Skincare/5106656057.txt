I LOVE Belif products. They are my go to for skincare and I have repurchased so many times. However this just wasn’t for me. I agreed with the claims that it leaves no white cast but I didn’t find it to be hydrating which is what I was hoping for. It may work great for someone with more normal to oily skin. May Be Better for You
