I received this Kiehl’s Fast-Release Wrinkle Reducing Night Serum for free in exchange for my honest opinion. I have to say it’s slow working but once you’ve tried it for about 2 weeks you start noticing results , before you start take a picture of before and after and you can compare how well this works. When you apply the serum is fast observing it feels like a tight squeeze on your face like a facelift .My face feels so soft and plumped and my wrinkles are actually blending in specially the ones by the mouth and forehead . Give this Serum time to work and you will definitely see the results.The picture speaks louder than words. It works but give it time.
