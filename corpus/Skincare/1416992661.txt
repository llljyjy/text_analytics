Easy to use very little pay off. I really wanted to love this product after receiving it from Influenster. The color is amazing and melted into my skin. The bottle however is inconsistent. When you pump very little comes out. Though it evens out the skin and leaves a glow the coverage is light. Using the product over a few weeks I never noticed a change that would validate the vitamin C benefits. Itâ€™s a nice product but not worth an investment nan
