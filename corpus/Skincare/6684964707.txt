Let me first start by saying if you are looking for a clean product that doesn’t break out combination skin, with the perfect balance of moisture this is it. I hate seeing all the reviews that is smells bad. It’s a clean product great for sensitive skin. Who needs a face cream that smells good if it does exactly what it’s intended for plus more. It’s a face cream not a perfume, get over it lol! I use the gel during the day since I tend to get more oily, and the cream at night to help balance my combo sometimes more dry skin! Please don’t change formula it’s perfect! Amazing for sensitive skin that needs moisture
