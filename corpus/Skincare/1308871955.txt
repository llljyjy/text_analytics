This is a great skin peel especially for beginners who don’t know how much product to use with other peels. As always take precautions with peels, and always avoid eye area! It will leave it super sensitive if you apply it there. Also don’t use this if you have plans to go somewhere, you do lightly peel!! Use only once a week/2 weeks when starting out. Way too strong to use twice a day. I only use it as an occasional treatment after acne has healed and marked my face to remove those spots. Does a great job! Great skin peel!
