The Milk Makeup Hydro Ungrip Makeup Removing Balm definitely does what it says it will! As the first cleanse of a double cleanse skin regimen I think it does a great job of taking the first layer of makeup off. It feels fresh and does not have a fragrance, great for those who are extra sensitive to smells and products with fragrance. The size of the product is great as well! Good bang for your buck! Overall, Iâ€™d recommend!! A great cleanser!
