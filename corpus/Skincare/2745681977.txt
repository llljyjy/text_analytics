I enjoyed this as an every day moisturizer that I would opt for if I’m staying inside or even as a lightweight moisturizer for the nighttime. I definitely prefer this one over the day cream with SPF in it! The scent wasn’t too overpowering and my makeup sat very well on top of this! Overall I would recommend :). Really enjoyed this!
