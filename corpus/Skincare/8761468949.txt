I really enjoy the consistency of this product. The product is scented but quite light smell and has not aggravated my skin. My skin felt great did see my skin wasn’t as dull. It’s not too heavy in conjunction with my moisturizer.  After using this product for a few weeks i have noticed my skin feels firmer and more hydrated. My skins tone and texture have improved and it wears really nicely under makeup. nan
