This is a lightweight oil that goes on easily, doesn’t feel heavy whatsoever and preps my skin nicely for application of moisturizer. Yes, there’s a light scent but this product is made of *sativa seed oil*. As a result, well, it smells kind of like hemp. But it isn’t strong at all. I’ve finished multiple bottles of this oil over the past couple of years and will continue to repurchase. lightweight, versatile product, great base product
