I’ve tried so many different brands of retinol and I’ve never been extremely impressed with the results. Most of the time they ended up irritating my skin, causing peeling or a rash. One brand actually gave me chemical burns on my neck. Not only have I had zero irritation but, with Kiehl’s Fast Release Retinol Serum, I’ve actually seen positive results. I have an annoying dark spot on my left cheek that nothing has helped fade...until now. I’ve seen significant fading, I’d say it’s about 60% lighter so far, after about 4 weeks of continuous use. I love the innovative technology when it comes to this serum’s packaging.  Being able to mix the actives right before use instead of having them sit on a shelf until purchased is genius and it’s what I believe has led to such great results. It was also fun to mix, like a little science experiment!  I will say that this is not at all a moisturizing formula so,  I’ve been applying the serum, letting it fully absorb, then adding a moisturizing night cream on top and that has been a winning combo. I also love that you can see the level of serum left through the side “window“ which I assume was intended to let you watch your ingredients mix but,  I like knowing when to order ahead of time.  Overall,  I could not be happier with this serum and I’m excited to see this dark spot vanquished!  Well done,  Kiehls! The Best Ever!
