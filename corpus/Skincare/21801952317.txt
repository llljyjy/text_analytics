Definitely not worth buying unless your avid about shaving outside of the shower. It made my legs feel really oily, wet, and slippery which I really didn’t like. I had to get in the shower to wash of the film which totally made this product pointless since it’s supposed to help you save water. However it did help give a smooth shave which I did like. I would t use this again but I see the idea behind it. nan
