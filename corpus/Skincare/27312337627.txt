I received this moisturizer for free from Topbox to try it  and give my honest review. Love love love this moisturizer. Goes on very smooth and doesn’t feel sticky afterwards. There is a slight scent to it but it’s not too overwhelming. It is a thick consistency but it melts into the skin and it helps it stay hydrated. I’m 36 with sensitive and dry skin. I use this daily I’m happy to have added it to my skincare routine.So I totally recommend the product! Cashmere moisturizer
