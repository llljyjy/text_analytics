I have never tried a product with lactic acid before. I went to the Shani Darden Tiktok page to make sure I used this properly because I wasnt sure how to use it. As per the video it is recommended to use this product at night after you wash your face but before moisturizer. It has a thin consistency but it is not watery. You can apply this product with your hands make sure not yo You can apply this product with your hands make sure you donâ€™t get too close to the eyes to avoid irritation. Allow this product to stay on your face for five minutes (no need to rinse as it works overnight) before applying your favorite moisturizer. I have been using this product for about two months and delayed my review to give the product a chance. At first I had some minor breakouts, I think that was because this was helping clean my pores. As this is an exfoliating serum. After the first week I really started to notice my skin improving and glowing. I would definitely recommend this to others. Glowy and Showy
