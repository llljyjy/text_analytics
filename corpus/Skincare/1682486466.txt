I’ve used all of these products in their full size but absolutely love the minis for travel.  I’m a nurse so that means i’m always dehydrated and my skin suffers for it.  So in the middle of a long day I love to do a quick self care session on a break and moisturize my face.  The packaging is great and the set is exactly what you need if you just want to try the products out, you won’t regret it! Perfect for a quality on-the-go pick me up!
