I have combo skin and my cheeks get super dry in the winter. Ever since I started using this moisturizer my skin feels so moisturized and soft throughout the whole day. This was definitely a splurge but I love it. I think if you’re on a budget this is not the item for you, but if you want to splurge on yourself go for it. I wish I could take off half a star because the packaging is not my favorite. The letters get messed up after light handling. It really doesn’t bother me that much, but I do think the packaging should be better for something this expensive. Other than that, this is an amazing moisturizer. A Good Splurge
