I had a worse acne breakout this F/W year. And it is surely because of my unhealthy diet. So I am grateful to try this cream as I had spent a fortune looking for the right product to clear my acne. A week review without any makeup or other products on my forehead to see if it dries out my acne AND IT DID! The cream is not heavy and it doesnâ€™t feel oily after applying. I only add it on my night skin care routine. I definitely recommend this! It's killing my acne and I love it!
