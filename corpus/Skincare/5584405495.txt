I never expected to love this serum as much as I do! I have been using it 1-2 times per day for weeks on my face & neck and it provides the boost if hydration my skin craves especially in the winter. It doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. I appreciate the volume of product in the bottle so I don’t feel guilty using extra for my neck. The bottle and dropper are functional, the viscosity of the serum is perfect - not too thin, not too thick and such a pretty blue. I will continue to use this product! Thank you Biossance & Influenster for providing it for free for testing purposes! It’s the saving sharks for me
