I’ll start with the good first. I love the fresh, clean, almost herb-y scent of this. It’s mild and feels so nice and creamy going on my skin. It literally feels comforting. My skin does feel moisturized and not tight after washing, and it seems to do pretty well at taking off mascara. Sadly though the only thing I really noticed after 3 weeks of regular use I only noticed that the redness is my cheeks had improved slightly. NOW for the bad....this bottle is absolutely horrible and will definitely keep me from purchasing. It’s horrible. Heavy glass will keep you from knowing how much product is left...and WHO wants to put a GLASS BOTTLE in their shower?!?!?!? Also, the product pump is ridiculously short, which makes it impossible to just pump out into your hand without tilting the bottle at a 90 degree angle! Extremely frustrating once the product dwindles down. Also, I have to pump this thing FOURTEEN times to get out the little amount of cleanser that is needed! No one should have to work that hard for literally a dime sized amount of cleanser. Very, VERY poor design. Packaging is going to keep me from buying
