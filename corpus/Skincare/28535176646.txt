Used this cream twice a day and started noticing slightly smoother skin after about a week of use. No irritation, no weird chemicals that caused my skin to break out as is the case with so many products within these types of products. I highly recommend it as it is an amazingly clean moisturizer and leaves the skin soft to the touch. Great skin care
