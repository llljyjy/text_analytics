I received this complimentary from hanni. I was kinda skeptical at first, but it works. There is definitely a learning curve with using this razor. In the shower it was fine and the pillow cream is nice and makes my skin feel soft. I used it without water but still used the pillow cream, I got razor burn. I like the design of the product.
