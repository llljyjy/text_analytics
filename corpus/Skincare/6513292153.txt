I have combination skin and tend to get acne around the time of the month and no cap this stuff keeps me from breaking out, I’m so glad I tried this! it’s very thick but u only need a little bit for your whole face! Paired with seaberry oil *chef’s kiss* super moisturizing for dry and acne prone skin!
