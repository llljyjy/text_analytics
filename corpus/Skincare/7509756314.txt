Omg i got the sample of it and its so rich and thick even though i have a combination skin, and i get break out on tons of different moisturizers which are even slightly thick, whereas, this one suited me so well. It gave my tretinoin treated skin so much hydration and silky softness. I want to buy this but the price is too high. I hope one day i am able to get it. In love with this ever since i tried the sample!
