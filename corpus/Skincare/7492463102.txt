I’d actually given up on finding the right eye cream until I discovered this one. I tried the face serum of the same line, but it didn’t work well for me. I’m so glad I gave this a chance anyway. I’ve only been using it for 2 weeks, and I’ve already seen the finest lines diminished while the deeper ones are a little less pronounce. Finally I’ve found an eye cream that actually moisturizes. The tone of the skin looks a bit more even as well. I really hope the results continue like this. Still in the early stages
