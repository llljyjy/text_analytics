AMAZING!!!! I wanted to step away from the tanning mousses during winter and go for something that was less time consuming. THIS IS IT!!! I freaking love the colour pay off, it looks sooo natural but it goes quite dark! I also love the fact that it’s a spray so if i miss spots I literally just re-apply and wait a couple hours and i’m good to go! I highly recommend this product! definitely 10/10! NEW FAVOURITE
