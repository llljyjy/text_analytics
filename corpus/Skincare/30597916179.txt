I received this product for free from @Influenster and @TheInkeyList in exchange for my honest review. I have normal but sensitive skin. Thid did not irritate or dry out my skin. My skin remained moisturized. I would not give it five stars because a little does not go a long way. My initial application had to be a lot. Other than that itâ€™s good. No strong smell! nan
