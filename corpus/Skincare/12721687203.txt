When I first used the Glow-On Shot Serum, I didnâ€™t love the way it made my skin feel oily. However, since I started applying a smaller amount and using it repeatedly, I have definitely seen some improvement in my skin. I love using this products in the morning and then applying my regular facial moisturizer afterward. I would definitely recommend! nan
