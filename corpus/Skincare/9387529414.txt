I really liked this product, but i did feel that it was a bit oily for use during the summer. My skin tends to be on the greasier side when it’s hot out, so this was a bit heavy for the season. However, it sat well under my makeup and kept my face protected from the sun. I wore it for an afternoon at the beach and it did the trick! It’s also the perfect size to throw in my purse. This will definitely be a winter staple for me. nan
