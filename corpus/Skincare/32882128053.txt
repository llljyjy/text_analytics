I had the opportunity to try this product out, and after a few weeks of use, I found that my skin stayed well hydrated and the look of very fine lines were somewhat reduced on my forehead. To be honest, the improvement for the fine lines wasnâ€™t absolutely dramatic, but I did  notice an overall firming up my skin after using this product. I am planning on purchasing this again in the future, and I have a feeling that with continued use over multiple weeks the wrinkle reducing benefits will be even more pronounced.
