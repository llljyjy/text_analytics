I really like this serum! It has a nice orange scent (took a second to get used to!), doesn’t irritate my skin (mildly sensitive and prone to milia), and leaves me with a nice glow! I’ve used it for about 6 months and have gone through about two bottles, but I’m trying a new brand to see if the results are more noticeable. Overall, I’m happy to buy again! nan
