I bought this product kind of a whim because it was so cheap, but I am so surprised at how well it works! This has become one of my favorite and most reliable acne treatment products! Very effective spot treatment without drying out your skin too much. Sometimes when I am really breaking out, I put it all over my face and then put a good moisturizer on top. My skin always looks better in the morning after that! A Surprise Treasure!
