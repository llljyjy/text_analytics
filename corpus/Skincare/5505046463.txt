If you’re looking to buy this razor with the hopes that it’s going to magically make the hairs on your legs grow slower, you’re going to be disappointed because that’s not possible for any razor to do. I’ve seen several false claims that by shaving with this razor you won’t have to shave as frequently and that’s just not true. With that being cleared up, I can move on to all of the pros of this razor. The environmental benefit and ability to shave outside of the shower is what first drew me to this razor and on both counts I’m pleased. While the shave pillow does clump up a bit under the razor when shaving outside of the shower, it can be cleaned relatively easily and the capability alone far outweighs the con of having to clean it. I use regular body wash in the shower with this razor and don’t have the same issue. I get a nice clean shave as good as the 5-bladed Gillette razor I used to use so I was very pleased. The learning curve was very minimal - just be mindful when you’re using it and remind yourself not to apply any pressure and you’re good. When I’m shaving certain parts under my leg when I can’t just let the weight of the razor do its job and instead I have to hold it against my leg, I do it just enough so that it slides gently along my leg and it still works just fine. No cuts thus far and I shave at almost my usual pace (though I did start very slowly at first because I was nervous). The cost point for blades is also a major plus. $6 for five blades instead of $30+ for a pack of six 5-bladed heads when both will probably last me about the same amount of time is a great deal and will cost me less in the long run despite the higher price for this initial setup. 10/10 I would recommend this razor. And for reference, I have very dark, course leg hairs. Not magic, but good
