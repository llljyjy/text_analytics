Oh wow. That is so refreshing. Smells like fresh orange blossoms. You know that sensation when you walk past orange blossoms or mock orange blossoms and you get that beautiful whiff of that fragrant scent? Thatâ€™s the same sensation you get with this but with a hint of peaches. Freshly spritzed in an orange dream.
