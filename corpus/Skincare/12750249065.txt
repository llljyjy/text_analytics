This toner is really hydrating! I use very drying prescription acne products and using this right after I wash my face really helps seal in moisture. I love that I can’t put this on really quickly and you don’t need too much of it for your whole face. A few drops is enough. And it smells amazing, reminds me of boba tea! Very hydrating!
