The Biossance Squalane + Vitamin C Rose moisturizer is an excellent product and I would definitely recommend it to others. The formula is not too thick or thin with a silky, smooth like consistency that glides easily across your skin. It doesn’t leave a greasy residue either and my skin soaked it up right away, leaving my face feeling refreshed and highly moisturized. I have combination skin that is oily in some areas and dry in others so I have a really hard time finding the right product that will actually treat both and doesn’t leave my skin feeling overly greasy but this moisturizer cream does the trick. It also has a nice floral scent of rose that isn’t overpowering and actually smells very nice. I’m glad I was able to try it out because it’s now become a staple in my skin care routine and I will definitely be buying it again! A little bit goes a long way so you only need to use about a dime sized amount on your skin, which is more than enough and means it will last for quite a long time. Overall, this is an excellent product and the only complaint that I have is the high price point which is more than I would typically like to pay or spend on a moisturizer cream but to me personally this product is absolutely worth the price. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. Excellent moisturizer for combination skin
