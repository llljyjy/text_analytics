This is the best face moisturizer I have ever used and I’ve tried hundreds. It causes zero sensitivity and helps with redness. It’s clearing my skin especially blackheads and healing scars. I’m so thankful it is fragrance free as I am very allergic. The only slight smell for the first 10 seconds of application is of shea butter which I love and does wonders for skin. Also, this doesn’t burn eyes or turn them red so that’s a miracle in itself. If you have highly reactive skin, I definitely recommend trying this moisturizer. Best Moisturizer Ever
