I love this cleanser! It may seem expensive but it’s sooo worth it. I have deep cystic painful acne and little bumps on my forehead. Within using this cleanser over one night I noticed a decrease in the bumps and the cystic acne was drying up. I’ve tried all kinds of face cleansers and I used to love the Acne Cetaphil Cleanser but it does not compare to this one. This cleanser is gentle and will not dry you out completely but does clear your skin! MUST HAVE FOR CYSTIC ACNE!
