I don’t wear a lot of foundation or other makeup but this cleanser is absolutely great for me. You don’t even need to use a lot to wash your face and it leaves your skin so clean and smooth, plus it smells good. I used to have sensitive skin with occasional breakouts that leaves marks behind but after using Omega+ Complex Cleansing Balm product I can’t believe how much my skin has improved. The texture of this product is light. grate
