This is an elevated version of your favorite basic moisturizer. It’s a pretty simple gel cream, but it has a surprisingly luxurious texture and sinks in very nicely - it doesn’t sit on top of your skin (it’s not occlusive at all), so it may not be enough for drier skin as a night cream on its own. However, that does make it a great hydrating day cream that sits well under makeup. My skin is normal to dry and I feel this cream is an excellent non-irritating hydrator, virtually scent free and overall plain (in a good way). It’s definitely smoothed out some of the flakiness I’ve been experiencing due to a reaction from another product. I like this a lot, but I’m rating 4 stars due to its price and inability to stand alone as a night cream. It’s very solid overall, and if you have the money to spend I do recommend this cream. Plain, effective, expensive
