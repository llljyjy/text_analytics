I really liked this cream. It’s hydrating but doesn’t leave my skin greasy at all. Living in Florida with the humidity this is really important to me. It doesn’t have a strong scent at all so it’s great for anyone. I really like that it’s vegan friendly and cruelty free. It works great as a base for makeup because it blurs your pores. I have huge pores and I definitely noticed a difference. I would definitely recommend it. nan
