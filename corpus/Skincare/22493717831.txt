Bought this a year ago for around $10, I was shocked to see that the price has almost doubled since then. This is not a good serum! It has had no effect on my skin and for them to double the price is so crazy to me… it feels nice going on and didn’t have a negative effect on my skin which is why I gave it 2 stars, but totally not worth it if you’re looking for a serum that actually provides noticeable results Double the original price for the same formula
