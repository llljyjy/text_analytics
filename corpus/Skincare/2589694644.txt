I tried the Algenist Triple Algae Eye Rewenal Balm With Multi-Peptide Complex. My under eye skin immediately felt more hydrated after applying. I have pretty intense dark circles and this product has actually slowly started to make a little bit of a difference. I’ve been looking for something like this for a while now. I just wish it wasn’t so expensive. I got little pre portioned packets for each day. I’d like to buy the original full size container, but it looks very small, and seems very expensive for the size. Otherwise I’d definitely add it to my skin care. Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm
