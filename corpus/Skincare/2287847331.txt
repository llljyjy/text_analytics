I’m always looking for good skincare products to add to my oily/ acne-prone regimen, and this was the perfect mask. It’s not over drying or irritating, it has a nice warming sensation while on my face, and my skin felt wonderful after applying it. I enjoy that it’s not a peel mask, and that I can just wash it off. I have sensitive skin, and this didn’t cause any reactions at all. It helped minimize pores and smooth some of my problem texture areas. I would say that if you don’t like products that have a tingle or warming aspect, you may not like this. Great for oily skin
