I am a huge fan and long-term user of IT Cosmetics. I was super excited to try this meltaway balm. I know using this product also helps my skin and a safe to use. This product works amazingly. You literally just rub it on your face and the makeup melts away. It is made with vitamin C and rosehip oil. This works well on waterproof makeup. You will need to rinse off this product after use. It works like a mask just leave it on for 10 minutes after rubbing it on. Innovative
