Love the smell, very light texture BUT I had higher expectations and was disappointed. Product states it is very hydrating and honestly it’s not, for me at least. Been using this for two week along with the serum that goes with this cream and my face feels even dryer then it was before I started using this duo. My forehead is flaky…. Really wanted to love this. Ok, not great
