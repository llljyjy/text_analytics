A very nice feeling in comparison to other oils, leaves a velvet feeling but not greasy. The final result is so natural, I love it! Buildable in the sense that you can control the deepness of your tan depending on how many drops you use. I used 5 drops and achieved the perfect tan on my face and neck. I like that it doesnâ€™t enhance pores the way other tanners have on my face in the past. Definitely my new go to! BEST FACE TANNER
