I got this as the free birthday gift. This product is definitely not for everybody. I breakout easily and the oily finish of this moisturizer does not help with my acne. It is also pretty fragranced and honestly doesn’t smell great. The only reason I am giving this 2 stars is because it feels nice and dewy and smooth when putting it on. I prefer the Laneige water bank moisture cream or Kiehl’s ultra facial cream instead of the Tatcha one for sure! somewhat overrated
