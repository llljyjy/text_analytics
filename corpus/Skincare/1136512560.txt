My skin looked and felt hydrated after using this product. I didn’t notice any immediate results? I didn’t see any noticeable improvement with my fine lines and wrinkles, but the hydration was evident. The cream is light and smoothe and felt cool on my skin. I would recommend it to others who are looking for hydrated and glowing skin. For a noticeable aging prevention solution, I would not recommend, however, dryness and aging tend to go hand-in-hand.
