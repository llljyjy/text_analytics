For context, I’ve been using this moisturizer all summer. I purchased the mini watermelon moisturizer and have used almost the entire bottle. I have dry, sensitive, acne prone skin and I had tried different creams and such to bring moisture back to my skin but nothing was really working. I use 1-1.5 pumps of this moisturizer twice daily and it has made a huge difference in my skin texture. Before I had patches of dryness which affected my foundation application but not anymore. Yes it’s a gel moisturizer so it’s not a heavy moisturizer but it does compliment other products, NO pilling when used with other products and my skin is more glowy now! Highly recommend I will be repurchasing once I run out and will be trying other Glow Recipe products. Amazing light moisturizer for dry sensitive skin
