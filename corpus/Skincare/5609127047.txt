I have been using Kiehl’’s Fast Release Retinol Serum for 3 weeks now and I love it. My wrinkles look less noticeable and it seems to even my skin tone which is a plus. It is very hydrating and moisturizing. There is a slight smell but it isn’t a deal breaker. I love the bottle because of the built-in pump. You can pump out as much or as little as you need. Mine was a little runny, but it sure did make it easy to smooth onto my skin. This product is paraben and fragrance free and I didn’t have any issues with stinging or irritation. I would definitely recommend this serum and will continue to use it in my nighttime routine. This product is a little pricey but because you use so little I think it is worth it! Gentle serum with no irritation from the retinol
