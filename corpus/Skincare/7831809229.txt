I received this complimentary through Influenster and these were just what I needed! You can tell they’re potent, they give my skin a very slight tingling effect, but don’t burn at all. My skin feels smoother almost instantly after using, and I’ve noticed a few blemishes clearing up as well. They do leave my skin feeling a tad dry, but as long as you follow up with a good moisturizer, it isn’t a problem at all. Instant Smoothing
