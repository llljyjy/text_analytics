The cream is really thick and luxurious. A little goes a VERY long way! It helped depuff my eye area instantly, but I think it will take a while before it reduces fine lines. I do think it helps to make the eye area feel more strong and resilient. I really enjoy whipped textures and feel like I got my moneyâ€™s worth. Great eye repair cream!
