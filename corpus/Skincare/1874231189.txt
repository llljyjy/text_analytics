I was so happy when I got this because I’m almost out of my first bottle. I only use it once a day (you’re supposed to use it twice) and it’s been 5 months and I’m still not done with it so it lasts a while! I use it as part of a whole skincare routine with a bunch of other products/brands so it’s hard to tell if this alone is giving me results but my skin isn’t worse, it feels smooth after I use it and I don’t break out from it so I’ll likely keep buying! Definitely recommend, although it does have a strong scent so if you don’t like that I’d say skip it. The smell doesn’t bother me but I could do without it or less of it. I received this free from influenster and shiseido for my honest review A staple in my routine
