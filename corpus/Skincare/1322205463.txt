Yikes. This felt like straight tar I was slathering on my face. Doesn’t spread/emulsify. It did actually did a really good job taking makeup off as I had no residue on my face towel but I didnt have that clean feeling after since this is so heavy. I only bought this to travel with and definitely not a product I’d buy again. heavyweight
