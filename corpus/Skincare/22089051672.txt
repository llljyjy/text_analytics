Korres Santorini Grape Poreless Skin Cream became an instant fave the first time I tried it! I received a complimentary sample from Influenster & Korres. This product does everything it says! I have combination skin that’s very dry during the winter months. I absolutely love the consistency of this product. It goes on as a cream & then feels almost gel like. It really penetrates your skin, hydrating & plumping it up. My skin was hydrated all day! My makeup went on flawlessly after priming my skin with this cream. I was in awe!  My pores are visibly smaller & my skin feels tighter, but not uncomfortable, still very soft & smooth! I noticed a difference in my skins tone & texture as well! I will absolutely be recommending this product to anyone who’s looking to add something new & good to their skin care regimen! I’ll be purchasing more once I’m finished with this bottle. Thank you so much #Influenster & #Korres! They nailed it again, another amazing skin care product! I absolutely love this brand!! Absolutely love it!
