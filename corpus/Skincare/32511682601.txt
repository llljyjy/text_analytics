The “Clearly Corrective“ Dark Spot Solution by Kiehl’s is an amazing way to lighten discoloration of skin on the face! It is my new favorite product, as it has worked wonders for the overall appearance of my skin. I made sure to use the serum exactly as directed, over a period of 12 weeks. This is a product that requires usage over a long period of time before seeing results: however, I was certainly not disappointed with my experience. The serum is clear, it has a semi-thick consistency, & pleasant fragrance which doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin at all. It absorbs fairly quickly and seems to greatly reduce my old acne scars, hyperpigmentation and red marks/rosacea. The skin texture seems smoother, and the actual tone of the marks seem lighter. I also enjoy the natural elements of ingredients in this serum, like White Birch. I’d highly recommend this to anyone looking for a way to reduce any kind of spots or discoloration. It’s worked better than other products I’ve tried in the past. Overall, I’d give it 4 out of 5 stars - I just wish it was at a more affordable price point. (I received this item for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.) Absolutely Fantastic Spot Correcting Serum!
