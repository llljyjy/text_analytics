I’m giving this review based on what I was provided through Clarins and Influenster. I was given a 7 day trial of the product though I know often it takes longer than 7 days to truly see how well skincare works. So that being said, I have to review it based on what it did do in 7 days, which I admittedly have noticed no difference in my under eyes. It has a very light, clean smell and it sat tacky on the skin but did eventually absorb in. I had no irritation. But I can’t recommend spending the money on the product based on the amount I received to review it. nan
