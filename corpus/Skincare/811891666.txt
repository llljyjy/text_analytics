This cream cleanser is very nice. it has a mild scent, goes on easily and manages to make my face feel clean but not stripped. It doesn’t remove heavy makeup the first time and is pricey compared to some other cleansers that work as well soI’m deducting a star. But a definite must have in my arsenal. nan
