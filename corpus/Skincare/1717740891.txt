It has a terrible gritty texture, like it has some tiny exfoliants that feel like sand paper on the skin. You won’t feel that awful texture until you actually put it on your face. Is it infused with a diamond dust? I saw other reviewers pointed it out but I couldn’t find what causes it...In the morning I smell a tanning lotion scent on my face, hand that applied and pillow. It left stains on the pillow (that thankfully washed off). I had to retrace my steps from the night before to eliminate a possibility that I might have mistakenly applied a self tanning lotion because I smelled like it.Can anyone tell me why it smells like a tanning lotion and the weird sandy texture, please???No good :-( Don't buy it
