This product does an excellent job removing makeup.  Easy to use. Does no harm to your skin.  No pushing our pulling.  It did however, leave a bit of a residue on my skin after cleansing. Others may not mind the feeling but I am very particular with the way my facial skin feels. Does exactly what it says it will!
