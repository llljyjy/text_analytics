i have issues with kp and ingrowns and this has been a game changer for me. plastic razors have always irritated my skin and give me lots of ingrowns and not as close a shave. You do have to use this differently than your regular plastic razor, but it’s nothing crazy!First, you want to make sure the you angle the razor and that the blade is touching the skin as you are shaving, otherwise you’re not shaving. I think maybe this is why ppl are not getting a close shave.Two, it does get gunky, so make sure you rinse it as you go and use it. just like you normally would.At the beginning, i did start slow and shaved in sections/short strokes until I got the hang of it. I don’t find that it takes any more time than shaving with a plastic razor.Also, love that you can shave with the shave pillow outside of the shower. I wear glasses and can’t always see behind my legs/ankle area, so it’s been great shaving on the couch with proper lighting. The best dermaplanning/shave ever!!!
