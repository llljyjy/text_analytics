I’m extremely picky about my skincare products because I do get irritated and red easily. This product actually lived up to my expectations. The very first time I used it, the following morning I actually noticed a decrease in the redness of my cheeks! I was expecting not to notice right away but I did! It didn’t make me any more irritated either. I’m also really dry so this added a nice layer of moisture. Overall, a high quality product. My only issue is there is silicon in this so you can’t wear it under makeup without it pilling. nan
