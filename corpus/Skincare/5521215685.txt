I did not like this product at all. I received this complimentary from Influenster, and I’ve never tried Diors products so I was super excited! It was very drying, made me break out and the scent smelled like old woman. I don’t typically have sensitive skin so this product definitely had something in it that my skin didn’t agree with. Very drying
