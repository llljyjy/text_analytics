I love this product so much, it calms my super sensitive skin and works wonders on my rosacea. If I go one day without it, I can definitely notice the difference. It has a watery jelly consistency, no smell and dries super fast. I have a super simple skin care regimen,  I apply this and a moisturizer after and it makes my skin feels great. Such a great product at this price point is a win! nan
