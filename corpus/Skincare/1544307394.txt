Vitamin C is an antioxidant, excellent for your skin.  (Read about it.)  This is a form that retains its strength because it’s in powder form.  You only need a tiny amount mixed with your choice (I rotate between hyaluronic acid by The Ordinary and a couple by Inkey or when feeling lazy just skip to lotion or pure Vitamin E).  I have no concerns about pilling, sensitivity or other complaints.  (How much are these people using?)  It’s definitely a keeper.  Yes brightening and clean.  I’m 46 with clear skin except for hormonal (monthly) expected acne.  I look quite a bit younger, and hope to stay that way.  Highly recommend. Definitely a keeper.
