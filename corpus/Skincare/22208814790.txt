I have really dry skin and sometimes during really cold weather it will get more dry and become almost itchy especially around my fingers. I used this and it works better than any lotion I use. After almost 2 weeks I notice my skin is more hydrated and doesnâ€™t feel as dry as it did before. Highly recommend! Works Great
