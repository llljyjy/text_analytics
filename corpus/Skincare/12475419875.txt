I love this serum!! It feels so nice whenever I apply it onto my skin. I use this along with their salicylic acid cleanser & hyaluronic acid serum (am using Vichy’s hyaluronic serum now). Every product that I’ve purchased from the Inkey List has been a winner for me! The only con I would say that may bother other people is the packaging as the residue from the Niacinamide tends to go all over the cap of the bottle & leaves a white residue. It doesn’t bother me, but may be something to think about when purchasing. Love It!
