This is the kind of product that you must use consistently in order to see results. I have been using for almost 2 weeks, and I like the way it makes my skin feel. It is lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin. I do believe that it has softened the “11” lines between my forehead. It feels super hydrating as well. I will continue to use it, and if it continues soften the lines between my eyes, it is worth the hefty price tag. I would repurchase in the future. So Far So Good
