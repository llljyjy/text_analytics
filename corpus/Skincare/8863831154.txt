I have incredibly sensitive and dry skin, so finding a moisturizer that both works and doesn’t result in a rash can be really difficult - especially finding one that has clean ingridients. Farmacy products are always a win for me though and this moisturizer in particular is fantastic. My skin instantly feels plumper and feels more hydrated. I use it daily, especially at night and my skin has never looked better. I will say it’s quite pricey, but a little goes a long way. I find it also works quite well under makeup, as long as you let it dry first. Amazing Moisturizer
