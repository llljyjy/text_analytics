Estée Lauder’s Revitalizing Supreme crème provides locked in moisture that is not heavy and is long lasting. I’m in my early 40s with oily sensitive skin that can easily break out. This crème is ideal for daily use because it provides hydration without looking oily on my already oily skin. A lovely new moisturizer
