I received this #freeproduct from #trytopbox in exhange for my honest review. All product I received to try specially skincare i have to use them for quite some time before i can actually give my honest review. I have been using this product for 3weeks now. I can say that this product give me an intense hydration and it’s visible just few minutes after applying the product, my skin absorbs this product quickly, has a natural fragrance which i love. With regards my fine lines I can’t say much because I haven’t seen much results on that part but i do understand and know that it will take time and a bottle of this product wont make it miraculously disappear maybe with constant and long term use. Would recommend to those who have the same skin type as mine dry/sensitive. i love the elegant packaging the president print in box give me a antique vibe i love that. great for intense hydration
