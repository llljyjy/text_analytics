I have very dry skin and am using Tretinoin cream as prescribed by my dermatologist for hormonal acne.  This moisturizer is amazing!  A little goes a long way, but it is very hydrating and I did not feel that it was greasy at all.  It absorbed into my skin quickly and left my face refreshed and glowing!  The lavender scent was nice and not too strong. Will definitely purchase on my next order!
