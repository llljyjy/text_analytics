I typically prefer my eye cream packed with as many anti-aging ingredients as possible but I was sucked into trying this cream by the stellar reviewsâ€”and it is definitely worth it! It helps keep my under eye concealer looking fresh all day long. My 42 year old eyes still need the big guns eye cream at night but if I am wearing makeup during the day, this cream goes on instead! indeed a great base for eye makeup
