I think this product can be great with the right skin type and specific needs. I have combination skin, and some parts are more dry than others. When I use this at night it just doesn’t give me the deep hydration that I want. It’s a good product and goes on easy, a little goes a long way, but just wasn’t for my skin. Hope this helps! Good, but not for combination skin.
