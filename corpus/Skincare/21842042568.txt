I received this product free for review through Influenster. I did notice that the cream made my under eye feel hydrated and it absorbed into the skin well. I did feel that I am a little sensitive to the cream as it felt a little bit burning when applying. However this would quickly go away. I do not have fine lines so this is not something I am able to judge the produce on. I feel as though this is a product that could be really great for someone with different under-eye needs. nan
