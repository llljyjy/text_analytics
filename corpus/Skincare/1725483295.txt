I was so happy to receive this product complimentary from BzzAgent in exchange for my honest opinion.  I’ve tried several IT products in the past and have been happily impressed with them all.  IT Cosmetics is a mid-range high-quality brand.  I applied the product twice daily for 3 weeks with great results.  I use tretinoin 0.1% at night and usually cover that with a serum & a moisturizer twice a day with the addition of a sunscreen in the morning and my regular make-up routine.  It’s really important that I have a great moisturizer to use because the tretinoin is quite drying and will leave my face very irritated without it.  I’ve suffered from cystic acne since my early 20s with the onset of endometriosis and PCOS. and I just turned 46   My moisturizer has to not cause further irritation or contribute to my acne and this product passed those tests with flying colors.   I felt no burning or stinging to the eye area.  The scent was very light and herbal to me, quite pleasant.  I also felt this product kept fine lines and wrinkles at bay as well.  This is a solid product with a fair price and I would recommend it to anyone looking to keep their skin feeling hydrated and happy!  Thank you very much! Great Moisturizer
