The first time I used this, it irritated my skin but I had bumps on my forehead. I kept using it and the bumps have disappeared. Dark spots have lightened. My skin looks brighter and healthier. I have (had!) very dry skin. My skin is no longer dry. It looks 1000 times better. I do use a moisturizer after applying to seal in the product. I just bought a second bottle. I feel like $31 is a steal for the results I have seen in the first month. Say Goodbye to Dry, Dull Skin
