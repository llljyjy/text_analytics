Bought for face use, but turned out to be too heavy for my skin and just sat on top like grease. I don’t love the smell or colour either, it but it’s not too bad altogether. I tried it next on my hands and I really see the benefits here! I’ll be using it on my hands overnight. I recommend getting the mini size first and seeing if you like it and it works for you. Very heavy, but good for hands!
