I received a free sample of the future cream. My original go to is the whipped super foods, but this might have changed that. Living in Arizona, it’s a perfect hydrating cream to use year round. It’s a little thicker than the superfoods, but it doesn’t feel heavy on your skin. Excited to purchase the full size. nan
