Not for me, gave me severe breakouts. I used caudalie’s face wash before this one and that is absolutely amazing. Not sure, if it’s causing other people breakouts but I have normal skin, not very sensitive. I started getting breakouts after using it, new pimples everyday. and when I stopped using it my pimples started getting better. I don’t have acne prone skin and don’t remember the last time I naturally got pimples. nan
