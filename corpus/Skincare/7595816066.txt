This product is really nice in terms of the glow it gives your skin. I use it everyday usually mornings and it goes well right under pretty much any moisturizer or sunscreen. It also goes well under makeup. It also doesn’t leave your face feeling sticky like other glow products do so I love that. One thing to note is it’s really runny so be careful squeezing the dropper. It will roll right off your face lol. Probably better to squeeze it in your hands first. Great staple for glowy skin!
