I originally bought this in a trial size and I was instantly in love. The immediate glow that this gives my skin is unlike anything i’ve tried before. The moisturizer is a bit heavy, perfect for our Canadian winters. But, I probably wouldn’t use it this in the summer. Pricey but worth it! My skin is in love
