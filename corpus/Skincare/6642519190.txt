Good but with some setbacks. Firstly it really does a great job at adding protection, obviously you cannot reapply a cream sunscreen after you’ve done your makeup so the ease of application is great and I never burn. However it stings a bit and it smells very strongly of sunscreen, the smell is not good. I would still buy because I want to be protected but I find that I like the Habit spray sunscreen better (can also buy at Sephora) however not sure how well the habit does with setting makeup.. it’s a toss up! Effective but with some downsides
