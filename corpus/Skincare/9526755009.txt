I loved the idea of powder sunscreen and love the powder itself.....  However, it is nearly impossible to get it out.  I’ve unscrewed the bottom, checked the brush, checked the interior.  Nothing seems to be clogged but I can’t get enough product out of the brush.  I ended up putting some on my hand to apply. Love the powder, HATE the container
