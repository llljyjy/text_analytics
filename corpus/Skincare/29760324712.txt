This is the best cleaner I have ever used for my skin. I used to have really dry, dull, sensitive skin. I didn’t get a lot of breakouts,  but I definitely get way less now. They also go away within 1-2 days. I have  combo skin so my nose gets really oily but my cheeks and the area around my jawline get really dry. This cleanser doesn’t irritate either area and it’s everything I’ve wanted in a cleanser. best ever
