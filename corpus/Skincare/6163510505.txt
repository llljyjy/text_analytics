Absolutely love the subtle scent and the rich texture of this eye cream. I see people saying it’s expensive but not worth it because it doesn’t show any change, anti aging products don’t make your wrinkle ‘go away’. It’s to prevent wrinkles. (Literally says ‘age-delay eye concentrate’) you can also put just a thin layer for the morning routine so that it goes well under the makeup. I personally don’t like too strong scent but fresh products in general don’t smell too chemical or strong. I’m on my third bottle now! I don’t think I’ll use anything else besides this. bought my third one last week.
