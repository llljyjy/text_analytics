Though I’ve only used for 2 weeks I’m believing some benefits thus far. I have been using every night and I stopped using my moisturizer. Reason I stopped using my moisturizer was I was unsure if I was to use in combination. After a week of using though I noticed my skin felt firm and possibly my poors improved. I know retinol can dry out skin but I felt this improved my super oily summer tzone area and I have not experienced any dryness or redness from use. I’m hopeful this will continue to give me results possibly on age spots and wrinkles, byt assume that will take a bit more time. I recommend some sort of info be added in if it can be used with normal skin routine, after online research I did it appears I can so I plan to use in conjunction.I’m only giving 4 stars as I’m just not sure yet how well the other benefits offered will work for me. 2 week review
