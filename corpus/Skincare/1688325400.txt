I use it in the morning and night. The smell I don’t love but don’t mind, like a plastic vitamin c rubber blend of smell. Consistency is like a thick whipping cream mousse, so it’s medium thickness. For my cheeks which is normal/dry, it’s helps with moisturizing the skin. It has a oily/silky residue feeling on my hands, which goes away after a while. Overall I like it and can see myself finishing the jar but not sure if I’d use another jar. Moisturizes but don’t love the smell
