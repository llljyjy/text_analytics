This stuff reminds me of a lip balm I used to wear in high school. It’s really thick and makes my lips feel hot. It’s definitely moisturizing but if you like the minty feel I wouldn’t recommend this. I also have no idea how I’m going to sleep with it since I feel like it’ll stick to my hair and pillows. super thick
