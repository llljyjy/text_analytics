I’ve been using Dermalogica for a while now and this eye serum works the best for me. It is light and absorbs quickly leaving your under eye skin very smooth. I had a hard time to find a cream or serum which diminishes fine lines and gives elasticity around the eye. This does and it’s perfect! Highly recommend it! Best eye serum!
