This cream is super moisturizing. I use it at night and it makes my skin feel so soft when I wake up in the morning. I’ve only been using it for a couple weeks so I can’t say that I can see any noticeable changes but I will continue to use it. I think it’s going to be great to keep my face hydrated as the weather gets colder. Very Moisturizing
