I received this Laneige Water Sleeping Mask from TopBox Circle as a free product. I have been using it every night as a moisturizer substitute for the past 4 weeks and I absolutely love it! My skin is on the dry side in the winter and very sensitive. When I first had it on hand, I doubted if it could work as a moisturizer for this season since the texture is a little lighter than a regular night cream. But I decided to give it a try and used it as part of my night routine. Surprisingly it didn’t make my skin dry in the morning even with the heater turning on during my sleep. And I’m glad to have it to replace my winter-must-have heavy and thick moisturizers. I I can tell my skin is smoother and more radiant now. I like that it’s a lightweight blue gel-like mask / moisturizer and didn’t have strong smells. It absorbed so quickly that I didn’t feel my face sticky at all. It’s very soothing and hydrating and didn’t irritate my skin or make me break out. The jar could last quite a long time and I would continue using it up. I really like this product and would definitely recommend it. #freeproduct Great Hydrating Night Moisturizer Substitute
