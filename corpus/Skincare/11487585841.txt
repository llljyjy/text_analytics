Wonderful, life-changing eye treatment! I can’t shut up about this one. I love the texture, the result, the application--EVERYTHING! The first thing I noticed is that there is no irritation at all, which is great. Zero greasiness as well. But what I loved the most is what it did for my black circles. They are completely gone! I’m 28, but my sister (18) and my mother (56) are using it too and they’re both loving it! Wonderful, life-changing eye treatment!
