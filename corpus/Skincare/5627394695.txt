This is honestly a great product. It’s better than the other de-puffing serums I’ve tried and I like the metal applicator because it feels nice on the skin. The formula is really watery and one pump feels excessive, especially since it doesn’t absorb into the skin quickly. But my under eye area always looks super revived when I use it! nan
