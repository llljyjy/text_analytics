This product is very unique for an under eye product. The consistency reminds my of lip chap, which at first I was confused about, but I ended up being pleasantly surprised! You swipe the product onto your skin and it literally stays there. I found it very hydrating as I have dry under eyes and I really felt that it helped with the application of my concealer. I highly recommend this product your anyone who is looking to hydrate their under eyes. This will not disappoint!
