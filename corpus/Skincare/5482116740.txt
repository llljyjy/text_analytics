This Magic Eye Rescue Cream With Retinol claims to protect against signs of aging, reduce the appearance of wrinkles, and brighten the look of dark circles... Due to the thick consistency and the retinol in the ingredient list, I personally elected to only use it at night, but I have been using it nightly for a month now and I cannot believe my eyes (pun intended LOL). First and foremost, my undereye area is so incredibly smooth and hydrated! My usual puffiness is nowhere to be found, and my fine lines have started to disappear. However, I think the most impressive part is that my eyes look bright and youthful even after I wake up the next day and do my entire morning skincare routine. I have absolutely awful genetic dark circles and while I’ve found some eye creams that help brighten the area, all of them tend to provide somewhat of a mica-shimmer effect that is temporary and washes off. This Charlotte Tilbury eye cream has had lasting visible effects, and I’m honestly amazed. I would normally not glowingly recommend a skincare product that’s meant for such a small area of your face (with such a large price tag), but I’m truly shook at how much younger my eyes look. Other people have noticed, and it’s really encouraging to use a skincare product that actually lives up to it’s claims. Plus, I love how this eye cream melts into my skin, and you only need a pea-sized amount for both eyes (so the jar is lasting forever). In conclusion, if you want your eyes to look 10 years younger, this is the product for you! It Works!
