Best of both worlds! Protect and Skincare all in one! Love this Tula Protect and glow UVA and UVB / SPF 30 Sunscreen gel! Easy application, twist off cap, the usual. I like the thick texture of the gel, it spreads well on the skin and has that classic sunscreen smell, you know what I’m talking about. It gives your skin a nice healthy shine, I liked that it wasn’t a glaring shine, it really does feel good to wear. My girl thought it made her shine too much, but I think it was in her head. But everyone is different. It’s not sticky, and your skin feels nice quickly, and later on as well. Excellent sunscreen. Best of both worlds!
