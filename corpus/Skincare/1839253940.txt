I had been using this moisturizer for the past 3 years and I loved it, the texture was so smooth and it had a really nice scent. This new formula is horrible, it smells like a weird medicinal ointment and the texture is clumpy. The new jar and label also look cheaply made. It’s not worth the money. I’m so bummed, I’m going to look for a new moisturizer. Terrible NEW Formula
