I received a trial size for an honest review. This moisturizer is amazing it feels nice when you put it on.  The product is thick and creamy. It isn’t greasy or too heavy it also absorbs quickly.  I would think any type of skin oily, dry or combination would have no problem using this moisturizer. A little goes a long way. It does have a scent but, it isn’t over powering which is very nice. I would recommend this product without hesitation. Very Nice Moisturizer
