This product is certainly not worth the $122 price tag. I received this in from Influenster, and I did not see any significant changes to my skin. The only positive was my skin appeared hydrated upon application, but it dissipates rather quickly. There were no breakouts using this product, so it would be fine for oily skin too. I don’t think this is necessary in your skincare routine. Ehh…
