My eyes love me for this.This stuff is creamy not sticky like other eye serums.  I used the tip of the product which has a ridged material to massage around my eyes in the morning and evening to reduce fine lines. I refrigerate this stuff to give a cooling effect too making it more effective on the eyes. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. My eyes absolutely love it!
