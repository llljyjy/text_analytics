I have very dry skin and I’m not very acne prone. I found it to be very greasy but it is hydrating. However, ever since I started using this I got bumps on my forehead and cheeks that I’ve never had before. This product just leaves build up and sits on top of my face. It took me weeks to get the acne on my forehead to go away & miraculously it stopped when I cut this moisturizer out of my regimen. Greasy Moisturizer, Causes Acne
