I LOVE this moisturizer, and for the price you can’t go wrong. I have combo/acne prone skin and I’ve had no reaction or breakouts using this. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and the nice thing about it for those who don’t love using a primer, it does a good job acting as that as well. It does leave you feeling ever so slightly tacky so I give it time to settle in before applying makeup, but I’ve had no issues as long as I let it settle first. Absolute Favourite
