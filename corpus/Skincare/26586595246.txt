I wanted to love and keep using this product so badly, but my skin SCREAMS no every time. If you have oily skin, this might not be for you. The only thing I could highly talk about is that there is no white cast AT ALL, which is the only reason I kept using it. At first, it leaves a matte impression on my skin, but the downfall of this product is when in a matter of an hour, my skin looks too greasy. This would be a great, indispensable product for dry skin. Not for oily skin
