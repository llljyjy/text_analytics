I love the way this cleanser makes my skin feel. It removes my makeup super well and doesn’t leave me feeling stripped. I also love the smell and beautiful packaging! I haven’t read this in any other reviews but every time I pump the cleanser into my hands and go to put it on my face, the product falls off my hands every time! The texture is like jelly when it first pumps out and doesn’t adhere to skin super well. Unfortunately this has lead to a lot of product wasted. makes skin so soft and clean!
