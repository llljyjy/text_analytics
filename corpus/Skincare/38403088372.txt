Feels super hydrating! Specially applying on after cleaning the face. Definitely going to start implementing more into my day to day. As I put it on my face at night, I want to try to experiment on when the best time to put it on will be. When applying to my face, I used a Q-Tip to get the product out then rubbed in with my clean finger tips. Never used eye cream until now!
