Why on earth is this in a jar instead of a bottle with a dropper or pump?  This is a serum, plain and simple.  Secondly, it isn’t as good as Herbivore PRISM.  I only tried this because I wanted to try something new.  It’s going to take forever to use it in a delivery system that is not appropriate.  Put it in a bottle and it gets a 4 star review. First of all...
