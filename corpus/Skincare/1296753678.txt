I have fairly dry skin and live in the northern winter states. I use a ton of lip balm to try to keep my lips moisturized and Iâ€™ve tried about every brand from Sephora. This one has been one of my favorites. I use it multiple times a day because I love the feel on my lips and it keeps them moisturized once the glossy surface has been removed from drinking.  The feeling is more of a lip gloss (thicker than an oil) but not sticky/tacky at all. Love this product! Amazingly Moisturizing
