Love the idea of pads. This is my first time using peel pads and it makes my life so much easier. A lot of nutrients in one pad! As a mom of three I am always in a hurry doing my skin care and so with this glycolic retinol resurfacing peel pad, I can just take one and rub it around my face instead of having to put many different products for a nourished skin. I can walk around while doing my skin care. Just using this with the resurfacing serum, my skin looks hydrated and rejuvenated. This doesnt even happen because I have very dry skin so I always have to put different serums and moisturizer before it can retain a hydrated appearance. Love this product! Life changing!
