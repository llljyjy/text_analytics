I can definitely see the mixed reviews. I noticed many people that don‚Äôt like it are not fond of smell good creams as for myself, I love a good cream that smells amazing.This one is actually not too strong. The Chanel face cream has a stronger scent than this one does. I think The Charlotte has a very light scent in my opinion, but to somebody that doesn‚Äôt like scent in their creams it may be strong for them. Personally I feel like they should‚Äôve made it smell a little stronger. I do love the thickness of this Cream and how it does make your face look plump. The packaging is beautiful as well. I think I will be getting a 2nd bottle after this one is done. üòç Mixed reviews- for me A+
