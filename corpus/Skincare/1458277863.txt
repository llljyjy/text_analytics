while this product made my skin feel and look great, i can’t get past the smell. at first i thought it had gone bad in shipping but after reading multiple reviews it seems its just common for this product. i received this as a sample and will not be purchasing in the future due to the horrible blue cheesy / moldy smell. can’t get past the smell
