What a great serum. I have acne prone skin so I use Retinol for that purpose but also for anti aging. I used First Aid Beauty .25% retinol serum for years, I continued to break out and thought I was treating my skin with that but turns out there are more than a few pore clogging ingredients in the First Aid Beauty serum (soybean oil specifically doesn’t work for me). Switched to this and I have been using it for about two months and my skin has never looked more consistently clear! I use it every other night with moisturizer. The texture can feel “oily“ but that good oily that feels hydrating, not like it’s sitting on top of your skin. Great ingredients, hydrating, and more importantly it seems to really work. For anyone not sure if they want to try it, it’s worth a go! My new holy grail!
