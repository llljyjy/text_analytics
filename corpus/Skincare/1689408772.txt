I lean to the dry side and this cream is fantastic! It absorbs quickly, leaves my skin feeling hydrated and smooth.  After several weeks of use I have noticed a decline in my pore size and a diminished depth of some of my wrinkles around my lips. I would definitely recommend this moisturizer to anyone who asks!! New Holy Grail
