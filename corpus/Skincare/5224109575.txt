I can honestly say this has been the best moisturizer I have tried hands down. The way it feels putting it on my face it’s so soft like butter feels amazing. I’ve seen such a notice this keeps my hydrated for the whole day I use this day and night. My pores have gone way down. My skin tone looks more even. I hope they never get rid of this cream cuz its the only one I will keep buying forever. I’m 36 and have gone threw trying out many face moisturizers and I can 100% say this is the best one out there. The best!
