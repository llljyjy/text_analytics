I have combination skin. It gets pretty oily, especially with humidity and heat, but also tends to dry out and peel occasionally in cooler weather when the heating is running indoors. My skin is sensitive and I react pretty strongly to most scented products.The Ren Evercalm balm is definitely more hydrating than regular lotion and hyaluronic acid based moisturizers. I would compare it to using Vaseline on your face. Just a little bit goes a long way. The first night I used it, I used too much and my face was oily and sticky the entire next day. The following times I only used a little dab and melted it on my skin like the instructions stated. Much better results! My skin was still hydrated but not super oily in the following days. The balm is unscented and didn’t trigger any allergic reaction. Since a little goes a long way, the amount provided will last a long time.I’m knocking off a star because I think that for combination skin it’s just a little bit too hydrating and battling the resulting oiliness the next day isn’t fun. If you have super dry and peeling skin, this is probably a lifesaver for you. I seriously wish they made a lip balm with the same properties though... Better for dry skin than combination.
