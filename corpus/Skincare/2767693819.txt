I was skeptical of this product, but after I tried it, I fell in love with it! I noticed an immediate change in my skin after the first use. After a few weeks, I my pores got smaller and my texture improved. Now, after a few months, my skin is bouncy, radiant, super supple, and my pores have significantly shrunk in size. I have super super dry and slightly sensitive skin; I use more at night than in the morning, and I only use it on my face (a little irritation on my chin and neck). Also, I only use 4-5 times a week. It’s lightly fragranced and can be a bit harsh for my skin with every day use (especially twice a day). I started with the mini and will definitely purchase the full size product. It’s worth a try! nan
