If you have break outs or blackheads i think this cream could work wonders for you, it really helped clear up my black heads I don’t usually break out but I do have a black head problem and this helped so much when it came to reducing my black heads, the smell is fine I don’t find it too over whelming, I used a very light hand with this product and only applied it at night. A little goes a long way. It has a thick consistency and felt moisturizing on first application then dried very quickly into my skin. It mattifies well I was afraid that the salicylic acid would dry out my skin but it wasn’t as bad as I expect I have super dry skin that’s why I only use it at night I don’t want to dry my skin out anymore, this product is great for black heads I totally recommend Great for blackheads
