I received a free sample of this product and am very happy using the GENIUS Liquid Collagen Lip. I am, what I consider, a “naturalist“ and do not like using body enhancing products. At first, I was hesitant, but from the first application, I was hooked! I love the cool- minty soft feeling on my lips and the fact that it did not burn when applied. After using it for 10 days, I was pleasantly surprised that 1) my bleeding lips were less apparent and 2.) my lips looked sexier and blumpier! In addition,I always apply some sort of lip balm before going to bed and usually reapply in the middle of the night. But, after using GENIUS Liquid Collagen, I no longer need lip balm and my lips are more moist. I love the product and I am so happy to have found a vegan-friendly option. full/sexy-lips
