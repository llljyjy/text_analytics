Iâ€™m not one to write reviews but this product was so good, I had to! At first, I was super skeptical about this mask. My skin has been dry and had bad stubborn maskne for the past 2 years. But omg, the amount of softness & shine the hylaronic acid mask gave me was insane! Woke up to my face being super soft and even one of my stubborn pimples has shrunk a little. Definitely will repurchase nan
