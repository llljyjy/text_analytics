Love love this cream! It’s so smooth and semi thick, so the consistency is very nice. It has a faint fruity smell that it’s not overpowering at all. I like the little application stick that comes with it as it helps me to not over use the product. Would give 5 stars if the container itself were bigger, it’s mainly jar and a tiny cream jar inside. Still worth it though! nan
