Love this product! I’ve been a fan of the Sephora Collection for years and am so glad i got to try out this product. I noticed my dark spots fading after just a few days of use in the am/pm. It also didn’t feel heavy or greasy on my face and was perfect to pair with other items I use from the Sephora collection. It also didn’t make me break out! Definitely will be adding this to my skincare routine permanently! Great Product!
