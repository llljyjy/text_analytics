this is a really nice serum with a hint of color. tone 3 is excellent and truly leaves no cast so i think it could work for all medium to deep skin tones. it has a fragrance with isnâ€™t too overwhelming but lasted throughout the entire day for me. i would recommend this product if youre looking for a serum with excellent skin care elements with a nice touch of color. brown girl friendly
