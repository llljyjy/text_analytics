I like this stuff. It’s definitely much more compatible with fairer skin tones, but I have a more olivey/uneven skin tone and it worked well for me too. It instantly eliminates redness and evens out your skin tone. You definitely have to make sure your face is freshly clean and moisturized before you put this stuff on. The product spreads so much smoother and even. If you have dryness or flakiness to your skin, this product may leave a “film”, I’ve noticed if my skin gets on the dryer side, this product does nothing for me but make my skin look dryer. Overall, I like it, it does the job, just have to apply it correctly. i like it
