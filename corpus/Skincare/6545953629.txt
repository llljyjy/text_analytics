I received a sample size of this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. I love the texture and feel of the cream. It felt very smooth like a silicone type texture and covered pores very well. I could only use at night because for me, it didn’t sit well under makeup although I have a feeling it will for other people. Most moisturizer doesn’t sit well under makeup for me. As for long term effects, the sample size was only about 5 uses so I can’t speak to anti aging benefits. Good product, would recommend to others. Revitalizing supreme
