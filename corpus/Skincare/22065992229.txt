I’m so impressed by this serum. I’ve used it for two weeks now and I’ve noticed a difference on my skin. I apply it 2-3 times a week to start off because my skin is sensitive. I have oily and acne-prone skin too. I noticed my skin looks brighter. I also see my blemishes reducing in appearance. And I haven’t gotten any acne lately. I definitely recommend this product and I plan to buy another one once I’m finished with it. nan
