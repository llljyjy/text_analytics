This product is gifted by Peter Thomas Roth Clinical Skincare. This is an effective vitamin A/C/E retinoid treatment. I thought it might be a bit irritating for me but it actually didnâ€™t cause any sensitivity or breakouts. It works great as a night serum, makes my skin look so smooth and glowing the next morning. nan
