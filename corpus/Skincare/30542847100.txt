There are those mornings, maybe the day after a party, where you want something extra and that is why I like these masks.  Thereâ€™s the whole relaxing ritual of putting them on and listening to chill music.  I am not sure if they made a difference, but it felt nice and so I like having them.  Also, I love to give them to friends as part of a hostess gift and everyone has loved getting them. Great for those days you need something extra
