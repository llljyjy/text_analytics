This product was overall nice.  I used it alone (without moisturizer) because it is oil based and  I was leery of mixing products.  I used very little of it when applying to retain a natural appearance.  My pores appeared “blurred“ and my complexion was softened.  One of my favorite features is the SPF 40, since sunscreen is part of my daily skin routine. Nice product
