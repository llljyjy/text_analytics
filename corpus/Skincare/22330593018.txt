This is a great product if you are starting out with acne treatment. It is best for people who’s skin responds well to spot treatments. Personally, my acne responds better to stronger products, like benzoyl peroxide. I really loved the packaging and the scent of the product. I also enjoyed that it didn’t leave any residue and dried down nicely. nan
