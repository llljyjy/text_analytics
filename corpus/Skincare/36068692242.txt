I really love this kit since it includes all you need for the skincare routine, especially for morning routine. The serum has a thin texture, so it’s very easy to apply and absorb into your skin. The texture of the cream is quite thick, but it can moisturize your skin very well, particularly in the winter. Lastly, the color correcting treatment is the best to me. It has a light tint that makes your skin brighter and even. I always use this kit for morning routine. I don’t need to wear any makeup, but I still have a very natural look. Really love this kit!! Great for Dull and Sensitive Skin
