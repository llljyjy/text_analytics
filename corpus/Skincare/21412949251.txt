AMAZING as expected! A little goes a long way, it feels tacky and sticky at first, but after moisturizing, your skin feels soft. I woke up the next morning with beautiful glowing skin. I prefer to use this during my PM routine along with the Knockout toner and Knockout gel moisturizer. I have acne-prone combination skin and was afraid of using a serum since all the ones I’ve before have broken me out. This definitely my new holy grail.I cannot recommend Tarte’s Knockout line enough for acne-prone combination skin types. I have struggled with hormonal acne since I was a teenager and this line, along with a low pH cleanser and gel sunscreen, has cured my skin. I got my sister into it and her skin has improved significantly as wellDo your skin a favor and try this product. AMAZING! Tarte Knockout Line Never Disappoints
