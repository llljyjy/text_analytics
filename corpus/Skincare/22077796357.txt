Received this product from influenster.This product reminds me of thise hand scrubs that after you wash off they feel really soft and smooth. I really like the product, I will definitely say it is an exfoliant. Made my face feel soft and smooth and even my pores feel clean. Of course with a product like this you do need to be careful as it can be drying so immediately apply moisturizer on and do not use everyday. One star off because it didnâ€™t feel like a cleanser and it did not feel like jelly and it did not become soapy. Good!
