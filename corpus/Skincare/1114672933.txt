I love that this style of packaging means you know the product is as fresh as it could be when you are ready to start using it. We all know that lots of actives in skincare products lose their efficacy over time, and most of the time we have no idea how long something has been sitting on the shelf before we bring it home (for instance, I’ve had wildly different experiences with the same Vitamin C serum bought at two different stores). Being able to mix the actives when you open the case gives a lot of confidence that the product will perform as intended. So far I’ve been using it about a month, and I feel like my skin looks brighter and I haven’t experienced any extra sensitivity. Highly recommend. Love the Packaging
