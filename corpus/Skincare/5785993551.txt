i don’t really know what else to say other than the fact that it smells bad, like rotten eggs bad. i get that one of the ingredients has a sulfur-like smell but still. sometimes its so unbearable that i’m gagging. however, it’s only been almost 3 weeks of me using. i haven’t noticed significant changes. my skin texture does feel a little smoother when i wake up but ill keep using it for a few more weeks to see if my acne scars disappear. if you’re sensitive to smells, i wouldn’t recommend this. not a great smell
