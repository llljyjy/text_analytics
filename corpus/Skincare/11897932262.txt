I received this product as a part of a free sample program. I really enjoyed using this cleansing bar. You could literally smell the scent before even opening up the box. Even though the scent was strong, it wasnâ€™t overwhelming. It smells really good and I loved pairing it with the Fenty Butta Drop. The scent lasted long on me and I felt really hydrated and moisturized! Smells really good!
