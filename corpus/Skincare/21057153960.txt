My bf got me this as a gift. I love the jar. Super cute sitting on my vanity. I really enjoy the effect from this cream on days when my skin isnâ€™t dry or sensitive. It is not suitable for me to use every day and will burn if I have any dryness or sensitivity. I have worn foundation over this without issues. I only bounce a sponge for foundation application. For use on perfect skin days only
