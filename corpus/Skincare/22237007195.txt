I like the silky smooth consistency of this product. It just slid so smoothly over my screen and also kept my face hydrated by not oily. I hate moisturisers that feel heavy on the skin and as soon as i put in this product i could totally forget I had something on. I would like to buy this for sure. Like the gel like consistency
