I love this moisturizer because it does not leave my face feeling oily. It does exactly what it’s supposed to do and it does it much better than other products I’ve tried. My face has been smoother since I’ve started using it. The only reason I don’t give it 5 stars is because of the smell. As someone who easily gets migraines, the smell can be a bit much at times. I just wish it was unscented. Loved everything except the smell
