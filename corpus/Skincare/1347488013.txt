I recently went snorkeling during a trip to Hawaii (hello face down in ocean) and a day later, I noticed red welts/bumps in various areas of my face. (After some googling…) I believe I had cercarial dermatitis or “swimmer’s itch” from the water.Anyway, I used the SOS Spray after I’d wash my face and 3 days after the welts were at their worst, they’ve gone down dramatically! I’m gonna chalk this up to the SOS Spray and say it’s magical. nan
