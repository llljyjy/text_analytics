I don’t see this just as another moisturizing lip product. I consider it a treatment. I’ve had this for about a week and I apply it religiously everyday.  I love the results. Lips are more pink, softer and plump. No more lip lines. I recommend exfoliating lips before applying the treatment. It does feel slimy but it sets into a velvety texture.￼ Soft baby lips
