Right away I thought the packaging was beautiful! The cream itself is thick, but not oily. Definitely less is more with this one. There is a good amount in the bottle as well so It will last you awhile. I could see the brightness under my eyes right away. It definitely helps with under eye circles. Thankfully I donâ€™t have any wrinkles (yet) but I feel like this would definitely help! nan
