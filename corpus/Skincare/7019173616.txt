I have very sensitive acne-prone skin, and I always have a really tough time in the winter with my skin being both oily and super dry. I tried this and it felt like my skin actually absorbed it instead of it just sitting on top of my face. It felt so hydrating and soft and applying makeup afterward was amazing as well. LOVE!
