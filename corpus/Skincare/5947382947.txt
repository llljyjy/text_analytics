This has been a life-saver for my dry skin. I often get peeling, flaking and pilling underneath foundations, especially in the winter time. I love the lightweight but moisturizing feel of this serum. It doesnâ€™t interact with my sunscreen or moisturizer and makes my skin feel the best it ever has! I wish it was a more reasonable price but until I find a cheaper dupe, I will definitely splurge. If you have dry skin, give this a shot!
