I received this product complimentary from Famacy. I’m not completely sure how I feel about this product. It is moisturizing, but I wouldn’t really call it a mask as advertised. I do like the feel of the product and the ingredients. I didn’t notice any pore tightening, but I haven’t been using it long enough to really judge that. Overall, it’s an okay product and I will use it up. nan
