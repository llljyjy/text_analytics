I don’t typically use products like this so I wasn’t sure what to expect but after a couple uses I’m very happy. The serum drops feel nice on my skin and my skin has a nice appearance. I don’t necessarily know if I see any brightening but my skin does look healthy and glowing. I would continue to use this product. nan
