This product is fine. It left my skin looking and feeling a little hydrated. However, my own masks and toners/serums leave my skin much more glowy and hydrated. And although I received this product as a complimentary gift, knowing that this single-use mask is $9 really throws me off. To use it consistently within a 2-week period, I would need to purchase 4-6 masks. That adds up pretty quickly. Overall, there are better products to spend on! Fine, but not revolutionary
