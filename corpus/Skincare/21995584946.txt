I received this product from #thetopbox for free in exchange of my honest feedback. I have very dry skin in the winters and it always ends up being flaky under makeupâ€¦ this moisturizer really helps with that. I am very sensitive to fragrance in skincare products and I am so glad this one has almost no scents. My skin felt very hydrated after every use. It leaves no shine or sticky feeling even after double moisturizing. I really liked using it and will be using it in the future as well. nan
