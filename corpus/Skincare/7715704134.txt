I have a dry skin type and this product instantly smoothes my skin. It’s gentle yet hydrating at the same time. I had some small breakouts when I started using this (like with any new addition to your skin care routine- and especially for me as I wasn’t using a toner before this). I recommend this to anyone who has dry skin and need something to smooth and hydrate the skin. The scent is really pleasant as well. nan
