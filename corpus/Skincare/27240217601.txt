Bought this about a week ago! It feels so silky and smooth going on and it leaves my face feeling soft and glowy! This comes from someone who strugglesssss to find a cleanser that doesnâ€™t make me feel stripped or too oily (I have acne prone oily skin) Love this for a fresh cleanse! Must have for your skincare routine
