I LOVE the Origins Clear Improvement charcoal honey mask! It applies smoothly and evenly and then rinses off easily. My skin feels hydrated and smooth once finished. Definitely one of my favorite masks and easily one of my favorites from the Origins brand. I have combo skin and this balanced my skin wonderfully. Highly recommend! nan
