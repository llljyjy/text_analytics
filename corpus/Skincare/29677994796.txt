This is a really elegant product that’s effective but not at all irritating. It adds tons of moisture, and sort of works as a hybrid toner-serum. I still used a moisturizer after, but I felt softer and dewier. I don’t know if I’d call it essential, but it was a lovely addition to my routine. Beautiful
