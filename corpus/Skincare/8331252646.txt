I really like this product and its results. I tend to have really dry skin but this product helped me to improve it, I still need to use it for a few more weeks  and see what it does to my skin as a part of my routine. The smell reminds me of a forest and even though Iâ€™ve been using lotions without smell this one is pretty subtle. Totally would purchase it in the future. Great Results
