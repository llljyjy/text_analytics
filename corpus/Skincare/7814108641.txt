Love this as a primer before makeup. I haven’t noticed a huge difference in my skin by my makeup lays much better overall when I use this first. It’s hydrating, great for my sensitive skin, and helps my makeup last longer. I recommend this product, especially if you have dry/combo skin and are looking for a smoother makeup application. nan
