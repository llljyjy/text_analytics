Not a stand alone cleanser. I always need another one to strip off makeup, this one smears it around. The oil kind of burns your eyes. When using this to double cleanse you hope the oil will keep you from feeling dried out but I really did not see that with this. Love this brand but not this product. Not a stand alone cleanser,maybe for a 2x cleanse?
