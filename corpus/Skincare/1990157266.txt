So tiny now! I’ve been using these for years and I loved them. My most recent order of two packs of these (purple packaging) were SO MUCH SMALLER. The original were just so much easier to handle and one sheet was all I needed, I liked the size so I didn’t mind the higher price tag compared to other brands.Incredibly disappointing to get these new ones in the mail and find they were changed to be so much smaller. I won’t buy again. Incredibly disappointed in new smaller size
