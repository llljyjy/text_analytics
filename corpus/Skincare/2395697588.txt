I love this lip mask! I’ve used the Laneige for years and wanted to try something different. I love Alpyn Beauty and HAD to have this when it came out! This lip mask is super hydrating and stays on my lips longer than the Laneige. I also love them lemonade smell! It’s such a treat. Smells and feels great!
