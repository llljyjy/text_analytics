This moisturizer is very silky and applies nicely without leaving a greasy residue. It absorbs into the skin beautifully, leaving feeling so soft. It works wonderfully as a nightly moisturizer as well as under makeup. I’ve only used it for a few days, but it doesn’t seem like it is causing any breakouts or irritation. However, I do not have sensitive skin. The only reason I took a star off if because the smell is a bit much, but it doesn’t linger. Silky Soft
