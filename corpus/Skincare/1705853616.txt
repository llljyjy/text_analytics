I received this product for free from influenster in exchange for my honest review. I really like this formula. It doesn’t have a white cast, it dries down to a satin finish, and doesn’t feel too thick. It doesn’t pill up and it doesn’t sting my eyes. I only wish it came in a bigger tube, had a little more SPF, and was a bit cheaper. Otherwise going to purchase when it runs out. nan
