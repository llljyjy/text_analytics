This is me without any make up. It goes on so incredibly smooth. It doesn’t have a fragrance, which I love. A little bit goes a long way. So here’s what I have noticed since I have started using it: My skin is so soft and smooth. Not oily or shiny. I have extremely large pores and I’m very self-conscious about them I came to the realization that they will never go away.Well… This cream has actually shrank my pores! Another great thing about the cream is that my make up goes on smoothly over the top. I will definitely be purchasing another bottle after I run out! All around great product
