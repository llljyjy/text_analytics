I noticed it works more effectively if you let the product soak on your skin rather than swiping. took a long while to notice results and the results were very minimal. a lot of their products are heavily fragranced. fragrance is a known skin irritant. OLE is not known for having revolutionary products and they over do it with the marketing rather than focusing on formulations. nothing out of this world. nan
