I received this item incentivized from Influenster for my honest review. I’ll be honest, this is the second eye cream I’ve ever used and this tiny bottle packs a punch! The consistency is really nice and goes on smooth. I was surprised how quickly I noticed improvement on my fine lines and crows feet. It did slightly burn for a bit which is why I only gave it 4 stars. But overall I’m very happy with this product and would purchase in the future to see what results I could obtain. Impressive!
