I am approaching 50 this year and my skin was increasingly becoming dry and flaking on my upper eyelids and around my mouth despite using hyaluronic acid underneath my current moisturizer.  I am also a healthcare worker who has to wear a mask all day for my shift.  Eucerin wasn’t working and I didn’t like all the ingredients on the product list. Decided to try this on a whim without any prior knowledge of this line.  What a difference this has made in the past 3 weeks!!!  My eyelids are soft and supple without any dryness and my mouth and chin are completely transformed into soft, flake free skin.  Would highly recommend especially if you live in colder climes. I am a Canadian and am ecstatic to find this product!! nan
