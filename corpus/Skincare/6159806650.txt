The name is in the proof, shall we say? I’ve been using this magic cream for two years now and was so excited to receive a LARGE container! I love the ability to buy refills to save money and help the economy. This is pricey, but a little goes such a long way which benefits us consumers in the long run. Not to mention the amazing ingredients and the fact it doesn’t leave your skin greasy. This is my daily staple both for no makeup days and to wear under makeup. 10/10 would recommend.
