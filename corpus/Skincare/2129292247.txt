I’m obsessed with this oil. Yes it’s pricey but it’s worth it and lasts a long time! A little goes a long way. I wear this under makeup and it’s makes my skin look flawless and hydrated. This Chicago cold wind does damage to my skin and this oil is forever going to be in my life! Also use at night and wake up with plump skin. I love this. I’d buy this over the magic cream. Honestly you can add this oil to any moisturizer and it takes hydration to another level. Hydration Heaven
