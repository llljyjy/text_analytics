Upon first using this moisturizer, I thought it was makeup because of its tint but it’s actually not. It’s really moisturizing and hydrating on the skin since it contains hyaluronic acid and aloe vera. I like using it on my neck because it contains bukuchiol, which is supposedly a natural retinol and so I hope it helps with my neck and any tech lines I may have. Moisturizing "Tinted" Night Cream
