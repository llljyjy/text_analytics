I didn’t love the drops because of the smell and streakiness, both of which were solved by this lotion. I am extremely fair, and the color looks natural (and doesn’t fade in patches). I still used a mitt to apply the lotion, and it came out looking perfect! This is the only product I can use that looks natural on my hands and feet. Natural & no smell
