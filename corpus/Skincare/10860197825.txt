So I was purchased this on recommendation for my dry skin. I did like how my skin felt after it - it felt oily (in a light nice oily way - not uncomfortable oily), only reason I didnâ€™t stick with it was the fragrance - it does have a strong honey fragrance, which I felt bit overwhelming. But great product overall! nan
