I have adult acne and an oily complexion. I used the acne lotion morning and night. It worksWell under my morning sunblock and under my night cream. The acne lotion and face wash is unscented which I really like. I used the acne face wash one a day at nighttime and the acne lotion morning and night under other creams. I ran out of the acne lotion first and the face wash lasted awhile. My only complaint is the acne lotion should come in a bigger size. I would recommend this acne kit because it didnâ€™t cause any redness or dry patches or flaking to my face. great non drying acne kit
