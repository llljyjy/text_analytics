I was gifted by Eadem this stunning new Cloud Cushion cream and I’m loving the results! The texture is like a thick, creamy butter but it’s whipped and airy feeling on the skin. It leaves your complexion feeling extremely hydrated and nourished without any greasiness or heaviness. I love what this brand’s ethos stands for as well and the gorgeous packaging with the gold spatula. Stunning cream I’ll be keeping in my kit! Gorgeous cream!
