Im a bit disappointed with this cream. I love la neige products. They work wonderfully on my skin. I had high hopes for this one. First I don’t like de smell. I find the texture not smooth enough (compared to water bank crème that’s I love) I did not see a difference in my skin vs a normal vitaminC serum. Won’t repurchase :/ not what I expected
