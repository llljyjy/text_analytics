I really want to love this. I am all for a glow, a sheen, some glisten, etc., but this has straight up glitter in it. I do love Supergoop and know it is good protection, and it doesn’t feel sticky or uncomfortable on the skin, but the amount of glitter in this is a bit much. I’ll continue to use it but I won’t repurchase. nan
