I’ve been using this moisturizer for the past 30 years. I consider it more along the lines of a slightly richer “emulsion”, for those of you who are familiar with Japanese/Korean beauty routines. What is standout about this moisturizer is it’s absorption. It doesn’t sit on top of your skin. I have dry, combination skin and I put it on after softener. It really does keep your skin moisturized and it’s very lightweight. You don’t need much and it’s fragrance free, and hypoallergenic-as I have sensitive skin and can react very badly to fragrance. You need to let it set in and absorb for a couple of minutes, but afterwards it’s easy to apply sunscreen. I find many sunscreens drying to I always play this before. Also, it’s the perfect way to protect your skin when you’re training your face to accept retinol. You moisturize with this then out the retinol afterwards and it really helps to help with redness and flaking while still getting the benefits of your retinoid. It’s also amazing for thinning out your foundation and getting it to absorb into your skin to look more like a no make-up make-up look. I don’t find foundations moisturizing even when they say they are, and mixing it with the Clinique helps with that plus it gives you a very natural application. If you have a face powder and need a quick foundation, mixing this moisturizer with a bit of powder gives you a really nice moisturizing sheer cover. It’s an amazing makeup remover, I’ve used it to take off my eye makeup when I’ve run out of remover, and I like it because it leaves the skin moist. So, I can’t say enough good things. It has stood the test of time for me and I use different and heavier moisturizers and creams but I always use this as an emulsion in my routine. it has stood the test of time.
