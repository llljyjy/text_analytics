I have dry skin with occasional redness and acne flare ups. I use benzaclin (clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide) and tretinoin .05% at night, which contributes to the dryness.I originally received this as a free sample and then bought the full size because I like it so much. It is very light (when I used to have oilier skin, I probably would have used this as my stand alone moisturizer in the summer). It is not enough on its own for me now, but it helps tame redness and leaves a little bit of a glow on my skin. I use it in the morning with Algenist’s original moisturizer.I do not wear much makeup and never wear foundation, so I can’t comment as to how well this plays with makeup. nan
