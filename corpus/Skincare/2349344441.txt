I wanted to love this, but it was just meh. Pros: cute packaging, light and pleasant smell, did not pill, did not cause any breakouts Cons: tacky and took a while to fully absorb, pump doesnâ€™t allow for full use of product in the bottle, no noticeable difference using daily in the am. Meh. Better options out there!
