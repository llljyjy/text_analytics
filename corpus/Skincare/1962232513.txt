I’ve been wanting to use a facial oil during winter in the Northwest as it’s been super dry with indoor heating and I’m loving this product! I’m usually sensitive to retinol so I haven’t found a product to use regularly but I’ve been using this one for a couple week and it seems to be doing fine and my skin doesn’t feel dry/tight anymore. Will definitely keep using to see if it makes any noticeable difference in appearance. nan
