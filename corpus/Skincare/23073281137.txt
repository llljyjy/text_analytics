I have loved everything Sunday Riley for a long time but this stuff sucks. The applicator is nice but it gave me flaky dry patches I’ve never had and dark poofy bags I’ve also never had after just one use. I thought maybe it was a coincidence so I kept using it for a week, but it just got worse and worse. I swear this aged me 10 years. I also have some red irritation bumps under my eyes now. Run! Terrible!
