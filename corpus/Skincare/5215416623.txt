I wish I returned it when I first opened it and now it’s too late. I love the exfolikate and thought wow I’m stressed so let’s try this soothing cleanser... urgh. my face doesn’t feel clean after , just like I rubbed smelly lotion on my face instead. I started breaking out afterwards too and at first thought maybe it’s just temporary.. nope. I’m not sure how so many people like it and I’m not usually one to complain but this is so bad I needed to review. ugh
