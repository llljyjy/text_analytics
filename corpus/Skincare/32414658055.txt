I like this product for reducing puffiness.  It doesnâ€™t do as good of a job with brightening g and managing fine lines as the GLAMGLOW Bright eyes or the Kate Sommerville, but it is 25% of the cost of GLAMGLOW and 7.5% the cost of Kate Sommerville.  For the money, no complaints.  This is a great budget friendly product.  It is especially great for people under 40 who have less lines to manage.  As I am at the 40 mark, I need a bit more help than this product gives me.  I still use it at night, but go with the GLAMGLOW in the morning as it is more hydrating and really gets to work on the lines.  If you are less dry and less old...lol, this may be a 5 star product for you. Can't Beat it for the $$$
