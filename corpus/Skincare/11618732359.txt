I think it’s working great! I believe it’s helping with my hyperpigmentation. I am going to have to update my review at a further date when I have used it for longer, but overall going well! It does sting a little when I use it near my under eye, but my skin is a bit more sensitive there. Doesn’t really have a scent to it, Which is nice. A little bit goes a long way! nan
