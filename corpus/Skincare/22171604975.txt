I *adore* this eye cream! After a week I already started seeing an improvement with my persistent under-eye bags, and I’ve never been able to make much progress on them before! This texture of the product is rich and creamy, so it felt incredibly nourishing and moisturizing. A little goes a long way, so it will last you a good while too. You can’t really see the real difference in my photos because of horrible bathroom lighting, but trust me - it works. Bags be gone!
