Great eye cream, soothing and gives results!!Review by Esma on 8 Jan 2022review stating Great eye cream, soothing and gives results!! I love the texture of this eye cream that is a thick cream, very soothing it is very hydrating too. I love using it morning and evening, with or without makeup. It helped me reduce my darker circle and give me a more awake/beautiful look. It feels very good I recommend it and itâ€™s an ideal addition to the jetlag mask too. Love it!
