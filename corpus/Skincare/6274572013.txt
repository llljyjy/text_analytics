This stuff is amazing. I really like Laneige’s Water Sleeping Mask but this stuff blows it out of the water. 2 nights in a row and boom, the single biggest improvement to my extremely dry face. I also tried Fenty’s overnight gel-cream, which was fine. Nowhere near as impressive as this. Product is thick but spreads out well. It feels almost tacky once applied but it really stays on there all night. Doesn’t small like anything! I have sensitive skin and no issues at all with this product... I have never had an issue with Niacinamide - everyone is different though! Saves my face from winter - overnight results!
