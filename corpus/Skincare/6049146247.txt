I received this as a sample. It was interesting that the two products were recommended to be mixed together. They were hydrating, I’ll give it that. It was a bit heavy on the scent and I don’t like to use a lot scented products on my skin (especially near my eyes) so I probably wouldn’t purchase this. I always hope major companies products would become cleaner in ingredients and limit fragrances. nan
