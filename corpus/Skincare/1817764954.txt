Iâ€™m 36 old and I wanted to treat the neck/decolletage area. I absolutely love this neck serum! There is no fragrance to it which is amazing, I can apply my perfumes and would not change the fragrance to it. The texture is lightweight and creamy, yet it absorbs so quickly and leaves your skin feeling smooth and hydrated. The packaging is well made and easy to take out the serum without making a mess. Will definitely be picking up another!!! I absolutely love this neck serum!
