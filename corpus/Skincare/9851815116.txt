I received this product free from Influenster for marketing purposes. I was excited to add it to my daily routine since it’s simple to use and was light, smelled nice and wasn’t very time consuming. I liked that it instantly nourished my forehead allowing my skin to bounce back quicker after everyday facial expressions. It soaks in quickly and doesn’t feel greasy so it can be used at night or in the morning. add this to your moisturizer
