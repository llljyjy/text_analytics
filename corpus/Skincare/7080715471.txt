I have never written a review about anything but WOW this mask was worth every penny! I saw a youtuber rave about this mask and have always known about the benefits of honey since itâ€™s so versatile. But after trying this mask my skin was radiating for DAAAYS. I felt like I just got a facial! I even asked some of my friends to try it who had dry or combination while I have oily skin and they got the same results! One friend, it got rid of her pimples two days after using it! This mask is truly for everyone and worth the buy. It really does remove dead skin due to the apple extract, a natural AHA ingredient so your pores are blurred and your skin is left with a natural glow! It firms that skin too, definitely a universal mask and the best part a little goes a long way! A mask for EVERYONE
