Mine came in the mini travel kit. I decided to try it in my hands first to see what it looked like on my fait skin. My face is whiter than my whole body so I wanted it on my face. Verdict : ONLY USE 2-4 DROPS OR THE RED BOTTLE, it works if that’s what you’re asking, In a few hours my hands were significantly darker. (6 drops in 1/2 pump of cerave moisturizer )In the picture my hands look oily because I tried removing it off with baby oil I hope it removes it. Not a bad product just not for fair skin. I’ll see in stores the red bottle. :) EFFECTIVE
