I’ve been using this cream and a few other of their products for over a year and love them. I get compliments on my skin all of the time. Highly recommend. My husband is even asking me if he can start using it for himself! I don’t have sensitive skin so I use it every night along with the algae eye cream, retinol serum and sometimes the vitamin C and moisturizer as needed. A must-have
