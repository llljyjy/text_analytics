What can I say about this serum other than its nothing short of amazing. I’ve only been using it a few days and I already such a huge difference in my skin! I’ve couples this with my normal skincare routine (this being the only thing I’m using different) and my skin already looks more luminous, hydrated, and soft. To be honest I’m shocked. A little bit goes a long way. I use about 2 pumps for my whole face and sometimes a bit extra on my neck. There isn’t an overly strong scent but there is a slight one but nothing too overpowering. I personal think the scent in quite pleasant and gives off a very luxurious vibe. Will definitely be keeping this as a staple in my routine. Amazing serum
