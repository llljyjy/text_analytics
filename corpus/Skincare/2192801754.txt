I’ve used this religiously for a number of years now and I won’t be without it. It is gentle and so effective at removing even waterproof makeup and mascara. It lasts a good while with daily use which makes the price reasonable and worthwhile. It makes my skin soft and supple and leaves a super clean but never tight and drying base for the rest of my routine. Couldn’t recommend highly enough for combo skin. I tell everyone about this product! Leaves skin soft & supple. 10/10 will always love!
