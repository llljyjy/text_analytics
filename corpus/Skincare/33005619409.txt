A very good retinol for sensitive skin. It has not caused any type of reaction or allergy as it happens with other products. I only apply a plum on my face, emphasizing where I have fine lines of expression and if I have seen changes, I have been using it for 3 weeks twice a week and it is going great. I recommend it. nan
