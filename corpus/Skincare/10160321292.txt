I was slightly skeptical about this face wash because I don’t associate Dior with skin care. Take that and the fact that the face wash is scented; I was honestly a bit scared to try it. Initially, it smells a bit perfume-ish. I was so ready to count it out! My skin isn’t particularly sensitive, but I am careful with what I use. I’m glad I stuck with it though! The scent is still there and it lingers, but it lessens to a fresh smell that I have come to love. As far as the cleansing, I love how well it lathers. It starts off as a cream and lathers into a lovely foam. A little goes a long way. If used properly, this could last you a while. I’ve integrated the wash into my routine and it has fit in perfectly, working well with all of my other products. My skin has loved it! Thinking this may become a staple.One drawback is that the ingredients aren’t on the bottle. That would be a helpful addition. Pleasantly surprised
