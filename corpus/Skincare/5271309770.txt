If you have really dry and sensitive eyes I would not recommend. It did not get rid of my dark circles, but under my eyes does seem brighter than without, however, that little bit of brightness does not constitute the price. It is quite thick which seems nice, but doesnâ€™t fully sink in so my under eyes still feel and look quite dry. I had some serious dry skin on my eye lids and it only irritated it more. Overpriced & not moisturizing
