This is a great creamy moisturizer to have on hand. It doesn’t have a strong smell, and sinks in beautifully into my skin. Like most great things, you won’t see instant results so I can’t say that I see any difference in my skin as of yet, since I’ve only been using it for like 2 weeks. But I can’t wait to continue using it and helping out my skin! nan
