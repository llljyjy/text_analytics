Iâ€™ve loved using the cream! It is deeply hydrating. The texture is delightfully creamy. It is light. It blends well. I use it on my hands too. It has an amazing scent! It protects the moisture barrier. My dry skin feels much better after use! It is free of sulfates and parabens. It has classic looking packaging! Would recommend! Very moisturizing!
