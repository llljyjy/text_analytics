Firstly - the smell is fine. A bit like nair, but literally goes away within seconds and after using it for some while I don’t smell a thing. But sadly, this product did not work for me. After 3 and 1/2 months I still have the same (if not more) acne scars and dark spots. I thought this would be my saving grace, but I think I’m well past being able to be helped by over the counter products. Smells decent, results not so much
