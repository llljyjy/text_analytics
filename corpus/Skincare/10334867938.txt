I was very excited to try this product out for numerous reasons, but mainly because I am a sucker for super hydrated skin. This product has a water like consistency but lacks a mean punch. I immediately can see a difference when Iâ€™m wearing it. I apply it after I cleanse my face and use my toner, then follow up with my serums and moisturizer. It feels like a real luxury.
