This was sent to me as a free sample from topbox circle. I used it every day. There was no scent which I appreciated and it did not irritate my sensitive skin. I wish it shared how much retinol was in it. My skin felt tighter using it but I donâ€™t think it did much for wrinkles. I would buy it if it shared the retinol amount on it. I like clinque products and I love topbox circle. I was excited to try this product, but was a bit disapointed. tighter
