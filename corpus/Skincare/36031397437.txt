I’ve used this product for about two months now. I have acne prone skin so I always make sure to give products the benefit of the doubt when first trying them. I noticed no changes within the first month using it and sadly after the second month still no changes to my skin. I won’t be purchasing this product any longer. Giving them two stars because of packaging which is made of 100% ocean-bound plastic. 2 months, no results.
