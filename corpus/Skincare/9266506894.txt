I’ve been using this product almost daily for 2 years and my skin has never looked so good! As someone who struggled with acne as a teen I now have people complementing my skin.  It gives a beautiful glow and has helped reduce acne scaring on my cheeks. Absolutely love this product! I use 3-4 drops on my face and neck after applying hyaluronic acid. Don’t use too much at once or it can feel oily and like its sitting on your skin instead of absorbing. Love it!
