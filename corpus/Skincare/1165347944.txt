I was experiencing a pretty annoying eczema flare up on my face - specifically around my eyes and my cheeks. Everything I would put on it would irritate it and cause so much stinging. I bought this product because I had heard it helped calm stressed out skin and I’m so glad I did. After only two days of using this, my skin healed and was back to normal. I don’t know what it did but I will always have a bottle of this on hand! it works!
