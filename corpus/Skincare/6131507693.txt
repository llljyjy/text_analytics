I started using the Luminous Ceremony Cream Cleanser recently. The texture is silky. It does not irritate my skin , and most importantly, itâ€™s not greasy . It makes my face feel smooth, and I notice my face gleaming. To say the least, LCC has become my favorite cleanser. Gray is my before image! My New Favorite Cleanser!
