I love this stuff. It refreshes your skin in all types of ways. It works best when you cleanse your skin, moisturize, then use the spray to lock in moisture and every product. It gives your makeup a Dewey look, and refreshes it after hours of wear. It’s reallly the perfect pick me up. I always grab this even when I have some at home I always can’t have too much of this. PERFECT
