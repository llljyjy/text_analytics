I’m loving this amazing cherry conditioning oil.  My lips feel very hydrated and look glossy. It’s a grown up version of shine that looks professional and feels silky.  It smells great and I love that it’s made out of healthy ingredients that are good for me.  The applicator is easy to use and the tube looks super cute in my makeup bag.  I take this with me everywhere I go because it really makes my lips feel great. Lips feel so silky smooth
