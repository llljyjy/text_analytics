I received a sample size from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. The pros...it absorbs nicely, doesn’t leave my face feeling greasy and it has a pleasant smell. The Con...I don’t know how well it will help with fine lines. A sample may be too small to fully determine the effects honestly. I do like how my skin feels though. Moisturizes well
