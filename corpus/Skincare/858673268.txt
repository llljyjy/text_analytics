I really love this eye cream. I am always on the hunt for something to help with my puffy under eye area and that I can use with my reusable eye masks. This formula is soft but also a little tacky when applied…in a good way. I don’t like eye creams that are too slick or that need a long time to dry. This feels luxurious. From the beautiful packaging to the creaminess and color of the actual cream. I would recommend if you are a real fan of Charlotte Tilbury products. It’s a little pricey for how much is actually in the jar but I only use a tiny bit in the mornings so I think it should last me a few months. nan
