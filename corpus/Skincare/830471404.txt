This is my favorite exfoliating product that I have ever used. It is almost like rubbing fine sand on your skin. The smell is very natural and kind of earthy. I do not care for artificial fragrances, so I find this one very refreshing. My skin is smooth and truly radiant after using this product. I just love it. My favorite exfoliant!
