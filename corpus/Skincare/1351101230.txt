This balm is great for an intense night treatment. It appears greasy at first but when I put it on my face it melted in easily. I only needed to use a tiny amount each night to cover my face. I have a lot of redness and while this didn’t get it to go away altogether, it was definitely calming. It also reduced flakiness. I didn’t have any reactions to it even with sensitive skin. The scent is minimal and pleasant. Soothing balm
