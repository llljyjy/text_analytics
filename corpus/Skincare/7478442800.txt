I’ve always used the belif aqua bomb so I knew this variation wouldn’t disappoint. It smells more citrusy compared to the original but delivers just the same in terms of moisture. My skin always feels super soft and as someone who is eczema/acne prone, I never have dry spots or breakouts while using this. I do use this product with a vitamin c serum and my dark spots are definitely noticeably lighter. I highly recommend this for all skin types! super moisturizing!
