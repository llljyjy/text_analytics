As my headline says... I’m sad I actually like this moisturizer/cream lol*I did get this from influenster in exchange for my honest review.*As soon as I got the package, I went on Sephora to see more about this brand because I didn’t know much about it. Man, when I tell you I gasped at that price tag, I’m not kidding LOL I thought that this moisturizer better make me age backwards or something.First impression was pleasant. It doesn’t smell much like anything, just pure cream, if that’s even a way to describe it. It went very light on my skin, absorbed pretty quickly and I was surprised at the healthy glow it gave me. I think that was my favorite part. You also don’t need to use thaaaat much to have your face feel moisturized; it’s light in texture but it’s effective.So I enjoy using this cream and it will break my heart when I run out because that means I’ll have to make the decision of whether or not I’d purchase this on my own... I’ll think more about that when I get to it though :-) I'm sad that I actually like it
