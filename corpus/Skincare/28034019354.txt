I’ve been using this for about a week now and have become excited about my skincare routine again.  The formula is very lightweight so I feel like it absorbs really well. It also plays nice with the other products in my routine. My skin feels softer and more smooth immediately after application. I’m loving it for the breakouts I’ve been having cause the formula is very soothing and hydrating which is exactly what I’ve been needing. Overall I’m very impressed! If I could only choose one serum in my routine this would be a top pick. It seems to cover all the bases in maintaining the actual health of my skin and I really love that. Looking forward to seeing what continued use will do for my complexion. So much to love!
