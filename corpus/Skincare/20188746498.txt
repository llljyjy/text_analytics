Pros - A little goes a long way- It is very silky, I love the texture.- I did not break me out at all. Even though I rarely get acne, moisturizers are one of the few things that can cause me to get acne. - It produces results in as little as week if used morning and night. I have resorted to only using it at night, now, and the results are still there.- The ingredients are wonderful. I would think that if you have sensitive skin you could use this cream.- Paraben free- Moisturizes without leaving residue or pilling. Cons - I don’t like the wide top where I have to stick my fingers in to scoop out the cream. I would prefer it to be a pump or a much smaller opening. - The ingredients are not on the jar, itself. They are on the box. This means that I need to keep the jar in the box at all times b/c I like knowing what is in my products b/c I have morning and night routines and use things with different ingredients in them. Sometimes the ingredients shouldn’t be mixed, sometimes I don’t need too much of one ingredient or I need more of another, etc.- Does not make my skin oily when using; however, I notice that in the morning I wake up with my skin slightly more greasy than it normally is without using the cream. Overall I really like this moisturizer and will order in the future when this runs out. A little goes a long way (it’s super concentrated) and with me only using it at night I think it will last me 2-3 months. The results are visible to not only me but others, I’ve received compliments from my family such as “your skin is glowing!“ The price is very reasonable for such a high quality item. Luxurious! Silky, my skin soaks it up.
