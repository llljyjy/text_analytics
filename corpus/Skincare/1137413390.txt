I wasn’t sure how to use this in my skin routine at first but after some research I’ve started using it as a toner before putting on moisturizer and it’s been calming my skin which is great before applying makeup or if before bed I wake up feeling refreshed! I’ve always loved Origins products because I feel like it’s good quality for the price. This product has a nice smell and I feel like it took a few times use to notice if it was working at all but it is noticeable. Good quality
