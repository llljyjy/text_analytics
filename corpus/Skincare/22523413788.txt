It does what promises. Is a nice product to carry around on my no MakeUp days. Gives a cooling and refreshing sensation and the blue tone cancels a bit of my blemishes. The glitter gives a natural fresh look. I also like to use it on my lips and thin lines. It hydrates and plumps it.I like the product, but is not groundbreaking. It does what's promised
