I have never used this product before and was excited to try a good skin care moisturizer. After a month of using it I am loving the results of smoother skin and I do feel like I have lost a couple forehead wrinkles lol. The only con is the smell. And it doesn’t stay forever and it’s not super strong just a Hint of something I can’t place. But I would still recommend this product Love the results not so much the smell
