I received this serum for free from Influenster and Lancome in exchange fo my honest review. This is the new skincare product that takes all the current skincare biggies (Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamic C, Niacinamide and Ferulic Acid). Lancome was launching the new product with the creative design. There are three outlets for product which allows each, individual ingredient to remain stable and unaffected by the others until the point of mixing â€“ such a genius application as shown in the picture. You can clearly see the different textures and formulas after dispensing the product (transparent, white, and milky)I can say an immediate and very visible plumping/hydration effect which lasted all day. My skin look softer, smoother after 3 day of usage. Texture is almost likeprimer, so it would work particularly well under makeup, especially if your skin was dry during winter. 3 product in the same bottle
