I have a gel moisturizer that I use for warmer weather months, but wanted something a bit more moisture-locking and cream-based for the winter/early spring. I went into the store and tried a few - this one stood out to me for its luscious & creamy feel without an oily residue, and for the scent! It reminds me of that Milk & Honey soap - just faint enough so that you get a whiff of it while you’re applying, but once it’s on, the scent dissipates! Just what I like. Also, glides very nicely, leaving my skin soft, NOT greasy looking (I have dry/oily skin), and looking forward to applying every day! I was between this and the Drunk Elephant Protini, which also felt great. But for almost half the price, I couldn’t turn this Honey Whip down! HIGHLY recommend! Best face cream I’ve ever bought
