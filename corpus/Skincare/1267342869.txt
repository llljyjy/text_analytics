This stuff is my saving grace. I am not sure why all the negative reviews, unless they are using it incorrectly. I use the whole line of The Ordinary. I was using a very high price brand SR that I loved but I think I am in perimenopause and therefore have started breaking out. My face was red, inflamed and angry until I switched lines. The only thing I noticed is that I cannot skip a night .No matter how tired I am I make sure to do my routine. I use this and 3 other products at night. If your unsure, go to their site and take the quiz and it will tell you what to use and in what order. LOVE the ORDINARY
