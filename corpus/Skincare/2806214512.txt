Improved my appearance immediately. It’s a pretty thick mask but, it wasn’t heavy, greasy or leave a film on my face like one would expect from a heavy cream. It left my skin looking hydrated. No more flaky dry skin. A little really does go a long way. My skin felt and looked so much better. I will be purchasing this in the future. I got this for free in exchange for my honest opinion. nan
