Smell was very  subtle but just like the typical sunscreen smell. I liked the product to use as an additional form of sunscreen but I don’t think this could be your only form of sunscreen. You can’t build it up and I don’t know how much protection you really get from a think layer of oil unless you want to be super greasy. It doesn’t make sense as just a sunscreen but I love it as a moisturizer product. I use this before I apply sunscreen so I feel good about getting more protection than usual.
