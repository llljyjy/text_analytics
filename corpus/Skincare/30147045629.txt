This cleanser works incredibly. It cleared my acne. My acne wasn’t horrible, but I never had clear skin. Now I only get the occasional acne and this helps clear it every time. I have sensitive and combination (leaning towards dry) skin. I did notice it to be a bit drying after using it continuously, but nothing crazy. Now I only use it at night (instead of morning and night). It helps with blackheads too, but not as much as it helps with pimples. Best Cleanser I’ve Used
