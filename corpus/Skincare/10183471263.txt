NOT incentivized. Y’all when I tell you this is the holy grail! I have acne prone, sensitive skin. My skin has always been dry, but any time I use any moisturizer, no matter if it’s for oily or dry skin, it always leaves my face looking greasy and pimples pop up. Not this one. I used to think my skin felt pretty normal and soft, but I was so sadly wrong. I’ve been using this for about a month now, and my face has never felt softer. I was worried this would be too rich for my acne prone skin, but my skin drinks it up like water. And best of all, this is the first moisturizer I’ve EVER used that doesn’t cause break outs (and I’ve tried like everything), and I use it both in the AM and PM. My face looks and feels more smooth and plump. Majorly softened my ‘wtf lines’ between the brows. Definitely my go to moisturizer now! WOW
