**I received this product as a complimentary sample for my honest opinionI spent a couple of weeks trying this product before writing a review, because I wanted to see what the longer term results were with this product. Overall, this product did improve my skin’s texture, though this cream tended to be a bit tacky/sticky after application on my skin. That said, I did notice hydrating and softening results within about a weeks time of consistent use. I think this product would be a great addition when the weather turns drier this winter. A lot of others have commented on the scent - it definitely is a little overpowering at first (though not entirely unpleasant), so if you are scent sensitive, this may not be the product for you. I don’t think that I will be repurchasing this product for future use due to the high cost, but it is definitely worth a try if you are looking for a texture improving night cream and have some extra cash to treat yourself! nan
