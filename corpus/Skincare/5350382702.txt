I received a sample of this cream to test for my honest feedback from KORRES and Influenster. I wasn’t a huge fan of the feeling of the cream on my face once I applied it. It had a slight smell to it as well. Overall, I’ve used other creams that have left my face feeling light and fresher than this one did. I also wasn’t a fan of the yellowish color of the cream. nan
