I received this as a sample complimentary of influenster. Though I have not seen any results just yet, this cream is very moisturizing and I’m loving how radiant it does leave my skin. It’s not too heavy. I have combination/oily skin and at times it takes a little to adjust to something new. Radiance in moisturizer
