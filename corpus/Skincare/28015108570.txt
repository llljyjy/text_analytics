This was gifted by Sulwhasoo but I would 100% purchase this after trying it out. I absolutely love the feeling of the product on my face. It absorbed instantly and made my skin feel hydrated and rejuvenated after just a few uses. The cream itself was lightweight and a great addition to my nighttime skincare routine. I even noticed in the mornings, my face felt tighter after using it. Itâ€™s even a great moisturizer to use under sunscreen for the daytime so it honestly has various AM/PM usages. nan
