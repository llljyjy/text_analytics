I’ve been eyeing the olaplex oil but due the price I didn’t purchase and decided on this instead, I used it on my roots and my ends and then proceeded to wash my hair as I normally would and now my hair is so soft and doesn’t feel nearly as damaged as it usually does!! For reference I have shorter curly hair and it’s very color/chemically damaged perfect for damaged hair
