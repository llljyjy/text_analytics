I received these products for free from Influenster and Lancôme for my honest reviewLancôme has always been one of my favorite brands when it comes to skincare. I was excited to receive this serum in the mail because it’s literally like a big drink of water for your skin. It contains Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C, Niacinamide and Ferulic Acid. These ingredients add up to an incredible plumping of the skin. I noticed that my skin became much brighter and bouncy after a month of use. It also cut down on the amount of steps I needed for my skincare regimen. Overall, I really love this product and will continue to purchase after this sample is out! Love this for my skin!
