I really like this cleanser. First of all, who doesn’t look a dual-action product? This cleanser has a jelly texture and you can feel all the gritty scrubbing “beads“ once you rub it on. I love how it left my skin feeling clean, smooth and polished. That said, I do have dry skin and while I felt like this product was appropriate for my skin type, I don’t see myself using something with this texture and exfoliating power twice a day. So far, I’ve been using it at night only. I recently read about exfoliating options for people with dry skin and fruit enzymes were recommended! Now for the smell! I’m somewhat sensitive and very picky when it comes to scents and this one is great! It smells very natural (I’ve seen someone complaints otherwise and I respectfully disagree, strongly). It smells JUST like orange peel which is a top ingredient in the product. And of course, I love that it’s a Clean at Sephora product. It comes out pretty quickly, so just be sure not to squeeze out too much. When I do, I scrub it on my hands and follow up with lotion--it makes them softer! Smells yummy!
