Wow. So many thing/products I have tried “guarantees, 97 % of women , such and such recommends -etc., and I see  nothing. Zip. No results. I wind up tossing them.Money and time wasted. Useless. I have had prescription  skin lightening from a dermatologist that did not do anything much, or the spots came back, didn’t really work. This work! So quickly. Lately I saw a lot of brown spots, upsetting, as they seem to all come at once. I retuned another most expensive product (not purchase on Sephora) this is amazing. It works so quickly, not month, mere weeks. Less than. A miracle. Best dark spot remover ever.
