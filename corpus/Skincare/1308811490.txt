I’ve been using the It Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream for over two weeks and I can’t get over the difference in my skin. Fine lines have disappeared, my skin’s texture is so smooth, and there is an overall brightness from within. It’s super hydrating, but doesn’t make my oily skin oilier. I am in love with this cream! Miracle cream!
