Josie Marans tinted sunscreen has been my most loved and repurchased skincare product for years (at least 10 bottles) and I was excited to try this one… This caused my makeup, when layered over, to peak off immediately and ball up. I have never had that problem before with any skincare or sunscreen. Leaves a iridescent white/purple glow that looks really unnatural on my medium skin. doesn’t play well with others.
