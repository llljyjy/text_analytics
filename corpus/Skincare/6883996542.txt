I’ve been using this product since January and I noticed how smooth my skin is. I definitely experienced purging where my skin was peeling and breaking out even worse than I used to. Now, I get occasional breakouts but they heal a lot faster! I’m still in the process of getting my scars fully healed but I really love the product! I added before and after (no make up & with make up) pics. Trust the process and make sure you focus on using products that heals your moisture barrier! nan
