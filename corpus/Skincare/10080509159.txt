I received this product from Influenster and #Clinique in exchange for my honest review. First off, I’m a long time Clinique fan and this product is like most of theirs - AHmazing. I’ll admit I read some of the reviews before using and was kind of surprised.  I guess most didn’t really understand how a cleansing balm is used?  You use this before your regular cleanser.  It’s not a stand alone, and you don’t just use it to remove make up with a cloth and go on your merry way.  Some seemed to think that and then reviewed it like it was greasy.  Well yeah. The point of this is to break down hard to remove make up and things like sunscreens and mascara, red lipsticks and so on.  It does a fabulous job. And this one, with the charcoal (that does not stain) in it, also detoxifies as well.  It doesn’t have any scent I could detect and didn’t irritate my skin at all.  The container is very generous and eye catching. There’s a lot in it and you don’t need much.  It starts out as a solid and once warmed on the skin smooths into a rich oil like balm that melts into the face and really helps to pull away makeup and dirt.  Rub it in circles along the face, eyes and throat and voilá!Follow with your cleanser and regular regimen.  I think you’ll find it a wonderful asset. I sure do; I’m using it daily. Thanks Clinique, I’ll be buying the next tub! This is fabulous!
