This is a super thick cleansing balm so a tiny amount(about a pea size) is all you need to use and the fact that it’s in a tube makes the portion size easy to control. I know everyone’s first thought is to use this to remove makeup which it’s great at doing but I also love using it as a first cleanse in my double cleansing routine. My face always feel a lot more hydrate, soft but still super clean without the dryness and as someone with extremely dry skin i really love this! As I mentioned it’s really thick but also non greasy or messy which makes cleansing so much more enjoyable. Best cleansing balm I've tried!
