I’m in love with the Juneberry & Collagen Hydrating Cream Cleanser! It’s the perfect balance of cleansing and hydrating my skin. The circular jojoba beads embedded in the cream gently buff away dry skin and dissolve  impurities, while the plant-based collagen helps keep my skin’s moisture barrier hydrated and balanced. My skin feels soft and smooth after using it, and I experience a flash of cool followed by a deep, purifying cleanse. I would highly recommend this cleanser to anyone looking for an effective but gentle way to cleanse their skin!I love that it can be used as a mask or a cleanser as well!  Plus it smells amazing!! I'm Loving This!
