After one use this had my skin feeling and looking AMAZING. Idk what happened but before I found this little gem my face had broken out, it was so bad, itchy and red and I’m not someone who breaks out like that. Everything I tried would not make it go away and so I bought this. And omg. The INSTANT RELIEF. Obviously my face didn’t clear in one day but it definitely made the redness go down a bit and the itching went away. After a few more days and my face was clear. Im obsessed. Love
