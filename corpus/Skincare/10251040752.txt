This Vitamin C serum does everything it claims. I thought I had a good one, but once I was able to try this, I was blown away. My favorite thing about this serum is that it is not sticky like so many others. I also love that I can see a subtle glow and it does not pill with my moisturizer, spf, or makeup. Well done, FAB! nan
