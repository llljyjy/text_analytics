I absolutely love this night cream! It is so hydrating and soothes my skin. When I wake up the next morning, my skin is plump and looks fresh. It gives my skin a nice glow without the oily shine. The texture and consistency is really nice as well. It is whipped and since it is a thicker cream, this helps with it actually being workable into the skin. In fact, it melts into the skin. A little goes a long way! One of my favorite things about this product, in addition to its performance, is the scent! It is so light and fresh, yet calming at the same time. To be fair, I would describe it as a gender neutral scent. Overall, I really love this cloud cream and will be keeping it as a regular staple in my night time skincare routine.(I received this product to try out in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own.) Staple in my night time skincare routine!
