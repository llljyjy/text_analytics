Words cannot describe how much I love this sunscreen. It’s so convenient to use and the smell is amazing. I have super sensitive skin and I’m dark skinned…. so finding an appropriate sunscreen can be challenging. The fact that this is a mist reassured me that there won’t be any white cast on my face.(as you can imagine, I’ve had embarrassing experiences before)I’ve been using this for over a year and so far so good. This favorite sunscreen ever and I would highly recommend especially for dark skin. Super convenient
