I had some reservations about something actually getting rid of my dark spots. I didn’t have a million but age is a real thing! I tried another brand a couple years ago and did everything they said but it didn’t work. I was happy to try this because I still wanted to lessen my dark spots on my face. Happy to say, YAY, they are gone!!!! Follow the directions and use it everyday, I think the consistency helped a ton. I love it! Ps, I took a pic of the bottle when I started and should have taken my spots. Totally forgot. The bottle has a little bit left so I can use it if anything pops up. Bye Bye spots!
