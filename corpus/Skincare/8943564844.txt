I LOVE this stuff. I tried it out last year because I was looking for an eye cream and was already familiar with the tatcha brand and liked it, and I’m so happy I did. The price is a bit daunting, but I’ve used this product twice a day, everyday, for over a year and haven’t even used all of one container of it, so it’s pretty worth it. The cream itself is so soft and silky and moisturizing without being heavy or sticky. I highly recommend it!!! nan
