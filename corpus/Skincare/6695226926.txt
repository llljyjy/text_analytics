I tried this product out for like 3 months. Never really removed my makeup, especially my eye makeup. it just smeared it around my face. always had to use another product to have it completely remove all my makeup. also when i was done using the product, it left a weird feeling on my skin like it was still built up on my skin (even after double cleansing), and kinda felt like plastic. I would not recommend this product to anyone. if you want a cheap cleansing balm that works really well, get the Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm Original instead trusted a tiktok review, wouldnâ€™t recommend
