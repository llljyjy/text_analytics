I received a free sample for this review. This toner makes my skin feel super soft and I really enjoy using it. I put it on as the first step after cleansing my skin and before my serums or moisturizer. Over time I feel like the texture of my skin has gotten softer and smoother. It has a pleasant light floral scent. Made my skin soft and smooth
