I received this product complimentary from Sukwhasoo. This is my first time trying out the Sulwhasoo brand, I’ve always heard that it was more of a luxurious brand, and it didn’t fall short of this. Let me just say this product goes a LONG way, the tiniest amount of product easily covered my whole face. The texture was super creamy and hydrating, I love how it set on my skin. The scent wasn’t overbearing, it was very fresh. My face is always super dry and products never fully absorb into it, however this one did and it left my face soft and smooth! Would definitely recommend trying out for yourself! Super luxurious!
