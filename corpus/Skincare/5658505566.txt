I absolutely love this stuff! I have dry, sensitive skin and I have had trouble with many cleansers in the past. I have struggled with severe eczema ever since I was a baby, so skin care has been a struggle for me my entire life. Once I tried this cleanser, I can’t imagine myself switching to anything else. It’s hydrating, gentle on the skin, and great for anyone looking to save a penny or two! To all of my sensitive-skin girlies out there, I highly recommend this!! Sensitive Skin Life Saver!
