I love this brand in general! I’m not sure it’s really fading my dark spots, despite consistent use daily for a few weeks. But, it is super gentle so I wouldn’t expect fast results anyway. If you have sensitive skin you’ll love this as I don’t find it even the slightest bit harsh on skin. Good overall
