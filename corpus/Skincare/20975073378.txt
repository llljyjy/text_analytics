I received this product from #topboxcircle for a review. Personally, this product was amazing!! I loved the packaging, since it looked very modern and the perfect amount of serum that can be applied to the face came out. I liked the fact that it contained green tea since it left my skin feeling moisturized, reduced my acne and red tones. I would definitely recommend this product to others. Works great for my skin!!
