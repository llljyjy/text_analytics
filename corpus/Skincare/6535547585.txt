I have only been using Kiehl’s Fast Release Retinol Serum for a couple of weeks so I don’t have any long-term results yet.  As for the past couple of weeks, I feel that the texture of my skin is smoother and overall looks healthier.  This was easy to incorporate into my nightly skin care routine.  It goes on smooth and soaks in quick.  Not oily or greasy. Good so far!
