I received this #freeproduct in a sample size for my honest review. The texture of this serum is light and no fragrance. It was fast absorbing and left my skin soft. I found this serum is very hydrating, which worked great on my skin.  I feel like if I used it over a longer period that I would reap the benefits of wrinkle reduction as well. Nice serum!!
