I tried the Tatcha mask because this was out of stock but ended up returning it because it was drying out my lips. This happened to be back in stop so I excitedly scooped it up on the basis of all the rave reviews. I liked that the texture was thicker, and a (flimsy) little scoop was included so I didn’t breed bacteria…. But the second I put it on my lips it started to burn.  Back it goes! Burns !
