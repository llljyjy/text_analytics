Definitely great for the summer as it is hydrating and you can smell the SPF. I was out in the sun with this on and didn’t have any issues with sun burn which I have recently. On the other hand, the scent definitely smells like sunblock so if that’s not your thing it is something you might want to think about. Overall, a good product hydrating and has protection.
