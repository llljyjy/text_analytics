I am enjoying this balm! It provides a sufficient coating without feeling sticky or yucky. It has a faint pleasant rose scent. I have found that my lips are wonderfully soft. I bought this item because I live in the desert, and itâ€™s the summertime, so I need a product that can keep my lips hydrated, and this balm is perfect! Great balm = luscious lips!
