Absolute Must Have! I held off to review this cleanser, as I have sensitive, dry skin and it foams. I neednâ€™t have worried! The cleanser starts as a cream, that is silky to the touch. When applied to a wet face, it creates a gentle foam that thoroughly removes makeup and dirt. When rinsed, skin feels smooth and clean, but not stripped and tight. A winner! A Must Have!
