I know this is expensive and there are lots of great creams out there. But this is so incredible. I recently bought my second jar. It is worth the price for the fall-winter months if you have dry skin, in my opinion. This moisturizes well without being greasy. If you can try the mini size or a sample, I would recommend doing that before buying. I will continue to buy this! Beautiful for fall-winter on dry skin
