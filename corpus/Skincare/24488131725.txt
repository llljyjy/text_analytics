The jar is comes in is really nice and sturdy. But I would be careful because its glass. The cream has a nice smell even if a little strong. The cream itself is light and goes on smooth. I have sensitive skin and expected to have a reaction to it but was pleasantly surprised to find no reaction or burning. This cream isnt to oily or grimey feeling. I would definitely recommend it. I feel like it has really rejuvenated my skin. I also think it will last a while. Light cream
