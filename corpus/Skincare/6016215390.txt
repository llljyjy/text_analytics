I fell in love with this product years ago. They reformulated it a while back and it’s awful. The original product, which came in a metal-like tube, was magic. It was so moisturizing without being greasy and improved my skin like nothing ever had before or has since - it healed hyperpigmentation and redness almost overnight. The new stuff is average at best and doesn’t leave skin feeling moisturized, soft, or improved. It basically does nothing. I have been clinging to an old tube for breakout emergencies when my skin needs extra TLC. I had to use the last of it this week and honestly nearly shed a tear when it was gone. I wish Dr. Jart would take these reviews to heart and change back to the old formula because it was literal perfection. Bring back the old formula PLEASE
