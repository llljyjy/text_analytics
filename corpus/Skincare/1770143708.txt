I absolutely LOVE this serum! I have some discoloration, but nothing awful or really noticeable to anyone but me. I was a bit skeptical using the product, not knowing if this would do anything for me. I have only been using it a few days, so no discoloration change. BUT I have noticed a huge improvement in the texture of my skin. It is softer than I ever remember it being and is so smooth. It also has more color and a glow to it, I didnâ€™t see a week ago. This is a new must have step in my skin care nightly routine! It does have a bit of a strong chemical scent, but nothing that sticks and it goes away when you put it on! New must have!
