I received this product free from #thisisbutterly #chickadvisor and Clarins in return for my honest reviews. This is one luxury product which I wouldn’t buy otherwise until I knew it worked so I’m happy that I got to try and test it for 7 days to see the results on my skin. I was looking to get something to brighten and fix my under eye area as I have noticed the dullness and dark circles. I got this 7 day kit which is packed with 21 plant extracts and also has some great ingredients like turmeric which is known to be used in beauty products. It can be a bit hard for some people to get it all out of packet and mix it together before applying but once out the serum is easy to mix and apply. There is a watery part and an orange coloured thicker and you have to mix it well before applying. I applied it for 7 days in the morning and evening and I feel it was non greasy and doesn’t leave the skin sticky. I felt that my skin was soft and refreshed specially in the mornings I woke up with a fresh and brighter skin. My fines lines aren’t gone honestly that’s not something a 7 day package could do, however I see they do look reduced. It’s a pricey serum for some and I feel it could work wonders on the first signs but not sure for those deep wrinkles. nan
