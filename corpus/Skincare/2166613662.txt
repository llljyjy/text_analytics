This product actually makes me excited to take my makeup off! It works so well to get stubborn eye makeup off without bothering my VERY sensitive eyes. The cleansing balm is perfect for my dry skin. If you aren’t double cleansing, it’s time to join! Love to follow it up with YTTP Kale cleanser for a deep clean. This balm is a staple in my routine and I’m so thankful for farmacy for making this holy grail balm! best cleansing balm out there!
