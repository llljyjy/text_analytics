This is an absolute staple in my evening skincare routine/rotation! It smells like lemon deliciousness, and it makes my skin look and feel amazing. I use it about 2 times a week in alternation with retinol products, and it has significantly improved my dark spots and acne scars. It is worth every penny that it costs. I would start out slowly with this, because it can sting a little bit when your skin isnâ€™t used to it. Amazing
