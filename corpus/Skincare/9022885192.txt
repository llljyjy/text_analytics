I received this complimentary from @influnester in exchange for my honest review.    The cream itself worked great and even doubt my skin tone.  I was not crazy about the smell. I’m not sure what it supposed to smell like but it kinda smelled a bit chemically.  If you can get past the smell, I think it’s a great cream.  The price point seems reasonable for what you’re getting. nan
