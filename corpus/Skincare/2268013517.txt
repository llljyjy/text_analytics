This is such a beautiful colour on me. I have very fair, translucent skin and this builds so gently and evenly. I always blend blend blend with added lotion (hemp lotion in sensitive skin) and I start at the bottom and work my way up. I’ve also wet the mitt slightly and I’ve always gotten great results. I like the spray the most. It lost one star because it Still smells like self tanner! FYI Buildable Tan
