I like this, but it’s more of an indulgence. It adds that really nice extra boost of hydration before my cream. I use it with my Avene thermal water spray and it just sinks right into my skin with a trace. Which is great because I prefer using multiple lighter, quick absorbing moisturizing products in the morning so I can get out of the door quickly. It also doesn’t irritate my dry, sensitive skin or have much of a scent. I don’t feel it plumps up my skin, but it moisturizes and my skin is soft after application. Asethically, it has a really fun liquid jelly like texture and I like that its pink. I’m giving it 4 stars because it does exactly what it says it will and it suits my needs better than other hyaluronic acids I’ve tried (absorbs faster and better than other hyaluronic acids I’ve tried and it has a nice texture), but it’s expensive. An indulgence
