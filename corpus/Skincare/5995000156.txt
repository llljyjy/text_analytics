I received this product from Sephora Collection in exchange for my honest review. I deal with a lot of texture on my skin along with hyperpigmentation from previous acne. I’ve used this product a few times since receiving it and I can already see a major difference in my skin texture and overall complexion. The Resurfacing Peel Mask is gentle enough for my sensitive skin, but still be careful and do a patch test first to make sure you don’t have a reaction! Skin smooth as butter
