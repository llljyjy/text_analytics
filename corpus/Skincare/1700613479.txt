I’m really loving this moisturizer, especially during the hot summer months! It smells very fresh and citrusy but not overwhelming. The texture is light and leaves my skin feeling hydrated but not sticky or greasy. My skin soaks it in right away. I’m really impressed with this product. perfect for summer
