I really wanted to like this… I thought it would be perfect for winter because the air in my house was super dry but my skin is oily and this broke me out. I don’t think this is a bad product just not for me. I would recommend this if you have dry skin. I am finishing this up as it is pricey but I’m mixing it with a gel cream. not for oily skin
