YOU GUYS… this isn’t like any other cleanser I’ve tried (I work in cosmetics so I’ve tried a lot). It’s so thick and so smooth! It’s slightly grainy, but that’s how it polishes away dry skin - and does so gently! It’s scent is subtle and pleasant. I ran the ingredient list through a website that translates chemicals, and absolutely NOTHING harmful came up. No complex fragrance, no PEGs, no silicone, and no sulfates. I’m in love. OH MY GOD
