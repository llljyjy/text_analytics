I thought the Aqua water bomb was nice and saw a sleeping mask so I decided to try it. This jelly is super thick and I have to stick my fingers in it and mix it around to be able to pick up a little bit. It feels like water and gelatin... Not sure how much itâ€™s benefiting my skin, but still trying it out. How do you pick it up?
