I have been using this product for over 1 month and still have plenty left. You only need 1-2 pumps and it goes a long way. Considering I was changing my morning routine to try this product the first 2 weeks I was not sure if I liked it because it had an oily feel. I knew my skin was still adjusting and kept with it and after 2 weeks I stopped having the oily feel.I have gotten several compliments that my skin looks great. What I like about this product is that it has multiple good ingredients that you would typically have to buy separately which would be more expensive and add more time to the morning routine. It has hyaluronic acid which is good for adding moisture and plumpness, vitamin C which is a good antioxidant and good to prevent aging, niacinamide which is good for anti-aging and inflammation, and ferulic acid which is pure gold. This product I think is great for those who are not ready to buy medical graded product and needs a quick/simple morning routine that is effective. This product does not cake and glides on smoothly. I highly recommend this product. A must have for morning routine
