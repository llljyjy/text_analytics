The Kosas Plump & Juicy Spray on Serum is a great addition to any skincare routine! I have been a licensed Cosmetologist for over 17 years and skincare is one of my specialties. This product had me at plumping and probiotics. At 36 years old, my skin is starting to lose the fullness that it used to have. I have also been trying to get better at taking probiotics in the past few years and I love that they are now being incorporated in skincare to. I love that this spray is unscented and vegan. It is very easy to apply and gives you a spa like feel. My skin soaked this spray serum up. After using it for a few weeks, it didnâ€™t cause my super sensitive acne prone skin any irritation. I think this spray serum would be great for anyone looking to speed up their skincare routine. Great addition to my skincare routine!
