Caudalie broke the first rule of business--if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it! This reformulation of the best moisturizing toner on the market (I’ve used it for well over a decade) is awful. I am not buying another drop of this. The old toner just glided across my face--it was perfect. This reformulation is much less emollient, and drags across my face, wrinkling and balling up the cotton pad. So I am joining many other reviewers here in looking for a new toner. I did manage to score some bottles of the old formula that will last me a year or two, but I am also sampling long-term replacements. Why, Caudalie, why?
