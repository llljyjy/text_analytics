Can not speak well enough of this product! Goes on in a primer-feel texture with absolutely no white cast.  As I have gone through Accutane, my face is fairly sensitive to the sun. I was preparing for a week in Mexico and needed a good sunscreen to last me, and took a chance on this and LOVED IT. Recommended to my family and will only buy this moving forward. I bought the smaller size and it lasted me the full week and still have a lot left. Highly recommend!!
