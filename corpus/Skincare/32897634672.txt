this particular sunscreen was very recommended but it does have a very strong smell, texture and scent is of a toothpaste, overall is very good for skin, it makes it cool and feel cool and bright. it’s smooth and smells expensive. i got the smallest of this product very pricey tho, 15$ for a the mini, but i will keep using it and seeing if it’s for me. thoughts on this purchase
