I’ve never tried any skin care product that was over 100$ before but I received this for free to test out and let me tell you I’m a little impressed. My skin was becoming super dry because I just had a baby a few months ago and haven’t been able to keep up with my skin care. I’ve been using this twice a day for about 2 weeks now and my skin is hydrated making the slight wrinkles I have look non-existent. My skin also feels really smooth when I apply my makeup. Would I pay 135$ for this? Hmmm maybe. I have to continue using it to be able to answer that honestly. I’ve used other products that are cheaper that have given me similar results but then again it’s only been 2 weeks.  So far I’m really loving it Pretty Awesome Serum
