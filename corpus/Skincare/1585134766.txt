I received the Estée Lauder advanced night repair eye gel-creme complimentary to try and I am loving it. Unlike some other eye creams, this goes on smooth and absorbs so well into your skin. It’s mildly yet pleasantly scented. After just over a week of use I can tell that my eyes look more refreshed and less tired. I think the value is there and I will be purchasing this in the future! Great eye cream!
