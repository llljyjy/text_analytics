Iâ€™ve been using this product for the last week and I was sold when I heard Niacinamide was one of the ingredients included. I have pretty dry skins so I use 3 pumps and I love the overall feel and and texture of the serum. Super lightweight, hydrating and glowing! A new go-to in my morning routine
