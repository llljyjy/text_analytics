I was really was hoping this would work cause heard a lot of people really liked it. However, the minute I used it my skin was burning it felt like I was using nail polish acetone on my face. I tried to get use to it but it made me break out like crazy for the first time in a year! On top of that my entire face is swollen, puffy, itchy, and red! It also made my skin peel and even more dry (I have dry skin). Just straight up feelings I put cooking oil on my face. For the sake of skin DO NOT USE OR BUY IT! ITâ€™S NOT WORTH IT! I recommend La Roche Posay Toner if you have dry & sensitive skin like I do. Breakouts and Allergic reaction!!
