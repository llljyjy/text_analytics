Pros No white cast given slight tintLight weight No scentSensitive skin friendlyConsExpensive but on par with my comparable (unseen)ImpressionI love this. May make the switch from goop to this as my favorite given itâ€™s a mineral based and has all the other pros I attributed to Unseen. Applies well with or without makeup. Slightly tinted but not a tinted moisturizer- rely on other products for coverage. nan
