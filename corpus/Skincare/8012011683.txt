this solves everything, I have normal skin, it’s more on the dry side and I have like small bumps/texture on my forehead. Usually heavy moisturizers make me greasy and gel or very light moisturizers don’t do enough for me, but this is like the perfect medium. It’s hydrating af but not greasy at all, if feels so fresh and this under my makeup made the biggest difference when it came my my under eyes creasing. Usually it’s crease city under my eyes no matter the concealer or eye cream I use, this product is so great and I can’t recommend it enough for girlies with normal skin types!! dreamy moisturizer
