I love Laneige as I have collected and used many lip sleeping masks. I am so glad I ordered this Mango lip sleeping mask as it smells like the mango fruit and it is so hydrating and moisturizing on my lips like a lip balm/chapstick I used it in the daytime and love it before sleep time too. I highly recommend getting this mango lip sleeping mask ASAP as it is a limited edition scent. Amazing Mango Scent - Very Moisturizin On Lips !!
