I got to try this #freeproduct through #topbox. I was unsure how well the product would work, considering the small size of the sample. Pleased to say that the serum was very hydrating, went on well and needed very little. It lasted longer than I had anticipated - a little went a long way! I didnâ€™t see a huge difference but I did notice a small one. I think if I continued to use it, I would definitely see improvement. I have combination skin, and some products can be tricky, leaving my skin oily, but this one did not. Would definitely recommend this one for anyone over 30 with combination skin. Great product
