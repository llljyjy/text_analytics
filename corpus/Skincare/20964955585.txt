I received this sample from influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. I have beentrying to find the best moisturizer for my face since after having my second child, my pores have gotten bigger,  half of my face stays dry and flaky while the other half stays oily somehow. I have tried quite a few different ones now but I’m so glad I got this moisturizer to test because I will be buying for sure. The cream itself is a nice silky, thicker cream that instantly feels nice and smooth when putting on. I’ve been using for a few weeks now and can honestly say I do see a difference.  My skin tone looks more even and brighter.  It’s been helping my fine lines.  Im excited to continue to see the results after longer use. Love it, Can Definitely See A Difference
