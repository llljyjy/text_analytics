After stopping birth control in my 30s, my skin went from being a little dry but no pimples in 10 years to I-must-be-back-in-high-school-oily. I was breaking out everyday and none of my previous makeup or skin care worked for my skin when my hormones changed. I got a sample with my points at some point and decided to try it when I was trying to find a new cleanser. I probably tried 8 different types over 10 weeks and this was the ONLY cleanser that didn’t make me breakout. I use it every night after getting home from work and taking off my makeup. It’s worth spending the money and getting the big bottle! nan
