Ok I was reading these reviews that claim that it’s a miracle mask, kinda skeptical… But now I’m a believer! I’ve used this for a week now 3 different nights and when I wake up in the morning my post acne marks are SO much lighter! I’ve never found a product that has worked this quickly and believe me I’ve tried them all. This also helped with my texture I had some milia and they even look better! This is worth the money! If you have dryer skin put your moisturizer on and then lay this on top before bed SO worth it!!
