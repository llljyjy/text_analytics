It’s ok... if that. I have very dry skin, so perhaps this is meant for someone with a normal skin type? I just found it thin and not hydrating at all. Plus, is it just me, or does it have an odd scent? It just didn’t do much of anything for me. I also found that my eyelids became very sensitive while using this... but can’t be sure if I can attribute that to the cream or a few other products I was using. Overall, it was just a wasted step in my routine. Made zero difference in my skincare routine.
