Bought this on sale and it was really good at extracting my blackheads fast and efficiently. I used it right after my hot shower so my pores were open and my skin prepped (wet) for extraction.Four stars because Iâ€™m not sure the serum infuser function really does anything, but the extraction function is great. Worth it when purchased for half price, not so much full price. works great for blackheads!
