I have been a devout user of Dr. Dennis Gross Extra Strength peel pads for many years, and they are a staple in my skincare routine. I’ve started to get a small amount of very fine wrinkles on my forehead and, sadly, slightly deeper lines around my eyes, so I was so excited to see this product. I have been using 2-3 times per week for 3 weeks now, and I’ve noticed a modest improvement in the lines on my face, and nice glow and smoothness. After the first use, I woke up the next morning with flaky skin, and an uncomfortable dryness that lasted for days. My skin adapted after a couple uses, but be prepared. My biggest, and probably only complaint is the price. These don’t do much more than the regular peel pads, yet they are significantly more expensive. I realize these aren’t for every day use like the other pads, so it makes sense they come in smaller quantities, but the price is not justifiable. I don’t mind spending money on quality products but, unless the price per pad comes down, or if I get them during a sale, I won’t repurchase. Noticeable improvement but doesn’t justify price.
