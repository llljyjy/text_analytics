This is a great gradual tanner! Probably one of the quickest gradual tanners I have used. Takes about 1-2 days to get pretty dark (which I love because I am very, very pale!). The smell doesn’t bother me, I actually like it and feel like it masks the classic “self tanner” smell. I would really try this out if your looking for a way to prolong a self tan (the way I use this product) or on its own! Very nice 12/10 ✨ THIS IS GREAT!!
