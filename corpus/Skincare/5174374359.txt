This is my first ever Tata Harper product and I enjoy it. Generally with eye creams I am not looking for a magic pill. I need an eye cream with a good texture that keeps my eye area soft and moisturized and if it fades my dark circles somewhat then that’s a bonus. This eye cream feels so nice around eyes. It doesn’t have a strong scent which I prefer for products going close to my eyes, and it really keeps my eye area very soft and moisturized throughout the day. I love that a little goes a long way and it will take a while before I am done with this bottle. It is pricey and I don’t know if I will purchase this myself due to the cost/there being other more affordable eye creams, but it it’s a nice to have. Mine came pre-filled, so I’m not quite sure where the refillable mechanism is. Gifted by Tata Harper Skincare. A Nice eye cream but expensive
