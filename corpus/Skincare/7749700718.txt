I read a review that recommended these drops. It works great to balance the redness in my complexion. Iâ€™m on Zoom calls for work and it was bothering me that my face looked so red. These drops work great. I use more than the recommended 2-3 drops. Then I put foundation on after and it looks great. it Works!
