I’m giving 3 stars simply because I do think the product is very nourishing and lasts a good amount of time. Unfortunately the color (blueberry) was not berry or lavender at all. It’s hot pink. Ever since Lipstick Queens “hello sailor” stopped being produced, I have been on a quest to find the perfect balm that provides a true berry color for those of us with warm/neutral undertones. Oh well…the search continues. Moisturizing but Not Berry-Toned
