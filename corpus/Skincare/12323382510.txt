Pro: This is a nice, rich moisturizer that doesn’t sit too heavy. Silky smooth texture feels luxurious to apply. It works great for the winter months in particular. However,Con: it’s too rich to use in the summer, and does leave my skin shiny so I would only use it in the evening. It’s also far too expensive.I have combo sensitive skin that is prone to acne breakouts. Very nice, but too expensive.
