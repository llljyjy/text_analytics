** Incentivized ** I received this trial size product of Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Gel-Crème Synchronized from Estée Lauder and Influenster for free in exchange for an honest review. Before I start my review, I should state I was very familiar with a previous version of this product before receiving it. I had previous retail employment with a major department store retailer and had sold this product for years.  Anyone who has used this product is aware of its ability to make the skin feel smoother and some might say plumper.  I didn’t used this product as recommended day and night. I only used it on days I felt puffy from allergies or loose from drainage. I did also layer it with a facial mist or hydration cream.  That being said my results won’t be the same as yours, I used it as a temporary aid rather than a prescribed method of prevention. This is a nice product alone but I prefer the face serum be used with it. If it helps; I’m 38 years old, seasonal allergies sufferer, with inconsistent sleeping habits, and I don’t wear makeup often since we started the pandemic. #complimentary #esteelauderxInfluenster @Influenster @esteelauder Recharging Eyes
