I got this item complimentary from Dermaligica Sampling. This cleanser has a very unique texture. It starts off as a fine powder and when you add a bit of water and mix it together, you get a very frothy foam! This is how you are supposed to use this cleanser, not as a powder. Once you get this for thy foam, you can massage the cleanser onto your skin and the gentle exfoliating ingredients will help exfoliate and clean the skin! I love this formula because with my dry skin type, I can easily over exfoliate and dry my skin out. This formula is so light, luxurious, and gentle that I don’t have to worry about damaging or drying out my skin. It’s great for using daily to really get grime and makeup out of your pores. The cleanser doesn’t really have an fragrance to it, which is great for sensitive skin types. I find you only need about a dime sized amount or the powder and the bottle lasts forever! This cleanser is great for all skin types and I can’t imagine my routine without it! It really cleanses my skin without stripping it and it makes the texture of my skin so smooth and soft! I highly recommend it! Smoother skin and health overall
