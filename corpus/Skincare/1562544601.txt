I always love to use a hyaluronic acid serum anytime I wash my face. I was excited to try this one since YttP never goes wrong for me, and I am happy with this product. Feels great on the skin. Not sticky and thick, works well under my moisturizer. Itâ€™s pricey but will last a long time. great serum
