I really love this product. I have adult acne and very sensitive skin. I have oily skin, but acne products often leave my skin too dry, which causes more breakouts. On the flipside, non-acne products are often too gentle and don’t provide the deep clean I need, which also causes more breakouts. So it’s a bit of a goldilocks situation trying to find the right products. After trying many, many cleansers, I gave this one a try. It is the perfect balance of cleansing and gentle, leaving my skin feeling clean but not tight. The price is amazing, this product is much better than cleansers I’ve tried that are 2x, 3x, 4x this price. Best Cleanser
