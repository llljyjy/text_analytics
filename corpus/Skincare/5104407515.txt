I was so excited that Sulwhasoo gifted me this product to try. I love the creaminess of this product! It smells so good and your skin feels instantly hydrated upon application. However, after leaving it on over night, I woke up with dry skin. Iâ€™m not sure this product is for deep, penetrated moisture. I would use it more as a daily moisturizer rather than an overnight moisturizer. Great product, but as a daily moisturizer
