I have skin that is prone to having monthly breakouts and as a result I have a few current blemishes I’m dealing with in addition to some lingering dark spots. I was surprised by the texture of this spot treatment,  it’s quite oily feeling and doesn’t really sink into skin but rather stays somewhat oily even after having it on all night.  I thought that would bother me but it wasn’t a big deal and after I saw how well it worked I’m sold on its effectiveness! The before/after photo shows the reduction in my current breakout after only one night.  Now that I’ve used it for about a week on the same spots they’re barely even noticeable. When I get breakouts they linger on and on but this has completely nipped them in the bud & drastically reduced the healing time.  It’s worth every penny! It works!!
