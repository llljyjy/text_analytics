I received this Gucci Brume de Beauté Beauty Mist to review from Voxbox. The packaging and bottling is lovely, it’s a weighty glass bottle and the spray comes out in a fine mist, so you can adjust how much you want to layer easily without feeling like you’ve overdone it. I tried this on a fresh washed face and I found my skin felt hydrated, soft, and non sticky for hours after I applied.  I didn’t use any moisturizer so I could judge the spray on its own and I was pleasantly surprised at how soft my skin felt with only this on it, and my skin is normally very dry. This Mist also has a very subtle rose scent that was nearly non detectable, which I prefer in my skincare.  I think this would work great as a setting spray since the Mist is so fine, as well as a midday face refresh! I did apply Moisturiser over it after a while and my skin felt super soft.  I find this product to be very refreshing. Lovely!
