I was nervous using this since other people got immediate breakouts and I’m sensitive and acne prone. I’m so pleasantly surprised! It’s very hydrating like a ha serum but my acne breakouts are going away without the crazy dryness when using other serums. I really like this stuff I recommend. Most people want fast acting acne serums but then you get dry peeling skin. This is gentle and effective. nan
