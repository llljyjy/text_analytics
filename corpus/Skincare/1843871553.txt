I love this and was honestly surprised to see negative reviews. I have VERY sensitive skin and I tolerate this serum so well. I first apply my moisturizer, then shake serum well and apply all over my face, then set with a mineral powder. It can look very dewy since I first apply moisturizer but the mineral powder balances the shine and I get so many compliments on how my skin looks. It evens out skin tone and feels very light, not suffocating on the face. Love it!
