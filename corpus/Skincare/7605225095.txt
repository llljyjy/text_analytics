Everything about this essence is perfect. It’s unscented, lightweight, and packaging is luxe. I’ve also noticed a definite improvement in my skin texture and dark spots while using this. Four stars ONLY because the price is outrageous. Will I continue buying this? Yes. Begrudgingly. I hate to admit it… but this stuff works.
