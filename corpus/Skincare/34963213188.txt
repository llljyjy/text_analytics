I was so excited about this product. I have been dealing with dry skin for years especially during winter months. I have to say just after a couple days I could see a difference, so I gave it more time and I am truly a lover of this product. I used it as a nighttime moisturizer and morning. My skin is not dry and it just feels so soft and smooth. I will absolutely buy this again and recommend to anyone tht wants soft and supple skin. AMAZING!
