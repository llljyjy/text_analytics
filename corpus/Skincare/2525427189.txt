Years ago I used the old formulation of this BB cream and I remember thinking it was ok but felt kind of heavy and greasy. This formulation is SO different! I’m using the fair-light shade. When the product is in your hand it kind of has a weird gray tinge to it so I was skeptical on it matching my skin tone, which has strong yellow undertones. But as soon as I put it on it blended beautifully! A little goes a long way but it was smooths out my skin and adds a nice glow. My skin feels like it can breath and the spf 40 is a big plus. I’m really happy with this bb cream for light even coverage. Love it!
