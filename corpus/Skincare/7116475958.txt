Tan is just okay, but what turns me off is the smell. Terrible self-tan smell develops after a few minutes and lasts all day for me. It actually distracts me and I am NOT sensitive to fragrances. Also after a few days the tan starts coming off in patches... will not be using this anymore. Bad self-tan smell
