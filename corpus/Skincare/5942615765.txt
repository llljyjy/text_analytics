I received a sample of this product from PinchMe, in exchange of my honest review. Ok, so you have to read the instructions carefully before using this product. I did and still got no results, there is no tint, it feels oily and icky when applying and when applying it cakes. It took me forever to wash it off my hands and had to end up using baby wipes. There was absolutely no coverage. The only good thing is the SPF40. I would not buy nor recommend this product. Not for me
