I received this product as a free sample in exchange for my honest opinion. My impression of the Dior Capture Totale Super Potent Eye Serum is wonderful. The application of the product was refreshing. I have fine lines, dark circles and puffiness and can honestly say it helped in reducing the issues. The smell is very pleasant and serum is hydrating without being too sticky. In my picture, you can see the product after five minutes of application help with my skin issues. Definitely a win!! Yes, I would recommend!!
