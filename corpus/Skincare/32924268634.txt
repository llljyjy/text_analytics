I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. I have used other retinol products in the past and have seen quicker results. I think it did an ok job and reducing some fine lines but not as quick as some others out there. For the price I think there are better products. It did not leave the skin dry or red which is good so Iâ€™m happy with that. It works but just ok.
