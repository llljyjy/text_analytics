I am surprised at how much I like this product. just a little bit goes a long way and 20 spf is the perfect amount for me. I used this at the beach on my face, neck, chest and shoulders and never got burnt. I got a nice subtle tan. the addition of the hyaluronic acid made a huge difference too, my skin looks healthier now than before I used it. it’s a bit pricey for sunscreen but I’m actually using this daily as a daytime moisturizer. I would buy it again especially if it was on sale! Nice
