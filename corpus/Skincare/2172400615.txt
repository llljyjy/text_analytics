I’ve been using Lancome Absolue Revitalizing Eye for two weeks now. I’ve tried several eye creams in the past few years. I really like the creamy texture of this one over many others. It glides on well, soaks in enough to not feel greasy while leaving the tender eye area fully hydrated. Which is important when applying makeup over moisturizer. This eye cream is a nice base for makeup. While a little pricey, the jar is a generous size compared with other eyecreams and a little goes a long ways. It should last a while. I haven’t yet noticed much difference in the circles and fine lines, but only two weeks in, I don’t expect it. I will continue using it and look forward to results in a month or so. nan
