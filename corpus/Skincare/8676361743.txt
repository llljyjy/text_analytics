Gifted by dermalogica sampling - I’ve used this product before in the past and it’s a great cleanser to use after your first cleanse. However even with the fine micro beads I don’t recommend this with everyday use or if you have sensitive skin. Using this as a 1-2x a week treatment is way better! nan
