Love the sunscreen but hate the container. It leaks and spews out with the barest squeeze and it doesn’t stop right away. I lost a lot of product. The texture of the sunscreen is just right - it’s a thin liquid that isn’t chalky, doesn’t pill, and doesn’t leave a white cast. Very pleased with the product overall but taking away 1 star because of the horrible container. Favorite sunscreen
