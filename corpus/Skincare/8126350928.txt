I have a hard time finding products that don’t leave my skin dry and flaky. The serum and cream leave my skin VERY moisturized. It is pricier for the full sized products but if it’s the only formula that works for my skin then it will be worth it. I tried this product because a Sephora employee told me it was comparable to my usual go-to moisturizer biossance omega repair cream which is a wee bit more pricey than the YTtP formula . Essential for winter skin season
