I received this product for free from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review. Shisheido makes some of my favorite sunscreens. The dilemma is the ones I love are all chemical. I would like to find a more natural one that is mineral based. One that doesnt feel and look like a mask. So, I was excited to try this out. It definitely does its main job of protecting you from the sun. I tested it out for hours one day. I was in the direct sun without any burns or redness, and I am really pale and burn super easy. It is water resistant, has no smell, lightly mattifying, and wears well under make-up. Best of all it is truly light weight, not greasy or heavy, which I Iove! Now the problems... just like other mineral sunscreens it leaves a white cast that sticks to any pieces of dry skin, and collects into creases. Everytime I looked in the mirror, I would have to wipe away the sunscreen that had collected. Despite this, itâ€™s at the top of my list for MINERAL sunscreens, and I will most likely buy another when I run out. Good....for a mineral sunscreen!
