This sunscreen reminds me a lot of the biore sunscreen. It has a light scent thatâ€™s typical of Japanese sunscreens. Super moisturizing with hyaluronic acid, and it absorbs pretty quickly. I love this as a makeup base!! I love that this applies like a serum rather than a thick sunscreen. Received complimentary for review from influenster. nan
