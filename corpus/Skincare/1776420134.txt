I received this product free from Influenster for my honest review.I was excited to try Dior’s new Cica Recover Balm. It has an interesting waxy yet moisturizing consistency due to the chamomile wax, which I think helps to lock in moisture. Definitely more on the heavy side, and if you have wintery dry skin like me, you’ll love it…it’s like the  “slugging” trend without that greasy feeling. See the nice glow on my skin? Love it!
