I have enjoyed using this night cream for the past three weeks. I have combo skin and I feel this cream is not too thick for me. It is the perfect consistency to moisturize my skin without feeling too heavy. It is also lightly scented but not offensive. It reminds me of a high end spa scent. I think it is pleasant. Overall, I enjoyed the night cream. My skin felt more hydrated, plump, and softer. I would recommend. Nice night cream
