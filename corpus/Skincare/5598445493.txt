I love this so much. I first got a sample to try out. I was able to use the sample for 3 days. A little goes a long way. So that’s the first thing I liked about this. I have very very dry skin and I’m 41. I have never seen my make up look better. My fine lines are almost non existent under foundation now. My crows feel look so much better. My foundation ever cakes. I’m obsessed. All while getting spf. My face doesn’t feel tight anymore by the end of the day. I’m so happy I tied this. I already put another in my cart to have on hand. hydration!
