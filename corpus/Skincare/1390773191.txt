I really liked this sunscreen for my dry and sensitive skin. I was excited to see hyaluronic acid as one of the ingredients as I know that helps with moisturize and my dry skin seems to respond well to it in my other skincare products! The sunscreen went on smoothly. I didn’t get an type of irritation so it’s definitely good on sensitive skin. I like the sleek and compact packaging too! Great sunscreen!
