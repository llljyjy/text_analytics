Clogs my pores and doesn’t moisturize as much as I need for these harsh Canadian winters. I have oily/combo skin and use Tret… and this didn’t help at all. I’m a huge Farmacy fan and this is by far my least favourite product. Consistency is like room temp margarine and the fragrance is like old honey, it doesn’t bother me but it lingers and might bother some. not for me
