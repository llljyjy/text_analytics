I throughly like this cream. Laneige used to make me break out when I was in the early teens, I figured I would try it again. I have been using it for 2 weeks now as a day/night cream. It leaves my skin so soft, no break outs and the smell is so subtle not over powering at all. The packaging is very slick as well. I will definitely be purchasing again. love!!
