I’ve gone through three bottles of this cleanser, currently finishing off the fourth. If you double cleanse, I think it’s great for your second cleanse specifically or for a morning cleanse when you don’t really have makeup or product to remove. I wouldn’t necessarily use it as a first cleanse which is why I knocked down a star, but if I could, I’d give it more of a 4.5/5 rating. I find it’s very gentle and feels soothing when you apply, but it doesn’t really lather (which I don’t mind). I live in AZ where the weather is dry, and it doesn’t feel my skin feeling stripped after washing which I appreciate. I’ve noticed my skin isn’t as red when using it in comparison others. It's nice.
