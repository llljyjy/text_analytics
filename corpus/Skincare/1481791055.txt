I have used this product faithfully for six years, and I have the skin to show for it -- at almost 70, virtually flawless. BUT -- the last bottle I used had the problems a number of women have been complaining about here -- the product, usually a white midweight cream -- had separated. Shaking did nothing to remedy the watery weird texture, and the last week of use a clear grease came out. I wasn’t sure whether this was actually “the good stuff“ or just useless base carrier. Whatever -- I won’t be buying this again until the company addresses the problem. Not sure what to use in place of it, but that’s what I will find. Once-great product now just gross
