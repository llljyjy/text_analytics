I recently received this moisturizer to try in a sample size the bit I tried was creamy lightly scented unfortunately it was a little too strong for me and It irritated my skin a bit. I do not recommend this cream for someone with sensitive skin or those that suffer from redness. I ended up giving the rest that was left to my mom who liked it she has more of combination skin not as sensitive as mine. Nicely scented but was not for sensitive skin.
