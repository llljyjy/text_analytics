I received this product as a free sample from Influenster. It was my first time trying a Tula product. I was impressed with the packaging, the box was simple yet informative, the bottle is very nice looking and good quality. The texture and look of the serum is a clear, white liquid, it easily comes out and is easy to apply. I use it on my face before bed. It absorbs into my skin overnight and makes my face look more clear the next day. It has a light scent to it that I actually enjoy. Overall I was impressed with this product and Iâ€™m going to try it again in the future. Moisturizing
