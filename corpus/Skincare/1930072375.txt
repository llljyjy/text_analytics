I don’t normally use tools to help clean my face, but I got this as a free sample so I decided to give it a try. It is really gentle on the skin and does help me remove makeup. I can even use it on my eyelids!! I can’t use micellular water because it irritates my skin so I usually just keep washing my face until my makeup is gone and this definitely helps break up the makeup and get it off of my face. It’s also lasted for much longer than I thought it would. I’ve been using it regularly for about a month and it still looks pristine. Good at removing Makeup
