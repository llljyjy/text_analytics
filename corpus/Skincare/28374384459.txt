I’ve used this for the past week and it definitely has its pros and cons. I have oily-combination, acne prone, light-medium (3.5 in Kosas concealer) skin.Pros: * Matte through entire day* Cosmetically elegant* Slight tint covered a bit of my acne scarsCons:* Slight white cast on me (definitely wouldn’t work for deeper skin tones* Drying if used alone (make sure to put on moisturizer before)* Expensive Overall, I wouldn’t repurchase tbh just because of the price, but maybe if it was on sale I’d think about it. nan
