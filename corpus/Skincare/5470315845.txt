Does exactly what it says it will. For the price, it’s a very good size that lasts a while. I like how it’s not super greasy, and it is completely unscented so it’s not irritating. I really like this product a lot more than I thought I would, and it’s worth it to not have to pay $30 for a makeup remover. No frills but works!
