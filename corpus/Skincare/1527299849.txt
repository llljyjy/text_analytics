This is the perfect first step in my skincare routine. I have issues with my skin barrier being damaged, so having a soothing and repairing product is a must for me. This lotion feels more like a toner or watery serum, but I really enjoy the texture of it. The formula makes it penetrate into my skin easily, and every time I have used it, I have noticed less redness and skin irritation overall. Using this in the morning as my first step also creates a great base for my makeup and Iâ€™ve noticed a difference with how it wears. I highly recommend this product. nan
