I’ve been using this product for almost a week now and have fallen in love! I really enjoy how luxurious it feels and knowing that it’s working for my skin! It’s similar to an oil in consistency so I like to use it in the am to gua sha. It gives me a lovely glow with my makeup. I also love that it condenses my am routine since I don’t have to apply niacinamide and hyaluronic acid separately with this product! A Go-To Serum!
