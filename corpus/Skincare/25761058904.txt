Every time I went to Sephora I would use the sample bottle and I loved it! I finally purchased it and I love it just as much! I have dry skin with large pores and this is perfect! It’s not too much and it’s not too little. My skin feels like I just went and got a facial, I would say it’s definitely worth the $90 considering facials are more than that! Also, it makes my wrinkles literally disappear!!!!! nan
