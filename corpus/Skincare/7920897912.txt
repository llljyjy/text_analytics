This treatment is nice because it’s gentle enough for sensitive skin and it won’t dry out the skin in that area. I also like the fact that it’s clear because it doesn’t leave a weird tint on your skin and can be worn under makeup. You can see a visible difference within 2 or 3 days of using this so I would recommend if you’re looking for a gentle acne treatment! nan
