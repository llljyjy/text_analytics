This is a super silky serum and feels great on. My dry combination skin loved this - especially overnight under the Dermalogica Skin Hydrating Masque. My skin looked glowy and refreshed in the morning. One note, I needed about 4 drops - or about half the dropper to really feel the serum on my skin. It might be personal preference, but I liked more rather than less here (which might sound strange to be calling out but I typically need so little of Dermalogica products to cover my face that it was noteworthy to me). @dermalogicacanada, @sephoracanada, #giftedbydermalogica Beautiful, moisturizing serum
