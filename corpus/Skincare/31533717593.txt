I have combo skin and dark under-eye circles, add in the fact that I just. had my first child this year --- cue EXTRA dark eye circles. Naturally, I am always on the hunt for magic cures and eye products. In July I was sent this product to try for an honest opinion, I have used this product daily since receiving and I have to say that I will probably be a lifelong Ole Henriksen fan. Stop trying to find cheap fixes, spend the extra money on superior products such as this. This product goes on smoothly and acts as an under-eye primer, it does not interfere with the integrity of my concealers or face makeup. After using this product for just shy of two months, I notice that the darkness under my eyes has reduced and that my skin feels overall smoother and more firm if that makes any sense. Since being sent this product, I have also purchased their moisturizer (today), Iâ€™ll review it once I try it for an extended period of time. This product is a clean formula which is always important to me. Overall this is a MUST TRY! A NEW LIFELONG FAN!
