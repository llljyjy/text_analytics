So, first impression: went on well, I understand why they refer to it as a balm, but not the greatest smell. Rinsed off surprisingly well! For the amount I used (maybe hf a tbumbnail’s worth?) There was some makeup left around my eyes, but that came off easily enough with CeraVe foaming cleanser. Overall decent balm! Glad I got it as part of a set, but I don’t wear make up enough to buy this on it’s own. Will be interested to see how this does against eye makeup First impression
