The holy grail of all creams I’ve tried to date. Use this 2x a day; skin is bouncy and I’ve had no dry spots this winter which is unusual for me. Price point is justifiable for the product being provided. Fairly confident this will be a lifetime moisturizer for me as long as they keep making it. Can’t wait to try the gel in the summer.
