Some things I really liked about this product: 1. The instructions are really clear. It replaced the toner step and should be used after cleansing but before moisturizer. 2. It’s vegan and focuses on using natural ingredients. Make sure you shake it first and keep in mind it’s very thin so use a washcloth or something rather than your fingers! The scent is really mild- reminds me a bit of calomine lotion. Good redness reducing toner
