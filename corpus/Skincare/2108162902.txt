I was given a sample of this the last time I shopped at Sephora.  I tried it later that night and it was love at first application. It has a nice smell and great consistency that it cleanses while also finely exfoliating.  It was great that it didnâ€™t feel like my skin was stripped of all moisture.  Definitely plan on purchasing a full-size of this face wash. nan
