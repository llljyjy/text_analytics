I have sensitive skin that tends to get greasy when I use facial sunscreens. I have been impressed with how my skin reacts to this product. It is lightweight and doesn’t leave a white cast on my skin. I haven’t noticed any increased oiliness, and my face does feel hydrated.  There is a light fragrance that doesn’t seem to linger. I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. nan
