I really enjoy this eye cream from Kiehlâ€™s. It is a great consistency that delivers hydration without looking and feeling greasy. A small amount goes a long way which is great for this small jar. It has lasted me for a long time with out making much of a dent in it. I have noticed a smoother and more youthful looking eye area after several weeks of use. I love this brand and their products and this will be one I def plan to repurchase once it runs out. Great eye cream
