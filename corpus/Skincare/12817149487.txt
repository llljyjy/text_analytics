I was gifted by outset to try this product and give my honestly review. I really like this product it’s very rich and creamy. A little product goes a long way. I used this product in my very last step of my nightly skin care routine and the next morning my skin was glowing. My skin was soft and hydrated! I love that it doesn’t have a scent to it and doesn’t irritated my sensitive skin. Thank you outset for this amazing gift. Good
