I loved the older version of this product, and I had to adjust to the reformulation. Now that I’m used to the new version of this product, I am amazed! I love how it wears on the skin. It is long lasting with a beautiful finish. I can use all creams or all powders with this foundation. It’s a great product and I hope Supergoop keeps it around for a long time! Holy Grail Foundation
