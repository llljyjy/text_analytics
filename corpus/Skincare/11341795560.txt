This is way to greasy and stays tacky feeling. I tried this so many ways and couldnâ€™t get it to work for me, I usually look for a moisturizing sunscreen. Forget wearing liquid foundation over it, even matte long wearing formulas look so oily in three hours. There are better formulas of sunscreen out there. La Roche Toleriane 30 spf is way better, regret buying this. Will probably use this on my body which is a shame. Greasy Mess
