I have been in love with this skin cream since the first use! I don’t usually like thick creams because my dry skin has a difficult time absorbing them. Not with this though. I just need a small amount and it’s perfectly hydrating. My skin is so soft and smooth now, I have to stop myself from touching my face all day. Great skin care!
