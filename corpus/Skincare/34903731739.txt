I’m not usually one to buy $80 products! But this one was one that actually surprised me! Literally my skin is so smooth now. I want to keep working to get rid of dark spots. But my face is looking totally different now. It really evened out my tone. I’m saving now to buy another bottle! Kinda worth the money if you got it to spend
