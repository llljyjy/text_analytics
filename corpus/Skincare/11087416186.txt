I was lucky enough to be chosen to receive free samples of Clarins Double Serum. Right off the bat, I have to say that I am a huge fan of Clarins products that I use on a daily basis. I loved this serum as it applies smoothly and leaves my skin feeling beautifully hydrated. My skin tends to react to overpowering beauty products, but that was not the case this time. In just a few applications, I really notice a difference with my skin which is more radiant and smoother. I would definitely recommend the Double Serum as it is well worth the price tag. Clarins does it again with another great product
