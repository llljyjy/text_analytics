I’m combination skin, not specifically super dry skin or anything. But this product is just not hydrating enough at all. Like, it’s just a soothing gel but doesn’t contain enough hydrating ingredients by any means. My skin dries up in few minutes after applying this, I doubt if there are many people loving this because you should have really oily skin to get on ok with just this moisturizer. Also it irritates my skin, I felt tingly sensation on my skin, which I’m not sure why it happened. Normally hyaluronic products doesn’t have any of those sensation on my face, so I don’t know why. Not repeating. It's for OILY SKIN people!
