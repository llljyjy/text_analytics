I bought these after watching a YouTube review and I’m so glad I did. I have tried so many skincare products over the years, but most of them have disappointed me. This is truly worth the price tag. I only use these pads twice per week (I am a student and cannot afford to buy a new box every month). However, I have noticed a transformation in my skin ever since I began using these. My skin tone is more even and balanced, makeup applies beautifully, scars are drastically lightened, and my skin is just happy overall. I was pretty nervous to use the extra strength at first, but I don’t feel any stinging or discomfort when using this product. For reference: my skin is combination, sensitive, and I recently went off the birth control pill. Worth the Money
