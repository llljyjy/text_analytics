This new reformulation of this moisturizer from Innisfree was a disappointment. It has a very thick texture and feels so sticky. It does not absorb very well so it cannot be used before makeup. My first impression was that it has very strong artificial green tea fragrant. I dont recommend it if you have sensitive sense. Otherwise, It works well for hydrating. However, it can only be used for night time instead of day time because your face will be shiny and sticky for the rest of the day. Thank you #trywithtopbox for sending me this #freeproduct and thank you #innisfree inorder to exchange for my honest review. Disappointed
