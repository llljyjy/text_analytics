I was lucky enough to get this from bzzzagent to test and boy do I love this!  I love the creamy not watery texture and how a little goes a long way!  I started this two weeks ago and I can already notice a difference in my skin.  My face was dry in some places and oily in others and now it’s just hydrated and smooth and it even looks brighter!I wash my face at night and put this on and I wake up and my skin just feels so good.I highly recommend this product!  In my opinion, it’s a little pricey, but ladies you can’t go wrong with this because as I said a little goes a long way! My skin is so hydrated
