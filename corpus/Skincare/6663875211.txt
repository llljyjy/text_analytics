I was recommended this product form one of the sales associate and it is horrible. I’m a mature woman with thin dry undereyes skin and it make it worse. You can’t set makeup and also enhances the dark circles under my eyes. Was told I can’t bring it back because I thrown out the box. So disappointed!I would not recommend this product at all. Disappointed
