This is a great cleansing oil, as part of a double-cleanse routine at night! I love it. On my third bottle now. I have sensitive, reactive, normal to dry skin, and this oil is really nice for taking off basic makeup / sunscreen. No stinging, super gentle, doesnâ€™t strip the skin. A little pricey, but hey, its sulwhasoo. On my third bottle - LOVE this cleansing oil.
