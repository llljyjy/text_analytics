I received a small, complimentary sample through Influenster, for testing purposes.This is a moisturizer that I use as more of a sleep mask. It’s thick without being greasy. It goes on pretty matte and my face doesn’t look shiny after applying. It also has a light floral scent, which I don’t mind, and I don’t really smell it on my face after a while.I was unable to use this for enough time to see any long term effects because of the small sample size, so after a couple weeks of using this sparingly at night time, I don’t see any major effects.However, overall I liked it as a sleep mask. Thick without being greasy
