I love this moisturizer! I was confused about what matte meant when it came to a moisturizer but I totally understand now. It instantly absorbers into your skin, leaving it so smooth and soft, not sticky at the lightest. After a minute, you would never know you put lotion on. It’s odd but perfect before make-up. It’s my new favorite day-time cream. The scent is a bit flourily, I don’t mind it but stronger than most of my other moisturizers New Am Moisturizer
