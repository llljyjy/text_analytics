What a GREAT product!  Sensitive skin?  No problem. Dior Cica Recovery Balm may be just what you need. It’s a light cream with a satiny feel.  It doesn’t cause me any breakouts and I believe that it eased (over a one week trial) the redness I have on my cheeks. It soaks right in without any greasy or oily residue. It goes GREAT under makeup. There are no artificial fragrances and has a very neutral smell. It’s very hydrating and leaves my skin very soft. I use it all over my face, neck and décolletage. Also on the backs of my hands. Highly recommended. Thank you to Sephora and Influenster for allowing me to try this product as a free sample. I will buy it in the future. Very hydrating, silky smooth, soaks right in!
