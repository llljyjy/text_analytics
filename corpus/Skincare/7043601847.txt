I used the original product for years and loved it but when they changed the formulation by adding in sunscreen I stopped using it. If I want sunscreen on my face I’ll choose it and the type but I don’t like it added to products. Dermatologists are now advising against the use of most sunscreen due to the bad chemical contents effect on skin. Stopped using it after formulation changed
