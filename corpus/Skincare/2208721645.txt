I was really hoping this product would be similar to the previous water bank product but it’s not. I immediately broke out after using this product which never happened with the previous version. It also has an oily finish so I can’t apply it before makeup, unlike the previous version that was more light on your skin. Super bummed. Not like previous version, save your money
