I really the light weight consistency of it and the fact that packaging has a pump. I found 1 pump to be enough to cover my neck and chest. As for results, it’s hard to say as I only use it a few times a week. I think this is a product I’ll gravitate towards more when I can use the extra moisture in my routine. nan
