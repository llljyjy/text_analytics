I received this product free as a sample with Influenster. I have skin thatâ€™s normal to oily and I applied this product as directed.The scent was nice and that was mostly the best thing about it. I love EL products but this missed the mark for me. It does not compare to my other skin care products. I honestly expected more and I would not purchase this in full bottle form. Ehhh not worth it
