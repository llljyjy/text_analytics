Ok so I wanted to fall in love with this cream so bad due to all the hype around it. I’m not saying I didn’t like it either though. First off it’s a thick cream which kinda just makes it feel like it would just suffocate your pores. And the smell wasn’t very pleasing. So the first night I used it I woke u with a couple little whiteheads which I believed was just because my skin isn’t use to a thick nighty moisturizer, but I wanted to like it so bad I was like “ let’s push through and give it another try “ That’s when I’m glad I did, after two weeks  I definitely noticed tighter better texture skin on my face and neck. My face looked plumped and more youthful. I feel good putting it on knowing that it’s backed by dermatologists. So I recommend give it a try, and just stick with it. Great little cream
