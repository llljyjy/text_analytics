I received this #freeproduct from Topbox in exchange for my honest review. I love how this moisturizer makes my skin feel. It’s so soft and light and doesn’t weigh down on my skin. I like to use it at night, just before bed. The scent is light as well. After using for about 2 weeks, my skin looks and feels younger in every way. Not to mention, the hydration it provides is outstanding! I highly recommend as a general moisturizer and anti-aging cream. Light, Hydrating Moisturizer
