I’ve never had an issue with packaging, myself (reading all the reviews!) and this products has travelled in my carry on on many international trips. I love anything I don’t have to put in that tiny liquid carry-on baggie security enforces. This is one more thing I don’t have to squeeze in there. Even when at home I love this for a quick touch up, or when my skin is very dry. I bought mine a couple years ago, so maybe the packaging was better back then? Anyway. Recommend, no scent in mine and my job requires my nose, so I’m sensitive to scent and do not even wear fragrance. Perfect for travel
