I really enjoy this cleaner as a first cleanse. It helps take off my makeup way faster and easier than if I were to just use one cleanser. I will say that you must wash this cleaner off with another one or else your face will be left feeling very oily. Love the fact that it doesnâ€™t have a scent. Good first cleanse
