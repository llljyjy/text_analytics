This serum has the best consistency of any serum I have tried. It goes on like a lotion instead of a gel and it doesn’t make my skin have that “tight“ dry feeling that I normally have after using a serum. After about a week of use I have noticed my skin texture feeling more even and smooth so I look forward to what it will look and feel like after longer use. The bottle is also nice and compact which might be irrelevant to some, but I really like being able to pack my skincare up when traveling without feeling like I packed more than I needed to. High quality serum.
