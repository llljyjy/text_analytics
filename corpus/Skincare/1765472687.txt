I really LOVE this Plump and Juicy Vegan Collagen Spray on Serum! First, it smells AMAZING! It has such a lovely floral scent that makes you feel like your skin is being pampered. The spray serum is Genious! I use it in the morning before I apply my moisturizer and it has added a spa feel to my normal skin care routine. My face feels so hydrated, soft, and the glow is undeniable. The peptides help my skin look young and glowing. The proteins and amino acids help to retain my skinâ€™s elasticity which everyone can use. Also, the hyaluronic acid keeps my skin moisturized ALL day! Ready to Pamper your face!
