I love how this cream has niacinamide in it because it is one of my favorite ingredients in skincare. I feel like this cream applies so nicely and leaves my skin looking and feeling very supple and just hydrated and healthier looking. I enjoy how this cream does not leave my face feeling greasy or as if I put too much on. This easily seeps into my skin and feels so soothing when I apply it on. Such a soothing cream
