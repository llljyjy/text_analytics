This is a pretty good moisturizer, I used the trial size I received with no huge complaints. This just doesnâ€™t outcompete some of my other favourite moisturizers. I think for someone like me with drier skin I prefer something thicker and creamier. I think if you have oilier skin this could be a good product for you! Again, no major complaints I was just meh on it for me. Not bad but not ideal for dry skin
