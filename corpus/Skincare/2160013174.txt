Wow! I can’t believe how quickly this product worked! I bought this because it is a fav of Hailey Bieber, and I know she deals with PD and sensitive skin. When I did research on the active ingredient, I was very interested to see how it would work for me. I am 11 weeks pregnant, and can’t take the antibiotics I normally take for my PD (which also helps with my mild acne). I was willing to try just about anything that would reduce bacteria and inflammation on my skin. The first spray I noticed reduction in redness. By the second application, the patch of PD that was by my lip disappeared! I purchased the mini just to try but will now be purchasing the full size. I highly recommend this product! I will say that I can feel a little bit of tingling on the areas of irritation after application, but it is not bothersome and I think that it’s just because the product is working. Great for Perioral dermatitis
