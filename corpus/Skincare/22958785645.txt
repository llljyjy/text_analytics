This stuff has so many benefits! I donâ€™t get pimples very often but it helps them and whiteheads go away, helps minimize pores. I ran out of the small bottle because my boyfriend started using it and didnt get a replacement right away.. I then could tell the difference with not having it. Someone today asked me what was different about me and couldnt figure it out. (No difference in hair, makeup, etc) I think it was my skin! Be careful though because it stings at first. Especially on any red spots. nan
