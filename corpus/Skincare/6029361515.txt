I really like how this product feels. It applies very smoothly and makes your skin feel instantly soft. It doesn’t feel greasy and it feels thick enough to let you know it’s working. The scent is very mild and pleasant. The only downside I see with this product is the price, but for a high-end product that works, it might just be worth it for you. Smooth, silky, a little bit expensive
