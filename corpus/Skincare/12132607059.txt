This definitely has a scent to it so if you are sensitive to them, take that into consideration. BUT it smells amazing! My fiancé told me I smelled fancy when I wore it lol. The glow it gives is a beautiful lit from within glow. My skin is very sensitive and it didn’t burn or break me out. It did make my pores look more smooth. The bottle itself is so beautiful!! It is worth it!
