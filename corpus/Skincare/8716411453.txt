I was sent this product by influenster to review and I will say, though I prefer chemical exfoliants to physical ones, this one is similar to the tatcha rice wash in how fine the exfoliant is. Works well, I didnâ€™t give it 5 stars because of the overwhelming scent it has. I steer away from face products with loads of scent nan
