This product is amazing! I have (or had before my mid-20s skin appeared) double dry skin and oil based or greasy moisturizers wouldn’t do anything for me. I actually found the concentrate first, but honestly they’re both go-tos for me now! Especially in the winter; I’ll use this, the concentrate, and the spray all together and my skin LOVES it. Never had any issues with my skin reacting either (I’m now a combination skin type and my skin still does not react). What I really love about this product in particular is that it’s a gel so it’s lightweight but still heavy enough to penetrate the barrier and moisturize my skin. Other moisturizers I’ve tried do not do that as easily, and again for someone who had a double dry skin type, it was very hard to keep my skin from getting thirsty. This SAVED my skin. I’ve also recommended it to a few friends with other skin types as well and they really liked it too! 5 stars all the way! I would also like to mention this product’s sister, the Moisture Surge Intense is not nearly as great as this one, and for having sensitive skin, it broke me out and my skin hasn’t been the same since. Best Moisturizer!
