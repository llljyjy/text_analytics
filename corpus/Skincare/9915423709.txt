Idk why I bought this product if my main problem was oil control. I used it for almost 2 months now, at first I did it every other day then I used it every night religiously. I wanted to make sure I was giving this product a chance, but my “purging” state keeps getting worst. I wake up w a new people everyday. I’m getting pimples on places I usually don’t break out from. Idk if I’m even purging anymore or if it’s actual breakouts. My pores look the same if not even more noticeable than before. It could be that i don’t know how to use this product, but it ruined my skin for sure. I wouldn’t recommend this to anymore who has a good routine going. Save your money guys ruined my skin
