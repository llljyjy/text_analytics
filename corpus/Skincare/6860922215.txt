I have combination skin, which means I need hydration without clogging my pores. This cream was perfect - gentle, smoothing, and does exactly what it promises. It sinks into my skin quickly, and combines well with my other serums and makeup, no pilling here. Plus, I love the grape smell! My skin loves this cream!
