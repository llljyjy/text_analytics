I purchased all the products from their website when they launched, so I’ve been using them for about 2 months now. I have to say my favorite products are the serum & the eye cream. The serum absorbs beautifully and has no fragrance which I love. It’s not going to be life Chanukah but if you are looking for a serum to add some vitamins & hydration in your routine… this one’s great! 2 months later!
