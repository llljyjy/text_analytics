I haven’t been using this product for very long, but I’m starting to see my complexion beginning to become a little more clear and brighter. It has a very subtle smell (mostly natural) and a refreshing watery consistency. I’ve really enjoyed adding this into my morning routine and followed by sunscreen. Would recommend! nan
