So as other reviewers noted, this is definitely not a cream- it’s more the consistency of a lip balm. Initially, I found that it was hard to get it to absorb, but after a few days of trying it started absorbing very well and there was an immediate, noticeable change in the texture of my neck. It is much, much softer and smoother than it’s been in years, and somewhat tightened as well. I used the little trial size, and liked it so much I went ahead and got the big one. Highly recommend if you have crepey skin on your neck, this stuff works- it just takes a little persistence at the start. Regarding the scent, it’s a little lemony, and a little medicinal, but I don’t find it too strong or off-putting. To each their own, though- if you’re sensitive to scented products this might not be for you. Not a cream, but it works
