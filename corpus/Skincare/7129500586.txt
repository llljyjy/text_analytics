I’ve been using this cleanser for a year and I really enjoy it! I use it as a second cleanse after the ordinary squalene cleanser at night, and alternate between the two in the morning depending on what I think my skin needs. I have oily acne prone skin, and I feel like this cleanser deeply cleans my skin without stripping it. If you leave it on for a long time before rinsing it can feel a bit drying so you just have to watch out for that, but as soon as you put moisturizer on that feeling goes away. I don’t think it does too much for my deeper hormonal acne (I started using prescription retinoids for that), but for smaller breakouts and clogged pores it’s helped a lot. It’s very affordable and concentrated, you only need to use a little bit so the bottle lasts a long time! I’d definitely recommend trying it if you have oily sensitive skin and are looking for a gentle way to incorporate BHA into your routine. Gentle but Effective!
