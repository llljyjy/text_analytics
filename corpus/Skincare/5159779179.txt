I really like most of the Fenty products I’ve tried so I was quick to try this. Bought this a couple times cause it has SPF and I’m horrible at remembering to put on sunscreen. It’s alright. I mean it smells good and it doesn’t feel too sunscreeny but it’s more of a sunscreen than a moisturizer for sure. It’s worth a try, just cause it didn’t work for me, doesn’t mean it won’t work for someone else. More like a sunscreen than a moisturizer
