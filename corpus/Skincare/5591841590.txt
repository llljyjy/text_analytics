Absolutely in love with the packaging, and color of Moon Dew. as soon as I put the product to my skin I could instantly tell a difference in quality unlike most that i have tried. I’ve been using Moon Dew eye cream for about 2 weeks and have noticed a nice difference in the appearance of my under eyes. It’s super hydrating and keeps my under eyes moisturized all day. It tightens and smoothes fine lines. I’ve noticed a brighter appearance overall. Looking forward to continuing the use of this product. LOVE!!!
