I have very dry skin and used this as a day time moisturizer. Itâ€™s incredibly hydrating and my face did not feel dry by the end of the day when I wore nothing on top of it. The texture feels like a silicone primer and makeup applies over it like a dream. However, the scent is overpowering! I enjoyed this product, but will not use it again because of the fragrance. Good for dry skin, but very strong fragrance
