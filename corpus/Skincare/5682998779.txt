I got a free trial size in one of the Sephora favourites boxes and all I can say is that it went on my face once, then got washed back off and into the garbage can it went. It had an extremely unpleasant oder to the serum that is difficult to describe, but it was really pungent. It also made my skin burn slightly so thatâ€™s when I decided to re-wash my face and chuck the serum. The one star is only because it has decent packaging, especially for a trial size, otherwise, I would rate it as 0/5 stars. Terrible and pungent smell, skin felt like burning
