Since I turned 30 I have been more aware of the products that I apply on my skin. This product has been definitely one of my favorites lately. Wrinkles has been a big concern for me, and this is definitely helping a lot to prevent them. It literally has almost everything I need. From retinol to vitamin c. I definitely recommend it. Better skin!
