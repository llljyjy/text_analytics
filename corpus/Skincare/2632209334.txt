Just an okay face mask in my opinion. I appreciate there are no perfumes in this, and I did see a slight improvement of texture after three weeks of use. Upon applying, I notice a slight tingle which was not bothersome at all. And it does have a creamy texture which I love. But with that being said, this is not worth almost $70. I saw very little change in my skin, and for that specific reason I don’t find the cost of this worth it at all. And at the end of the day after washing my face on my no makeup days, it’s like a slimy film once the water hits my face. If I’m going to shell out close to $70 bucks, I want a face mask that’s not going to just sit on my face all day like a film and do more then just slightly smooth. Just okay
