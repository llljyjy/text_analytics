Was very excited for this cleansing balm as it is very affordable and clean! I will say it takes off my makeup very well and it doesn’t irritate my skin. However, I found the product to be a bit runny at times even when shaken and it leaves a lot of residue on my face. It feels like there is oil on my face and I need to avoid my eye area or else there is a chance it ends up in my eye. Which isn’t great when you want to remove your eye makeup… i will say it removes waterproof mascara, but I had to use a different makeup remover for my eyes. Overall, okay product if you don’t mind having your face feel oil like after you rinse. Double cleansing did remove most of the residue feeling as an fyi. baby shaken before use Good cleansing balm, bit too oily for me
