I generally love this brand, but one this that disappointed me with this particular product was that there was a huge air bubble in the product, in the jar. So instead of getting a full jar of product, I probably got like half a jar. This is incredibly disappointing, because it is so expensive. This also happened with their moisturizer. Overall, it does help reduce texture on the face and is a good exfoliant, but considering the price and the amount of missing product, I would consider looking into another brand once I am finished with this jar. Great, butâ€¦
