I received this compliments of influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review. I’m really loving the  Ultimune Power Infusing Serum, it’s so lightweight yet super hydrating my skin just absorbs it and it’s left feeling and looking really radiant, this is definitely going to remain a staple in my skincare routine! I use it in the am and sometimes layer it under a night cream in the pm. Lightweight and hydrating!
