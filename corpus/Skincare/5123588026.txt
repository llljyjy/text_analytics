Saves my skin when I neglect to take care of it. I usually put this on as a moisturizer over night rather than a mask that I wash off, and it really helps my dry skin. I also use it when I am being diligent, but feel like my skin is getting on the drier side. The fragrance is strong, but I personally find it pleasant. Skin saver!
