I absolutely love this product.  It works amazingly on my skin.  It didnt cause any extra oils.  It makes my skin feel nice, refreshed, and supple.  It really makes my skin feel nice.  Its a great product for a great price.   A little bit goes a long way.  The scent isnt bad or overpowering.    Its really nice.  I use it a few times a week and its perfect!! Great mask!
