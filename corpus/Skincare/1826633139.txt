Iâ€™ve tried several different vitamin C serums for areas with discoloration & dullness. This one has a nice texture without being too drying or smelling metallic. Been using a week so bit early to tell about efficacy but so far so good. I really like the unique applicator- wish more serums had it. So far so good
