This product is amazing, its cream formula makes for all day and night hydration and absorbs well enough into the skin. It really is like its predecessor but better. I have very sensitive skin and there are no ingredients in here that seem to irritate me. The only reason im not giving it a full 5/5 is because of the size difference there was more product in the old packaging. The packaging here is adorable but it sacrifices the amount of product in the jar. nan
