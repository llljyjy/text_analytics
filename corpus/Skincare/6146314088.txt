I’ve never used a product like this before — a liquid lotion? Never even seen that! I have loved using it in my routine, though. Every morning my skin looks refreshed and radiant after I quickly pat this product in and top it with my daily moisturizer. I’m so happy I found this! I have very sensitive skin and didn’t have any adverse reaction to the formula, so I’m very pleased. I’m a believer!
