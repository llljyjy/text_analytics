I gave this product three tries - with & without moisturizer under my foundation, and also by itself. I have drier skin, and every time it made my face look too shiny/oily. It’s completely transparent so it does not provide any coverage. It felt like it never dried down & remained transferable throughout the day. It isn’t waterproof so you can’t wear it in the pool. So what’s the point then? I returned it because it’s way too expensive and wasn’t flattering in any way. I’ll stick to using ilia’s super serum skin tint spf 40 (which by the way you still need to use additional sunscreen with bc the spf protection is highly questionable). Unflattering, Returned
