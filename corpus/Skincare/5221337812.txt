I was happy with my usual eye cream, but decided to try this because of its best of beauty award. I gave this a good 4+ months of use to really give it a chance. I wish I had never bought it or switched. Not only did my fine lines and wrinkles get worse, but so did my dark circles. I finally gave up and went back to my Murad, and saw improvement in days. This may work for some people, but I would not personally recommend it. Not a fan
