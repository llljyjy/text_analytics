This night cream is a really nice hydrating moisturizer before bed. Although I wish Lancôme would do without the fragrance for those of us with sensitive skin. So far my skin hasn’t broken out due to the fragrance, but I prefer fragrance free products over scented ones. It does the job though and really helps moisturize the dry flaky areas on my face. Very hydrating! Could do w/o fragrance tho
