Best color in a self-tanner I’ve ever used and I’ve tried them all: St. Tropez, Loving, Jergins, Isle, etc. If they have a pretty okay marketing campaign, I’ve bought it. This is easy to use, not too thick and the color is awesome. I put it on and then do a layer of lotion, and I’m good to go. Worth every penny!
