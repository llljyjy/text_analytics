I recently switched back to this cleanser and I still love it. It cleanses very nicely. A great trick is to apply one pump to a dry face and massage before adding water. This helps to get out more dirt than if you started with water. I don’t normally wear heavy makeup, just mineral sunscreen or tinted mineral sunscreen and powder blush and bronzer. However, when I do wear full coverage foundation I have to cleanse twice to fully remove the makeup. A great first step would be the cleansing oil followed by this cleanser if you wear foundation daily. Plus, it doesn’t dry my skin out like many other cleansers! Gentle Everyday Moisturizer
