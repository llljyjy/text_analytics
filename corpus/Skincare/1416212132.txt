This eye cream gives me everything I need and want an eye cream for daily use. I love how it smoothed my under eye and gives it the perfect canvas for concealing and baking my concealer without creasing or Spotting or wearing off during the day.  It’s smooth lines wrinkles and helps with puffiness. The consistency of this cream is awesome it’s very pillow like if that makes sense it’s very pleasant to put on and doesn’t feel heavy at all. This will definitely stay a part of my daily make up routine! Finally! My total eye cream package!
