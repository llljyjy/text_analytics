I tried a few of this brands products and I think this might be my favorite. It’s really easy to put on, take off, and feels great. It’s a very gentle scrub which I would prefer to be a little rougher, but I think my skin would tend to disagree with that thought. Overall I really liked it, but it’s expensive enough I probably won’t buy. It has a little bit of a clay smell, but it’s not overpowering. nan
