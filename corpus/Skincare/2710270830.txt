Would of gave it 5 stars but the packaging it the bad. The product is great. It leaves no white cast and it’s not heavy. Not much is needed to cover the whole face. With that did said the 3 stars is for the leaking packing...losing some of the product. The foil on the bottle peels and ends up on my face some how AND it hard to get off without wiping the sunscreen off. The only solution is to transfer the product to another container so I don’t lose anymore product. Tatcha would have to change the packaging before I purchase this product again. Would of Gave it 5 Stars
