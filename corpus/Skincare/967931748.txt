Received this as a sample and was disappointed that it didnâ€™t smell anything like the original CEO moisturizer. I wanted it to be the same moisturizer in a gel/lighter texture. So unfortunate. It smells like the Ceramic Slip but stronger! The texture is nice and looks glowy on the skin but the smell is too overwhelming. Overwhelming scent!
