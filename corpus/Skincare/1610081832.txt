I was surprised how horrible this Melting Cleanser is. There is absolutely nothing melting in this product. The texture is way too thick to begin with, which makes it hard to apply. It emusifies after you add water, leaving your skin with waxy layer that trapped all your makeup in it. Even mascara that usually washes off just with water, this product turned into a black waxy goo nearly impossible to get rid off.If I could give less than 1 star, I would. Very waxy
