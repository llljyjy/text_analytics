I finally started buying anti aging products at 38. I’ve used the same Aveeno lotion as face moisturizer for over 10 years and wanted to try something new. So I purchased this item along with a couple other high end highly-rated face moisturizers to try them out and see which one I liked best. Honestly I thought this product was better than the highest rated facial moisturizer on the Ulta site. I liked this moisturizer better than the other two I tried for a few reasons. A little bit of this goes a long way. Other moisturizers I needed to use a bit more product. It’s very easy to smooth into the skin. It disappears into your skin, it doesn’t leave that layer of white overcast. But my favorite reason I like this is because I will put a fresh layer of this on at night and after waking up, I can visibly notice my facial redness has gone away. Usually my cheeks are naturally a little red but no more of that when I use this facial moisturizer. In the morning I don’t notice it. Best cream to use
