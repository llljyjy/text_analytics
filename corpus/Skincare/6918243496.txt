This eye balm is very thick and moisturizing. I’ve been using it both AM and PM and it’s been a great addition to my routine. This is marketed as super moisturizing and I’d say that’s true! It works well with my makeup, as well. No changes as far as creasing or longevity goes. It is a bit pricey at $60, though. I’m not sure if I’d get it again or not at that price. Very moisturizing!
