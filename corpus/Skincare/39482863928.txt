This popular moisturizing cream is formulated to absorb quickly to provide 48 hour hydration and is designed to help reverse 10 signs of aging skin in as little as two weeks!  I loved the thick texture and how smooth it felt on my skin. Although having a very thick appearance, this cream feels very lightweight once absorbed and left no greasy or sticky residue. The cream is lightly scented, and my skin soaked it right up. So far I can definitely tell a difference in how hydrated, soft and smooth my skin looks and feels  since I’ve been incorporating into my routine. It’s definitely a top seller for a reason and I would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a good quality anti-aging moisturizer. nan
