We can call it fate or just the Sephora gods listening. My skin was so dry and flaky. I was feeling insecure wearing foundations with such flakey skin. This little bad boy walked into my life and has changed the skin game! Extremely hydrating, dewy and leaves the most beautiful sheen. With such sensitive skin I was worried about break outs under my foundation and I was left with nothing but hydrated, beautiful & even complexion! The caffeine has even given my skin that extra bounce it desperately needed. My only issue is the cap. The nozzle has given me tons of over spray that left the product all over my clothes. I would have preferred more of a dropper dispense. Overall a lovely and amazing addition to my skincare regimen. Boo to nozzle, yes to caffeinated hydration!
