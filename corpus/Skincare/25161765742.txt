There had to have been a FORMULA CHANGE because this worked great for my skin before and I loved it but when I got a new one it almost destroyed my skin barrier and my skin started getting super oily. I started getting a ton of acne and I started getting pimples on my nose and cheek where I had never gotten acne before. Theres other reviews too on google too about it. NOT GOOD ANYMORE
