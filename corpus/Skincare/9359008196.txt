I am a sunscreen junkie, and this really did not blow me away. The texture is decent, but unfortunately was one of the many sunscreens that broke my out - I find it a bit too heavy . I also found that it pilled a bit under my makeup. If you don’t have sensitive skin and don’t apply makeup on top however, I think this would be completely fine! nan
