Pros:- price tag because I’ve been using my Dr. Brandt LIQUID SUNSHIELD and it costs $65 whopping dollars! Cons:- it is NOT sensitive skin approved since it broke me out- it has the typical sunscreen smell which I don’t mind on my body but on the face is a dealbreaker.- it pills like no other. I’ve never had this problem with my Dr. Brandt one Unfortunately, I have to go back to my more expensive sunscreen because that’s the only one that doesn’t smell bad and does not break me out. I had really high hopes for this sunscreen since so many people like the other products from this company and I heard that it is very sensitive skin-friendly but it wasn’t in my case. NOT sensitive skin friendly!
