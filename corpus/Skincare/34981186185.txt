I received this product from Sephora collection in exchange for my honest review. This peel mask was such an awesome addition to my beauty routine. Since starting to use it, I have definitely noticed brighter, more glowy natural skin, and it also helped with my acne. I do have to say that if you have sensitive skin, you should build your way up with this product. Awesome Peel Mask!
