My skin tends to be a little more on the sensitive side so I always need to be careful with my retinol products but this has given me fantastic results. It’s clinical strength and really makes a huge difference but it’s not so strong that it is too harsh for my sensitive skin. It’s been the best retinal product I have found to date and I would highly recommend it! nan
