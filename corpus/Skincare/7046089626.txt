I picked this up in store because I had seen it on tik tok and I absolutely love it! I live in swampy Tampa, FL and have pretty oily skin and other popular spfâ€™s like supergoop unfortunately made me look like a greaseball, especially if not being worn under foundation. This one does not make me greasy either way and leaves no white cash for me! Great for oily skin and/or humid climate!!
