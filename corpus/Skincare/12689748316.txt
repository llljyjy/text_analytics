I’ve been using this for 2 days and my skin looks so good!? Like it’s so calm and unbothered and smooth. I pick at it almost daily and I’ve never had anything heal it so quickly before. It is a teensy bit greasy so I use it at night or on the weekend when I don’t need foundation. It smells slightly of honey and nothing else. Will be buying the big jar next time. Mmm so good
