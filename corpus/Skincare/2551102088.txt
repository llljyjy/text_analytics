I received a Khiels clearly corrective dark spot solution from BzzAgent for free in exchange for my honest review.  I have been using it for 12 weeks and I know products like this requires a longer period of time to see results. It is gentle to my skin, it doesn’t irritate my skin at all which is great.  I used other Products for dark spots in the past and they always make my skin irritated or gave me rashes.   I am glad this product is not One of those. I my dark spots did not magically go away, but I believe the Spots are not as dark as they used to be. I will keep using it till the bottle is gone and hopefully I’ll see better results. nan
