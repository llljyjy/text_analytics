I got a terrible chemical burn from this mask. I tried it more than once and both times My skin immediately started burning and my entire face turned beet red. It lasted all day and when it finally improved, I was left with rough, dry skin. I have seen many other reviews stating the same. I donâ€™t know if it was a bad batch or not but I will have to throw it out. Sad! Chemical burn
