I have mild, activity-based rosacea. This DID neutralize the flush quite a bit, but did not work as well on a new pimple. To use the amount of product needed to truly reach spf 30, you would need to CAKE this on. I did that on first application and it was awful. A smaller amount works better, but use a second product for spf to make up for it. I have combo skin, and I found this product to be too thick, and breaks down during the day. My oily t-zone didn’t like it after a few hours, and by the end of the work day, my whole face looked like an oily, caked on foundation-y mess. Powder seems to exacerbate. I’m fair neutral-slight cool and this didn’t make me look orange as some reviewers noted. The shade match is…not the best, but I can get away with it. Overall, this product is just ok. I wouldn’t order the full size. Tbh it’s probably better to use a green primer to neutralize, tinted moisturizer, and a sunscreen. Neutralizes but bad as spf/foundation stand-in
