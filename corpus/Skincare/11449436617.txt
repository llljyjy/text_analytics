I am almost 40. I have been using this eye cream for a month. I have noticed, gradually, that my fine lines have softened, the skin around my eyes is smoother and firmer and to my shock, my under eye area is brighter! The puffiness and the slight purple discoloration (I donâ€™t always sleep well) has diminished quite a bit. In fact, I look so much more well rested. My eye area looks younger also! I absolutely love the creamy texture that melts quickly when gently tapped/massaged around the eye area. I will definitely repurchase. Great Anti-Aging Eye Cream
