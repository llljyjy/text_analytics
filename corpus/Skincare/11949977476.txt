I absolutely loved this product. I have really dry lips and I have a tendency to pick up my lips due to my anxiety disorder. It leaves my lips feeling super soft and moisturize. I had gotten the sample size with my points and I’m so glad I picked it, I’ve been using it for months now and I still feel like I have so much more left. Top favorite product
