When this product came in the mail, it was on a cold winter day and I put it on immediately, which became a game changer. Now I stored in the fridge to put it on my face while cold and it is a wonderful refreshing feeling. The cream isn’t too heavy and I feel that it provides a good barrier to the dry indoor winter heat. I also appreciate that there’s SPS in the moisturizer because I often forget to put it on. It’s a nice cream that isn’t too thick or too thin, but I want something more dense to wear at night. It’s a good day cream. nan
