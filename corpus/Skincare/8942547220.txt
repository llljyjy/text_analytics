I’ve tried almost all serums from glow recipe and this is the only one I actually love. Most of their other products leave my skin feeling so sticky that the results aren’t even worth it to me, but this absorbs quickly and gives my skin an amazing and even glow after just a few days of use. If you have particularly dark scars this may take slightly longer than you are hoping for but I am seeing progress with those as well. Unexpected love
