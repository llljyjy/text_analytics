Sephora Collection gifted me to this product, but the opinions are completely my own based on my experience. Iâ€™ve always wanted to try a facial roller but never got around to it because I thought it was gimmicky. However, I have completely changed my mind after trying it out. I can definitely see the de-puffing effects after using it in the mornings. I love the refreshing feeling of it straight out of the fridge. I would definitely recommend those who have second thoughts to give it a try! Oh, and the color is gorgeous! Must Try!
