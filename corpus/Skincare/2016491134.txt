I was not very optimistic after seeing the bottle, but I tried it anyway. I have a good habit of trying something for a a few days before reviewing it for others to understand the truth. This is a really good product for antiaging and sagging skin. I can see visible differences in wrinkle reduction, skin tightening, and skin that looks hydrated. No disappointment, good product for aging skin
