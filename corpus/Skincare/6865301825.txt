It’s honestly not as great as their previous formula but still holds as a dupe compared to Belif Aqua Bomb or Tatcha Dewy Skin. It’s consistency became a lot thicker — not a favorite but it does leave your skin feeling refreshed. I double it with the Water Bank toner and the serum to really make sure that moisture is locked and loaded. Miss The Old Formula
