This moisturizer is pretty great. I am a combination skin type so that’s why I didn’t give it a complete five stars because I can tend to get oily especially in the climate I live in which is a warm climate but I can also get really dry depending on the weather so for the nights that my skin feels a little dry and my forehead gets tight this stuff is amazing. I like how it makes my skin feel although I can feel a little heavy so a little bit does go along way but I really like the fact that it was made for a sensitive skin and it gives you soft and hydrated skin while still being gentle enough to use on a daily basis if you needed it! I love that I received this product for free to try it was definitely a product that I might not have picked up on my own just due to the fact that I probably felt like my skin didn’t need it due to my skin type but I was definitely wrong and you shouldn’t judge a product by X it’s cover it’s something that I would definitely purchase and I would definitely recommend it to friends and family that are dealing with skin dryness or sensitivity! Great Product!
