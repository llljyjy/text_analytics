The texture is like a thick cream that doesn’t feel greasy or leave a heavy residue. It’s easy to apply and absorbs quickly. The cream has a slight yellow tint to brighten the under eyes, but I didn’t really notice much of a difference in brightness. For reference, I have really bad (genetic) dark circles, but I don’t have any noticeable fine lines. I didn’t feel like this super moisturizing, so if you have dry under eyes this probably won’t be enough hydration. There were several occasions after using this that my under eye concealer looked drier and cakier than normal. Prior to trying this, I used a Japanese brand eye cream that costs under $20 but I feel like I got more noticeable hydration and brightening, plus it worked beautifully under makeup. I don’t think I’ll get this again, especially for $42 there are other (cheaper) eye creams with better results for my skin. For a brand that I typically really enjoy, I was pretty underwhelmed by this. Didn’t meet expectations
