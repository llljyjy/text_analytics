I got the sample from Sephora, and got about 5-6 uses. I used it on my face, neck and chest. It didn’t absorb into the skin at all, it just sat and made me look greasy and shiny. Felt super heavy also compared to other moisturizers. 5-6 uses probably isn’t enough to see real benefits, but just based on how it felt I wouldn’t purchase. Face Looks Greasy
