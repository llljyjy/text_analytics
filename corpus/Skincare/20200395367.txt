This cleanser I learned about from Whitney Simmons, she always talked about Tula and their products. I got this cleanser in a travel size and it quickly became my favourite. Even my boyfriend who has a hard time with skincare working for his very sensitive skin adores it! It’s a tad drying for him but he uses a moisturizer and he’s all fine. I have combination/tank skin (meaning nothing irritates it) and I adore it. I have one cleanser at his place and one at mine it works so well!!! Will be repurchasing until I’m not able to! For 200ml it’s a fantastic price too. My new daily cleanser!
