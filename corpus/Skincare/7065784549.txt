I got quite a few samples of this and was excited to try it as I really like the daily peel from this brand. I definitely won’t be able to use this long enough to see results as it smells SO BAD. Normally I can overlook the smell of a product if it works well and scents don’t bother me but this serum reeks so bad I had to wash it off. I wouldn’t recommend to anyone Smells HORRIBLE
