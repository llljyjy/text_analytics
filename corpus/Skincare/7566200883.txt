Supergoop has great sunscreens! I love how lightweight yet hydrating this sunscreen is. I layer it before makeup, leaving my skin feeling great for makeup or no makeup! However, I personally find this sunscreen begins to irritate my eyes by the end of the day. Thatâ€™s my only complaint! Great sunscreen, but a bit irritant!
