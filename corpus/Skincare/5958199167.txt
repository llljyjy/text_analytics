So far I really like this lip balm, I was in search of a hydrating mango lip balm just because I love the smell of mangoes. This smells fantastic and doesn’t taste bad either, not that I’m trying to eat it lol. It’s very creamy on my lips and seems to be lasting on them for some time, I wish they made it in stick form as I really hate dipping my fingers in lip balm for many reasons, but I will deal with it this time just because I really like this. I also hope they make this a permanent flavor and maybe consider making it in stick form. nan
