I’ll start with what I do like about it… it doesn’t make my face feel greasy and feels like it’s moisturizing but I have found that my skin is still really dry no matter how many times I use this. I don’t know if it’s the moisturizer or my skin is just dry. Also don’t like how it’s so heavy!! I had to put in different container due to the weight but overall I like the product and still use it daily! nan
