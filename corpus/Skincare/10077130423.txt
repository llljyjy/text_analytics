The texture of it is perfect! It’s light, but hydrating which I love. It goes on smoothly, and melts into your skin. Having sensitive skin and sensitive eyes, I can say I’m thankful that I’ve had no issues with irritation. I love that it is fragrance free, safe for when I wear my contacts and it works well with other skincare and makeup. My eyes are looking more hydrated and smooth, but I’m definitely looking forward to more improvement as I continue to use it. Loving it so far!
