For reference I have normal to sensitive skin. This has a nice consistency, not too thick or thin. Wore nicely under makeup and stood through the hot summer days. It left my skin look glowy and I could see a firming effect. My skin was noticeably hydrated throughout the day as well.Downside, if you are sensitive to fragrance, get a sample. I normally do not have issues with fragrance, but this does linger quite awhile and is in my opinion quite perfume-y. Worth a try!
