I was looking for an anti aging oil to use at night and this is exactly what my skin needed. It’s definitely not for everyone (especially if your skin is prone to being more oily) but I found that it hydrates my skin and melts in very nicely. I’m not giving this 5 stars due to the price point and because I’m still waiting to see a visible change in my skin that actually reflects some of the claims made. I’ve had this for a few weeks and use it daily but haven’t seen noticeable improvements nan
