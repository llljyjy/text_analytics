Overall I think this is a great product. Itâ€™s a thicker skin tone tint that blends nicely with the skin giving you a more even tone. It works well as an under eye primer as well since it has a sort of sticky feel for a couple minutes after placement but that does go away after a little. My under eye feels more hydrated as well. nan
