J Lo Eye cream was sent to me from Influenster in return for my honest review. The packaging is absolutely beautiful! The eye cream itself is a thick consistency that doesnâ€™t take much to put around your eye area. The product should last at least a few months, so great for the price. I noticed that the dark circles I sometimes get for not sleeping well have all disappeared. My eyes are also less puffy. In close, I will be buying this product when I run out. nan
