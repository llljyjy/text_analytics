I have bought this product in the past and absolutely loved it. On June 25, 2022, I purchased my current product. This product is extremely oily and separates. No matter how much I stir and try to make it creamy again, it does not work. I spent a lot of money on this product to only use it once due to the separation. I absolutely loved this product previously and never had this problem. I also have seen some reviews from others that bought theirs around the same time as me and have been having the same problems. I’m assuming Dr. Jart changed formulas or it was a bad batch. I’m extremely upset with this due to this being one of my favorite foundations. Separated & now I cannot use it
