I don’t know what happened with my skin and this cleanser but really wasn’t good for my skin. This cleanser has been causing my skin to break out for weeks now, and in places I’ve never had breakouts before. My skin is extremely dry and acne prone so if you have similar skin, this may not be for you. nan
