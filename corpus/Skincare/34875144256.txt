It should be noted that my face is oily but not homogeneously and with visibly open pores.I preferred to wait to complete the 7 days of use of the serum and then use this mask. The day I used it, I was really surprised! I left the mask on for 20 minutes and then I withdrew At the time of removing it, I felt a breather in my facial skin and not only that, but I could visibly see softness and a certain homogeneity in my face. The truth was gratifying experience and I give a 10/10. nan
