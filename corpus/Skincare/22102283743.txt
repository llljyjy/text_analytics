I love this product! I tried it for the first time and it didnt feel like it was taking the moisture out of my face. It felt really nice. I tend to have more sensitive skin so it wasnâ€™t over exfoliating, I didnt really notice the exfoliation. I took it off and I WAS SHOCKED!! I tend to have blackheads on my nose and chin and most of them were gone! I have used many other charcoal products and this one blows them all away. I would 100% recommend! I will be keeping this as a go to mask for a long time! nan
