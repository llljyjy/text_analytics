I was so excited to try the Tula 24-7 Power Swipe when I received it from Influenster. I gave it a try for a couple of days and then noticed my skin was a little irritated, so I stopped. The product itself feels wonderful. It’s easy to put on and doesn’t feel greasy. There’s no strong fragrance and it has a smooth finish. I don’t wear make-up often so I can’t comment on how it feels under make-up! Great Concept and Product
