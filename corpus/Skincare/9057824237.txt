I used this two nights in a row and noticed my sun tanned forehead and chin colour even out. Although, the product is sticky and led to some texture this morning, I still want to continue using to see how I truly feel about it. I think it has potential and my Accutane can fix the bumps which I am not too worried about. I will get the bigger tube and continue monitoring over my arms as well. It seems to work on sun tanned body parts but not too sure about the acne scars and textured skin yet. So far so good
