The texture of this moisturizer is very good. It’s smooth and creamy and not too heavy when applied. My skin gets really dry in the winter so often it’s difficult for me to seal moisture. I actually applied coconut oil after applying this product on my face. And let me just just my skin looked bomb!!! Love it!
