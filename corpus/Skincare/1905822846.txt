I’m so glad I got a free bottle in exchange for a review! I have two additional bottles of this stuff. This product answered my prayers!!!!! I liked the scent of the original floral mister but didn’t love it. I could not stand the cycle we scent. I love fruity scents and just wished one existed and now it does!!! I wear it everyday and reapply throughout the day!!! So nice to spray over makeup and gives a glow!!! ANSWERED PRAYERS
