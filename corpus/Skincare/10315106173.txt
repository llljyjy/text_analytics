Would rate it a 0 if I could. I used this product for a day at the beach and reapplied multiple times and I burned the worst I ever have on my face. I thought maybe it was the sun being too strong so I tried it again next time still burned even though I applied multiple times. Everywhere else where I used a different sunscreen did not burn. Not quite sure what’s up with this, but it definitely doesn’t feel like spf 50. burnt
