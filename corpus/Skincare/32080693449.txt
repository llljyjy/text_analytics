I love this cleanser! I I brought the travel size version because I wasn’t sure what to expect even though the reviews looks good,( I’m an skeptical person), but I ended up loving it. It felt nice on skin, I didn’t feel like my face was dry after using this and personally love the smell. I love that it made me feel like I was glowing afterwards. Plus it made it easier to remove my makeup, I will admit that I had to keep lathering it into my face to get all of the makeup off but I didn’t have to get more product to remove it. But overall love it and will be repurchasing! nan
