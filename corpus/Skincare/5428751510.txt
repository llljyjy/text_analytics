I can’t live without this stuff. After having a baby I decided to try some other (cheaper) brands to see if I could find something I liked just as much that wouldn’t break the bank. I wish I had just stick to my Drunk Elephant routine because these products are unlike anything I’ve ever used. The Marula Oil gets 5 stars because this is a must have product. It adds so much moisture to my skin without being greasy and helps my skin absorb serums better. It’s totally worth the money! Buy “the littles” any chance you get because those kits are a great value and you get to try all the staple products! nan
