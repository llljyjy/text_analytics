I loved it!! This worked perfectly to help me take off my eye makeup and remove my lashes easily. Literally melted the makeup away in a couple rubs. I have super dry face and the balm is very hydrating to my face. All the ingredients are great for my dry face! The fact that I can use it as a a regular face mask it’s a plus for me!! I will continue to use it because it’s amazing! Amazing Mask & Makeup Remover!
