Through my 30s I noticed that my skin kept looking more abs more tired. I wanted to have my glowing skin from my 20s back! I finally have the best skin I’ve ever had and it’s in part thanks to this moisturizer. It’s thick enough to be really moisturizing, but lightweight enough not to feel like a huge greaseball. It’s definitely worth it, especially for the 40s crowd. Brings back the vitality!
