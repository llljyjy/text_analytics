This product is very balmy, as its name implies. Because I’m using a lot of chemical exfoliants and retinol, the skin around my eyes can become tight. This product really helps with my dry eyes at night. Unfortunately, it does not work well for me during the day when I wear makeup - it pills and my Laura Mercier caviar eyeshadow sticks will not lay on top. As other reviews have said, it does have a lot of silicone. This does not bother me; I love the feel and it keeps the skin around my eyes plump better than other eye creams I’ve tried. It is very expensive. I received this product for testing purposes as a Sephora employee, and while I like it, it’s not so life-changing that I would readily spend $100 on it. nan
