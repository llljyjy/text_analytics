I have dry skin, and find that the cool applicator feels nice on your skin. There’s not a strong scent to it which I think is good. The ingredient list I think is great!!! I’ve never tried any probiotic skincare before now. I do fine it does take the puffiness out of your eyes. I do have dark circles and didn’t notice much of a difference with that.
