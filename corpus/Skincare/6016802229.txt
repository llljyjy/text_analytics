If you use prescription strength retinoid then pass on this product. Otherwise it’s actually good. I used it for 3 weeks and I didn’t see a dramatic difference because I already use prescription grade retinoid but it maintained my skin for 3 weeks so I’m guessing it worked. The reason I’m giving it 3 stars is because of the horrible packaging. Who decided to put retinol in a squeeze bottle? It was so difficult to get the product out on some days no matter how hard I tried. There were days where I used more or less depending on how much I could get out of the bottle. Change it to a pump! It was very frustrating. Works but major packaging flaws
