One of the best face creams on the markets. My skin is hydrated and helps smoothing the appearance of wrinkles. I have already bought another one as a backup. It glides on the skin very smoothly and hydrates all day long. Makes my skin feel better and look hydrated. Would definitely recommend. Plus, since itâ€™s last so well on the skin you use less product. The container is large and will go a long ways. Best face cream on the market. As the label suggests, makes me feel confident.
