I have dark acne scars on my face so was hopeful this would help. In the summer, I noticed a difference in my skin with this, but as someone with combination skin, this caused me to break out a bit when my skin was more oily, so I took a break. I started using it again in the late fall/winter when my skin becomes more dry, and I still see a difference and I have yet to notice any increase in breakouts from it! I would recommend this product to anyone with dark spots, but in terms of how often you use, I say base that choice on your skin type. nan
