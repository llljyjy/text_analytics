this cleanser isn’t oily, it’s milky. because of that, it’s poor at removing makeup, sunscreen, and whatnot. i don’t think this leaves a film so for a gentle cleansing step it could be good for that. i have noticed a difference in my overall skin hydration after using this product for a bit over two months (i believe), but i could’ve achieved that with a different product. sometimes it stings my eyes too. wont buy again. if you want to try the cream skin line do the toner. i only say i’d recommend this because it has its usage, it’s just not the one it’s intended and marketed for. meh
