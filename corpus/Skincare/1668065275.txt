This is a great eye cream! It applies very smoothly and has an amazing silky soft texture. I don’t really have any fine lines or wrinkles, so I can’t say it makes them better, but my under eye area does seem brighter and it’s much more moisturized. This tiny sample has lasted forever so the full size would definitely be worth the money in my opinion. Great eye cream!
