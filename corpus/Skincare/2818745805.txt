This serum was just ok, I didnâ€™t notice much improvement in my skin and I did find it slightly irritating on my sensitive skin. Also the packaging needs improvement, when you first get it you have to pump is many times to get all three serums to appear. Only one of the serums come out for like the first 10 pumps or so wasting a lot product. One thing that I did like was the texture of the serums, it felt lightweight and did leave a nice glow. Als in all I definitely think there are better serums out there at a way more affordable price point. Just ok.
