One dermatologist told me the small, scaly, itchy red patch on my face was eczema so I bought this and thought it worked great - very moisturizing, helped with the itch and did fade the redness so great, right? I decided to get a 2nd opinion and this dermatologist used a tool to examine the patch and it was pre-cancerous cells that needed to be frozen off (and I donâ€™t have eczema!) Anyway, be sure to get a good diagnosis - but the product was amazing works well, however
