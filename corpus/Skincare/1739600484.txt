I thought this moisturizer would have a dewy finish since itâ€™s tailored for dry skin, but to my surprise it leaves a non greasy satin finish. It gives my skin enough moisture where my skin feels hydrated, but not overly greasy where it feels like oil is sitting on my skin. It absorbs fairly quickly when you rub into the skin, but does leave a slight film. I think this is great for normal skin. It has a really rich texture almost like a hybrid between a balm and moisturizer. Jars are not my favorite since you have to dip in and sanitary reasons, but I think it is the right component as it might be too thick for a pump. Overall I love this moisturizer, but think if you have dry skin you might not like the satin finish and want a dewier one Nice Moisturized Skin
