This product was gifted by Fresh. I’ve used their lip products before on my dry lips. I love that they use natural ingredients like Beet root and cranberry seed oil. This product works great as a moisturizer however the color does not show up on my skin. I’m totally fine with that. What matters most to me is relief for my dry lips versus a lip tint. Great for moisture but not for tint
