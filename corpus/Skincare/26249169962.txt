I get hormonal acne and since receiving this product, I was able to just try it out once when a new pimple made an appearance.I was quite impressed as I dabbed a tiny bit of this just before bed and I woke to the pimple significantly reduced in size the next morning. With continued application, It disappeared in a little over two days. It was quite gentle on my skin; there was a tad tingling and dryness but that eased within a few seconds. Iâ€™ll definitely be using this again when my skin breaks out! nan
