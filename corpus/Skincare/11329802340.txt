I love the way this product absorbs fast, with no tacky feeling either.  It is oil-free, mineral, and has Hyaluronic Acid. You can use this product as a primer prior to doing your make-up.  Itâ€™s SPF 42, water resistant, plus it has a ball inside to help combine the product thoroughly while shaking it.  Thanks Quickly Absorbs
