Nice product! I have combination skin prone to occasional break-outs. I regularly exfoliate as I feel it is the key to good skin. What I especially liked about this product is the fact that it GENTLY exfoliates…some products cause “pulling” of dead skin…this product does not. It left my skin soft and smooth and didn’t cause break-outs! Recommended, but a bit pricey. Nice gentle exfoliation!
