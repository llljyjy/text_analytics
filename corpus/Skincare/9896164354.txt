First of all, the texture is an absolute treat! It’s rich, creamy, and feels luxurious. It’s super gentle and perfect for the colder months. I never felt dry or tight after washing. My skin is balanced, fresh, and hydrated. It gets the job done without compromising the skin barrier. Definite favorite! Fav cream cleanser
