Smells like baked goods, like cookies with oranges, but in a bad way. Did not enjoy putting it on my face. It flaked/peeled off in little bits throughout the day, too. It did feel nice when freshly applied but I could not get past the smell. It’s not the worst, but for the pricepoint it’s pretty close. nan
