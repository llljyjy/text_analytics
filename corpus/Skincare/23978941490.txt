My skin was dry and my makeup would just sit on top of my dry skin. Since I started using Olehenriksen creams, my skin has improved sO much. This cream has a nice, thick consistency that nourishes my face overnight. I cannot do without it. It’s changed my skin a lot. My face isn’t dry, my makeup looks cleaner, and my wrinkles aren’t as noticeable. I love it. Been using it for few years now. I cannot go without this
