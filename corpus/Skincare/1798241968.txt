I love this serum! It is a very light gel type texture and it smooths over the skin easily. Some cons of the product is it does take more than a few seconds to absorb into the skin and the smell is a little off-putting (smells a bit like strawberry medicine... but more sour?). Still, the smell doesnâ€™t last and the results are well worth it. It helps with my minor adult breakouts and gives my skin a nice glow. Weird Smell but Works Great!
