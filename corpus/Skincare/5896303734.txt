This is by far the best facial oil I’ve ever used and is well worth the price tag. It leaves my skin feeling super hydrated but not at all greasy. It clears up and acne I might be struggling with, and my skin has a nice glow the next morning. Just a couple of drops is all I need, so the bottle lasts a long time. I can’t recommend this highly enough! This is the first CBD product I’ve ever used, so the smell took me a couple of days to adjust to. It doesn’t linger, so it’s not a big issue at all.
