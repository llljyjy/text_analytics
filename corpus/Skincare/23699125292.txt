I’ve been curious but it’s way too expensive for me. One day I had really bad day and decided to treat myself and grab this essence. I’ve been using this for a month. Every time I put on foundation, my large pore on my cheek used to become so noticeable, but I realize it doesn’t happen any more. I tried so many primer for blurring my pore and none of them worked. I almost quit using foundation because it was so depressing. This essence saved my soul!!! Yes this is sooo expensive but what it does for my skin, I must admit I need this… nan
