Receive this product complementary in exchange for an honest review. I wanted to like this Cleanser, as I like a lot of the Goop products. I have combination skin and some areas of my face are very dry. Daily use caused even more dryness and  flaky skin. At the moment I only use it once a week and itâ€™s working better. I would recommend it for people who have oily skin. Not for very dry skin
