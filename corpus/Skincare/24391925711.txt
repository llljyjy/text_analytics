i’ll be honest, i never review items. but i have EXTREMELY, horrible dry and flaky skin that gets so tight i can’t move my mouth. this lotion has been the only thing to help actually moisturize and repair my skin! make sure to get the lotion for “very dry” skin and not the gel one. this has helped me so much! i’m also very acne prone and it doesn’t break me out thankfully. the ONLY thing that helps my cracked/VERY dry skin
