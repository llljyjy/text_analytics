I wish I loved this product. I am such a fan of summer fridays but felt let down by this one. It felt like I was putting water on my skin, it would soak in immediately and then was dry shortly after. I also felt like I went through this product so much faster than others due to this problem. It only lasted me around 2 weeks while other products will last me months. nan
