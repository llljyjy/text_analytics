Shocked by some of the other reviews and photos. I am on my third purchase of this eye cream and have never had an issue with the packaging. I started using this eye cream in 2019 in a sample I received and made my first purchase in 2020. At the start of the pandemic I started noticing fine lines around my eyes. I was 26 at the time and feeling a bit self-conscious. I also contemplated getting botox just to stop these lines from getting worse. With the pandemic in full swing, I decided to try out all the products in this Kate Somerville line and it totally changed my skin. The serum and moisturizer have dramatically my skin and stopped all of my adult acne. I haven’t had anything more than small clogged pores since I used this product line. As for this eye cream, my fine lines went away for good. These products help keep my skin cells turning over and my eyes look brighter than ever.If this will be your first time using a retinol product, expect to purge. My skin purge lasted about two months. For the eye cream, this meant that my eye area was a bit sensitive temporarily and I had to use a lot of SPF more than normal. I made the mistake of using this eye cream the night before I went on a hike, which was a bad idea. My eyes were bright red for about another day. Now that I am way past my purge, this is not an issue for me at all. I use a regular amount of SPF and never have any burning, redness, or flaky skin. It’s important to remember that this happens with all retinol products - you have to trust the process and give it about 3 months to work. I am probably on the younger side of the spectrum of people buying this product, so I’m sure results will vary, but this was a life saver for me. Now that I’m just a smidge older, I’m glad I didn’t spend the money on botox, which probably would have messed up my face in my long term at this age. A life savor
