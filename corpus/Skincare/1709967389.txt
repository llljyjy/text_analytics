The same great sunscreen from Habit in a fun new scent! The scent is subtle, but not so subtle that you don’t notice it when misting on. It has a fairly dewy application. I like to do 10 or so pumps to make sure I’m getting the spf protection. It goes on over makeup so easily and reapplication is a breeze! The same great sunscreen in a fun new scent
