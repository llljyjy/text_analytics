I absolutely adore this cream! Wow! It is definitely a new must have in my routine. The consistency is really nice, it is not too thick but not too thin. It had a nice scent that is not too overpowering. I love the way it glides over my skin. I have been using this cream for 2 weeks or so and have noticed a significant difference in my “11’s” between my forehead!!! I also am starting to notice a little more firmness around my eyes. I’m hooked on it! A little goes a long way. I like it soooo much more than another moisturizer I have been using. My skin is super soft and it has gotten rid of a dry patch I had around my nose. Also, one of the best parts is that it has not broken me out AT all!!! I sometimes break out from trying new products and this has been perfect for me. My new go-to!!! Yay! Amazing!!
