I always wanted to try the products of this brand, and I was not disappointed.Do you know what it feels like to have firm skin while it is hydrated?.This happens with this product thanks to the vegan peptides that act as building blocks for an important protein such as collagen.I love that it has a very mild scent (my allergy to strong odors appreciates it) and my sensitive skin just feels protected, firm and soft. This moisturizing cream is on another level.
