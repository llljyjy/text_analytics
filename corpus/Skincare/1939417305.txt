I love all things necessaire and ordered this immediately when it was released. I like the formula so far. It didn’t leave a white caste on my skin and I thought it blended easily. I usually put on moisturizer before sunblock though so it spreads better. My issue is the size. I feel like this wouldn’t be enough to last me a vacation at the beach. I was expecting the size of the serum and was disappointed with how small it was. I wouldn’t even mind paying more for a larger bottle…. Small packaging
