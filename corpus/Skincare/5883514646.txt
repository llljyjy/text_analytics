In love with this face mask! I am a 31 year old with no lines/wrinkles but I do suffer from  Papulopustular rosacea along with some rough skin on my outer cheeks. This seems to help my rosacea along with keeping my skin much smoother and plump. ( I am scared to use the moon fruit serum because serums seems to flare me up due to their fast absorbency. ) Canâ€™t wait to see the great long term effects of this mask! Favorite moisturizer ever
