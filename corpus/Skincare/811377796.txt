I used the product for almost a week, then threw it away.  The scent is very off-putting, and I do not usually care about that since I do not like fragrance, but it smelled like really old, rancid crayons.  The balm did okay to remove makeup, but it was unreasonably hard to wash off and left a film on my face.  I double cleanse regardless, but felt this almost needed a third cleanse since the second was just to wash off this product.  Appreciate the reasonable price point, but will not purchase or recommend mainly due to the filmy residue it leaves, and also the smell. Leaves a residue and smells bad.
