I got this product for free from influenster to give my honest review. I love the feel of this face cream. It’s very light and thin. I feel like a little goes a long way. I have dry skin and after applying this, my face feels smooth and so soft. That being said, in these drier months, I don’t feel like it keep my face feeling moisturized all day. The packaging is beautiful and heavy glass.I do not feel like I would repurchase this with the high price tag only because my skin is so dry and it didn’t work for me as well as I would have liked in the winter months. Great lightweight cream for summer
