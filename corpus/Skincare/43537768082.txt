I am so fortunate to have been chosen to test the product Clarins Double Serum for the past 7 days.  It has a lovely light floral scent.  It is smooth and easy to apply.  I would recommend applying the serum at night before sleep because it leaves the face a little oily at first and then soaks in.  While the 7 days of use were not enough to eliminate the wrinkles under my eyes, I will say my face does feel satisfyingly hydrated and moisturized each morning.#DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare #gotitfree #Butterly Clarins Double Serum
