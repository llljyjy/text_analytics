Hate to be this person but this product was honestly one of the worst moisturizers I’ve used. It’s pleasant to apply, but seemed to make my skin dryer after putting it on. I don’t know if it just didn’t jive well with my combination skin, but it made my face flaky and did not provide any moisture. A Huge Let Down
