I received the Dr. Zenovia Skincare Advanced Retinol Night Repair Treatmentas a sample from PinchME. I have to say, I love it. I like the way the product feels when it goes on - very smooth and “slippery“. It absorbs well. And, I must say, my skin has looked great over the last couple weeks that I have been using it. My skin is not sensitive, and I have been using it every other night as a precaution since Retinol can be harsh, but I have not had any irritation from it and could probably safely use it every night. Great results
