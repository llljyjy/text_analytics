Not bad! Maybe it’s just me, bit I don’t see a big difference between this and the aqua bomb? Either way, Definitely moisturizing and very smooth, my skin just drinks it up. only put 4 stars because of the fragrance, it’s not bad, but I’m a bit sensitive to smells so too much at once can give me a headache. Definitely doesn’t need a scent as long as it does the job. My skin drinks it up!
