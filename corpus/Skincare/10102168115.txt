so i bought this exfoliant yesterday because im tired of using physical exfoliants. i used to use some of the Lush ones but they expire too quickly as theyre fresh and tbh they just werent doing it for me anymore. i did some research on this one and i thought why not give it a shot? ive never used a chemical exfoliant let alone ever dabbled in ahas,phas,bhas,acids etc. so im very new to this. i tried this out yesterday and i could literally see results after just one use. in the images its 1.right after the first use and 2. right after the second use. ive used it twice and its made such a difference im never going back to those scrubs. im still working out what my routine with it will look like but so far its checked all my boxes. i have very dry, sensitive skin and i have rosacea on my cheeks and i only really applied this on my t zone + on my temples but gently swiped it across my whole face. i did notice a bit of redness on my cheeks after the second use but i think that could just be from me using it 2days in a row as it didnt happen on my first use. all in all, im thoroughly pleased with this and its totally worth the money for the amt u use at a time. LOVED ITTTT amazing wowowow
