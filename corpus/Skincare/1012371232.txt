Been doing cosmetic microneedling for 2 years now and my skin is gorgeous. Everyone should be doing it. I have the BeautyBio roller but tbh the replacement heads are a rip-off. Youâ€™re better off getting a regular dermaroller and changing it every month. Yes for microneedling, but this tool is overpriced
