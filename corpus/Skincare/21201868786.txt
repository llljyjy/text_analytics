Loving this product! I was lucky to receive a mini sample to try and have been using for about a week now. My skin feels super hydrated and not dry and stretchy specially in the cold weather. I use this in the mornings after I wash my face and before applying the Superfood Air-Whip Moisture Cream which is another of my favorite products! Great to keep skin hydrated during the winter!
