This was terrible. Please save your money this doesn’t work. I waited 2 months before writing a review but I have not seen any results. It breaks your whole face out in little white dots in the beginning. They go away after a week. But the acne I had prior to use didn’t go away but got worse. I even lessened the application but still nothing. I hope you guys take into consideration my review especially if your are a WOC Bc I’m starting to think it might not be made for our skin. save your money !!
