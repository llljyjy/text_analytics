This product isn’t that great as a hydrating overnight mask but it’s fantastic at keeping oil at bay. I have very dry skin that gets oily on the nose. If I apply moisturizer and oil is starting to bead up on my nose, this will stop it in its tracks if I apply it over top! I believe it’s due to the higher niacinamide content. Great product has become a winter staple. I use it in the day for this purpose as the final step in my routine instead of at night. great for combo skin
