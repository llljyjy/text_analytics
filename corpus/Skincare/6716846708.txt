I should start by saying that I have never been a Clarins shopper, I don’t usually enjoy anything that I had tried by them in samples over the years. That all changed with this cleanser, I had received a sample in one of those skincare sample bags Sephora will sometimes have. I didn’t have high hopes but was on the lookout for a new cleanser so I thought what the heck? I used that sample morning and night (as the second part to my double cleanse along with Glow Recipe papaya cleansing balm) and by the end of the sample I was sad our time was up. I have dry/reactive/dehydrated/mature skin and this cleanser did not leave me red, itchy, irritated but cleansed and feeling hydrated. I don’t need to use much for it to foam up but it isn’t an aggressive foam, more of a creamy foam if that makes sense. The scent is very light and almost herbal but in a clean way. I bought the full size when I ran out of the sample and have been using it every day again and loving it. I feel this cleanser will last quite a while too. Great gentle cleanser
