My niece gave me this Peace Out Retinol Face Stick for Christmas so I thought I would give it a try. I have been using it since Christmas and I see quite an improvement On the lines around my lips & eyes. I put it on each night & again in the morning. I have sensitive skin and normally I would have some sort of reaction to the product or sometimes the smell but this has no fragrance. Happy CustomerMeg Titus nan
