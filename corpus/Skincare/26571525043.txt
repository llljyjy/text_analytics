Bought this to replace my La Roche Posay 60 SPF face lotion bc I couldn’t find it in travel size and I’m happy with it! I love the light smell and I give this extra points for the easability of the packaging. Being able to stick this in my purse and apply it to my face w/o having to use my hands to evenly apply during this covid-era is a nice pro nan
