This moisturizer is creamy and smooth. My skin drinks it right up. It is not sticky and does not leave a residue. My skin feels hydrated after using this product. A little goes a long way. This is great for sensitive skin. I also love mixing this moisturizer with the Hyaluronic Acid for extra moisture. nan
