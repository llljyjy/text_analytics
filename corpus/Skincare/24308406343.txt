I received this cream in exchange for my honest review. I have really sensitive skin so changing products normally causes me to break out....not this one! This cream is so luxurious. It instantly left my skin soft, smooth and glowing! The gorgeous packaging includes directions for the Tilbury Tap which I’m sure makes a difference but as a busy mom of 5, I didn’t have the time to do it often and I still saw incredible results! A spatula would be a great addition as trying to get the cream out with long nails is pretty difficult without it going under them. This will 100% be staying in my beauty regime! Heaven in a jar!
