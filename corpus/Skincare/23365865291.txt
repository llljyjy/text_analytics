I really wanted to love this eye cream because I’ve loved all products I’ve tried from this brand but unfortunately, this eye cream irritates my eye and makes my eyes watery even when I apply if further from the eye. The consistency is ticker and very moisturizing I just can’t keep it long enough without my eyes burning and my eyes getting watery. I’m not normally sensitive to anything on my skin so I was very sad about getting a reaction from this eye cream. Unfortunately not for me
