I’m not really sure how to feel about this product. It evens out my skin tone nicely and dries out to a dewy finish. The thing I am not much fan of is the high price and also I live in Florida and brought my sunscreen out once, put it in my bag. Then I wanted to reapply and the packaging started peeling off and stucked on my hand like a little silver particles. Now every time I have to use it I have to wipe my hands properly to make sure I won’t get any of these on my face. I don’t really know what happened I just put it in my bag like I do with other sunscreens. Also a pump would work so much better, this sunscreen is very liquidy and sometimes it’s hard to control the amount. Not worthy for $60 :( there are better cheaper options
