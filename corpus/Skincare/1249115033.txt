I received a complimentary sample in exchange for my honest opinion.This treatment lotion is very much in the same vein as a Japanese or Korean First treatment essences. It is ment to be gently patted/pushed into the face, to help soften the skin and help absorption of subsequent products. I only received a small sample, so am unable to comment on the long term effectiveness, but I will say that I definitely noticed a softening of the skin, and enhanced dewy/glowy appearance. The only downside that comes immediately to mind is the cost could be prohibitive. And if you suffer from malassezia, the bio-ferment in this may aggravate it. Skin Softening in the Short Term
