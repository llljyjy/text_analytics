I received a sample size of this product to review so I didnâ€™t get to use it long enough to see how it performs long term. But I thoroughly enjoyed the moisturizer. I did find that my skin would feel slightly dehydrated near the end of the day. The texture of the product is very nice and feels rich without feeling too heavy. I would use this again. nan
