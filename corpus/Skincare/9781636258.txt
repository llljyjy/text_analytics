I have used retinol products and know how harsh they can be on your skin. I was so excited when I found out I was chosen to try this because Retinol Reform claimed to be sensitive on the skin - and it really is!! I have been using this product for a few weeks and I was able to immediately start using it 3 times per week with no issues. My skin looks brighter and the texture has visibly improved. This product was gifted to me, but I will definitely continue using it as part of my routine. I already purchased my next bottle so Im not without it! One thing to note, retinol can make your skin sensitive to the sun so make sure you wear sunscreen while using this product. Fountain of youth?
