I use this daily before bed. I think I notice brightness in my skin. In my 30s it’s all about maintenance so my face still feels firm, even tone, and smooth. This bottle has lasted me a year already. I can’t tell how much is left, but a little goes a long way. Overall I just thought that a retinol product applies to acne, blackheads, and sebum also so I still rely on the Good Genes which I like more. Pro: anti aging maintenance. Con: not at a level that caters to acne and pore concerns. Pro anti aging, but not acne or pore concerns
