What I liked: Silky cream that is refreshing when applying to undereye area. It spreads easily and left under eye area smooth next morning.What I did not like: The cream was hard to grasp to finger. Texture is like a compact cream but slightly separated. No results yet, might need longer application for results. Liked but won't be repurchasing
