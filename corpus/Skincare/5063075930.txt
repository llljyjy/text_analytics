The moose goes on clear so you can’t see where *exactly* the product was covering. However, I felt like this product is easy to apply for anyone with experience using sunless tan products. With doing a thorough application and with using the Isle of Paradise brush (sold separately), it was still very easy to blend and cover! I haven’t noticed any streaks (although, I think I would need someone to do my back for me in the future!). I had some areas that looked a little bad on my wrists, elbows, and feet. I put lotion on those areas first, but I was lazy and didn’t do any exfoliating prior to applying the product. The product didn’t transfer color onto my clothes while processing (huge positive), and it didn’t smell bad while processing (another huge positive). Although, once it was finished processing (at about 6 hours in) it did start to have that ever so classic fake tan scent. For the end result, I liked the color! I always worry about my fake tans looking too orange on my very fair skin. It gave me a healthy looking glow that looked very natural. Color fully showed up at about 6 hours and I rinsed it off after about 8 hours of wear. For reference, I have very sensitive skin that is prone to eczema/dermatitis flare ups and this didn’t seem to irritate my skin. Fair skin approved
