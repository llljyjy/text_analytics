I like that this sunscreen is lightweight and has a slight tint to it. It is a little bit greasy, and I don’t mind that too much, but I think some people would. I typically prefer my sunscreen to be SPF 45 and higher on my face, so this is a little bit of a drawback with this product as it’s SPF 30. I love the TULS brand and use other cosmetic products from them. I received this product complimentary from Influenster. Lightweight with a slight tint
