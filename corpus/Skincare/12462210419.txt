It’s a pretty good product. it works well and does a good job at taking off all of my makeup. it feels nice on the skin too. it doesn’t feel gross, sticky, or super oily and greasy. it works well and feels nice on the skin. i didn’t notice it break me out or clog up my pores. the reason why i have given it 4 instead of 5 stars is because i just don’t think i would repurchase it because i could use any other makeup remover that is cheaper and just as effective. pretty good
