This is a really good cleanser. I was devastated when Sunday Riley changed the formula for their Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser around 2018, and Iâ€™ve been trying to find another clay cleanser to love ever since. This cleanser is definitely better for my skin than most non-clay cleansers, and I plan to continue using it. Solid cleanser at a great price
