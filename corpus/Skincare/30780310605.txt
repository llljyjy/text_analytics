I generously received a sample of this product from Topbox to try. The texture of this face cream is smooth with no scent which I appreciate. It felt nice and moisturizing on the skin when applied. Although due to the small sample size I am unable to attest to the fact that it had any effect on my fine line and wrinkles. It is a face cream I would be willing to give a try to see if any long term results. Good face cream
