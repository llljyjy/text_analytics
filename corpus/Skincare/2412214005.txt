I’m on accutane, so my skin is incredibly dry and sensitive. I bought this because I needed something extra in my skincare routine to add and sustain hydration. This checks all my boxes. This makes me feel like I don’t even need a moisturizer (I do moisturize though; can’t take any chances on this medicine), and it feels and smells incredible. It’s also very tacky for a few minutes after application, so I think it would be a great primer for makeup. This combined with my hydrating cleanser and moisturizer has decreased my dryness and flakiness enormously. Highly recommend. New Holy Grail toner
