this lathers up very nicely! I leave it on for a few seconds before washing and it away and it never strips my skin. i learned half way through the bottle that a TINY amount truly goes a long way. loses one star from me because it did not deeply cleanse my pores... I really donâ€™t notice any difference :( except that my skin feels softer :) a worthwhile cleanser
