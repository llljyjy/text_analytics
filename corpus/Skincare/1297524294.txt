I have somewhat sensitive combination acne and dry skin so there is alot going on with my face. I was only able to tolerate this product 1x a week on my face because my skin gets dry immediately with any retinol or BHA products. It did lighten the scars on my face noticeably. I use this product mainly on my backne 2-3x a week with success. It makes my skin look smoother and marks reduced. Knocked off 1 star because I don’t think it’s great for sensitive skin. Good if your skin isn't sensitive
