I recieved a sample size to test and review and I managed to make that last two weeks. A little goes a very long way-this is a very thick & rich product and it absorbed beautifully into my combination skin. I tend to lean towards oily in the summer and this did not contribute to that. My face felt very moisturized and soft the mornings after use and I have to say this is one of those products that is worth the splurge. No matter your skin concern-moisturizer is important. Luxurious
