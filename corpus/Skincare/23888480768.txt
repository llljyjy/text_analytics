Unfortunately, I don’t notice any difference in my skin in regards to hydration, firmness or fine lines. I didn’t see any plumping effect but is smooths over the skin nicely and does not irritate my skin. It doesn’t have any fragrance which is a huge plus for me. This serum lacked the hydration so I use it under another moisturizer, it works for me that way. Just OK
