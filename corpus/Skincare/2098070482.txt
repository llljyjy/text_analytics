i regret to inform my bank account that this is, in fact, a miracle product. i got a few gross zits after the first application (that i popped, sorry) but they healed unnaturally fast and i haven’t had any since. the blackheads on my chin were gone after ~3 days. my skin is firm and soft after washing, when before it would be dry and tight before applying products. all i’m waiting for now is the blackheads on my nose to go away, and if/when they do, i’ll be this brands #1 fan. it smells weirdly like the bread aisle at the grocery store, but it fades within minutes. obviously, everyone’s skin is different, but if you can afford this, you should definitely try it.for transparency, my (once a day) routine is: wash with cetaphil gentle skin cleanser, hot water, and a white washcloth laundered with bleach. pat dry with clean towel. apply SK-II facial treatment essence all over face. apply glossier super pure serum all over face. apply two pumps of augustinus bader the cream all over face. apply one pump of glossier bubble wrap eye cream to under eye area only. i don’t stray outside that area or i break out. hope this helps! elixir of the gods
