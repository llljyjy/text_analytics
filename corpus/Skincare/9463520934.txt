IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream is one of my new favorites. First, a little goes a long way. This is going to last me a while! I have combination skin and easily breakout. This keeps my dry parts smooth and hydrated, and I haven’t had one breakout since using it.  It’s not too heavy or overly scented. I think I’ve found my new Moisturizing cream! nan
