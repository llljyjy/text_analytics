High quality ingredients with a nice texture. I’ve used for over a month as an addition to my skin care routine. This absorbs into the skin without leaving any films and will even layer well with makeup if you use it during the day. I didn’t notice a huge change with my skin but I didn’t have any adverse reactions either so I’d still recommend. nan
