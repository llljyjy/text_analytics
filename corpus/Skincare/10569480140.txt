I have been using this product for about two weeks now and love the reaults I am getting. The texture is smooth and consistant. It is cooling and hydrating and leaves you feeling refreshed. My only negative and the reson I did not give it a 5/5 stars is the amounf of fragrance in the product. For someone who may have sensitive skin, it could be an irritant for sure. Will buy again, hopefully in stock when I need to replenish! The extra hydration boost we all need!
