I received a trail size and I LOVE IT! I have extremely sensitive skin, so I was kind of afraid to try it, but when I did my skin loved it. I paired it with the Paulaâ€™s choice exfoliator (which is also good). It will give you that glazed donut type of look, but not too much. It feels extremely comfortable on my face. And a little goes a long way. I will be purchasing the full size. GREAT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN!
