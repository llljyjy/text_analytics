If you’ve tried any of the Lancome products in the past this falls in line with their high end, luxurious character.  The cream is intended for nighttime use but I find it blends easily a little bit on the heavier side but with a nice slip and can be worn underneath foundation or sunscreen.  There is only the tiniest hint of fragrance, so mild and in fact I am not even sure what to say it smells like, it’s not unpleasant.  This product is one of the many products on the market selling use of topical probiotics for your face.   It does contain some other Ceramides and deep down in the list hyaluronic acid.  Moisturizers and absorbs well and is pleasant to use.  As to whether it lives up to its anti-aging claims remains to be seen.  I’ve used it for a few weeks, do you really like it but will have to wait to see if it produces better results than other similar products in a lower price range. The sample size of the study was only 24 women, not statistically significant.  Self reports of the claims were only 79 women. But overall I like the product, I was provided a sample to try at no cost to me. If you have the extra money it’s a nice product that contains multiple good skin care ingredients. nan
