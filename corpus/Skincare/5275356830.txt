I like this product but as someone that wears a full face of makeup frequently, this didn’t work for me. I felt like things slipped around or didn’t wear as well as they would when I didn’t use this. I guess I felt like it didn’t sink in or dry enough for me to be able to put makeup on top of it. It is a good hydrating SPF however. Not great under makeup.
