This product has SULFUR in it. Had I known never would have bought it - years ago I used the Mario Badescu drying lotion which if you know also has sulfur in it & that is what triggered my terrible cystic acne for the next 7 years. I used this serum by Topicals thinking it will help all the acne scars left over and my severe hyperpigmentation and the first day after using it I didn’t break out however the 2nd day.... I had tiny pimples EVERYWHERE on my face and I’m talking like 10 tiny yellow zits in one spot alone. all over my face. now I know 100% sulfur is not the right ingredient for me I really wanted to like this product and I’m sure it works for other people but there is just too much stuff in this for my sensitive skin. I wish there was less more powerful ingredients than a mix of many. Product contains SULFUR - may break you out
