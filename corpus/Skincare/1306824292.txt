I really like this moisturizer. But, the dispenser fell apart after a few uses (the cap came unstuck). I got it -- sort of -- stuck back together, and am now treating it with great care. As long as it sits undisturbed on my shelf it’s probably fine, but no way could I ever travel with it, and it’s too thick to decant to something else. Really frustrating. Great product, lousy packaging
