Just finished my jar of this moisturizer. I wanted to be obsessed with it but personally it was just okay for me. Not bad, not amazing. I found that it was not “deeply” hydrating. I have what I would consider normal or combination skin and live in Southern California with dry but mild winters, so don’t know how it would work for those with dry skin or in a much harsher winter climate. I enjoyed the scent and consistency and while it did a decent job, I was not wowed with any extraordinary results and didn’t experience the hydration I expected so for the price, likely would not repurchase. basic moisturizer
