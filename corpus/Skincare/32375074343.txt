I enjoyed using this sunscreen on a regular basis. It helps blur the skin and acts as a primer. The sunscreen comes out as a liquid, but once you rub it in to the skin it becomes powdery like makeup. This sunscreen did not clog my pores, unlike most sunscreens. I did not breakout from this sunscreen and it kept my face matte far longer than mattifying makeup. The price is where it is more of a splurge item. The bottle started to become empty far more quickly than other sunscreens because of how liquidy it comes out. I am still considering adding this sunscreen to my routine. nan
