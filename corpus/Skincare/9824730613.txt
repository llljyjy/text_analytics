I received a sample of this product from Influenster and Clinique in exchange for an honest review. I was really pleasantly surprised by this moisturizer! I have sensitive, acne-prone skin that leans dry in the winter. The product itself feels like a gel-cream and applies very smoothly. I usually need to use a heavier moisturizer at this time of year but I felt like this was hydrating enough for all day wear! Admittedly, the sample was pretty small, so I can’t speak to the long-term effects. Based on my experience, I would definitely recommend this product and I’m planning to purchase it as a summer moisturizer! Smooth and hydrating!
