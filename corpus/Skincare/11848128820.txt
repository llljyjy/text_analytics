I revieced this product for #free from #samplesource and it was a one time use foil packet so do with this what you will but I liked it. It didn’t have a bad smell and it was smooth. I think if I had more to try I could be more thourough in my review. But I’d say if your looking for a good serum I don’t think you would go wrong with this. It wasnt irrataring or anything like that. Give it a try
