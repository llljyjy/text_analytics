I did a test of the old formula compared to the new formula on different sides of my face. The old one is way more hydrating and instantly plumps the skin. The new formula is not as hydrating and $40 is not worth this new formula. It also didn’t plump my skin. I have dry skin. The new scent is too strong and does not smell great like the old one. I’d suggest finding a new moisturizer until Laneige brings back the old formula. Not sure if it’s the newly added glycerin or squalene but the old formula is the only thing worth $40 I DID A TEST | FIND A NEW MOISTURIZER
