I’ve used this for over a month..The smell is amazing. My face feels super hydrated after using, and my face feels/looks more firm. My skin tone looks more even and I have less redness. I also have sensitive skin and I was worried about the smell bc it is so strong.. it didn’t negatively affect my skin in any way. This is a lot of money to spend on a serum. If you can manage that, I believe it is worth the price. LOVE
