I’ve been in need of a new moisturizer because in the winter, my skin is extremely dry. This moisturizer has antioxidants that helps with your complexion to brighten it, and also has been a big help with fine lines and wrinkles on my face. If you are not a big fan of scented moisturizers, you might not like the scent of this because it does smell like roses. However, I love scented moisturizer is because my skin is not sensitive and I feel wonderful after I use this moisturizer because I feel the plumpness in my skin and I’ve been using it for a few days now I have already seen results. I recommend using this day and night, and at night to apply a thicker layer of moisturizer, especially if you are prone to dry flaky skin in the winter. Beautiful Moisturizer
