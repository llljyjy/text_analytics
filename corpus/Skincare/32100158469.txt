So I received this for free from influenster and shiseido for my honest review..I’ve been using it for two weeks and it has a light nice smell and a beautiful and breathtaking bottle. I’ve noticed my fine lines are getting less noticable and my pores are shrinking. After I use it my skins feels soft and looks very nice and glowey. Make sure to use a moisterizer after because it can have a little drying effect after a little while of use. 5 starts! Thanks again! AMAZING
