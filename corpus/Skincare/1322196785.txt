I received this product for free from Influenster and was able to get 3-4 uses out of the tiny 15ml bottle. It goes on really smooth and my skin feels ultra moisturized when I put it on. I tend to have dry skin and I really did like this product. I wish there was more in the sample to really try it for a full week to see long term differences. I used it at the beginning of my routine although there were no instructions with the small sample. A little goes a long way! Great Sample - wish I had more!
