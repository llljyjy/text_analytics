I received a sample product for free from Influenster and Clinique in exchange for my honest review.Iâ€™m surprised with how small the sample size is but it did work wonders! Have used the entirety of the product for about 2 weeks! I would say for my combination skin type, its a good moisturizer. It felt my skin is hydrated and moisturized all day and it didnt have that sticky heavy feeling on my face. I definitely would recommend this product and probably buy in the future! Great moisturizer product!
