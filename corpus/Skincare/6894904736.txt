This stuff is magic. I am 49 , with combo skin, surface dehydration and large pores. Occasional breakouts. I alternate using this one night and Retin-A the other night. I’ve used Retin -A alone for 20 years. When I added this to my routine my skin drastically improved. Never have breakouts, balances my skin, evens skin tone, and improves the look of my pores and skin overall. I’ve ordered bottle after bottle. It’s my only consistent splurge as far as skin care. I can’t be without it. If I run out I notice a difference almost immediately. My only complaint is the packaging. You can’t see inside the bottle, so when you run out, it’s always a surprise. You can’t see that you are coming to the end. Other than that, it’s my favorite product at Sephora. How to use on mature skin, along with Retin-A
