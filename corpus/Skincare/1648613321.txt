I figured out at some point that my chronic chapped lips was likely due to a baby sunburn. So I started seeking out lip balms with SPF, and things greatly improved. I love this one! First of all, I just love the woman behind it and what she stands for. That matters! Secondly, it works! My lips are dewy and soft, not sticky, and I dab it on on my way out the door for a walk or to run errands. Here’s what’s interesting... The first time I tried it, there was a faint hint of a tropical scent or something, but every time I’ve worn it since, it’s neutral. No taste, no fragrance that I can detect. And it goes on clear, no whitecast or anything like that. This is a great lip balm that happens to be SPF 30 and it’s everything. Love it! Love it! Dewy but not sticky, and SPF protects!
