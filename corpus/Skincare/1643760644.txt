When I review skincare products, I like to use the same brand throughout the steps to truly test if the brand works for my skin. I like that this set comes with three different face product and how it is light in texture and its citrus scent. The Lemon-Aid Detox & Glow Micro Peel is a wonderful deep pore cleanser, exfoliate and skin brightener. It gently removes dead skin and impurities, leaving you with clean and glowing skin. The product is gently and doesn’t have any abrasive beads or whatnot so the skin is left soft and supple.The Citrus Clean Balm & Makeup melt. It massaged nicely on the skin to melt away even the most stubborn makeup. I like that there was no oily residue left and didn’t leave my skin feeling tight.The Citrus-C Mask & Daily moisturizer is very hydrating and doesn’t leave a greasy film. I have acne-prone skin and I’m happy that this hasn’t broken me out. The tubes are the perfect travel-size essentials and the clear bag make this kit perfect to bring along on a trip! 3 steps to cleansed and hydrated skin!
