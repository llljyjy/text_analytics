Love! I have sensitive skin, and even putting on regular products turns my skin red and sensitive. This balm/cream is hydrating, gentle, and doesn’t leave my skin oily. I mainly use it on my face, but also apply to trouble areas on my body. My hands, elbows, and knees get dry and this stuff works so quickly. I like how it doesn’t leave my skin shiny, and it barely has a scent. nan
