I was really excited to try this product because I’m always on the lookout for good moisturizers especially during the winter time. I like that this is a thicker moisturizer / balm and I could really feel it soak in to my skin and immediately hydrate it. I first tested out the product by using it on my hands as I always have dry / chapped hands in the winter time. After rubbing it in, my hands instantly looked and felt better. I like the fact that it’s fragrance free which made me more comfortable with applying it to my face. However, with it being a heavier cream I only used it for spot treatment on my face. I have naturally oily skin and acne so I’m very cautious as to what moisturizers I apply to my face. This cream leaves your skin feeling a little greasy so this definitely wasn’t something I wanted to apply all over my face but instead like I mentioned, only to the areas that needed it. Overall I did find this product to be effective in helping dry skin. It didn’t necessarily “wow” me or knock my socks off by any means so I’m not sure if I’d pay $60 for a tube of this. But if you’re on the lookout for a fragrance free hydrating moisturizer that’s good for sensitive skin for both your face and body then I would suggest at least giving this product a try! Hydrating balm great for dry & sensitive skin!
