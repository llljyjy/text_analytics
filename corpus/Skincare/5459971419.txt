This product is a game changer. I have acne prone skin with hyperpigmentation using a retinoid. This product works well with my medicated acne creams and has improved my skin tremendously within 3 weeks I could see a difference in my complexion. For reference I am dark skinned. Itâ€™s a must buy. The price point is up there though. Worth the change.
