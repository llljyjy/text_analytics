I have really dry and sensitive skin, especially in the wintertime. Sometimes I have to stop cleansing altogether to avoid painful rashes, but this product was super soothing and easy on my skin. I could use it every day and not feel sensitivity. However, Iâ€™m not a fan of the scent and it could be a bit better at taking off makeup. nan
