Mineral sunscreens are known to have a thicker texture which makes it more difficult to apply. What I appreciate about this sunscreen is that it’s super easy to spread across the face while leaving a minimal white cast. However, the downside is that it’s really greasy -- I find dust particles and my hair sticking to my face. Easy to apply, but too greasy
