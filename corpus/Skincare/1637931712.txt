I love this brand but the product was terrible. I tested it for a week trying different moisturizers and foundations with it, different setting times, etc. It always pilled on me and left my face looking dry and blah. NOT glowy. Also pricey for little amount of product, but would pay it if the wear was nice. Disappointed. Pills!
