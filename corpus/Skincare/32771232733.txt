I received this product as a free sample. I recommend this product. It works very well. I have oily skin but I don’t have too much acne but you know it’s normal to have it some days so I used just when I needed. I could notice it helps because it looks like it dried the zit and actually the products says “use two time at day” but I just used it one time, at night. It has a light texture and is really soft and gentle with the skin. nan
