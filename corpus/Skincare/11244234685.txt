I am relatively new to the Vitamin C niche of skincare, and I have a few different Vitamin C products from Dermalogica, La Roche and Paula’s Choice which are all varying in formulation and purposes. This moisturizer is one of the best moisturizers hands down I have ever put on my face, and I own some pretty $$$ moisturizers. The way I use this product is in the mornings after my serum, I will apply this moisturizer and then apply SPF - sometimes the opposite way too. 2-3 pumps covers my face thoroughly, and I’ve noticed that the redness around my nose, bridge between my cheeks and mouth area have been becoming lighter in redness and more in sync with my neutral skin tone. I’ve also noticed a slight brightness under my eyes, nothing too extreme but enough to make me do a double take of myself in the mirror. This is a wonderful moisturizer, has a slight to moderate citrus fragrance that fades, and I think is a pretty good price for the product - I purchased two because I had a hunch it would be good - which it was! Highly recommend. Yellow Dream
