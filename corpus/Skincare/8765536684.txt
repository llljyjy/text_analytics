I am a huge fan of products made by Dr. Zenovia and was super excited to try out the Aloe Vera Blemish Soothing Moisturizer. I have suffered through different acne types throughout my life and now in my late 30’s have hormonal acne that has left my skin tone uneven and red. This moisturizer goes on light and moisturizes the perfect amount, it doesn’t feel oily or greasy at all. It took about a week before I noticed any visible results but once I did, my ski tone was less red, felt less irritated, and felt smoother, as my husband can attest as well. Another great product by Dr. Zenovia. It's so worth it!
