I have used the day and night cream now consistently for a few weeks and they make a huge difference to my very dry (post-pregnancy) skin.The Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream moisturizes my skin really well, it smells good and I love that the package is rather environmentally friendly. Great for dry skin
