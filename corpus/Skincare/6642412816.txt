I hated the texture of this, it’s hard to describe but it’s like a gel-cream and a balm combined, it felt like I was spreading thick lipgloss over my face. As a mask I can accept that, but as a SLEEPING mask that you dont rinse off, you definitely have to put it on a little earlier than before bed so that it has time to absorb. I did wake up with clearer pores so that’s definitely a plus. Would not recommend deviating from the instructions using as a day moisturizer, way too sticky. Weird Texture
