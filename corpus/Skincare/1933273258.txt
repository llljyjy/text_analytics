This product is the perfect way to re-apply SPF during the day, specially for dry skin. The finish is dewy but not oily and even though it has chemical filters it did not irritate my eyes. The scent is nice but too strong right off the bat, but as soon as it dries down the scent fades. Super ingenious product! Super ingenious product!
