In a world of crappy Vitamin C products, I was a skeptic to start. At first, I felt that the serum was a bit sticky…and I still think it is a tiny bit. I definitely feel like it applies WAY better if you tap it on thoroughly, which is a bit of user error. After continuous use I have really noticed a difference in my skin’s brightness! I have gotten a Botox treatment on my forehead lately and that’s where I notice the most brightness, but I don’t feel like the results are only because of that. I think this serum has made a decent difference in my skin’s overall appearance! I’ve only seen similar results from the Sunday Riley CEO Serum but this is a much more affordable option. I just wish it was a teensy bit less sticky personally. A great vit C once you give it a chance!
