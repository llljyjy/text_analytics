I don’t write reviews unless it is a remarkable product. I’m nearly 70 and have those above the top lip lines that are awful. I’ve never smoked so it’s age. I bought Caudalie’s eye cream for my eyes since I’ve been in constant search for a fabulous eye cream. What I found in the fine print was that I could put this on my lip contours which I took to mean the edges of my lips. I applied around my eyes and my mouth. Within a week I noticed a difference around my mouth. Lips appear fuller and not dry. Lines are softer. At first I thought I was mistaken but this is continuing. It’s been a month or 5 weeks and my eyes are starting to show more brightness and less “oldness”. I’m amazed. This stuff works!  I will purchase again! It’s a Winner
