I bought this after trying the tatcha water cream and finishing out that the tatcha one broke me out. I love everything about The Inkey Listâ€™s Water Cream. It feels just the same as tatcha, it feels very lightweight almost like a big tall glass of water. On the hands it feels like a nice bouncy cream, once on contact with the skin you just feel it burst all over. It feels nourishing and lightweight and left my skin super supple. NO BREAKOUTS YAY!! Tatcha Water Cream Dupe
