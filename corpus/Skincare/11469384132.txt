I didn’t know how much I loved this stuff till I ran out and noticed my texture and breakouts came back. This serum definitely works! My dark spots got lighter within 3 weeks, my skin is smoother and brighter. I have sensitive acne prone skin and this wasn’t irritating, I use it every morning. I just bought the brighten trial kit so that I can try the rest of the line! The size is perfect too, more than enough product to see results by the time you finish the bottle. I never want to run out of this serum!
