If you want a sunscreen to use along with makeup …..this is NOT it. I followed the instructions and still I had a ton of pilling! I even made sure not to “rub” it on my face and I patted onto my skin and still I had pilling. It’s not worth the price, my $6 sunscreen from Pacifica works soooooo much better than this! What a waste of money, and you have to keep reapplying it to truly work. ! I threw it away in the trash where it belongs. junk don’t buy it not worth the hype
