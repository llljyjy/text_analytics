I had never worn a daily SPF until Influenster and Shiseido offered me a free sample. I know what you are thinking “oh she got it for free, or course she likes it” I get it, I use to think the same thing. This product is fantastic and a real game changer for me. I am a 50 year old with broken capillaries on my face, and in my 20’s spent too much time in the sun. As they say.. better late then never. When I first dropped a free drops out, I though, yikes, this is really light (color) but once I rubbed it in, it was a perfect match for my skin tone. It also leaves a very light Dewey/ Pearl shine. It’s beautiful and I love it. It checked all the usually boxes, UV, UVB protection, but this one is light, not heavy, not oily. This absorbs fast, mattifies skin, and I love that it doubles as a face primer. 5 stars from me. Skincare “newbie”
