This is my first experience using St Tropez in any kind. I have to say the result was amazing, the shade is between Brown and orange, which in my medium skin tone looks very realistic. The mousse is concentrated, a little bit goes a long way. It also has the not-so pleasant smell as other faux tan, but is goes away after  your first shower.
