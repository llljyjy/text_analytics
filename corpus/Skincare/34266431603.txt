So I tried the IT Bye Bye Makeup Removing Balm, and while I really want to give it 5 stars I can’t because it did give me some issues with my skin. I would still recommend others to get it and I would not ever put a negative spin on my issue to put down a product,  so I would tell someone to at least try it. In regards to it compared to other makeup removers, it hands down does the job it was meant to do. I had really caked on makeup and I tried with my usual makeup remover and it left behind a lot of my makeup from the previous day. Then when I tried this product,  hands down it took it off my makeup 100%. The texture is a little bit to get used to, as it kinda feels like I’m greasing a cake pan. And you do not have to use a lot of the product, but it does take getting used to that kind of greasy texture. I was able to wipe it off with a wet towel easily, and as far as washing it off, it does come off really fast. The issue I had with my skin is that it made my skin a little bit too greasy. I ended up waking up the next day and had a bit of a breakout because of the leftover grease. And it wasn’t because i left any product behind in my skin, as I washed my face thoroughly. But it left a level of grease on my skin that I can’t overlook and I can’t use a product that causes other issues. As far as the smell, I usually steer clear of rose smelling products, as I find them obnoxious, however this product was very feminine, light, and it smelled really good. This product really did leave my skin soft and supple and it did not strip my skin of the natural oils my face produces like some other products do. So for anyone out there who’s considering this product, I would give it a thumbs up and tell you to try it, as it couldn’t hurt and you may find a product you really like. So just because it reacted this way on my skin does not mean that it’s gonna react on yours that way. Bye bye yes, other issues no
