I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. I have very dry skin and oily t-zone and it left my skin looking and feeling amazing.  It helped control both dry and oily areas. I didn’t give it 5 stars because I’m not crazy about the smell but I can tolerate it. It smells like school glue. Helped my dry/oily skin
