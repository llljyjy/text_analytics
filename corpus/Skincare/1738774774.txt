I have combo skin with an oily t-zone and I happen to live in a humid climate which means I’m used to being shiny. It’s hard to find something hydrating but not heavy and this product was very light but hydrating and didn’t leave me super shiny like I expected. My skin also feels much smoother and calmer as well. The price point is high but I enjoyed this product so much that it’s my new go to daily moisturizer. Moisturizing but Not Shiny for Oily T-Zone
