Major breakouts. I have clear skin that normally radiates. The gave me breakouts that lasted over a week. Tons of random zits with a few deeper pimples. This is unprecedented for me. I use the water cream and have never had an issue. I will never purchase this again. It also just feels like it sits atop your skin, no moisture added. First breakouts in my adult life. It's a no.
