i have been looking for a product that has pure retinol in it. i dont want stabilized retinol because it doesnt give me the results that i want. i want something that will cause the dreaded purge. yes... i want the retinol uglies MAKE ME PEEL PLEASE!!... and well, i believe i have found it. THIS is the only retinol i have EVER found to contain more than .5% of pure retinol OTC. no stabilized retinol. none of this vegan stuff. none of this plant garbage. i really dont understand why people keep trying to push this stuff on everyone. some of us dont want it. some of us ACTUALLY WANT RESULTS. not patronage. and if the babies complain about a little sensitivity and peeling, then you need to make it clear WHAT it is that they are experiencing so that they dont think something is wrong with your product. if you are purchasing this product, and dont know that real retinol has the potential to make your skin sensitive and peel, you probably dont need to be using it. you probably should stick to plain moisturizers. nothing in this life is worth having without a little pain. that being said, within a few days of using this product, i got the purge. there is no other product that i have found that has 1% pure retinol in it. its all stabilized or vegan patronizing garbage. this the inkey list 1% retinol is the real deal and at a bare bones price too. give this a try if you arent taking prescription retin a. i will never buy any other OTC retinol brand!!
