Overall it is a great face cleanser. Pro: easy to dissolve in the palm with a little bit of water, half a bag of powder is enough for one wash. Powders are packaged in individual bags.  One bag is enough for a dayâ€™s use. Skin feels smooth and clean after using the product.Con: not for everyday use as it contains exfoliate material. This product is gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. A must-have to keep clean and smooth skin
