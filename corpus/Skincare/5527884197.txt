I received this product for free from @influenster and @dior in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using this product for about a month. I have dry skin, dark circles fine lines. I I haven’t noticed any improvement. I do like that it is hydrating and the applicator is nice. Something that needs improvement is, it’s difficult to control the amount of product that comes out, it’s usually too much. This is quite a pricey product, I would not pay for this. I wouldn’t repurchase this because I have eye creams from the drugstore that work just as well if not better. I will use it up because if I put it on right before concealer and then put my concealer on before it’s fully dry, it helps. I’m grateful for the chance to try this product. Not worth the price
