I really loved this IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Makeup Cleansing Balm. Ive been using it to remove my makeup and it works sooo good! My skin is left feeling soft and moisturized, other makeup removers usually leave my face kinda of dry and I have to add other products to bring the moisture back. This one did not do that and I like how it is a 3-in-1. I highly recommend trying this if youâ€™re looking for a cleanser that will remove your makeup and leave you feeling soft and glowy! nan
