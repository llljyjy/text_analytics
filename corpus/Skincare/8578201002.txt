Love the original, hate the refill. Purchased the refill to save some money and plastic. I followed the instructions to replace the refill and The pump no longer works and I can’t unscrew the refill to get the product out by hand. I’ve essentially wasted the $42 and my local Sephora doesn’t carry this product so I can’t exchange it. I’m just going to see if I can break the container open to salvage some of my purchase. Don’t buy the refill. nan
