I am a fair skinned redhead. I really like this product. It does have a weird smell, but it dissipates quickly. If you follow the instructions you will not have pilling. Didnâ€™t cause breakouts which was huge for me. The only thing they could improve would be the pump Worked well for my sensitive skin
