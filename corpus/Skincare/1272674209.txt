I wanted to love this so much. The hype and the science, and when you spend $280 on a bottle of cream you start to pretend it’s amazing. The product required me to do three pumps to cover face and décolleté. I bought this on March 14th and I ran out a few days ago. Starting 3 weeks ago I started getting white heads which I’ve never had before. It’s unfortunate. nan
