This cleanser is definitely on the pricier side, but it’s also definitely worth it. The bottle is actually really large and my fave feels amazingggg after I use it. When I wear makeup it takes it off in one wash and I do wash a second time to make sure everything is off— but that’s not necessary. Definitely will be getting it again once I run out. Love it!
