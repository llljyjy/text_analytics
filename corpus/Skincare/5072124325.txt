The texture was thin to be a lotion and even though it feels good on the skin, it didn’t make me feel hydrated. Also I received this as a gift from Influenster and I received a very small sample. I used up the whole sample and didn’t see any improvement on my skin. I wouldn’t be recommending this product as it didn’t do anything for me. Too thin to be lotion
