I received this Laneige Water Bank complimentary from Laneige in exchange for my honest opinion. I’ve liked Laneige products in the past, and this one is no different! I think the floral scent is amazing, and it seems to linger longer after application that most skincare fragrances. For me, this is a positive, but it could be a dealbreaker for those who are sensitive to fragrances. The serum applies easily and left my skin feeling smooth and more hydrated. It absorbed easily and quickly into my skin with no sticky or tacky residue. When I followed it with my moisturizer and makeup, I experienced no product “pilling” and it continued to feel comfortable on my skin. Throughout the day, my skin felt moisturized. I do really like the serum itself! However, my one complaint is with the packaging. While the smooth lines of design and light blue color looks clean and fresh, the thick large rectangular shape also feels a bit awkward and clunky. I think that this could have used a more sleek packaging to reduce waste. It does have a “refill detector” to let you know when you’re running low, but this feels like a novelty that I’ve never needed in more traditional bottles. I would much rather have less extra packaging. The twist feature to the close the pump does seem like it would help limit contaminants entering the bottle; however, I think a small cap could accomplish the same thing.Overall, happy with the serum, but disappointed in the packaging. Great Serum, Okay Packaging
