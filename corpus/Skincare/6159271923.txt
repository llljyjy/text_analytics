I am GLOWING! I’ve incorporated this product into my routine every morning. I have fairly sensitive skin so I apply this after I cleanse and moisturise - I find that when I apply serums with active ingredients after my moisturiser, it’s a lot easier on my skin. This served as such a pretty base before my makeup, I usually wear a tinted moisturiser daily but I honestly didn’t feel the need to after applying this serum! I went with a touch of concealer  and I was good to go - the glow lasted all day. I'm obsessed!
