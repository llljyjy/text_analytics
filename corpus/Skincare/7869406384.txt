I had overall pleasant results with this face wash. It does the job and left my skin fresh and thoroughly cleansed. It is frothy and you don’t need very much product, so it will definitely last a long time and is worth the cost. However, it does result in a squeaky clean feeling, which just feels too drying for my preference. On the plus side, I used this several times and did not have any irritation afterwards, despite the squeaky clean effect. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a decent, moderately priced cleanser and doesn’t have to worry about dryness or sensitivity. nan
