I received this product as a sample from Influenster. I have combo skin (oily in T zone and dry on cheeks, with very sensitive skin). This product reminds me of the Neutrogena Hydrogel moisturizer, except it worked way better on me. Usually gels are not as effective on my skin because of my super dry cheeks, they feel like didn’t get enough hydration. I tried the Clinique product and my whole face felt hydrated!!! Not to mention I did not break out. That feeling of freshness is amazing. I wouldn’t say it lasts 100H but enough to get through a 9-5 work day. I rated 4 star due to the price point. For $50 it is a small container compared to my usual skincare products for that price. But it is a higher end skincare brand and I usually go for more affordable options that still work. Combo face felt hydrated!!
