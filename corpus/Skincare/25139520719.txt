I purchased this product a while ago and just recently ran out. I use the matte maximizer (light pink bottle) every morning. The product is super helpful for getting rid of an oily sheen to your face when you want to go outside with no or little makeup on. It is super lightweight and feels very calming on the skin. I also noticed that it cleared some breakout areas on my face. I would definitely add this product to your skincare routine. Worth the Price
