I’m loving the Olé Henriksen Barrier Booster Ferment Essence.  I have dry skin and hyperpigmentation.  I love how hydrating the essence is.  It almost feels like a serum.  My skin looks and feels brighter.  It smells absolutely amazing.  I’m loving the results so far.  My fine lines are less noticeable. nan
