I’ve been searching for a new eye cream for so long. I finally found this renewal cream. It was recommended to me by a Sephora employee after she listened carefully about what I’d tried and what I didn’t like. This stuff is GREAT. I’m on my second bottle and I couldn’t be happier with it. I would give it 5 stars if it weren’t for the packaging. The bottle is needlessly bulky. Worse, you will waste a lot of cream when the pump can’t get it out of the the internal plastic bag. It’s a shame. And yes, I pulled out the pump and cut the bag. There was more than a week’s worth of cream in there and this was the only way I could get it. No one should have to do this. Please, please change your bottle. It’s aesthetically pleasing, yes. But it is impractical in its heft and wastefulness. Wonderful eye cream, unfortunate packaging
