I’ve been using the Bearberry & Vitamin Glow Serum for about a month now and I’m blown away by the results I’ve been seeing. I’ve had a few pesky hyperpigmentation marks that would not go away but I’ve seen them lighten up tremendously since using this serum. I also love the extra hydration and natural glow it gives. This serum has such a beautiful texture with a gorgeous shimmer. It’s not heavy and doesn’t leave that tacky feeling that a lot of other serums can leave behind. I haven’t worn makeup in a couple of years but I can imagine how beautiful this would look under a tinted SPF or even mixed in with a foundation. I can definitely see why this is an award winning serum! amazing!
