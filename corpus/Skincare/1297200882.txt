Oh wow, look at me spend an entire fortune on this cream! This cream went on smoothly and my skin felt so soft and hydrated. I was surprised on how much I enjoyed this cream. I have used a few of Lancome’s more “high end“ creams and always seen results but, the price tag on this one takes the cake...and it definitely deserves it. I consider it a hydrating facial in a bottle. Someone take my credit card away :D nan
