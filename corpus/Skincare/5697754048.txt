Not for me. Unfortunately my skin broke out as soon as I started to use this product. I stopped for a few days, and my skin started to clear up. I used it again and my skin broke out again so I returned the product.  On the upside, the sales consultant was awesome when I had to return it. So I ended up buying a moisturizer there rather than going to a competitor. Not for me.
