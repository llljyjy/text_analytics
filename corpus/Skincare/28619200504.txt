Just ok. I have regular/normal skin. I was really looking forward to this being a very hydrating + glow overnight mask situation. It let me down. It feels nice, smells good, but vanishes by the time I get my jammies on and leaves my face wanting more. I end up applying moisturizer on top to achieve the desired “go to bed and hydrate“ effect. I wouldn’t bill it as a hydrate + glow mask, it’s an ok hydrator but didn’t give me that locked in beneficial hydration or glow I get from other creams. Pricy for a mid-level hydrate
