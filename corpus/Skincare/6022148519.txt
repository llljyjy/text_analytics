I love this product! It’s definitely moisturizing, especially because I have dry skin. I get nervous trying new products because I break out easily in pimples even at 32, but also excited to try something . I’m glad I got the chance to use this because it has done wonders for my face. The texture is smooth and soft and a little goes a long way. I can’t wait to purchase this. I highly recommend this product.I received this product free from Influenster in exchange of my honest review. nan
