Product is thicker than I’m used to (think cream, not lotion) but as soon as you put it on, it def feels like something is happening (you can feel the moisture being absorbed). It’s not too heavy (a little goes a long way) and my face doesn’t feel sticky afterwards. Not sure what smell people are referring to (not off putting to me because I can’t smell much). Still a little too early to notice a difference, but I have very dry/sensitive skin and so far no complaints from my skin! nan
