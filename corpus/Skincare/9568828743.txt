I am a sunscreen junkie with tan skin and I love  wearing makeup almost everyday. I was impressed with the texture, performance and smell of this product. Do you know how difficult is to find a mineral sunscreen that doesn’t leave any white cast? This one helped with some areas with enlarge pores, leaving the skin pretty smooth and it doesn’t smell like oil(like most mineral sunscreen). It’s my first time using this brand and it definitely didn’t disappoint. You can see the product and after blending it. It’s pretty good! Mineral Sunscreen without white cast
