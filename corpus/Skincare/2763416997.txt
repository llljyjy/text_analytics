I received this product for free from Influenster and exchange for my honest review*I really enjoyed these pads - The smell was light and fresh, and I like the way they felt on my skin- my skin felt very rejuvenated after use. Occasionally some products like this tend to cause redness but these did not bother my skin at all . I would definitely recommend this product to others.. The only thing I would change is that the pads are so thin itâ€™s difficult to apply the product without them rolling up into a ball Would recommend!
