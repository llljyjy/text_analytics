So I bought this a long time ago and used it for a bit. I recently picked it back up because my skin was broken out like never before, but also dry and oily in odd places. I swear this fixed it all over night. I have one stubborn pimple left (my fault, I popped it) but other than that, a clear and soft complexion. I used this product alone and only at night and thatâ€™s probably why it worked so well. Sometimes less is better. Highly recommend if you have combination skin. Overnight Miracle Worker
