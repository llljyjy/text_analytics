Not good, not bad. Certainly not worth $122! Maybe if this product made huge improvements in my skin but I didnâ€™t see any marked change while using. The consistency of this product is on the thicker side and felt nice when applying. I had used it after I removed my makeup to prep my skin for skincare at night. Not worth the $$$!
