I was sent this product for review from Influenster though my review is 100% honest. I was sent a 5 ml sample size smaller then the palm of my hand. This only gave me about 4 small uses. On the first application I noticed it left my skin feeling very smooth and sank into my skin very quickly. As someone who had more normal to dry skin this worked well. Though I have been working extremely hard this year to take good care of my skin. I believe if my skin didn’t have the consistency of my skincare routine since January this wouldn’t of been a good moisturizer for me. I don’t recommend this to anyone with very dry patchy skin. I do not know what the long term effects this moisturizer would have on my skin as I don’t have enough product to test that. Sample size review
