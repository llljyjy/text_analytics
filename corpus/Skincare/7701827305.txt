Keep in mind I have this in the mini size which came in .5 OZ in the mikayla X glow recipe set. I used it just as it instructed which is twice a day, 2 pumps. It lasted me about a week and a half…. Even less. Since the one I have is half an ounce compared to the full size of one ounce, I’d predict the full size to last about 2 weeks? And for the price it’s so not worth it, even tho it’s a really really nice serum Runs out fast
