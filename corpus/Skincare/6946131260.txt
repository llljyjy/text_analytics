Love this product so much. It made me break out at first but once my skin got used to it I became obsessed. The smell is amazing also. I don’t like the bottle it comes in though. While it’s cute, it’s not functional. It’s a struggled too get the last 1/3 of the product out of the bottle because the pump doesn’t reach or something. Super frustrating!!! Product good, bottle bad
