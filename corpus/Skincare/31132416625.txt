I’ve heard so many rave reviews on Charlotte Tilbury beauty products, and that they are worth the price, but I’m sadly disappointed with Charlotte’s Magic Serum Crystal Elixir. I only used it for 1 week, so I can’t say that it was long enough to see an improvement in wrinkles. I had to stop using it because the smell was so unpleasant, and it felt like there was a residue on my skin, even with very little applied.I give it 2 stars for beautiful packaging with a chic glass bottle and the potential to be effective if the smell appeals to you. Sadly disappointed
