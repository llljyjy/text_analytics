I bought this since the Kiehl’s Super Fluid Daily UV 50 SPF seems to be out of stock permanently. Pros: good sun coverage, blends in nicely, no white cast. Cons: sunscreen smell at first (that does fade), thicker texture so you do have to work it into your skin more, it doesn’t blend in as nicely as the Kiehl’s so if you have really oily skin you might want to use less or find another option nan
