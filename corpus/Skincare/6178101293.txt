I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. I am actually not normally a fan of eye creams, but was surprised with how effective this Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream was within a few days. I experienced noticeable and visible results within the first few days. The cream has a firm consistency, is cool to the touch, and absorbs well when applied. I would recommend this to others and plan to purchase a replacement when I run out! Effective Eye Cream!!
