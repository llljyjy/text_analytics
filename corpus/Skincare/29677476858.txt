I usually use this before I take a shower. I use about once a month. It makes me skin very soft and smooth. I feel clean after a long month of build up. After the shower I like to put on a barrier mask from dr jart its in a yellow package. Putting both together will keep your skin smooth and cleaning feeling for days.  Would recommend this product if you use it correctly. 5 stars
