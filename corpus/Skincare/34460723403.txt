I’ve been using HABIT sunscreens for about 5 months. I was looking for a sunscreen that would spray well over my face and makeup later on in the day, since in the morning I apply mineral SPF directly to my skin. I’ve been loving HABIT already because the mist is super fine and sits well on my skin and makeup. The bottles are small enough that I can stash them everywhere too! I’ve used the cucumber scent until HABIT sent me this new white peach + neroli scent. It’s my favorite!! It doesn’t have any chemical smell whatsoever and of course the formula sprays well and sits well. Thank you HABIT for filling a gap I had in my SPF needs!! LOVE
