I got this product about 3 weeks ago after my usual vitamin-c serum was discontinued. I liked my old one because it went on flat, was very liquid-y (not oily), had no fragrance and really did make me feel more awake and bright. My first few times using this product was great. The texture was a good white mix of oil and other liquid. However, the past 2 ish weeks that I’ve tried it, it only comes out as a clear oil that makes my face supppppppeerrrrrr greasey and makes me break out pretty bad in ways I don’t usually break out. I tried shaking it and all the things, but I can not get the normal serum out anymore and am very disappointed especially because of the pricepoint. My old one was $25 and was perfect, could be built with other skin care and makeup on top. This one I have to wait 10 mins and actually wind up patting it off because of how oily it is. Pic is the breakouts I’ve gotten and 10 mins after application (still visibly oily) Not worth the $$$
