How am I just learning about this???  This is the best makeup remover I have EVER used.  I just swipe my fingers across this and rub it into my face, 16 hour lippie, mascara, then rub it off lightly with a warm wet cloth and BAM, makeup is gone.  Just gone.  No rubbing, scrubbing required.  I will never not have this again. The very best, honest.
