I bought this product initially because I heard it was a good makeup primer for dry skin. I use it as the last step in my skincare routine when I’m planning on wearing makeup. Not only is it one of the best primers I’ve tried, it genuinely is an amazing skincare product too. It feels so nice on the skin and I’ve noticed a big improvement in skin softness. I now use it nightly as the first step in my routine, before applying tretinoin and then a heavier cream, which has cut down on irritation. I'm in love
