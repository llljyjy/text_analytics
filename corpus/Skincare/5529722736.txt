The product feels like silk, smells great. It absorbs into the skin and does not leave behind a sticky residue. It makes my skin look extremely smooth after application. The bottle however reminds me of my great grandmothers perfume bottle from the 70’s but luckily the product makes up for the packaging. I love that it’s glass! I would absolutely recommend.
