This product isn’t bad. It does the job it’s supposed to do fairly. I’ve used better, but it does a pretty decent job. The price seems great, but it really isn’t. I know this is the mini size, but I expect to get about 3 uses out of this container. I’d rather pay $10-$15 for a cleanser that will last me several months. This does a pretty good job, it didn’t melt all of my mascara off. For the size, it’s just not worth the money. Save your money.
