I’ve been using it for 12 weeks and have started to see results (I will keep using it longer since I know products like this sometimes take longer and continued use). It is gentle to my skin, it doesn’t irritate my skin at all which is great. I have used other products for dark spots in the past, and they always make my skin irritated or gave me rashes. My dark spots did not magically go away, but the spots are not as dark as they were. I have also noticed my skin does seem brighter as well. I will keep using it till the bottle is gone because I have liked what results I have gotten so far! Works Great!
