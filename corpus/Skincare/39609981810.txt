I received a 7 day trial Clarins Double Serum from Butterly as a free product in exhange for my honest review.The sense was a little strong for me but lucky it subsided after a few mintues. I have combination skin and I found the serum too greasy for me. The serum took longer than my other serums to absorb and left my skin looking very oily and shiny. I stopped using it after two days. Not for me
