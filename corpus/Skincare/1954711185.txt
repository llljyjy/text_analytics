I received this complimentary from influenster for my honest review, I’m surprised at the cost for this 29ml bottle. It’s so cute though. Love the package. I hoped it did what it labeled to do. The side indicates a list of harmful ingredients it does NOT contain. The other side the ingredients that it contains and how it helps your skin. After using a handful of times. I’m amazed with how smooth and soft my face felt in the morning. If I see results with continued use I would definitely continue this product! Free from influenster for my honest review!
