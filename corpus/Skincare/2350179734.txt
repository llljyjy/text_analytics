Loving Confidence in a Cream!!! I started using this after getting a little too much sun and am so thankful that I’ve had it to rescue my skin this summer!  It’s super moisturizing, goes on evenly and absorbs quickly.  I love that it doesn’t have a scent and a little goes a long way because it’s very hydrating.  Definitely going to make sure I have plenty stocked up for the cooler months when that dry winter skin hits and totally sharing with my family and friends so we can all be hydrated and glowy! nan
