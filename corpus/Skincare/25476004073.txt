I love this lotion! It’s gotten a lot cooler in Texas and my tan has started to fade! I took this with me on vacation to Vegas, and it gave me so much confidence! The slight tanning it gave me it’s beautiful, and looks very natural - a great complement to my natural town. The only downside was slight staining to my hands. Summer time fine
