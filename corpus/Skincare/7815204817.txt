I really like Laneige but this product didn’t do much for me. I have combination skin and I liked that this product wasn’t as sticky or oily. However, I did not notice a major difference after using the product consistently for the last couple months. I’ll probably move onto another vitamin c product unless they change their formulation. good not great
