I’ve used this product for the last week and it has been lifechanging. My skin looks so much brighter and I noticed that some of my dark spots have begun to fade. This serum was easily incorporated into my daily skincare routine. It doesn’t pill up or behave weirdly when I use my other products as well. The applicator is super cute and easy to use. I absolutely love the packaging. I looks so sleek and sophisticated, and I feel like the amount given would last a really long time.Overall, I really enjoyed this product and recommend others to use it. Absolutely Amazing
