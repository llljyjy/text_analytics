This product has been amazing. I use it every evening and have for the past 10 days. I have been using it in conjunction with the 3 piece J Lo set too. It is keeping my skin bright and hydrated overnight so I wake up with fresh skin that’s ready for the day. I appreciate that it’s not TOO lightweight because it’s for overnight and I need it to work all night. Scent is unremarkable lol but it smells like a serum would.  It is really making a difference in my skincare routine. SHEWWWWW ITS GOOD
