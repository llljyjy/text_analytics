I was gifted this product for reviewing purposes. I wasn’t disappointed in this item however I wasn’t wowed by it either. I used it for a little over a month and honestly noticed nothing other than it was hydrating like using a good moisturizer before bed. I fully believe you can find a cheaper product that will work just the same and some ever better. So I can’t really say I’d actually purchase this or recommend it to anyone else. It felt nice and didn’t have a strong perfume scent which I dislike but it didn’t do anything that made me go “wow this is incredible” Nothing to write home about
