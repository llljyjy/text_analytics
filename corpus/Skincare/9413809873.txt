This cactus water is AMAZING! For the size and price it is definitely worth your money. I use this product in the morning 1st step in my routine in replace of washing my face. I use this on a cotton pad and it always pulls out some dirt on my face even when I deep cleansed the night before. It leaves your skin with a gorgeous glow that feels clean and refreshed. I would 100% recommend this for all skin types as a morning toner. New must have!
