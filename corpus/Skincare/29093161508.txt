I’m not a huge fan. This makes my skin oily when I wake up, which is not something that I’ve ever worried about or had issues with. I’m new to retinol, so not sure if this is normal? Regardless, not a fan of how it feels or smells (chemically). Also, I’m not sure that it even remotely helps with my fine lines but I only use occasionally bc I don’t like how it feels. nan
