I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. I’ve been waiting to try glow recipe for a while since seeing it in store at Sephora and on socials but wasn’t really sold on any one product until I saw this moisturizer. So so glad I decided to Add this to my stash - it is the perfect last step in my nighttime skincare routine! This leaves my skin feeling soft & hydrated all night without being too heavy. The consistency is THICC & I love it! The scent is very light and perfect for my sensitive skin. 10/10 from me, would definitely repurchase! If you have sensitive skin, this is a 10/10!
