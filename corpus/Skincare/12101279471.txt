I could not figure out how to apply this product and have it not pill/ball up for most of the summer.  I read the reviews warning of this problem but thought maybe it was exaggerated because there were so many other good reviews I thought I would give it a try.  After trying it over and over again I think I figured out how to apply but there are too many caveats for me to buy again.Pros--Great for my dry and sensitive skin. -White cast does go away after rubbing (but I do have pale skin)-Skin looks dewy and pearlescent, no tint but to me gives a great “no makeup“ makeup look.-No scent.-Didn’t burn my eyes.Cons-- I can ONLY WEAR IT BY ITSELF.  No essence; no serum; no toner; no makeup (I tried under eye concealer and blush) under or on top of; no water on my face, hands, or hair line, OR IT WILL PILL UP/FLAKE OFF IMMEDIATELY.-When applying I can only apply about a finger tip dab amount at a time to one area of my face, rub it until the white cast is gone (maybe two or three seconds) and then stop rubbing and apply in next area of face.  If I apply about a quarter/ generous dollop amount and massage into face or, God forbid,  keep massaging after white cast has gone it will PILL UP AND FLAKE OFF IMMEDIATELY.-And when I say flake off I mean it looks like the whole product crumbles like parmesan cheese all over the place and you have to keep brushing it off your neck, lip gloss, eye lashes and clothes for the rest of the day. - Am not great at reapplying sun screen like you should but imagine that would be impossible for me and have it not flake off. USE ALONE
