We all know that effective vitamin C is not coming in a clear bottle, so forget any long term C benefits. However, this does have a decent glow/plump effect in the morning. I also love that it gives you time to spread it around completely before it gets a little tacky. It does well under spf and a little concealer, but go further than that and you might experience pilling. Affordably priced as far as serums go. not bad for what it is!
