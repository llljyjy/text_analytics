I’ve always really loved Estée Lauder products since I was young, and I was so excited to get a chance to try out this cream. The first two things I noticed were the scent and the formula. I don’t normally get scented products because my skin is a lot more sensitive than it used to be.The scent is pleasant, but what I loved is that it didn’t make my skin breakout! The formula is a true cream - on the thicker side so it doesn’t glide on as easily. I do really like the application, though, as it doesn’t leave a greasy feel on the skin. I would try this again, but I think I’d pick up an unscented formulation if they have one! Nice formula! Pleasant scent
