Ya know it’s working when your high school students tell you your skin looks amazing! After finishing these products, I bought the full size face wash, Vitamin C serum and moisturizer. I didn’t love the scrub because it felt too abrasive on my skin, but the others were winners. Buy if you like compliments!!
