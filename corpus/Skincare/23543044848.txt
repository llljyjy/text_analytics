im a big fan of this moisturizer! i definitely use it as a first layer for hydration, with a cream based occlusive top layer. its good to draw more moisture to the surface, but is less of a heavy protective layer. honestly, i mostly wish they had a bigger bottle. i find myself having to buy again every three or four months, and it makes me use less often because i hate not being able to get a value size :/ nan
