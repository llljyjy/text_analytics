I love the actual product. Has a sweet scent, keeps lips hydrated, and provides a glossy sheen.Unfortunately I cannot repurchase due to the poor packaging. Halfway through the tube; product just stopped coming out. No visible clogging. After squeezing like a maniac, the balm bursted out and the applicator tip was cracked. Now when I squeeze the tube, product oozes out from the cracked portions instead of the actual opening. Poor packaging
