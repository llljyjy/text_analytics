Bruh why is this so hyped up? It’s honestly a bad oil cleanser and doesn’t properly remove my makeup, like when I wipe my face after I double cleanse there is still a little bit of foundation on the towel. Also it leaves a residue on my face and has a weird texture. Wouldn’t recommend. Poor Cleanser
