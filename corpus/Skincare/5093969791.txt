I was honestly surprised this didnâ€™t burn my skin! I was afraid to try it out because of the retinaldehyde and niacinamide. I always have a reaction when I use salicylic acid so I just knew this was going to be similar.. I was wrong! I used it once every 10 days to start and I am feeling confident enough to try it every week now. It definitely smoothed my skin texture and I could tell a difference about 24 hours later. It did dry my skin around my lips (which is where I usually have my reactions but I had zero burning!) so I would recommend using the cactus serum like YTTP suggests and make sure you use some lip balm at least twice a day. Overall, I would definitely try it again! Sensitive Skin here
