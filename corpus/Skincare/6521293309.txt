I received Biossanceâ€™s Squalane and Vitamin C Rose Moisturizer for free from Influenster and Biossance in exchange for my honest review. This moisturizer has not only moisturized my skin, but left my skin looking brighter and radiant. My skins feels refreshed after each use morning and night thanks to the antioxidants provided by squalane, vitamin c, rose, and lemon. I especially appreciate how this formula has been designed for all skin types, vegan, and non-comedogenic. Certainly recommend others to try it out as well! Amazing moisturizer!
