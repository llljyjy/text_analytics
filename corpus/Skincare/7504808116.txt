I love the way it makes my skin feel after using it. It makes my face feel soft and smooth. The only thing I was hoping it would help with is my pores but I didn’t notice a big difference in my pores. I also wish it was scent free. It didn’t irritate my skin at all which I was nervous about because my skin is so sensitive. nan
