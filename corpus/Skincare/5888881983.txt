What a magical little product. Coola has yet to disappoint me with any skincare product. I’m always afraid I will feel greasy with something like this, but that is not all the case. It provides just the right amount of “glow” at none of the UV-ray cost. It smells wonderful, protects you from the sun, and is easy to build makeup over. Just wish it was cheaper. nan
