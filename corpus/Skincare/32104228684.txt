I will never not have this in my skincare rotation. I use this as my nightly moisturizer. A little goes a long way and I’ve found it works best when a thin layer is applied. That being said this product lasts me a long time considering I use it nightly. I am not a huge fan of fragrance in my skincare but I enjoy the scent of this and it doesn’t irritate my skin. 10/10 will always recommend. a staple in my routine
