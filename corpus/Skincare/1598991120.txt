I’ve enjoyed using this product for the past few weeks. It feels replinishing without heaviness. It’s held up through summer’s hottest and driest days. This Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Creme from Clinique didn’t irritate my fairly sensitive skin. I definitely feel the difference where I’ve used it -- new smoothness and a more even tone. I recommend and would purchase
