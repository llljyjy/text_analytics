I was so excited to try this product! I love the way it dispenses, it smells fresh and is moisture heavy. One thing that could be improved is the ability to know when you are low on product, I hate being stuck without moisturizer and because it’s not a see through package or open bottle item it’s hard to tell where your at with what’s left. Used for about 2 weeks and no major reactions or anything. I have dry skin and it is pretty moisturizing! Moisturizer heavy and a little goes a long way!
