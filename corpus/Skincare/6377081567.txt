I got another beauty from Influenster and holy grail moisturizer! I know it has to be pricey but not did it work, it is winter right now so my skin is dry and flaky but a pea size of this covered my whole face and smoothed out at the roughness and looked like I had put in a blurring primer. One day I’ll get a new phone with a better camera so I can show proof till then you’ll just have to trust me. Plus the fragrance was soft and feminine, this has been my go to on non makeup days to help smooth the skin and fill in the pores. Blur and moisture
