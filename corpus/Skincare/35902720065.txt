The Cay Skin Isle Glow Face Lotion is absolutely AMAZING! This was gifted by Cay Skin and I have nothing but good things to say about it! I literally apply this product under my makeup or just use it alone! It applies so smoothly and has a great scent. The scent is very faint so it is not overpowering at all. You canâ€™t even tell that you are wearing sunscreen. It did not irritate or breakout my skin whatsoever. I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone looking for a daily sunscreen. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING
