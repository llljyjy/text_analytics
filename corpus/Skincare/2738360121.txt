What I wanted: A lightly hydrating and easy to use cleanser that also removes makeup. I got none of that. With Squalene literally being in the title, I expected to feel somewhat hydrated after washing my face. Nope. Love the concept - melts into a nice milk and is so convenient for taking off makeup compared to the potted cleansing balms I love. Unfortunately I donâ€™t even feel like it did that well. Really had to work it in around the lashes to get my non-waterproof mascara off. It also burned around my eyes, which I can happily say none of my cleansing balms have ever done. It lives in my shower now as a morning face wash. Great in Theory, Awful Execution
