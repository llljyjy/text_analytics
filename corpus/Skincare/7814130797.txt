My skin has been really dry and flaky lately and this jelly cream came straight to the rescue! Haha itâ€™s been leaving my skin moisturized and glowy.  The texture is jelly like and once you put it on your face it feels watery and so refreshing! I definitely recommend this product if you have dry skin! This product was complimentary from innisfree :) Worked miracles on my dry skin
