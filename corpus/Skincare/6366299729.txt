This product was recommended by a TikTok makeup artist and beauty advisor, especially for older women. Since I do love Caudalie products I decided to try this.  It is expensive but you need very little on application.  The product is very smooth, non-greasy, and non-irritating.  The metal ball applicator is very convenient and soothing.  I have noticed a difference in my dark circles.  The texture around my eyes is very bright.  Highly recommend this product. Really works!
