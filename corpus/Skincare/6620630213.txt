Ive used this product a few times now and I definitely notice a difference in the texture and overall appearance of my skin. My skin feels more hydrated in the mornings and my complexion looks a lot brighter. I can really speak to the hyperpigmentation just yet since its only been about a week and a half but Iâ€™ll definitely keep using as it layers well with my other products. Super hydrating
