I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. I chose to try the Ilia C Beyond Triple Serum SPF 40 Mineral Sunscreen and I am no disappointed at all! For best results, follow the instructions on how to use this product. I waited about 5 minutes after applying my moisturizer to apply this serum and it did not pill on me at all. Shake the bottle, apply the drops directly to the face and gently swipe and tap into your skin. it looked dewy, not greasy, on me. If you love the dewy look, then no need for powder. It had a skincare scent - not floral, but more like a clean scent. The ingredients worked well with my skin type. I wish it wasnâ€™t so expensive, but I would re-purchase again since it did work for me. No pilling on me!
