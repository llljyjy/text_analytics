My favorite! I love the new formula and feel like it’s so much more effective (I’ve been using this for years). Vitamin C is unstable and should be mixed right before using it for the highest potency. FYI: if you’re vitamin c serum has an orange tint…it’s already oxidized. People complaining about the new formula don’t know what a true vitamin c serum should feel like (yes it’s runny…yes it’s a little sticky…it’s supposed to be!!). If you follow the directions and mix it correctly it works wonders! New formula is so good!!
