I was looking to find a moisturizer that would keep me looking hydrated and not greasy. This moisturizer is perfect for my skin, having oily skin. The only downside is it doesnâ€™t have SPF, so i always just put some on after. It makes me look very hydrated even when i have makeup on. A MUST FOR OILY SKIN !!
