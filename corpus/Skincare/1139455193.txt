I’ve been using this serum for the past week and liking it so far. I have highly reactive skin and my skin feels comfortable with this. It has a gel-like consistency that feels cooling on the skin, which is a plus. It absorbs and doesn’t feel tacky at all. I find my skin glowing in the last few days and hoping it continues with this product. I like the scent because it’s not obnoxious. It has a light floral but clean scent. Would recommend. Glowing Skin
