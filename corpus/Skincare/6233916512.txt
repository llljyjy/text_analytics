Bought this product and was scared to use it on my oily sensitive acne prone skin, so it remained in a drawer for months. I’ve been struggling with hormonal/mask acne for a couple years now.. nothing was helping. Finally tried this and wow! Like night and day! My acne is gone. The oil is more controlled and yet my skin still feels hydrated. My skin glows.. GLOWS! Can’t believe I left this little miracle in a drawer for so long!! Amazing!!!
