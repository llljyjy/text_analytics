I’m not sure if I’ve used it consistently enough to see results. I like the way it makes my skin feel, as for looks I haven’t noticed a reduced redness (which was one of the reasons I purchased) I have dry, acne prone, very sensitive skin and it didn’t make me break out / have an allergic reaction. I still use a primer over this product because I don’t find it to be hydrating. I feel it’s overpriced for what it is. nan
