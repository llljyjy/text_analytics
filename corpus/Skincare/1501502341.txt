I am obsessed with this mask!  My skin felt glowy and moisturized for 12 hours.  The mask itself had a cooling effect which was nice but the serum itself was the star of the show with how long it lasted and how moisturized it left my skin.  I bought several more and intend to use weekly through the rest of the winter months to keep my dry skin happy and hydrated! a MUST BUY for dry skin!!!
