This is one of my favorite products. It tightens and smooths and, it’s probably not doing anything for you if you don’t have anything to tighten or smooth. I’m not sure I can live without this one. Per the other reviews, I’m going to try to use less. It’s so nice that it does not feel like a clay mask, all drying me up, making it look like it’s cleansing every pore individually... but I will say this, it does just that! I don’t want to oversell it as it clearly has been, but it’s a great exfoliant if you are just using one. Love it. Can be harsh, you've been warned.
