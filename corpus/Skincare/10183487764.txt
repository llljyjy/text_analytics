I received this product from influenster and korres for my honest opinion. I honestly did not see any difference in my pores using this product. It did hydrated my skin. Which has become dry during the cold winter months. The smell,  I thought,  was not very pleasant. For the price,  I thought other products or there were better. I can not honestly recommend this in good faith. Ok, but have used better products.
