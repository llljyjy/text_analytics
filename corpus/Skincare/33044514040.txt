I’ve been using this for a few weeks and it has now replaced vitamin C in my routine. My skin is smoother and plumper, with none of the redness or irritation I experienced with L-ascorbic acid or even vit C derivatives. Since I’ve started going for more hydration and gentle ingredients rather than a continual onslaught of actives, my skin has really responded. This in the morning, with evenings alternating a gentle mandelic acid and a retinaldehyde, all surrounded with nourishing moisturizers and barrier-friendly allies. Chef’s kiss. There is a slight smell (metallic copper, as you might expect), but it’s not strong and doesn’t linger. The blue hue also doesn’t stay on your skin at all. I tried the Deciem CAIS, but in addition to being far more expensive, the texture was so watery I didn’t have any confidence about the skin coverage I was getting. This is the product for me. Very Pleased
