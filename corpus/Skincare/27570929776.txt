I really like that this does not dry out my face like most products. It doesnt take off all my makeup so I do have to double cleans and I use this one after my first makeup removing cleanse. When I need to exfoliate my skin I do use this with some coffee grounds. My skin feels rejuvenated, soft and clean. nan
