Edit to add, review 10.31.22 : I just got this in my vox box and color me absolutely thrilled. Ever since my last review, I’ve bought this cream a few times and to get this in my vix box was a true squeal moment. This is a great cream for people who have dry skin like me but don’t want to be weighed down with the typical thick creams marketed towards us. This is very quick to sink in and leaves my skin looking supple, healthy, soft, and not dry! Especially useful for the cooler months that’s for sure. Previous review : Have been using this cream for about 2 months now and love it so much. It is rich even though it is not the rich cream and has sunk in very quickly on my normal leaning dry skin. It leaves me soft and not greasy looking at all. I’ve gotten a LOT of compliments since starting to use this cream too! Will def rebuy and already have. A Great Gentle Cream!
