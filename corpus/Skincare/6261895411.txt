It’s convenient because it’s a stick and has 0 white cast but I only use it on my neck now because it broke me out and it’s incredibly sticky and greasy and not in a moisturizing way. Your hair will stick on this with any breeze and be careful around the eyes if you have sensitive eyes, they’re really irritating. Also there’s a fragrance, it’s nice and mild but definitely there. nan
