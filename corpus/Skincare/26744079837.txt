combo skin gals this is for you!! i’ve never found a moisturizer as good as this. it moisturizes my dry parts and doesn’t leave my oily parts shiny the next day. it doesn’t leave my skin tacky or dry like some moisturizer(some popular ones are kinda dry when i first apply and then a few hours later turn my face moisturized) amazing please go buy this it’s my holy grail now. the only complaint i have is the packaging u cant twist it down or anything so u just have to squeeze super hard even tho 50% of the bottle is left. i de potted it into a jar for easier accessible nan
