My skin felt SO squeaky clean after using the dermalogica microfoliant. I did have a couple small breakouts a few days later but thatâ€™s pretty typical for me using any kind of exfoliatant on my face. This though has definitely been the best. I will be getting more when I run out. -complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling A new must have in my skincare routine
