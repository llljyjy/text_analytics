Lovely facial cleanser! I adore that this is made with good, vegan, cruelty free, and clean ingredients. I love the fragrance free portion as well. I really like this cleanser - its feels like it gets the job done without stripping the skin. I have dry to very dry skin and I never felt that my skin was tight after washing which I hate and I have used plenty of different facial cleansers. It feels gentle and lathers just enough. This may not be for everyone but it definitely is for me and my skin type. The consistently is somewhat jelly like and feels great in my hands before applying to my face. 10/10 recommend Non-stripping face wash
