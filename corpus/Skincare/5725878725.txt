I tried a sample of the tanning drops and wanted to grab a full size. I found this set and knew it was a steal. I drove all the way into the city to pick up the set only to find white mold-like material floating in the tanning water. I contacted customer service to see if they could be of help. Unfortunately, since it was purchased in-store I would have to return in-store. So now I have to drive another 30/45 minutes into the city to return the product. Not only am I inconvenienced, but I am very concerned that Sephora may be selling old/expired products. There are other reviews complaining about the same expired tanning water.  Very disappointed. Don't Purchase, Old Product
