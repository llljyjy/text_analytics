Wow… I can’t believe I avoided this moisturizer and brand in general for years. I received the mini version for my birthday gift this month and I put it on. Wow, I’m extremely mind-blown! A little goes a long way. This is great for normal to dry skin. It leaves my skin extremely soft, moisturized, and of course, dewy. My makeup even looks flawless when I have this moisturizer on. Love it!!! Where has this been all my life?!
