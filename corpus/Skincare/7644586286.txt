I enjoyed this eye serum, however I prefer other eye serums and creams more that are much cheaper with fantastic results. I don’t have many wrinkles around my eyes, however I am 36 years old and do invest financially in skincare when it is a product I enjoy. Price tag isn’t really a factor for me when a product works well for my skin. I did purchase the full size of the facial serum in this line, however passed on this one. Rather than making my undereye feel hydrated it greesy and like it was sitting on top of the skin rather than sinking into the skin so it just wasn’t for me. Meh.. not for me.
