I was excited to receive this moisturizer, when I got it I couldn’t wait to put it on my face. the moisture this moisturizer provides is insane! I apply it at night before I go to bed and when I wake up my face feels amazing! It smells pretty good too, also love the fact that it helps with blemishes! It’s a 2 in 1! A moisturizer that helps with breakouts is a everything if you as me lol. I highly recommend this. Oh and let’s not forget it is good for all skin types!! So stop reading this and go get it, you will love it Great Moisturizer
