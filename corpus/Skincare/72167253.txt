I have combination skin with some sun damage and crows feet. I was pleasantly surprised that this serum added firmness and evened out lines around my eyes after two weeks of daily use. I like the fact that there is little to no fragrance and the texture is somewhat thick. I think someone with dry skin would see even more benefits. The price is good for the quality and amount of product. If you are looking for a serum to help with skin firmness and texture, I recommend you give this a try. Great texture!
