I received this product for free for my honest review.I absolutely love drunk elephants packaging. Given that it is also purple, it’s a huge plus it’s my favorite color! But onto the product itself. It feels nice as far as consistency goes. You can expect it to be more of a richer eye cream. So if you are someone who is prone to milia, I would not recommend this for you. After some days of use, it started to burn my eyes. So I removed stars.When it comes to skin care, I definitely prefer more medical grade products, and that is why I rated it down also! nan
