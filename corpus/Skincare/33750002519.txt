The product is great, my skin feels hydrated and ready to go at the moment I put it on but I can’t say I feel a great difference after a few hours. This can also be caused to the really dry winter weather we’ve been having. All in all the serum is great, a little goes a long way, I would recommend if you need a little pump. nan
