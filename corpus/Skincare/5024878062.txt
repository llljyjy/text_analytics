While I value reviews tremendously, I haven’t written one in years. Enter this serum. I’m 32 and I’ve been self-conscious about my pores for a while. I’ve tried half a dozen serums and masks and nothing really did much. When I first started using this product nightly, I didn’t expect too much, but thought it was worth a shot. Cut to just three days later and my pores were smaller than they had been in years and years. I’m blown away by the results of this serum. HG doesn’t do it justice. Seriously, this is the serum to get if you’re worried about the size of your pores. This is the HG pore serum
