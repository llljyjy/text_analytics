This was gifted by Supergoop but is officially my go-to sunscreen for reapplication when I’m on the go! It’s such an easy fine mist that doesn’t feel sticky or require my to use my hands at all. You can be generous with the spray without it feeling heavy which is key for me to make sure I am using enough! nan
