I received a sample of this skin cream for review from Influenster. I loved the way it felt on my skin, I haven’t really noticed my pores changing at all, so I’m not sure about that. It doesn’t really have much of a scent at all that I noticed, but overall I loved it and it left my skin feeling moisturized! Great moisturizer.
