i’m so torn with this! on one hand, it smells wonderful and lasts on lips for so long. on the other, i don’t love the packaging. it dispenses so slowly that i always end up dispensing more than i need and then it gets all sticky. but I truly love how it feels on my lips! other lip masks i have tried tend to slip off my lips, but this feels more sturdy without being sticky nan
