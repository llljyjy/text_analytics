If you have dry, sensitive skin, this feels beautifullll. It cleanses well but isn’t drying at all. It’s non irritating, feels so soothing and calming on the skin. I’m excited to keep using! The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because of the price but overall, a really nice product. So Gentle!
