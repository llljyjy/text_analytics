My skin loves this stuff. Super hydrating on its own, even for my dry skin. It works wonderfully as a thin barrier for my sensitive skin when applying stronger actives like Tretinoin. I do find I’m only able to use it at night, because it’s so hydrating it leans a bit oily/ overly dewy for day time use. Very Moisturizing!
