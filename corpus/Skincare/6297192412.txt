I received this as a free sample from PINCHme. I’ve been using it for a few weeks now. It moisturizes my skin quite well, but I find no difference in fine lines or firmness. I’ve also had a few breakouts that I hadn’t been experiencing before using. For the price I won’t be purchasing this product. Okay moisturizer
