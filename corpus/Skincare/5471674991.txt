I felt this product did a very good job of hydrating my under eye area. I also seen slight improvement on my dark circles, the area lightened slightly. Besides this I did not experience any drastic changes but perhaps a longer time frame of this product could change my opinion. Overall I’d say give it a try everyone’s skin is different and you never know it might be your holy grail product!P.S I received this product complimentary from Influenster to try and give my honest feedback. nan
