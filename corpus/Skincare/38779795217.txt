*These are gifted by Dermalogica Sampling* For starters, my samples arrived very quickly. While the packets looked very small at first, they had pretty solid amounts (at least for me). Theyâ€™re also really easy to use and cleanses well. My face felt refreshed after. I think these are great for traveling, would consider buying a full size in the future. Convenient for Travel
