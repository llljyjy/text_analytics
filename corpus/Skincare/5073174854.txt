I purchased this mostly because it smells good. It does a good job, but I loved how it smelled before. It had a delicious scent and I loved it. I opened it and was disappointed to  see it had no scent. I know that it is a better move for people who are sensitive to fragrance, but I feel like I wasted my money. I won’t purchase again, because I have other products that work better for me and I don’t really need to detox my skin. So weird as it is, I was loyal because of its scent. Disappointed
