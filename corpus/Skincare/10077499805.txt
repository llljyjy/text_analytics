I know this is probably geared more for the face but since it says face and body, I decided to try it on my hands. I have an issue with the palms of my hands getting visibly dry. The Cica Recovery Balm works so well for them. It really does hydrate for a long period of time. There is not a heavy perfume to it which is nice. And I did use it on my face and it works well there too. I just really love this for my hands. Love this for my hands
