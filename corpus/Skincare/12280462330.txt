I will definitely be repurchasing this mask forever! I have very acne-prone skin that is sensitive, red, and oily. I followed the instructions by using the mask for 4 days in a row and then 2-3 times per week after that. After the second use, I noticed a difference myself. After the third use, I was getting compliments from friends on how my skin looked. It’s now been almost 3 weeks and I am blown away! I have never found a product that works so well, yet feels so gentle and doesn’t irritate my skin at all while soothing any redness. I haven’t had any major breakouts since I started using it (just a small pimple here and there when I’ve worn heavy makeup). My skin feels smooth and soft, and looks bright and clear. No product (and I have tried them all) has worked this well. Wow! Amazing for acne-prone skin
