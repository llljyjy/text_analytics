I’ve been using this overnight treatment for about two weeks and I’m really enjoying the moisture and brightness that I wake up to in the morning. I like that it is free of parabens, sulfates, formaldehyde, etc. It claims to have ingredients that lock in moisture (probiotic extracts), boost the appearance of firmness and smoothness (AHAs), reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles (Indian gentian, give the appearance of brighter more even-toned skin (vitamin c). I have combo skin with dark spots and a few wrinkles. I don’t see any changes to my wrinkles, but my dark spots look a tad bit lighter and my skin is very moisturized. I can not speak on firmness. Here’s what I don’t like - THE SMELL. It’s awful. It smells like plain Greek yogurt that’s days away from being expired. It doesn’t smell once it’s applied into the skin, but when you first pump it out, the smell is very noticeable. The packaging is cute and the upright pump is a new twist. Overall, I like and will keep using. I will just hold my breath while applying . So far so good!
