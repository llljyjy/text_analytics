Sad and disappointed. I fell in love (online) with this product! Bought it and once the battery died, I charged it and now it doesn’t vibrate at all! The light turns on but no vibration still :(Not sure what could have happened there but I’m disappointed I didn’t get the chance to notice a difference. nan
