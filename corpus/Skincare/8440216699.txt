I only really struggle with hormonal acne on my chin, and this cleanser has done wonders! I use this after I take my makeup off using the Oat Cleansing Balm from The INKEY List. My skin never feels dried out from using this cleanser. I consider this cleanser to be my holy grail in terms of combating my hormonal acne! nan
