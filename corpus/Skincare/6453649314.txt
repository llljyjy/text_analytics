I tried this product for a few weeks before this review. It stands true to its claim of “blurring” huge pores while also hydrating my skin (which is rare as creams minimizing pores tend to be harsh on skin). It went on really smooth and was very lightweight which I adored. I think this would be a great daily cream to use in warmer spring/summer months!I received this product complimentary or influenster in exchange for my honest feedback. Perfect lightweight spring cream
