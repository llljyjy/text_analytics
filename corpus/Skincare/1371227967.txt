This is so creamy & luxurious & absorbs so well while hydrating without any greasiness or stickiness. I love this moisturizer! My skin felt smooth, hydrated and looked more glowing, radiant, & even toned. It didnâ€™t pill when applying makeup over this either.  My skin loves this and I will always continue to use this, I think I found my HG moisturizer & I have used many from beauty boxes & purchases. This is the Best!
