This moisturizer is very light weight, and has a thin consistency. It absorbs into the skin very easily without leaving any kind of greasy residue. It smells like lemon pound cake, which I think smells delicious. I would definitely consider this for a replacement moisturizer once I run out of the one Iâ€™m using. Great cream!
