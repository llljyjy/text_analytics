Hello magic tinted sunscreen!I rarely wear makeup so a tinted sunscreen is totally something I can get behind! That plus the fact that I feel like not only did it give me the little bit of color that I desperately need but also made me skin look more vibrant than normal. It says to put on a generous amount but I say a little goes a long way and you just need to rub it in. Would recommend to anyone! Received via Influenster
