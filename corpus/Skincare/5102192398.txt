Received this cleansing balm from Influenster and I have to say I will definitely buy this again!! The Clinique charcoal cleansing balm is not as soft as other cleansing balms but this slightly stiffer texture works perfectly! And you donâ€™t need much to make it work! It even takes off my mascara without any tugging or struggling, it leaves my skin feeling so clean and very soft! Did I mention how big the container is?? Absolutely wonderful! Great cleansing balm- little goes a long way
