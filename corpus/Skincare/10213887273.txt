I have bought sooooooo many of the old formula of this. I initially bought it for the spf to wear with makeup-less looks like at the beach & on vacation and it soon became my go to lip with a little liner every day almost. The tint lasts hours. I’d reapply maybe once or twice out of habit. The tube was metal and high quality, now it’s a little less quality. I just purchased a new one and had no idea they took the spf out, I’m kind of bummed. Seems they should have gotten less expensive in my opinion. Bring Back The Old Formula
