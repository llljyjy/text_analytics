I’ve tried so many products in the desperate hope of seeing hyperpigmented areas on my face lighten, if not disappear. Nothing worked, no matter how religiously I used them. Just when I was starting to resign myself to the fact that these bothersome blemishes were here to stay, I happened to hear about Eadem in one of the skin forums I follow. Made especially for skin of color... that certainly piqued the interest of this brown-skinned female. Fast forward to a month of using this magical serum day and night...I can’t believe my dark spots noticeably getting lighter! Not only that, it gave my skin a nice, healthy glow as well. Thank you, Eadem! I will forever be your fan! Great for hyperpigmentation
