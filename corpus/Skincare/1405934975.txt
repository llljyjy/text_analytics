Has a great smell and feels really nice. But it completely stripped all moisture from my face. I’ve never felt my skin so tight and exhausted. I had to use 3x the normal amount of moisturizer. A few days of using this and my skin doesn’t feel good. I have combo skin and usually only get a little redness, but I think this is better suited for teens going through hormonal changes or people with very oily or acne prone skin. Better for teens/extreme oily skin
