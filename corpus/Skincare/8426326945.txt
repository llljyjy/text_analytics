I’ve been using this for a month. I quit using all other serums and just used this and a moisturizer. My skin feels so soft and I have noticed diminished pores. It hasn’t done miracles for my lines but they aren’t getting worse. It’s quite expensive for what it does but a little does go a long way. This bottle will last probably five months for me. nan
