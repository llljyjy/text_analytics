I was pleasantly pleased to receive this cream! It has a very light creamy citrus scent that quickly goes away. I used it for my face and especially my neck and chest. I like to use higher end products for my chest and neck because I think it’s so important in looking younger. I took a before picture and a pic 2 weeks later and I actually see change. It quenches my skin dryness without being oily or wet feeling. I think when I continue using it I will have even better results! I will update! I’m happy I found this! Moisturizing and non irritating
