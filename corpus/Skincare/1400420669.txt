My skin is really sensitive, so I don’t use a lot on my face. But I will say I love this cream. It absorbs really great into my skin which is a must for me. I often find that a lot of products just sit on top of my skin and then roll off when I’m trying to apply makeup. Also what’s the point of a product just sitting on top of my skin and not absorbing to do what it needs to. This one definitely absorbs in and you don’t need much of it. A little goes a long ways. I only use this once a day and do see a difference on days I don’t use it. It decreases the appearance of fine lines on your face. Mostly where I noticed this was in between my eyebrows. I highly recommend this product. I’m also a nurse and science nerd so knowing the research that went behind creating this adds to me being a fan. Check it out! Sensitive Skin Review
