I received this product free from influenster in exchange for my honest review .Truly love this. It’s light weight, watery even and instantly sinks into your skin. Does not feel greasy at all.  It smells really good- maybe citrusy or something. It’s SPF 50 which I love. I wear sunscreen everyday so being in love with it is a must. This one definitely made the cut! #complimentary #AquaBombSPFSquad A definite from now on
