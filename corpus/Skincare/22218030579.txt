I can’t rave enough about this cleanser... it seriously saved my face!! I used to have horribly dry, dull skin, (especially in the -30°C weather where I live,) to the point that it would become painful and itchy. I was even breaking out more because of how damaged my skin’s moisture barrier was. After a few weeks of using this, my skin began to transform and heal. I’ve been using it for over a year now and I’ll probably never go without it. My skin feels moisturized, soft, and glowing! I literally have better skin now than I did in my 20’s. I definitely recommend giving it a try, and give it a chance to work for you. The best!!
