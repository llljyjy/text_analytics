I loved how light it was and that it wasn’t greasy but you need to use a lot of it and I didn’t see any results at all whatsoever with any of my wrinkles but it’s a good mosturuzer for sensitive skin I didn’t break out or have a reactionTo it like I do with other wrinkle creams, but I need something that removes dead skin to reduce the appearance of scars and this does nothing therefore it can’t reduce wrinkles either Not what I need
