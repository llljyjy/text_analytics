About 7 days in and THERE IS A DIFFERENCE! I’ve always struggled with texture on my forehead since I was 14 (20 years now) but as I got older and out of the acne phase, it’s just been moderately textured skin. Always showed under my makeup, etc. After reading reviews and hearing about this product, I decided to buy and I am so glad I did. Can’t believe there’s already a difference, and everywhere on my face that isn’t textured is nice and glowy. Surprised at the speed!
