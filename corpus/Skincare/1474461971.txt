I don’t have a ton of experiences with the Origins brand but I’ve tried samples I’ve gotten from Sephora and have a couple of friends who love the brand as well. I like to always give more natural based products a try because I feel like they’re better for your skin overall. This serum dries quickly so I had to be sure to try and apply an even coat to my face before it got a bit tacky. My skin concerns are acne, unevenness and overall preventative care. This product claims to address all of them and I am just not sure. There did seem to be a dewy/glowy plumpness after use but I can’t tell if it’s just kind of temporary the same way a lip gloss plumper causes your lips to swell/enflame for a short period. Overall I would give this a 4/5. Very cute sleek little tube bottle though! I featured mine with my tea caddy/Zen/relaxation corner for self-care Sunday! Undecided, but I'm leaning towards yes!
