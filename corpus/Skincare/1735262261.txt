I will forever use this moisturizer before bedtime. I’ve always had trouble finding one that isn’t greasy but moisturizes enough. This one is perfect. My face is soft in the morning after use. Lightweight and you don’t need much. Strangers have even commented how my skin is glowing in public. I’m so in love with this product. Will recommend to everyone. Love love love!
