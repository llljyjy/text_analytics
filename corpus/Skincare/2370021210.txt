This is the first time I have given a product 1 star. The reviews were rated so well I thought why not. Firstly- I saw absolutely no difference from applying this product. Second- it wasnâ€™t even remotely hydrating thirdly- for the price the tube is so tiny. Not much product, which would be forgivable if it actually worked. Not worth the hype
