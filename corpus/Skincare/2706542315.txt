Great smelling, good texture. A little goes a long way. I have an oily t-zone and am dry around my mouth and just under the apple of my cheeks, so I ease up the application on my forehead and jawline, and use normally around my mouth. I like how it leaves my skin feeling. It’s actually improved my oiliness in my t-zone. I got the sample for my birthday last month and it didn’t last, only because my daughter was using it without me knowing lol. Improved my oily skin
