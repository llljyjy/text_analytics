At first I thought my skin would probably feel greasy from looking at the texture of the cream. Then I applied to my skin and was not expecting it to absorb so beautifully. I was looking for a moisturizer that would pack a punch and deliver results and Confidence in a Cream did not disappoint. After trying it for two weeks I noticed my face feels more hydrated, bouncy, and my fine lines around my eyes are less visible. I would definitely recommend to anyone and replenish once Iâ€™m done. I look forward to my skin care ritual every time now that I added this to my routine. Obsessed!
