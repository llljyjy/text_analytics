I love this mask, it does make my skin look flawless and plump the next morning.Smell is minty like eucalyptus, but smelly like something herbal. Not very enjoyable at first, but you get used to it. The Blue Tansy Oil smells better comparatively.REMOVING A STAR BECAUSE WHAT THE HECK IS THIS PACKAGING. THE STUFF IS FILLED TO THE BRIM AND THEREâ€™S NO PROTECTION AND ITS L I Q U I DIT LITERALLY POURSSSSSSSS OUT ALL OVER THE PLACE. I love this mask so much but every freakin night it makes a mess. Great mask, terrible messy open jar????
