I received a free sample as part of a promotion for reviewing purposes. After trying this moisturizer for roughly 3 weeks I can honestly say that it is AMAZING! My skin is now super soft, smooth and supple. I’ve even had people ask what foundation I use to make my skin look so good and we’re surprised to know that I don’t wear any! My only take away is that it does make my already oily skin a lot more oily so I couldn’t give it a full 5 stars. Lives up to the hype!
