The formula is amazing so smooth and lightweight, my only reason I have to give a 4 is because the bottle isn’t so good. Since its a very liquidy moisturizer and it leaks easily and the product is everywhere when you open it… I loose so much product! :( wish it was a pump style. GREAT formula… not so great packaging
