Works really well for fading dark spots! I use it for old hyperpigmentation. When acne forms a whitehead, I slap a pimple patch on it (while using BPO or BHA) until the pus is no longer an issue. Then, I use faded on it during the healing process :) Makes for much less problems dealing with hyperpigmentation caused by acne. A little bit goes a long way as well, so you get good value for the price.People complain about the smell, and it is noticeable-- but I let it dry down and wash my hands before applying the rest of my products. I donâ€™t notice a lingering smell that way. nan
