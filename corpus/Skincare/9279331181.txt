I love this stuff. It cleared up my acne and got rid of all the redness on my cheeks. It has no fragrance which I love since I am allergic to fragrance but does have a light chemical sent when you spray it which I do not mind. Once it dries on your face you can’t smell anything so it does not bother me at all. Try this if you have redness or acne you’ll love it. I kinda just wish it wasn’t so expensive. The bottle is pretty small for the price you pay. it works!
