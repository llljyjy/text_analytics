The texture is thick not as easy to apply as I normally like, so I feel like I’m pulling my skin a little when applying it. It settles in surprisingly quickly, though, so I don’t feel like I have a thick layer of goop on my face which is the only reason I will see this bottle through to the end. Won’t buy again though. Thick, but not in a good way
