I have been using Clayton’s double serum for 2 days and already notice such a difference in the look of my skin. It is more radiant and feels like it just looks so much healthier I did notice that it has a floral scent which didn’t bother me too much but definitely more scented than other products I use. I can’t wait to continue using it for the full seven days and see if my skin improves even more!#gotitfree nan
