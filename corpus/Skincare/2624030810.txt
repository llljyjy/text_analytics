Loved the scent of this serum. It felt like a decadent treat that was thick but not overbearing. Much more luxurious than some other serums Ive tried. I only had a sample to test it so I can’t say much about the long term effects but I can tell it’s a good one. The sample packets could be improved. Sometimes I felt as if I only got one half of the serum. This is great for oily skin. A decadent treat for your face
