I’ve been using this every day for almost a month now and I’ve definitely started to notice that my skin texure has improved so much! my face looks really smooth and has a very subtle dewy look to it. doesn’t have a noticable scent and sits well under my usual moisturizer. for frame of reference, I have light, combination skin. thanks for coming to my ted talk love this stuff
