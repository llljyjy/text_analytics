Did not love. I was looking to find something comparable to the Herbivore Prism facial, and this was not it. Not a fan of the gritty polishing beads in the mask, way too rough for a peel. Happy I got the mini size and didnâ€™t go for the full size. Herbivore prism facial is way better than this as far as a facial peel goes. nan
