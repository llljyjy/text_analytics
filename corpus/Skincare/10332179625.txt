I received this compliments of Influenster! When I got this product it felt like such a treat because I’d never buy this for myself! I appreciate this moisturizer has SPF -I know SPF is important but Im just now making it part of my skin care routine. It’s very lightweight and keeps my skin feeling great all day. Unlike some moisturizers that leave me feeling dry a little while after. I have combination skin. Treat yourself a d give it a try! nan
