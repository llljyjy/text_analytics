I initially loved this product and was so excited to find out they had a serum that mimicked the results of their mask. The first couple of weeks were great and I saw amazing results: Minimized pore size, smooth skin, etc. After continued use, I started to notice light spots on my face, specifically around the cheek area. I am melanated, so it was very noticeable. I didn’t want to write this product off so fast though. Other products or ingredients could’ve been the culprit, right? After eliminating products, stoping use of this serum, then restarting, I determined this product was causing hypo-pigmentation. So sad. :(I am going to retry this product and only apply on my nose area, where my pores need the most help. Hopefully, avoiding the cheek area will help. Caused hypo-pigmentation
