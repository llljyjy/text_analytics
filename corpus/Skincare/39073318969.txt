Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme Moisturizer 1.69 oz/ 50 mL“Incentivized” I received this product in exchange for my most honest review: Skin Type And Concerns:I have normal skin but since I live in the state of Connecticut; during the fall and winters that quickly changes. Within these seasons most of my face remains normal with the exceptions of dryness around my eyebrow, below my cheeks where contour would normally go, a small area of my chin, and the nostril area of my nose. Other concerns I am currently experiencing are very small fine lines around my forehead and eyes. In the fall I also have little pimples around my nose from dryness. First Application, Results, & Impression:Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme Moisturizer is a very thick moisturizer, it has a very subtle floral fragrance that is pleasant, and a few dabs of the moisturizer will go along way so apply very small amounts and work that in before proceeding to add more. Upon application the moisturizer felt a bit oil, even when I applied very little but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was fully absorbed by my skin with minutes of letting it set. I immediately noticed that my skin was extremely soft, my face felt hydrated, and lifted….much more firm then before the application. Due to it being my first application, I can not see a visible difference in my skin just yet. I can however see that it is hydrated and glowing. Another thing I noticed right away would be that the moisturizer did not irritate my overly sensitive eyes and (I truly appreciate that).The update:It is day three with Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Creme Moisturizer and I am in love, my skin is indeed firmer, hydrated, glowing, without irritation, and the moisturizer workers wonders under makeup. In fact, I set out to Sephora to purchase the entire line plus a bigger jar. I love this moisturizer!
