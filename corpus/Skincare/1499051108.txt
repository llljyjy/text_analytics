I really wanted to love this moisturizer. I enjoyed the texture, when applying it seems to melt into the skin. It doesn’t feel heavy or oily on the skin. It absorbs nicely and doesn’t leave a thick feeling film on the skin. However, it doesn’t offer enough moisture for me. Halfway through my day my skin feels dry. There is a light fragrance but it isn’t cloying or linger long on the skin. I didn’t see or feel a massive change in my skin. I will probably enjoy this a lot nore in the summer when my skin isn’t as dry. nan
