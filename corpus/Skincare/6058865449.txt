I’ve been using a sample of this product for a little over two weeks now. I thought it would be thick since it says “night repair” but it’s actually a smooth, light texture. While I haven’t noticed any difference in my under eye dark circle texture, I do feel like my overall complexion is brighter. I’ve been using it as a one and done when usually I have a night cream, moisturizer/serum, oil. This treatment made my face tingle upon application. My husband tried some too and had the same reaction. I have oily/combo/sensitiveish skin and his skin is normal. one and done!
