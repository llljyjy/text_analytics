I’ve been using this for about a month and haven’t noticed any improvement in my skins brightness/tone. I like the idea of mixing the product yourself but its really runny and sticky. It takes 2 pumps to cover your face/neck/chest because it dries so fast in your hands and doesn’t spread well. It’s also impossible to layer sunscreen or makeup over it because it’s so sticky it causes everything to pill, it might be better if I used it at night but I prefer to use vitamin c in the morning. The packaging also feels cheap and the smell isn’t great. Overall not worth the price nan
