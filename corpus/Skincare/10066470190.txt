The packaging is gorgeous and so luxurious, and I love the hygienic pump, but I was overall not impressed by the product itself, which was a bummer as I’m a huge fan of Shiseido. The serum is fragranced, which might be irritating for anyone with sensitive skin, and while I do think it offers a little bonus hydration, I didn’t see any other difference from using it for a few weeks.
