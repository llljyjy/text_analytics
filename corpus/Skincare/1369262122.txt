The pump is the WORST. So, I don’t like sunscreen. Who does? I don’t want my skin to be greasy or shiny. However, a mist is an easy way to apply. But, this pump is TERRIBLE. It’s not really a mist, it’s more like a spray. Which does NOT apply evenly. I immediately poured the contents of this bottle into my urban decay setting spray and that was much better. It also kinda stings when applied, but switching the bottle helped. And it does kinda leaves a greasy “glow” and it feels greasy too. It’s not that bad. I just wish they could improve the formula and the sprayer nozzle for sure is sub-par. It’s sunscreen. But, it could be better imo
