This “lotion” is more like water. The smell is extremely overpowering and I haven’t noticed any benefits from this product. I’ve used it on my neck and chest the very first day I received it in the mail and I broke out 2 days later. That was the only new product I used so I didn’t try it anymore because I was scared of breaking out again! Weird texture, strong smell
