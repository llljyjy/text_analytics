I tried a sample size and noticed the awful odor. Thinking it was just a bad jar, I moved on to the bigger size. It also s bad. When  I contacted the company to ask about this, I was told “it is all natural without perfumes but you can mix some of the rose oil to alleviate some of that odor.“ Rally? I’ve used unscented natural products before and they have NO odor. Don’t tell me is is the smell of the  natural ingredients. Won’t be buying this again even if it does moisturize. The odor can knock you over.
