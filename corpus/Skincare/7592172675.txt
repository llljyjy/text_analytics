One of the best balms I’ve used in the past few years! I have used two before, and this balm gets EVERYTHING off. Especially tricky mascara and eyeliner that gets stuck in my lashes! I didn’t need to wash again with a makeup removing oil either. This in with the milk primer makes such a bomb combo, the primer keeps it in place and the balm removes everything! It didn’t dry me out and had a pleasant light smell, i am so pleased!!! best makeup removing balm!
