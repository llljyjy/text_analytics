Okay so I got super excited about this BHA trend so I was so excited when I got this. It can be a little drying so don’t skimp on moisturizer when you use it!! It’s a serum with 6% salicylic acid so if you use do not use with any other hydroxy acid products or toners. It helps unclog pores Im obsessed… it’s like a cream serum it’s notClear and really gets in those pores when you rub it in. Big fan been using twice a week on my tzone nan
