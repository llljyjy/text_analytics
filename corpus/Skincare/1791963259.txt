I received this product in a subscription box.  I did not try it for a long time but decided to try it this week.  I am really happy with the way it leaves skin feeling.  Ive used at night and in morning.  Appealing light scent.  If by the time I finish the small jar I have and it is still this good, I will purchase.  I am going to explore their other products as well.  Five stars so far.  PS I have regular skin type (over 50). Really happy with this product
