I’ve been using this serum for a few months so I could give it a legitimate review.  It feels really nice on my skin.  Super hydrating without being greasy.  My skin does seem brighter and happier with the moisture but haven’t noticed any positive effects as far as anti-aging goes.  This probably isn’t the best product in the world but I enjoy it and it’s worth trying out especially with drier skin. Decent
