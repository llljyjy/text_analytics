this is a must have in my skincare routine! the consistency is watery but hydrating especially for my dry skin. for this price, you canâ€™t complain! i find that The Ordinary products are the best in the game. the ingredients are simple and its perfect for layering other serums and cream. this gives me the glass skin look which i love! RUN, don't walk!!
