I’ve used dozens of skincare products from drugstore to prestige brands. This product is in my top 5. The texture is to die for, and it doesn’t pill up on my face like other products. I’ve been using it for almost 2 weeks, and can already see a difference in fine lines. You don’t have to use very much, so the bottle will probably last me 3-4 months at least, but likely more. nan
