I got the Hemp wipes and while they honestly work great at removing my makeup and whatever, but the perfume was burning my skin. They did remove my lash glue so that was impressive. After use Iâ€™d have to wash my face really good after use due to how oily and slimey my skin felt afterwards. Good remover, too much perfume
