I am a sucker for trying everything and sticking with nothing. With aging skin at age 49, I am trying to find the perfect most efficient skin care regimen and I think I have found it. Liquid gold has given me a glow that has been missing since I was pregnant. I highly recommend this serum as part of your regular skin care regimen. It took a Few applications, but I am sold and will continue without end. Goldmine for the aging!
