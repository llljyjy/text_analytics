I have very sensitive skin and it is very dry during the winter but normal during the summer. I found this product… ok. It irritated my skin and caused dry patches as well. It did however keep my skin clear and soft. Didn’t particularly see much change in wrinkles but I only have a few laugh lines. Over all I would just rate this as average and not worth the irritation was ok
