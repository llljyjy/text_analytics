Love this Serum. Though it is not a “need“ it does make your skin feel so plump the morning after. Some reviews on here complain about pilling, but the trick is not to use it with other oil based products. Stick with all water based products. Will definitely purchase again even if it’s more of a luxury than a need. Lives up to its promises
