First time use1.don’t use this on your hands feet or face. 2. Use sticky pads on your feet or wash the bottom of  them with soap after spraying. Trust me haha. 3. I used gloves as some other comments said they had to use so much product. I barely used that much, and it evenly rubbed in. Basically spray in sections (upper body) rub rub rub- then arms- rub rub rub etc. 3. This is not drying so far. I left it on over night. Rinsed in the am (don’t use soap first wash) just rinse and use an ultra hydrating moisturizer while damp. I actually don’t feel dry or have that burning feeling after as I do with some. 4. When done, use a damp wash cloth to hit your elbows wrists ankles and knees to prevent deeper color. 5. I did use this on my feet and hands. I did moisturize them prior too. It looks bad. Very splotchy and uneven. I normally use a blending brush with a color guard light tanner on my hands and feet for this reason. So skip your hands feet and face so you don’t have to go through the dreaded scrub off with dove for 3 days. 6. I will add the scent is horrible. It does not stick after rinsing. So today, it’s actually probably one of the least smelling tans that I have used, but while wet it absolutely smells horrible. The good news is that is doesn’t stick and has almost no smell after rinsing. nan
