I was not expecting this product to work so well with my skin. I have mostly dry skin and the poreless skin cream did keep my skin hydrated and fresh throughout the day. I would apply this after my toner and it really does keep the skin moisturized without feeling greasy. A little also goes along way! Poreless cream!
