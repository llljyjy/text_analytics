This Dior OFF/ON cleanser is a nice cleanser to add to a routine. It’s a super creamy and somewhat thick to start off. As you mix it with water and rub it onto your skin it feels creamy and foamy all at the same time! It glides across your skin and is very comforting. I found the scent of it to be pleasant and mild. I use it at nighttime since the cleanser also removes makeup. It does a good job at cleaning my skin. It rinses off well and gives my skin a ‘squeaky clean’ feeling. It feels smooth and not dried out like other cleansers do. I normally use drug store makeup removers and cleansers; however, I might be repurchasing this cleanser instead. I like Dior makeup products a lot, and this cleanser performed even better than I expected. Although Dior products can be pricey, they noticeably are higher quality than other comparable options. Great cleanser!
