I really enjoyed trying this product. I really liked the feeling when applying it it felt nice and thick but then no after feeling, not sticky it tacky at all. I did have some issues with discoloration on my face due to sun exposure I was hoping it would help but I didnâ€™t notice any changes. I would recommend overall, it does leave your skin feeling moisturized.  No noticiable smells. Nice moisturizer
