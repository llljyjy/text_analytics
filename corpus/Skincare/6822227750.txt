I love this sunscreen. It makes my skin smooth and gives a natural glow. You do not feel a heavy cream on your face as it mostly happens with other mineral sunscreens. This one has a silky texture. On days that I do not want to put make up on, I just put some blush and I look as if I had make up. I also like that it has hyaluronic acid to hydrate my skin. nan
