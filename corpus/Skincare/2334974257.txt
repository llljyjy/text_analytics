This is similar to the other shisiedo urban environment sunscreen but I feel like this one is more formulated for the body. That’s how I’ve been using it and I feel like it works great. It rubs in easily, leaves no white cast, and works well on my pale skin on a hot sunny day. This is an easy bottle to throw into your bag on the go. It’s expensive but I would absolutely use again. nan
