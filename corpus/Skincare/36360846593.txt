i purchased this after some internet influence and it’s great! it applied smoothly and absorbed pretty well. but compared to my much cheaper and smoother korean sunscreens, it honestly isn’t that great of a deal. i would give it a 5 star rating if it were a bigger size. this one barely lasted me two weeks. good, but not worth it
