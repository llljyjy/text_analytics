I am so glad I tried this!! It smells good, is pretty to look at and felt soo nice on my face! Some balms can feel kinda too “heavy“ or “greasy“ but not this one. It also never caused any kind of break outs. I also just love the subtle opalescent colors in the lotion, doesn’t show on your face but it’s just a little thing that made me love this stuff even more. ♡LOVE!♡
