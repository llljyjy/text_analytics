Great for hyperpigmentation and helps with my acne breakouts. The smell is a bit strong but it doesn’t last long THANKFULLY. I use it mostly at night cause I don’t want to have onion face during the day lol. Using sunscreen is recommended so I double up just to be sure. It’s a great deal for the price. The girls that get it, get it.
