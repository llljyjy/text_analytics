I should have realized all the 5 start reviews were from receiving the product for free. The smell is so strong, I’m not opposed to fragrance in products but in this it just lingers and it’s not the best smell. I will try and continue to use it and hope it actually works but so far nothing. I’ll update my review if it helps but not sure I can continue to use it with the smell. stinks
