’ve tried an OLDER version of Multi-corrective Anti-Aging Eye Cream in the past, it was okay, but not impressive. Compared to the old version, I really like the new version. I’ve been trying this time, and I was able to see the difference it made. It’s easy to blend, super hydrated and a little goes a long way. It contains niacinamide, which is a very popular ingredient. After a few days’ use, twice a day, I saw my dark circle getting a bit lighter, which was a surprise to me! Definitely will buy it again! Recommend!
