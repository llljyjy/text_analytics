It is a serum moisturizer that goes on after toning and before moisturizing/priming. It is very lightweight, absorbs quickly, and plays very well with makeup. My skin appears dewy and glowing after I use it. I donâ€™t find that it helps mattify or controls shine throughout the day and the price is steep so that is why I docked off one star. I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Nice Lightweight Serum Moisturizer
