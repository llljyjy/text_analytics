Sephora Collection gifted me to this product, but the opinions are completely my own based on my experience. After using the Sephora Collection Smoothing Cleanser for a few weeks, I can confidently say this has changed my skin for the better. I have very sensitive skin and this product is not too harsh or overpowering on my face. I love how clean the ingredients are and how they are cruelty free. I am always looking to find brands with clean ingredients and morals when it comes to creating their products and Sephora always creates the best quality items for an awesome price. I went and bought this product for my sister after using it for a few weeks because of the noticeable difference in my complexion. For $10 this is an absolute steal of a deal. If you are looking for a sign to buy this... GO ORDER IT!! One of the best cleansers I have ever used!!!
