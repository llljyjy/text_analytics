The Josie Maran Infinity Cream Intense Cream Oil is truly amazing! A little bit of product goes such a long way since it melts down into an oil. I think this will last me a very long time. It does a really good job at hydrating some dry patches on my skin. My skin soaks up this products and doesnâ€™t just sit on top of my skin. A new skin care favorite!
