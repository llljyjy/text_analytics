Highly recommend this to combat redness, and calm sensitive skin. I received this kit to try from Influenster and was super excited. I purchased the color corrector previously and loved it. So I was excited to try the serum and moisturizer. I now use the serum and moisturizer daily. This kit gives you a chance to try out some great Dr. Jart products without having to spend a lot of your coin. It’s also worth the money just for having these for traveling! The color corrector can take some trial and error to get right, so give it a chance. Figure out how much to apply and you’ll be happy with the results. I use it on my non makeup days to cover my very red skin. I like the serum but haven’t really seen much of a difference in my skin but it does feel nice. The moisturizer is calming, and wears well under my makeup. Great Kit!
