First and foremost, this product was sent to me in exchange for my honest review. These thoughts are completely my own. Now with that out the way let’s continue.I really like this product. This is one of the first moisturizers I’ve used that’s like a heavy cream that doesn’t leave my face looking or feeling oily. It truly moisturizes your face. I think it’s cute that it came with a little sample of their serum (I have yet to try that yet). I don’t know what’s in this moisturizer that treats hyperpigmentation (or if there’s anything in there that treats it for that matter); however, skin has cleared up quite dramatically (I only use soap and this moisturizer at this moment but I’ve been using my soap for years and I’ve never seen a drastic change like this). I do not follow the Charlotte method by the way, I just rub it on my face. The packaging is super cute and I love you can refill it for cheaper. I definitely recommend this product. It’s truly worth it. In love
