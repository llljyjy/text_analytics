I never write reviews but this exfoliant has absolutely changed my skin!! About 6 months ago, I started dealing with microbumps on my forehead and cystic acne on my chin, and it seemed that nothing was working to get rid of these issues. Luckily, I stumbled upon the positive reviews of this product and decided to give it a try. Within just a few months, all of my bumps are GONE, my skin feels more even, and I have regained so much confidence as a result!! It is also so lightweight and refreshing to use, I personally apply this to my face morning and night before moisturizing. I seriously recommend you try this for any similar skin issues, you will not regret it! 10/10. Amazing Product!
