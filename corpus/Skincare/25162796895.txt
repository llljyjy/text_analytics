Love this mask so much! It’s so easy to put on since its in two pieces. The mask feels very cooling to put on (almost minty) and it tingles. The mask dries up when you use it so when you’re done you have to peel it off. The peeling reminds me of how it feels to remove pore strips since it makes it feel like my pores shrunk when I used it. My skin felt so good after using it! I would def buy it for myself again. Tingly and minty
