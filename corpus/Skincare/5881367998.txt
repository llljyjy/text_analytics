I have to start by mentioning that the packaging is gorgeous and the outer blue cup can be repurposed or you have the option to buy a refill. The eye cream has no scent and is more lightweight than a cream. Since it isn’t so thick, I’ve found that I can get away with half a pump total for both eyes. A few reviews mention that this irritated their skin but I have sensitive skin that turns pink easily, and this is actually one of the few eye creams that hasn’t bothered my skin or made my eyes sensitive. After the first few days using it twice a day,  I noticed that the skin was more hydrated and eye makeup applied smoother. I’m now to about 4 weeks of use and I’m starting to see the fine lines in the corners of my eyes are less deep and the container still feels full. Although it’s definitely pricey, a little goes a long way and I think it’s worth the investment if you are looking for a cream that is super hydrating and reduces wrinkles.  I received this product in exchange for my honest review. nan
