I got this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox.  I have been using it for one month now, in the morning and at night before my moisturizer.  It has a lovely light floral scent while you apply it which dissipates once your skin absorbs it.  It is a light texture and is easy to spread.  It absorbs very quickly and leaves no residue. I have noticed that my skin is less bumpy and red and I have fewer breakouts.  It seems to be very effective at calming my skin and hydrating it.  It definitely feels like a high end product, with beautiful, sleek packaging that protects it from the air and light.  It is a unique set of ingredients as well, using grapes! Effective new serum
