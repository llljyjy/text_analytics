I had high hopes for this eye cream but found it too be too drying for the delicate skin around the eyes. It actually created more wrinkles, Not sure what ingredient causes it. BUT! it works wonders around the lips area. It practically erased all tiny wrinkles there. So I decided to keep it. The search for the perfect eye cream continues... Not sure...
