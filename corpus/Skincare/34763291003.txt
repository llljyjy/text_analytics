I overall love this cream. It is nice and easy to spread on skin and the feeling is of a softness beauty. It also made a difference just after few nights that I’m using it! The only thing I don’t like much is the smell. It is not strong (which I love usually) but it is also not super interesting I would say! But totally worth it for the nourishment of your skin!
