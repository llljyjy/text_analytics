Out of all the tanning drops I have tried, this was the most hydrating and patch/streak free. After 8 hours, it created a beautiful, naturally tanned color without an orange hue. The dropper was extremely easy to use, and I always customize my application process by mixing the tanning drops into my moisturizer to avoid patches and streaks. If you're debating on getting this, DO IT!
