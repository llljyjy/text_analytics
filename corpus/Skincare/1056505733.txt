I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my review. So far I’m really liking this retinol serum. My skin is softer, smother, and brighter. It’s only been about three weeks but so far so good. I’m hoping to see more results at the 12 week mark. My forehead is already looking smoother which is a very good thing!! I’ve been able to use it daily with no irritation issues. I’ve used retinol products off and on and some have irritated my skin while others where fine. If you’ve never used a retinol or chemical exfoliater I would start slow. Be sure to use a good SPF as you’ll be a lot more sun sensitive. If you’re nervous about starting retinols this is a good one to start with and get your skin used to the product. nan
