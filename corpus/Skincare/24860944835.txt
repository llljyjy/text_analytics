I was so excited to use this.  I had gotten a sample from a while back that I finally decided to use and it was incredible leading me to purchase 2 of the full size jars while on sale.  The full size is nothing like the sample.  It feels like it just sits on top of my skin without providing any additional moisture.  I one point I was rubbing my temples and the lotion actually began to ball up and flake of my skin.  Complete waste of money.I’m trying to use up the jars I have by sealing in my other moisturizing products at night but I’m overall just very disappointed.  Not sure if the formula changed between when I got the sample and when I purchased the full size. Disappointed
