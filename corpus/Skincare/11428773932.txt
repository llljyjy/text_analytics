I really enjoy the consistency of this cleanser! It foams really well so a little goes a long way. It isn’t drying & made my skin feel clean. I took one star off because the bottle doesn’t stand up & it has a very strong scent. It smells good & I prefer scented products, but I could see why it could be too much for someone. so would definitely purchase this product! nan
