I have been using this product for 4 or 5 years now, and I notice a difference in my eye area if I don’t use it. I keep mine in the fridge and roll it all over my under eye and eyelids before applying the rest of my skin routine (serum, moisturizer, sunscreen). I love how soothing the cool roller feels on my tired eyes, even on a cold day! My eyes feel moisturized, but not heavy, all day when I use this. I also find that if I give it some time to dry before applying eyeshadow primer, it doesn’t reduce the longevity of my makeup. I don’t know if this product specifically helps with fine lines and wrinkles in my skin (I use other products at night that are more specific to that concern) but I can tell you that the skin around my eyes feels soft, smooth, and soothed all day with this! I love this product so much that my Mom buys me this each year for Christmas, and that bottle lasts for most of the year before I have to pull out a deluxe sample or buy another to hold me over until Christmas again. Most soothing part of my morning routine
