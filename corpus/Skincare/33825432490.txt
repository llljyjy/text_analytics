Everything about this moisturizer was amazing (even down to the packaging). The container is glass and therefore was heavy (wasn’t cheap feeling and I was able to grip better). I use this once-twice daily after I apply the Premier Cru The Eye Cream. The moisturizer wasn’t watery but actually pretty thick and VERY deep penetrating. It doesn’t feel like I’m wearing it once I massage it in very well #freeproduct #trywithtopbox MOST DEFINITELY WILL BE PURCHASING AGAIN
