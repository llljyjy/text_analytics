Like all products, this has its pros and cons. I have oily, acne prone skin and I got this in hope of it clearing up my skin. It did work! My skin cleared up within a few days of using it and I had very minimal purging. However, it is an oil based serum. It sinks in fairly well but stays oily. Gives a very nice glow to the skin though! Overall I think it’s good especially for the price. mixed feelings…
