This brand is on my radar for a long time so I was happy to get to try it. The cream is thick and luxurious. It went well on my combo skin and I although is thick and rich, didnâ€™t make me oily. My skin felt hydrated and my dry areas looked less patchy. Great also as a night time treatment and a lighter slugging option. It has a funky smell that evaporates really quickly. Great for a plumper skin
