I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. First off, I am not used to heavily scented skincare. It’s a pleasant scent but it does linger. I liked the way my skin felt in the morning, soft and not real oily. When used in the morning it did feel a little drying to me so I definitely reached for my moisturizer right away. Overall it’s a nice cleanser. Soft skin
