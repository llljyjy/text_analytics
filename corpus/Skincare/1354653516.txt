Shani Dardenâ€™s Retinol Reform is great. Retinols address skin turnover, therefore helping with anti-aging, firming, brightening, softening fine lines and wrinkles, smoothing texture, and adding radiance to your skin. Shani Darden Retinol Reform contains lactic acid too, which is a nice addition to the retinol. The Shani Darden formula is vegan and fragrance free: a gentle time-release serum that is easy to apply nightly and clinically proven to improve your skin starting in 8 weeks. I highly recommend Shani Darden Retinol Reform! nan
