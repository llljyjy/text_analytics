when I first got this I was like wow ok never seen a cleanser like this before. It’s a whipped consistency that is almost hydrating while cleansing. My sensitive skin didn’t feel tight or dried out like it usually does after cleaning which was amazing! Totally recommend if you’re on the search for a gentle but deep cleanser! unlike other cleansers
