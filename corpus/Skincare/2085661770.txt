This product smells absolutely terrible. Like an old gross basement. Honestly when I put It on my face I didn’t notice much of a difference it’s extremely subtle to the point that I couldn’t even tell, the only thing I could tell was that the scent was awful. Returned immediately- it’s a no from me. And a perfect example that sometimes these products with near perfect 5 star reviews aren’t all they are cracked up to be. Surprised none of these other reviews have mentioned the smell… odd. nan
