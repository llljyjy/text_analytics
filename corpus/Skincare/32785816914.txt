This cleanser isn’t the worst. Not great tho. Some days it comes off pretty easily, but most days it takes soooo much effort to rinse it off. sometimes I also feel like it might be leaving a small film on my face, which I don’t mind a lot in the winter. ultimately, I would say this isn’t worth the money meh
