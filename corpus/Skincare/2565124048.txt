I absolutely love this product! Itâ€™s thicker in texture than my other moisturizers, but it absorbs quickly and does not leave an oily residue. Within a week, I would already tell a difference in texture, and suppleness. The positive is, a little goes aong way, so my current supply has lasted me for more than 1.5 months (using one a day - in the AM). Also, it is fragrance free and comes in a reusable jar (can purchase replacement package and save some $). Love!
