I love this serum, I do think it’s a bit tricky to get all 3 out at once, but overall it’s worked very well. It’s been a few weeks, and I’ve noticed a change in my skin, which I wasn’t expecting as I’ve used similar serums for years. It’s definitely something I’ll continue using. (And no issues with my sensitive skin!) Works well for my skin
