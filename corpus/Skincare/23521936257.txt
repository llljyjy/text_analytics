I’ve been using this for about a week now, it’s extremely gentle and just feels like a rich cream moisturizer when applied, I feel like I’ve seen a difference already, my pores appear smaller and my face looks overall brighter and a more even tone. I’m using it for acne and to fade some PIH from previous breakouts. I have oily skin and my skin has felt A LOT less oily, I haven’t needed to use blotting papers all week, so, so far I’m really happy. I will say to be careful with it around the eye area, I’ve had it sneak up there and now when I apply makeup or any product up there the skin feels really sensitive and burns a little. new to retinol - so far amazing
