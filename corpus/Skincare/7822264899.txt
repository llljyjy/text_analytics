This is a really good basic cleanser! It does what it claims and doesn’t leave my skin feeling stripped. It does a good job a removing light makeup (concealer, blush/bronzer, brows) on its own but you’ll definitely need to double cleanse if you’re trying to tackle heavy foundation and mascara. The only think I don’t like is the scent but that’s just personal. I was able to pick this up when it was on sale (50% off!) and it was a fantastic deal for the quality and performance of the product. However I’m not sure I would purchase it again at full price… so if you ever come across a sale on this one I’d certainly recommend it! Good basic cleanser!
