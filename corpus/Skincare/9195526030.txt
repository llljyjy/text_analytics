Never really tried a product like this so I was very intrigued when I first received it in the mail. This shaving gel doesn’t require any water so I was hesitant at first, and after trying it out for a few times I can truly say, I am very, very impressed. I don’t get any razor bumps when I use this gel and it glides on so smoothly, making shaving a breeze especially on the go. This is such a great compact product to travel with without the mess.
