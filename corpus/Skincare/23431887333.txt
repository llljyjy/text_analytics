Love the texture! Like other reviews say, it doesn’t absorb immediately (takes about 5 min to “absorb” but still feels like you have a layer of product on your face afterwards). It was initially a little oily after that 5min, but the morning after that completely goes away and my skin feels great! Plus, it is less oily than a lot of other night masks I’ve tried. Also I had no issue with any residue on my pillow case. Great Mask
