I received a FREE sample of The Inkey List Mandelic Acid Treatment from PINCHme in exchange for an honest review. I received this product just as I was recovering from an acne breakout. As advertised, this product worked quickly to address the red discoloration from the acne. Within a couple weeks, I could see the redness fade. I cannot speak to other discoloration, but for me it was very effective for addressing discoloration left by acne blemishes. nan
