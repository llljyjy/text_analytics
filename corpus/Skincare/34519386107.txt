I received this product to try and this is my honest review. Does it work well? Yes. My skin felt really stuffy after using it. It’s free if a lot of chemicals that one wouldn’t want on their skin. Why 3 stars? It smells terrible. Hard to use it because the smell is off-putting. I think if they could remedy the smell issue, they have a solid product. Works good, smells bad.
