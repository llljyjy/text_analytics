This multi use lotion works for both face and body! When I first read that I was worried it would be too thick, the way many hand lotions are but to my surprise it was creamy and hydrating, quickly absorbing on my face and it did not feel heavy at all. I have dry and sensitive skin during the winter, but this did not irritate my skin at all. I was hydrated until the morning and I love that the packaging is a squeeze container (I am not sure what the official name is haha) versus a tub since it is more sanitary and convenient. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants a hydrating lotion and an easy on-the-go lotion as well. nan
