This is an amazing eye cream! I’ve been using it for about two weeks now and I really like it. It had a super thick, rich, balmy texture and makes my under eyes feel very hydrated. I was also really happy that it didn’t irritate my skin. I have reallt sensitive eyes, and this felt good and didn’t bother my eyes or skin at all. I’d definitely recommend this product! Fantastic eye cream!
