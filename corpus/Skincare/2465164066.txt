I LOVE this product. I love the texture. I use it on a dry face and rub all over quite thoroughly. It does a fantastic job of completely removing mascara, which I’ve never found another product to do. It’s so gentle on the skin. Once I’ve washed and rinsed I follow up with a cleanser (since this is a makeup remover and NOT a face wash) and the rest of my skincare routine. Im very happy with the results. BEST makeup remover
