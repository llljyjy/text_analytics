I received this in exchange for my honest review. I was so thankful to have gotten this! It has such a following but it’s rather expensive to try. It’s a such a beautiful bottle and eco friendly packaging. I was expecting a “cream” since this is called the “light cream” however, this definitely a serum. Quick absorption and instantly mattifying. I was curious about the science behind the brand and how Bader had developed a wound gel. Being that I “pick my face” occasionally, I of course squeeze too hard and cut my cheek slightly with my long nails. I applied the “cream” liberally in the mornings and I almost couldn’t believe it.. my huge under the skin pimple and scratches from picking healed within two days. I normally would grab my special little tub of silvadene but I was so surprised to see this cream work like magic to heal my superficial wound. I can’t even find the area on my cheek where I had the pimple and scratches. I have seen great results and “healthy” looking skin using this product for the last several weeks. I would definitely recommend if your budget allows. Healthy looking skin
