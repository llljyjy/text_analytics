Great sunscreen, but the worst packaging ever. As soon as you open it, the sunscreen just pours out. I’ve tried everything. I’ve tried tapping the bottle on a surface first to make sure the product is on the bottom. No matter what, as soon as you open it and pour some to use, it just keeps coming out and does NOT stop. It makes such a huge mess. No to mention so much wasted product. It’s already a more pricey option and then when you take into account that over 1/2 the product is wasted because it just keeps flowing out, this is just not worth it. Like I said the sunscreen is great.....but unless you play to put it in a completely different container, I’d recommend saving your money. I will not be buying this again. Packaging wastes 1/2 the bottle!
