I received this product for free from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review. If you are looking for a serum to brighten your complexion, this is it - Charlotte’s Magic Serum Crystal Elixir! The serum has Vitamin C that evens and brightens your skin tone. It has niacinamide 5% that minimizes appearance of pores and improves skin texture. It has polyglutamic acid that hydrates 4 times more than hyaluronic acid. So, this serum does it all, firms your skin, refines and tightens pores, helps contours your face, gets rid of fine lines and reduces wrinkles and helps your skin stay very hydrated! It is super charged with crystal infused resurrection leaf. It has a lot of precious stones powders like ruby, quartz, amethyst and had gold and copper in it. It also has camellia seed oil and aloe vera juice which is very refreshing and soothes the skin and gets rid of inflammation and irritations. The texture is a creamy milky white liquid, it isn’t thick but also isn’t too thin. There is a slight scent but almost none at all. It I had to describe the scent it is a citrus clean one. It dries down fast and is not sticky or oily which is nice. It does hydrate very well and does all that it claims. Silky smooth application and my skin Glows! I used it on “clean skin“ BEFORE applying my moisturizer in the morning AND the evening. I used the product for 4 weeks and I can honestly say my skin appears more rejuvenated, hydrated, smoother, firmer and with an even tone. The applicator gives you just the right amount. I have included a photo of myself without makeup, so you can see the AMAZING results of the magical serum. I am 50 years old and this product has done wonders for my skin. I highly recommend Charlotte Tilbury Magic Serum Crystal Elixir! oooh, the magic!!!
