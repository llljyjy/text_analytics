I got this product on sale for $50 and I definitely think it was worth the price I got it at. At first I didn’t think this was worth it, but after a few weeks of consistent use (2/3) I found that my face is always smooth (no dead skin) and my skin looks more pump and firm. I feel like my skin looks better than it has in months and this is the only new product I’ve used. Make sure you rise it off every time you use it so bacteria doesn’t accumulate! Smooth, firm skin
