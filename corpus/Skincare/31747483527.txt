I was glad to be able to test this product as I am a bit of a face wash junkie. I can definitely feel the Moisturizer in it and you need a cloth to be sure to rinse all of it off. My face felt soft and clean after using it. My only complaint is that the product has a bit of a chemical smell to it which is not all that pleasant.  It is not scent-free. But, the cleanser does work well. I like it but don't love it
