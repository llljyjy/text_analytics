Really like this moisturizer! I received this sample to try and review and my thoughts are that this is a good moisturizer for my skin. It goes on very smooth and creamy and smells good.  The reason for only 4 stars is that I felt like it got gummy after it dries on, but other than that I really like it. I would and have recommended this to friends to try. I’ve always loved IT products and this doesn’t disappoint. nan
