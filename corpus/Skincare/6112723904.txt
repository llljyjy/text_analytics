Wouldnâ€™t recommend this for combo skin. It will definitely stick to every little dry patch you have. Product looks amazing on the parts of my skin that are more oily or have no dry patches. Wish this worked for me. Prepped my skin as much as possible and it still stuck to my dry patches. Amazing for the oily gals. NOT for combo skin or anyone with dry patches
