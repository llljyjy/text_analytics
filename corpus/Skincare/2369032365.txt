I love this SO much. It removes all of my makeup, including mascara, and isn’t irritating at all. I generally follow this up with a cleanser and overall skincare routine, but on ultra lazy nights I will just use this and it’s amazing. It does make my eyes a little cloudy for a minute or so, but nothing major. Will repurchase again and again. nan
