I received this from Estée Lauder and Influenster for my honest review. I have very dry skin and am in my 30’s. This moisturizer is beautiful! It gives me glowing, moisturized skin and lasts all day. It’s a little tacky of a formula and  very fragrant but I love the results on my skin. I am a bit sensitive to fragrance so this is out for me but if you’re okay with scented skin care - this is probably my favorite moisturizer. My skin looks fresh all day and my skin is so luminous. Luminous, hydrated skin
