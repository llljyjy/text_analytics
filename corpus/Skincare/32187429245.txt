I tried this night cream for 2 weeks and loved it! It truly feels like a cloud and a little goes a long way. It makes your skin feel super soft when applied and you wake up with that same soft feeling. It’s not greasy and applies so easily. I wasn’t aware of the scent at first, but its a calming lavender. If you’re sensitive to scents, it is a little strong. I tend to keep to the cheaper options due to budget restrictions but this is quality and will last a long time which I think makes the higher cost worth it. Only down side was some piling when used on top of my other serums (hyaluronic acid, retinol, & niacinamide) but not enough to make me want to stop using it. A Dream
