This is my favorite skin care product by far. It has niacinamide, squalane, and peptide-lipid complex to fight signs of aging like dark spots, loss of elasticity and fine lines. It’s like creamed silk in a jar. It makes your skin feel so healthy and hydrated. There is little to no smell and what little scent is there is natural. It Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream is amazing. I’ve been through more jars of this than I would care to admit. Not that I’m embarrassed to use it but it’s a bit pricey but for what it does the price is very decent. I will continue to buy this and will always recommend it to friends and family because this stuff is great for all skin types and is not greasy at all. Your skin will thank you for buying this by looking amazing and silky smooth. It Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream
