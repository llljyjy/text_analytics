I received a sample from Influenster to try out and review. I always use eye cream. I had been using an eye cream from Clinique before trying this out. I have been using this eye cream for about 3 weeks day and night and the only change is my eye area is more moisturized. I have dark circles and dark eyelids and they havenâ€™t improved. However this cream is really good at keeping concealer creasing in the under eye area. So if I decide to purchase a full size it would be for that reason and maybe if after long time use I just may see an improvement in my dark circles. Not Much Change
