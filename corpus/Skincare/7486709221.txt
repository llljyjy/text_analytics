I received this product complimentary for testing purposes only. I used if religiously for three weeks straight. After that I  took a few days off not using it and noticed the heavy dark circles I didnâ€™t have before. I love the way the Gel Cream leaves my skin feeling, but did not see many changes. Lines are the same and bags also. I am 30 years old with little lines and hardly any bags under my eyes for reference. Skin texture changed only.
