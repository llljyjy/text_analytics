I used the product as directed by warming up with my fingers and it was still difficult to apply. I used it after moisturizing but after applying, it showed every dry spot on my face especially the crevice of my nostrils, I did not like the finish and although it helped reduce the redness appearance, it definitely did not neutralize my face enough for me to wear this product alone. In addition, after a few hours (2-3) my face would look greasy, used it 3 times to give it a fair try and will be returning nan
