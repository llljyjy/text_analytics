my skin:.  dry, reactive, rosaceathis cream: i used it for almost 3 months daily morning and night.  wonderfully hydrating plumping and moisturizing for me. doesn’t react with my skin at all in fact it soothes it.  However.....and this is a very big deal for me ....it’s very strongly scented that I don’t believe I’ll repurchase.  for those interested, it smells like lemons and citrus. almost perfect
