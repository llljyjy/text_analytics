Works well and keeps my skin moisturized in the winter. I have super dry skin so I don’t mind it being a bit heavy, but it might not feel so good for people with other skin types. The smell is a bit weird at first but it’s nothing I can’t get use to. I wouldn’t say this is my go to moisturizer but I’d definitely stock a few in the winter and use it on days my skin feels extra dry. Good for dry skin
