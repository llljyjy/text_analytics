I love a good serum in my skincare routine and this one has exceed my expectations! The texture of the product is very nice and is super hydrating on the skin. My overall skin texture was instantly soft and supple. I have tested it for a couple of weeks now and my skin is less textured, pores are smaller, skin is soft and supple, and overall my skin feels more hydrated. Though this product is on the pricier side, I would definitely repurchase this for how itâ€™s been performing on my skin! I received this product complementary from Influenster. Skin is Supple, Soft, Smooth, & Hydrated
