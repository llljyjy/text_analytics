I’ve only been using this serum for a few weeks but in that time, I’ve noticed my pores are less visible — so I know this has helped with congestion and clogged pores. I like the addition of vitamin C to the formula since over time that will help with hyperpigmentation and brighten my complexion, although it’s still too early to see those long term benefits. I’ve been using this every other night and I think that’s the sweet spot for me to achieve smoother, brighter skin with less congestion and minimized appearance of pores. nan
