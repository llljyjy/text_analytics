I wasn’t a fan the first time I tried this sunscreen, I put it over my skincare and it peeled pretty bad unfortunately. Plus, it left a weird tint to my skin, but there wasn’t a white cast. The second time, I used it without my skincare and it worked a lot better. I didn’t really notice a smell to the product it was definitely faint. It does have hyaluronic acid in it as well as SPF 42, it’s also a mineral sunscreen. It felt nice on the skin and left a bit of a glow to my skin. I’m hoping I can find a skincare routine that woks with this sunscreen! Otherwise I definitely say it’s for younger people :) nan
