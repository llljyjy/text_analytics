I recieved this product free to sample from influenster. After using community sixty-six hydrating eye cream for a few weeks I haven’t really noticed any difference. It’s comparable to your typical eye cream and really nothing more. I don’t have anything bad to say but I can say that I have used better. Not the worst product but, I’ve used better.
