I absolutely love this sunscreen!! It is very lightweight and leaves my skin feeling fresh with a nice glow. It isn’t greasy, does not have a bad smell, does not irritate eyes, and blends into skin beautifully. I have pale, dry sensitive skin and this stuff may be my new favorite!! I did not break out while using and even after being in the hot sun at baseball tournaments all day every weekend, I never burnt once!! I don’t  wear a lot of makeup but when I did it blended flawlessly under my foundation. I wore this every day for at least two weeks to give my honest opinion and I would definitely recommend this sunscreen to everyone! Plus I don’t know if it’s just in my head but I swear my skin looks and feels better after using this product. Fantastic sunscreen
