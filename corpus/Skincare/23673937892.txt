Not all moisturizers are equal, I love the lightweight gel formula that blurs out pores and does not leave your skin shiny, best of all it hydrates the skin all day.One of the most important aspects of this moisturizer is that it is compact with a powerful blend of hyaluronic acid, salicylic acid, antioxidant-rich Santorini grape. These are a big factor for me. I would recommend it. Right moisturizer
