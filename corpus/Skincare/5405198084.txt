The All Day Hydrator Moisturizer has been apart of my morning skincare routine. I love that it has Hyaluronic Acid in it and it’s lightweight. During the winter months I love a more thicker formula so this would be better for me in the warmer months where I just want something lightweight yet moisturizing. Also love that it’s vegan, clean and affordable! Great lightweight moisturizer
