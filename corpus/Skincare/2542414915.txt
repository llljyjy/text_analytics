I finally FINALLY found something that takes off waterproof mascara without super scrubbing my eyes - this is so gentle and a subtle smell … I find that my eyes are a little blurry after but that may be the way I’m using it…?? Who knows but I’ve never found something that works this good so will be buying again ! it works!
