Great new product! As a repeat user of the adaptogen moisturizer I find this one to be equally as moisturizing (tend to have dry skin) and after multiple uses no breakouts or unexpected dryness. I will definitely be adding this product to my daily routine especially given the areas it is meant to target. Great moisturizer!!
