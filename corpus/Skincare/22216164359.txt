I was sent a complimentary travel size container through Influenster, and I have been pairing this nightly with the DE Framboos Glycolic night serum, and it took a solid two weeks to notice a difference - but I’m glad I stuck with the routine because I’m definitely noticing a subtle glow to my skin that I previously lacked. Perhaps some of that is a hint of summer glow, but I’m definitely waking up with my face still feeling moisturized from the night before. The product doesn’t rub off at all in my sleep, and it’s definitely trapping the moisture and enhancing my skin overall. The whipped texture is nice and lightweight, and glides on nicely without feeling filmy or greasy. Lightweight, but packs a punch
