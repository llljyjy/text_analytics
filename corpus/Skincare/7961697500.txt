I was given this product by Influenster and Biossance for my honest review. I’ve only been using this product for two weeks and I can already see a change in my skin. My redness is toned down and my uneven texture is gone. My skin texture wasn’t horrible to begin with but enough that my redness would come through my foundation. I have combination skin that is highly sensitive. I really like this product and I’m excited to see my results after using it for a longer period. Best thing for my skin
