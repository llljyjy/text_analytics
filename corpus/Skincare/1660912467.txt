I am on my second 1.69oz container. The first lasted me about 4 months so I’m ok with the price. My skin feels soft and moisturized and looks plumped/hydrated after applying. Works well under makeup and I’ve used it around my eyes without irritation. I’m also a huge fan of the pump packaging; I hate dipping my fingers creams. Nice moisturizer
