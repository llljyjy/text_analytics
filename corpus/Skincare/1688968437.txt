I used to use a very similar cleanser with white clay in high school that whips into a stiff foam and even had ‘face cleaning training’ from a family friend who worked for shiseido. It’s such a relief to switch back to this kind of cleanser that really does the job well. There is a scent to the cleanser, but it smells exactly like the lobby of the Hilton Tokyo (which I like). The key is to use a quality Japanese face cleansing/foaming net. (Sephora should carry one in their stores!) I used to use my hands to whip it up in high school, but now with a foaming net you get more foam and faster, and you can really get stiff foam. This is how I learned to use this type of product: Using a tiny, pinky-nail squeeze of the cleanser with a foaming net, you can whip it into a giant handful of foam. I like to whip it, squeeze it out of the net, and then put it back into the net and whip it into a stiffer foam, about the texture of really good freshly-whipped-meringue. Light, but stiff. The key is to start with a wet net and slowly add tiny splashes of water as you go (but not too much, or your foam won’t be stiff!)Then after spreading most of the foam across your face, you make the left over foam into a ball and begin to “roll” the foam in tiny circles across your face. It’s a really soothing feeling as the stiff foam gently tugs on your skin. It feels like the foam is lifting impurities from your pores. Then after washing all of the foam off, your face feels clean, soft, and hydrated. Get a foaming/cleansing net! Use with a Japanese Foaming/Cleansing Net!
