This is product was more “megh” for me than I was hoping it would be. I live in a dessert climate so I love a good effectively hydrating moisturizer, The product is thick, which I normally am not against (love a good slugging) but I found that it left unnecessary residue and when worn under even just milk’s own cc cream, it was breaking up underneath or not maintaining moisture. I feel like I got the same results from smearing shea butter on its own on my face for much cheaper.I would say it would make a great slugging cream, but why do this when you can get a more affordable option with more effectiveness or something of the same price with more skin benefits?Just feel like their are better vegan options, super bummed because I’m obsessed with most milk products. Sadly disappointed
