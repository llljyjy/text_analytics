I received this product in a sample size from Sephora a while back and didn’t think too much of it, but my overall experience with this cleanser was literally amazing. I have very sensitive skin and also have ezcema, which was not a problem for this cleanser. I think it’s advertised as being for sensitive skin and I totally agree! I would name this my favourite cleanser ever if it wasn’t out of my price range lol Great for Sensitive Combination Skin!
