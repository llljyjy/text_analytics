I loved the Dior Off/On foaming face cleanser Its fragrance is exquisite and lasts for a long time after washing your face. With a small amount you get the desired result, a rich and abundant cleansing foam. The skin of my face is normal and it works very well for me, however I consider that for dry skin it could leave it a little dry. Its packaging is elegant and stylish. In the end I loved it! nan
