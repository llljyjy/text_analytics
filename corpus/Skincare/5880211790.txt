I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. When I opened this moisturizer, I thought there was no way I would like it because the charcoal made the consistency look almost like a mud mask. I was super surprised at how light weight it actually is and so glad itâ€™s non greasy! Although my acne skin has cleared up in my adult life I still cleanse daily with a face wash which contains salicylic acid, so I was excited to try this product. Typically you have to watch with salicylic acid because it dried out your face, however this product is still moisturizing enough that you can use up to twice a day. My only complaint is that I would prefer it to be in a pump! Lightweight and Clean!
