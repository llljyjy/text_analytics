The serum has no fragrance and it get absorbed in the skin very fast. The texture is very nice as well snd not sticky.I only gave it 4 stars because as many other reviews mention, the dropper doesnâ€™t work well and you have to dip it several time to get enough product. You also have no idea how much product is left in the bottle which can be frustrating nan
