Sephora Collection gifted me this product in exchange for my honest review. I’ve been using this for about 2 weeks and I love how smooth my skin feels after I apply it. I also notice that my skin looks brighter too. It doesn’t have a harsh smell and a little goes a long way. brighter and smoother skin
