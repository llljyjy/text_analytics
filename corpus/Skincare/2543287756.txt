This is great for melting away face makeup and sunscreen. I use it every night before my water based cleanser. I have dry/sensitive/acne prone skin, and this doesn’t irritate my skin whatsoever. Using this a a one-step cleanser won’t be pleasant but using it before your water based is wonderful! It also doesn’t sting my eyes! The reason I am giving it only 4 stars is because it doesn’t remove waterproof mascara very well, so I have to use a micellar water first. I am currently on my third bottle. nan
