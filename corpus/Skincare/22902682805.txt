I have this cleanser for a while. I was impressed with the mini mostly because it didnâ€™t finish quickly. I am not big on fragranced skincare but I must admit i love the fruity scent in this. I must also admit that though I feel cleansed after use i cannot say that it removes makeup since even though I lather twice to remove my fenty powder and (sometimes) hydrating liquid foundations I still see some of it when I wipe with my reusable pads especially around the hairline which is annoying. So, take with that what you will. But i like the twist on/off maneuver, scent and lather for my oily combo acne prone skin. nan
