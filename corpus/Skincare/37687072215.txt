I received a free sample from influenster. Itâ€™s hard to give a great review because the sample was very small but from the three applications it was effective at leaving my face soft and silky without looking greasy. The scent was nice too and the liquid was watery so it felt really refreshing on my skin. All in all I thought it was good not great but good. I give it 4 stars
