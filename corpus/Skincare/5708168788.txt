I’ve been searching for a luxe eye cream at a mid price point for a year. This is it!! It’s buttery yet fresh and light. It leaves the skin around my eyes supple and moisturized without being heavy. My skin is incredibly sensitive and does so well with herbivore. This is the 4th herbivore product that’s been upgraded into my daily skin routine and I’m so happy to have found it. Buttery and Light
