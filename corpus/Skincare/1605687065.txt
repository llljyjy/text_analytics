The new, reformulated version isn’t nearly as soft and moisturizing as the old. I’ve been using this product for years and I hate what they’ve done to it. I could live without the SPF, but the texture is terrible, not even close to being as moisturizing as before, and I have to reapply less than an hour later. Don't bother buying the new formula
