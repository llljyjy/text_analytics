This very well could be my second review but it honestly deserves it. This stuff is the absolute holy grail of makeup remover or double cleansing, whatever you’re into! Sometimes I use it on the entire face and it quite literally MELTS your makeup right off or it works fabulous as just an eye makeup or lipstick remover if you’re trying to make it last longer. That being said, a little goes a looooong way! I’ve been using this for years and I cannot live without it — if you’re on the fence, just buy it! A must have!
