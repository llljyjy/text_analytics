I’ve been using this cloud cream nightly and really loving the results. It’s light and fluffy and has a pleasant lavender scent. This melts into your skin and doesn’t feel heavy or greasy . I put this on before bed and in the morning my skin looks bright and more toned.  I have a  youthful glow and  a  more even complexion. I would definitely recommend this night cream cause it delivers especially the more you use it. There’s been no irritation,  the scent is pleasant,  luxurious whipped texture,  gives a youthful glow,  refines , tones, and just an overall good night cream that works while you sleep.
