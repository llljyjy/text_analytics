I get complements on how young I look for my age(Iâ€™ve looked 25 years old for the past 10 years now), so I figured I should do something to preserve that. I use Fenty Skins entire routine, then apply this as the last step. Since then, my dark spots have begin to fade, and my skin is alot smoother. Not to mention it does not make my oily skin oilier. Over all, my skin looks great and Im going to continue using this product. This brand lives up to it reputation for making great retinol  products. ( I bought the 1oz bottle, a little goes a long way, so it will last awhile) SR has an outstanding reputation for a reason!
