I purchased this after reading so many different reviews trying to weigh price vs. amount of product vs. how effective the product was and this seemed like the best bang for my buck, so to speak. And while I do think it works, the smell is really not great. I love an earthy, nonfragranced, medicinal smell. To be honest, I prefer it. So the handful of reviews about smell didn’t deter me at all. However, there’s an after smell (think aftertaste, but smell) that I can only describe as spoiled food sour, as if I bought sour cream and left it out. The product smells fine at first, and then the lingering smell is one that makes me genuinely worried that something in my product went bad. I’m not sure if this is the smell that other reviews were referencing or if I just got unlucky, but the smell is incredibly off putting. It seems to be working okay, or at least isn’t upsetting my skin, so I don’t feel like it’s fair to knock the product for effectiveness. But the smell is just too much for me, and I wanted to warn others who might be more sensitive that this is more than just herbal/medicinal. Not for those sensitive to smell
