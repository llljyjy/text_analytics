I have been looking for a good moisturizer especially for winter months (I live in the Midwest) and this is it! This cream saved my dry, sensitive skin. It did not cause any breakouts and my skin feels and looks amazing. I can definitely feel the difference in skin hydration as well. I will continue to buy this over and over again because I am so impressed with the results. Holy grail moisturizer!
