i am not usually a vit c gal (my skin hates it) but THIS is a work of art. this moisturizer is incredible under makeup & acts as a pore-filling/brightening primer. i find it very moisturizing & it sinks into my skin so well & never pills.  it is a very thick cream coming out of the super aesthetic tube but once on the face it sinks in & doesn’t feel too thick. i don’t tend to notice the smell-tho i see a few other reviews mentioning it, the scent doesn’t linger whatsoever. i can’t wait to see more skin care from freck beauty-they’ve made me a fan with this one. i will definitely continue to use this as my daytime moisturizer. won me over
