I must admit that I was at first a little intimidated by the activation process and that you couldn’t  just use the product immediately after taking it out of the box. It was very simple though and my love for the product makes it worth it. I love how my skin looks smoother. I often like to wash my face in the evening before I get too tired and then still hang out with others and I feel comfortable that my skin looks refreshed with this product (okay to see others after washing up for the night) and I was unable to do this with other products because they left my skin red or blotchy. It’s rare to see such positive changes after only a short time. nan
