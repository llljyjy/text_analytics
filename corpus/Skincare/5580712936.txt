I really did enjoy using this sunscreen because it kept my makeup in place and I was not oily at all. It is soft on the skin and there is no strong fragrance on the skin. If you have oily skin I do recommend this sunscreen. My forehead gets sun burnt easily and with this sunscreen it helped to not get any sun damage. nan
