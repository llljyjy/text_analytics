This spf 42 mineral sunscreen was a nice surprise! I was happy to get it from Influenster.  It has a light texture, almost milky, and blends out beautifully and quickly, especially for a mineral sunscreen.  Played nicely under make-up and over skincare.   It’s oil-free and does not look greasy, but although it claims to be “mattifying,“ it wasn’t drying on my very ry, mature skin.  Slight white cast.  On one very hot day when I reapplied a few times, I did notice a little hanging out in my forehead lines,  but that was easily tapped away without pilling. nan
