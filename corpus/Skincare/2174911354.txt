I used the Ole Henriksen C-Rush Vitamin C Gel Creme for years before switching to this! Best moisturizer ever. I have dry skin, especially in the winter. This is super hydrating, great before applying make up, and leaves my skin feeling smooth with a glow. I use it with the banana bright vitamin c serum and banana bright eye cream! New Morning Go To
