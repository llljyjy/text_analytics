Firstly, I was super hype about this when I first got it especially after seeing the reviews. It definitely smells good, like citris. After using it though, my face got red but my face was super soft. Brushed it off and put my normal lotion on. I used it the next couple days to get a better feel of the product and the redness became more prominent plus a few pimples came up, so I stopped for a week. The following week, I tried it every other day and still had redness... then another pimple. Its not typical for me to breakout. Honestly, itâ€™s probably just my skin not taking this product in the way it should. nan
