I apply this balm to my eye area twice a day. I apply it under my eyes, around sides and all the way up to my “11“ brow lines.Immediately my eye area felt moisturized, hydrated and smoothed. It primes my eye area and improves the look of my under eye makeup. With repeated use (7 days) it slightly dimished the appearance of dark under eye circles and crow’s feet. Longer use may provide even better results. nan
