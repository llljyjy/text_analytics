The worst cleansing balm I’ve ever used. It’s incredibly thick and no matter how hard you rub it together in your hands, it will stay that way. Adding water doesn’t do anything either. It will remain as a thick layer on your skin until you go in heavily with a water based cleanser. It doesn’t even remove my waterproof eyeliner, like at all. I have to take it off with a microfiber. Today I finally got a replacement for this product and the pores on my nose look so much smaller now. They had gotten so big and black because this product wasn’t doing anything.
