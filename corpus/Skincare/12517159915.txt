Wow. This is an unincentivized review. First time using it and I felt like my skin was clean but not stripped of its hydration. Usually in the shower my skin feels dry after my facial cleanser but this made my skin feel smooth, clean, and hydrated. Followed it up with the Skinfix triple lipid lotion and my skin is feeling plump and hydrated! Will write another review after a week of use. First impression: amazing!
