Not crazy about the smell from the phenoxyethanol, but otherwise seems great. For those that have issues, open from the cap size up and the crimped side down and push it out. Problem solved. Do not pour it directly in your hand. I have only tried it once so far but no skin burning which usually happens pretty much immediately. I am really hoping it works. I loved my other Bakuchiol serum until I became allergic. All other companies use essential oils like limonene or linalool that cause allergic reactions over time for some people and you never know if you will become one. Also limonene or essential oils that contain it like citrus oils and lemongrass create formaldehyde when exposed to the air. It is a thinner lotion but this is for wrinkles, not a moisturizer. I am hoping that it works well! If it does as well as my last serum the results should be great. Bakuchiol has been shown to work as effectively as retinol if it is used twice daily. Great option for those who want a natural retinol!
