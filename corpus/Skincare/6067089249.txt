I was hesitant to use this product while using a spot treatment cream for acne because that had been drying out my skin so I waited a couple days in between and let my skin get back to it’s normal PH. So after trying this cream it made my skin feel very soft and smooth. I have been using it in the morning and before bed. I did notice that my Pores on my nose and chin appear to be shrinking a little . I like that it has salicylic acid in it Because I get pimples randomly once in a while. This morning I did notice that on my forehead after using it my concealer seemed to cake a little because I had slight dryness on my forehead. I don’t know if it’s from the lotion though. My skin has been through a lot more than normal lately but is pretty resilient.  Anyhow, I would recommend trying this.  I will continue to use it morning and night until it’s gone. I’m not sure that it is worth $36.00 for a Normal size of it. Soft skin, shrinking pores
