I love this product. I use the vinoperfect serum and moisturizer so the last time I decided to try this product. At first I thought the smell was a bit unusual but Iâ€™m fine with it now. I use it like a toner after cleansing and my face glows. Well worth the money and a bottle lasts a long time. nan
