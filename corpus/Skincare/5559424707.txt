I was excited to see an option for an affordable cleansing balm, but unfortunately you get what you pay for here. This unfortunately has all my least favorite characteristics about cleansing balms: it leaves a greasy residue, it leaves a weird film in your eyes after using it, and it stings my eyes, although I will say not as badly as some others do. Also your skin has to be damp for this, which I didn’t know beforehand, and I was disappointed by that because I like cleansing balms that emulsify well with water. It’s just okay at taking off makeup, not the worst but also by no means worth all the downsides. I really struggle to understand the hype for this product. Even if most of this doesn’t bother you, I’m always skeptical using a cleansing balm for a double cleanse that leaves a residue on my face. Makes me feel like I need a triple cleanse in order to be cleansing skin that is already as close to clean as possible. I’ll save this for a back up, probably throw it in travel bags for when I need something to take off my makeup while I’m away from home. At this price I’d say that’s probably its best use, an on the go backup. Disappointing
