It’s been years (many many years) since I’ve been sold on a Clinique product. I purchased the Even Better Clinical Dark Spot Corrector serum when it was on sale as part of a holiday kit and since using it over the last 2.5 weeks, the texture of my skin has noticeable changed for the better. I have very sensitive combo skin that can be extremely dry in the winter season, and so far, my skin is the best it’s ever been in quite some time. My skin has cleared up and my old acne scars and dark spots are slowly diminishing. I’m honestly shocked at the noticeable improvements. Aside from the high price tag, I’ll definitely continue using! Thank you Clinique! So happy I took a chance on this serum!!!
