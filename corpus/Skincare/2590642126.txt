I originally bought this set for my husband four years ago to encourage him to start taking better care of his skin, and he has been using the face buff and cleanser ever since! The face buff is his favorite. He says it feels like it lifts the hair and makes shaving so much easier. I have also seen a difference in the fine lines around his eyes. The moisturizer is also good, but he upgraded to a different brand with a higher spf. This set is definitely worth a try! Husband loves it
