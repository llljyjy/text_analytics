I have oily skin and this product is just perfect for moisturizing it without causing any breakouts. It smells like berries and has a silky texture. After application my skin feels hydrated. I will definitely continue using this product and highly recommend it. This was my first time trying probiotic skincare and Iâ€™m absolutely in love with it! Absolute must have!
