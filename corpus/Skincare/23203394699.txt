I fell in love with this serum for 2 reasons. First is that the serum is separated by chambers, which helps longevity and potency.  Yay!!! Secondly it actually helped. My face felt softer, plumper, and some of my pigmentation got lighter. I have been using this serum for roughly a month and still have serum left. I totally recommend this serum if you are in the market for a new one. New HG serum
