My eye area is pretty good before I tried this product, not sure if itâ€™s my skin routine or my age lol, but I really enjoyed this product. It did not irritate my eyes or leave it feeling greasy. It did not clash with the products I usually use but enhanced the why my eyes feels under my make up as well. Highly recommend Hydration it the Movement
