I really wanted to love this product after reading mostly great reviews but it just didn’t work for me. After using it I immediately broke out. I waited 2 weeks and tried it again and again, I broke out. I ended up giving it to my sister and she uses it weekly and hasn’t had any issues with it. Just goes to show that everyone’s skin is different and what works for one doesn’t work for all…hopefully you’ll have better luck…it just didn’t work for my skin unfortunately didn’t work for me
