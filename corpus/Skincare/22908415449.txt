Wow! This Premier Cru Anti-Aging Serum is REALLY incredible! I’m a huge fan of Caudalie, so I was excited when I found out that I’d be getting to #trywithtopbox as a #freeproduct. The first thing I noticed was the ultra sleek frosted glass pump. It just looks nice. It’s got a really light floral scent, and I love it a lot! The texture of the serum is nice and light, and it goes on smooth. A little goes a long way, and I have a feeling I’m going to love the results of this serum, as I definitely needed something for anti-aging. I’ll definitely be checking out the cream, too, because I’ve been hearing really great things! Such a great serum!
