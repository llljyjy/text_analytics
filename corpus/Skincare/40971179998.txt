I’ve been using this on my face and neck 2x daily for over 2 weeks, in combination with my normal moisturizer.  I’ve noticed some change in the texture of my skin and it absorbs very nicely, but not really much else.  It has a very very faint scent to it that isn’t offensive, the packaging is beautiful, and the serums dispense very well (I used one pump on my whole face/neck).  Overall, I LIKE it but maybe not LOVE it. nan
