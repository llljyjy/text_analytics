I received this product as a free sample from Influenster. I have combination skin type with some early signs of aging, no deep wrinkles. I did find this product to be very watery however the scent was mild but pleasant. After application I found my skin to be very smooth with this product alone, even if there was no tingle. I find many other wrinkle serums to be harsher both in scent and in application, they tend to be thicker in consistency as well so this was a nice change. I noticed my skin already appearing more supple after a few short weeks of using. The ingredients are very clean which makes me feel good about putting it on my face. I have never used a probiotic skincare before however I enjoy that this formula is without harsh additives. I will continue to use this product and look for more signs of repair once the bottle is empty if I will purchase another. I would definitely recommend this product to others to try for themselves! Great clean serum
