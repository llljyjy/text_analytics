I literally was so surprised with this. I got this as a sample to try, and omg. I’m in love. It’s more of a sticky gloss than an oil, but that’s what I love! It’s long lasting and def acts like a lip balm in that it’s pretty nourishing. I honestly wasn’t expecting to be wow’d this much. It does have a cherry smell to it but nothing over powering, at least not to be. I’ll def buy this on my own when I run out. nan
