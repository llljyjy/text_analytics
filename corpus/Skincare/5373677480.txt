I have small zits around the nostrils usually around my period. I get some on my chin too but never on the forehead. After just two days of spritzing morning and night(twice a day, four times in total) I have two huge volcano of a pimple coming up above my lips and on my forehead. It’s so big that these pimples have their own heart beat. It’s only been two days so I cannot be sure it’s the spray or it’s just me but …putting it out there. Did it make me break out in just two days?
