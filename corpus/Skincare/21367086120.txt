I received this to try it out and it was a nice eye serum. It has a small fragrance to it which I don’t mind and it’s seams a little thick once you mix it (it could be due to the sample package which was hard to use) but it apples nicely and hydrates under the eyes really well. I don’t really have dark circles but it helped with the hydration. nan
