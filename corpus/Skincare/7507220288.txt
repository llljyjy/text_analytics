I typically don’t incorporate or use an eye cream in my skincare regimen so I was excited to try this product and I was actually pleasantly surprised. It’s super thick and initially I was worried about that and not absorbing into the skin but not with this one. It absorbs into the skin super fast and doesn’t leave a tacky/residue feeling. Typically when i wake up  i have puffy under eyes but the last couple days that I’ve used this product, that hasn’t happened. My under eyes feel really soft and nourished even after being in the sun and swimming. I would actually repurchase this product. I really like it. Super moisturizing
