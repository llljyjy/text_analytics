I received the Dr. Zenovia Skincare Advanced Retinol Night Repair Treatment as a sample from PinchMe. The product itself has a very smooth, velvety texture to it and is easy to apply. It goes right into my skin. The packaging looks very sophisticated. I gave it 4 stars because I did break out a little from it. Iâ€™ve been using it for 2 weeks and so far I think I see a little improvement. nan
