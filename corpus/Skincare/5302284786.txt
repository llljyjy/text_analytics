This is the second Spf moisturizer I have tried so I am fairly new of using Spfs. So here is my pro and con list of this product:Pro:Very translucent - the zinc is very finely milled so it tan girl friendly!Last quite awhile - I put it on in the morning and it still there by mid afternoon.Not too heavy on the face but you can feel it a bit on your faceIngredients are clean and environment friendlyCon:A faint smell when it hits direct sunlight but no smell when in doors. Really weird! It smells like old cucumber or an old wet plant. The smell slowly goes down after an hour or so in direct sunlight. Face feels greasy when you touch it.A day after I wash it off, my face is a bit dryer than usual if I forget to use night time moisturizer.Side note: dries matte after awhile of direct sunlight. Pretty good...
