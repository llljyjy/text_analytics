This cleanser leaves my face feeling clean and hydrated, which are the main things I’m looking for in a cleanser. It doesn’t have much scent at all, which is nice. It lathers very lightly and rinses easily. The packaging is beautiful. The pump is small, but I have been able to get the product out easily and without any problems. solid all-around cleanser
