Really liking this product! Comparing it to my prescription retinoid, it may not be as strong but it is a bit easier on the skin and moisturizing. I love that is so easy to just throw on before bed if you aren’t feeling like doing a huge routine. I have fairly sensitive skin and it hasn’t caused any issues except for some mild redness at times but resolved over night.   No peeling, drying, or breakouts for me! Great nighttime combo product!
