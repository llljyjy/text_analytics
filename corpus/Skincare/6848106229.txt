Honestly the best face moisturizer I have ever used. I was skeptical due to the reviews but my skin loves this! I didn’t break out, actually-I stopped breaking out, made my skin super soft. The price tag is steep but for something that actually works for me is worth it! I’d rather spend money on something that works than keep wasting money trying products that don’t work. I noticed results instantly and I’m already a month in and love it! I will continue to use this and purchase again. I’m too scared to try something new if this works best for me! Best moisturizer for me!
