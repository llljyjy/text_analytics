not holy grail.  very overpriced.  $38! itâ€™s not life changing. i have dry skin w little texture & milia. a little bit drying. only change i noticed was it decreased the discolorations on my skin. also the liquid starting to get some cloudiness /residue forming.  not a replacement for physical exfoliating. inkey has $10 mandelic acid & fulvic acid cleanser better value  for your budget & works the same overpriced & too hyped up in youtube
