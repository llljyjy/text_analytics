I was excited to try this exfoliant because most dry my skin out- especially in winter, it’s a bit of a double whammy. Goop, I feel, really elevates prices on their products. However, a few friends of mine actually use this product and said it worked wonders for their complexions. The packaging is straightforward and uninteresting 🤷🏻‍♀️. The SMELL of this product is sooooo off-putting. I can be honest and state right away that I will NOT be purchasing this item because of scent alone. It’s horrible-acidic and almost fermented (in a bad way). The product is also quite sticky and took a long time to dry on my skin. The positive, is that this product gave my skin a really lovely glow after I used it. The glow stayed long after the product dried which was very nice.  I can’t say that I’ve noticed a dramatic difference in my face texture or coloration, however I will say that my skin looks more hydrated and glow- so that gave this product some stars! I used this product as instructed for 5 straight weeks to give this a fair review. Great Product- except for THE SMELL 🤢🤢
