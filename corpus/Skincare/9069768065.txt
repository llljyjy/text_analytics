I love the texture of this moisturizer. It’s very lightweight as it claims and doesn’t leave a greasy feeling. My skin is left feeling hydrated, balanced and refreshed! I love that it’s refillable and I’m obsessed with the beautiful reusable jar! If you have oily or combination skin this is definitely the moisturizer for you! I 100% recommend it! Amazing for oily skin!
