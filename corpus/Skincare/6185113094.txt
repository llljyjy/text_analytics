I’ve only been using this moisturizer for a few weeks but I am really liking it. It’s not to heavy on my skin, makes my skin feel nice and soft and seems to be helping with my fine lines. I haven’t seen much difference in my dark spots but like I said I have only been using this product for a few weeks Really liking this moisturizer
