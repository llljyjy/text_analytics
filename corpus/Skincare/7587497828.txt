This product is a nice toner, however, I think I prefer a toner that also doubles as a moisturizer. I’m sure it pairs wonderfully with their water cream, which I do love. I have my eye on another product which will be my go to when this one is out. I also don’t enjoy the scent, which was disappointing because I usually like Tatcha’s scents. Tatcha has good products, but this one doesn’t do it for me. If you’re unsure, get a sample/travel size and try it first. The bottle itself is very sturdy, so you’ll need something to put it onto to apply it. (Or I suppose you could shake it onto your hand). It works but it's not my favorite.
