After reading the reviews for this, I was a little bit weary. I was so pleasantly surprised when I tried it!! It goes on super easily, almost like a balm. It didn’t irritate my eyes and it did keep my eyes super bright all day! The only reason for giving it 4 stars and not 5 is that it did leave a tingling sensation on my eyes. It wasn’t terrible and it didn’t burn my sensitive skin, but it was just slightly tingly which wasn’t my favorite. I’ll use it anyway though because it’s a fair trade for how well this worked. Wait okay this is cool!
