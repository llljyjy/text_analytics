I finally have found a cream cleanser that works! It takes off makeup and still leaves my skin feeling smooth and gentle.  Most cream cleansers I’ve used in the past don’t do a good job at wiping off excess makeup/dirt, but this Luminous Cream Cleanser does the job. Absolutely love this!! Love this!
