I received this product to test and I must admit I was pleasantly surprised! I love the dropper because it doesn’t put out too much product, a little goes a long way. I used this morning and night and noticed a significant difference in my skin. It was very plumping and I even noticed my skin become brighter and felt lest textured. I would recommend this product and plan on repurchasing in the future! I’m also interested and trying more products from this brand. Surprisingly awesome!
