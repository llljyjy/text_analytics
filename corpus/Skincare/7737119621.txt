Simply adore this. After envying a friend’s one of these, I bought one going into a sweaty and humid summer where reapplying a liquid sunscreen midday felt horrid. This was perfect to carry on the go without worrying about keeping it out in the heat all day. The brush is a great size for reapplications midday, which is crucial at peak sun exposure. I love that it doesn’t trigger my acne prone and oily skin. I had the Bare Minerals version of this back in high school but prefer this one. And I recently discovered the handy screen you can pull up to make putting away the brush even easier! Perfect SPF for on the go and touch up
