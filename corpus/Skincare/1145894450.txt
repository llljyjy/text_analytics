Been wanting to try this for months but was very nervous as my skin doesn’t like extensive skin care. My skin is happiest when I stick to basic skin care. Then I got this as a gift with purchase. I decided to spot treat this on one acne rather than all over my face. I put a thin layer with q-tip directly on the acne. In a few hours, that one acne turned into a cluster acne with 5-6 more heads. Looks even more horrible now. I immediately applied my face oil to calm it down but yeah not all ’hyped’ products will work for everyone. I understand the concept of purging but this seem more like a case of aggravation to me. Again my skin doesn’t like strong skin care so it could just be me. Glad I didn’t actually purchase this and was able to test out with a sample size. Use at your own risk. Eh...
