I received a complimentary sample from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest opinion. I received a small sample, so I used it on my crow’s feet around my eyes. After 30 days and nights, I maybe saw a softening of a small line. It is rich, thick, and moisturizing. It has a pleasant scent. I would not use it on my oily skin. Someone with dry and first signs of aging may appreciate this product more than someone with oily and mature skin. It’s OK
