I was excited to try this product, as it has a lot of beneficial ingredients found in Japanese and Korean skincare. I received 1/2 oz sample from Influnenster, which lasted about a week or so, using 2x daily . Pros: It did not irritate my sensitive skin, was not heavily fragranced; Cons: a week is not long enough to see benefits from a topical product. If I had received a larger product I might have been able to write a more comprehensive review. nan
