I did not like this product at all. I have dry skin and this serum makes me look greasy, not dewy. I donâ€™t like the qatery texture at all. It feels like it is packed with silicone. It does nto glide on the skin. It is supposed to be applied on clean skin so no product on the skin before it. I always use toners or toning solutions. So it does not work in my skin care routine. It does not provide coverage and it does not even the skin tone so I applied makeup as usual. It started to peel. The price is way to high for a small bottle of product that just does not make sense for me. Not for me.
