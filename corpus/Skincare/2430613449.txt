Very strong smell. It’s not a nice rose smell, it’s like a really old potpourri smell. It did not help my dry skin nor did it wear well under make up. It spreads weirdly on the face and I needed to use a lot to cover my face. The jar was not full when I first opened it, which is very disappointing since it is so expensive. There are wayyyy better options out there. Don’t buy this
