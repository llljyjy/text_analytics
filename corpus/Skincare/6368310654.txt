I’m not sure why this is called a lotion, but I do like it! It’s as thin as water, but it leaves my face feeling nice and refreshed before applying moisturizer. I put it on with a little cotton pad and it has made a noticable difference in minimizing the pores on my nose. I received a sample size of this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Not a lotion, but it works!
