It’s ok? As others have noted, the packaging is awful and the paint peels off. The product is very liquid, leaks, and generally gets everywhere. It also doesn’t soak into the skin very well (at least not my skin.) Also, please note - THIS PRODUCT IS NOT WATER RESISTANT. Sephora listing has an image that says that it is, but the product insert specifically says that the product can be removed with water. I’m sure there are many other quality products one can buy at half the price. Messy & Overpriced
