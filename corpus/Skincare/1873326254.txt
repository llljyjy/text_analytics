Lancôme Renergie HCF Triple Serum is light weight and melts flawlessly on my skin after cleansing and toning. It has a light and soft scent that is not bothersome or irritating. I honestly haven’t noticed any of my skin discolorations lighten or fading but I know it takes time to see results. The packaging is amazing however when the bottle dropped from a shelf, the pump broke which was very disappointing. I was able to mend it together with tape just so I could continue to use the product. I will continue to use it to see if I have any results but so far, none yet. nan
