Perfect for dry to normal skin. I’m not sure why other reviewers with a beauty profile of oily or acne prone skin even purchased this and left a bad review, its meant for dry to normal skin lol. I however have extremely dry and sensitive skin (most skin care leaves me red or with bad irritation - this does not). I absolute love this, its basically IT cosmetic’s ’secret sauce’ but for more dry skin. I’ll be buying another :) Perfect for dry skin, I'm in love!
