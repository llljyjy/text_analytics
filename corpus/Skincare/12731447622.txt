Honestly reading the ingredients I wasn’t so sure but it does seem to have some great moisturizing properties and I do like to use it under my under eyes and on my face for some good moisturization. It’s not typically the type of serum I would use every day but it does have its uses.This product was given to me by Influenster for my honest opinion. It took me a few weeks to develop a an opinion we’re sharing. It’s good for moisture!
