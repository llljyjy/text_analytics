Love this hydrating cream. I have very dry skin and only need a little bit to hydrate my whole face and neck. Leaves my skin feeling so smooth, soft, and fresh. Does not clog my pores and having sensitive skin it has not irritated me and have been using it daily for a month now. Definitely worth it. nan
