I was very excited to try this youth oil. My skin has been acting up lately so it needed something different. After using for several weeks I can say I will 100% be repurchasing this product. Itâ€™s so smooth, and leaves my skin so soft and plump. The scent may be over powering to some , but I actually love it. Worth the high price point
