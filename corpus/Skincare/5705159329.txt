My eyes are very sensitive and facial vitamin c serums would always irritate them! But this is the perfect texture, silky and sinks right into the skin, and you can apply it all over the lid and under eye without it dripping into your eyes. Remember that this is an eye serum - I would still use a lightweight eye cream/moisturizer over top. One of those rare products that actually makes you look better upon application. I’m very picky and knowledgeable and I can tell you this is chef’s kiss! I can’t wait to see the long term benefits as well! BEST TEXTURE and instantly makes eyes look better
