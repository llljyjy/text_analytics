I got this as a sample and loved it so much I went out and bought it the next day. It is so incredibly hydrating and makes the skin feel almost silky when you put it on. I’ve tried many hydrating toners due to my dry, sensitive skin and this stuff is so amazing. I’d definitely recommend! Amazing toner
