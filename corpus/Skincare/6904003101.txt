I was given this once before and finished it up so quickly with how much I loved it. I had quite a few more serums to finish up so I didn’t repurchase but my skin missed this so much. I’m back to using this again and it’s just as good as I remember! I’ve tried nearly every serum in Caudalie’s line and this is by far my favourite.I love how this is so lightweight yet so hydrating. I apply just 1-2 pumps and massage into my skin, I find it absorbs very easily. It hydrates but also soothes my skin when it feels irritated. I feel like my skin is extra soft + plump when I have this on and the last few mornings I’ve experienced less tightness and dryness within my skin when I wake up, despite not changing much else in my routine since reintroducing this serum into it.Definitely a bit pricey for a hyaluronic acid serum compared to others, but I do think it’s worth it if you’re willing to splurge for a more enjoyable skincare experience. I’ve found a lot of other hyaluronic acid based serums to feel really sticky, but I do not experience that at all with this one. Have had just an overall lovely experience with this serum and I am completely willing to repurchase this serum with my own money when I run out. favourite hyaluronic acid serum
