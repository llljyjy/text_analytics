This product was gifted to me by Tatcha and I would definitely recommend this product because it is not harsh on the skin but very effective. This mask is cool and calming when applied and gives you an exfoliation while youâ€™re washing it off. It leaves my skin feels smooth and a lot less textured. great mask!
