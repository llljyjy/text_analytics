I used this for about a week before I wrote a review to post my honest opinion:Applicator: I love the applicator and the pump dispenses the perfect amount each time, and when I take it with me places in my bag, I don’t have a fear of it spilling everywhere Smell: It has no fragrances however it does have a strong-ish berry/grape smell. I don’t mind it but might bother some people Skin: I have acne prone and sensitive skin and this has not broken me out so far and I do feel like it moistures and hydrates my skin well and does what it says. It is a little bit tacky/sticky at first but then that goes away and dries nicely. I applied this at night and I felt like my skin Looked nice in the morning. I also feel Like It can be worn under makeup, I didn’t try it under foundation yet, but it was nice under my concealer, bronzer, blush.Cons: the price point, unless there is a justifiable reason why it’s 76$ I can’t see my self spending that much on a moisturizer, however I do feel like this one lasts long so i’ll see nan
