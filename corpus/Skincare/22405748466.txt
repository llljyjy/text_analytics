This product has a VERY STRONG smell that reminds me of bathroom cleaner. Got this as a free sample and it has multiple uses left, Iâ€™ve only used it twice, but I am going to throw it away. I notice more of a glow from my regular moisturizer. If you are looking for a glow find a moisturizer that works for you mix in vitamin c (I love the drink elephant one) and top with a face mist. Vitamin c works over time, spray gives an instant glow. Smells like bathroom cleaner
