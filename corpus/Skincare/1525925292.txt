I was very excited to try this serum and the pads as I have used Peter Thomas Roth products years ago and remember having a very good experience. This serum, (which I used after the resurfacing peel pad) fell a bit short for me. It probably does something but it didn’t feel like a “serum”, it felt like somewhat of a drying gel. There is no real scent to it, I just don’t love it. I used it for a month straight along with the pads and if there was any difference in my skin, it was minimal. I’m 40 but I am told I look younger, so to begin with my skin isn’t terrible. I take good care of it. I would say my top two things that I look for in skin care is ultimate hydration because my skin can feel a bit dry sometimes and also even skin tone, this is so important to me!!! I’ve tried so many products and this is the hardest to come by. Falls a Bit Short.
