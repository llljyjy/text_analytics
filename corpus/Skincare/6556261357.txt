I was dealing with hormonal acne for 3 months and tried a million things to get rid of it. My texture and acne were gone after using this 2 days in a row at night. It’s been controlling any flare-ups since. I use it once daily and it doesn’t try my skin out like other salicylic acids. Honestly amazing and worth every penny This fixed my skin in 2 days.
