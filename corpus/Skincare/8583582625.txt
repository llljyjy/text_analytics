I received a sample of this awhile ago and loved it, so when my old moisturizer ran out I finally bit the bullet and bought the expensive full size. I’m not sure if they’ve reformulated or what but this left a film on my face that pills off. At first, I thought it just didn’t react well with the oil serum that I used on top of it (futuredew by Glossier - which doesn’t make any other of my moisturizers pill). However it pills off even if I use this by itself. When you’re applying it, it feels great - lovely cool silky texture and smells great - but once it’s applied it either does nothing or pills off. :( Pills terribly
