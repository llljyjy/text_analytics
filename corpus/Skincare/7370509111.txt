I feel this product is very innovative and my skin get very healthy and hydrated. I tried the shade 3 I am a medium to dark complexion but I think I should try tone 2. The color does disappear but I did I see some change with the darkest tone. Overall I do recommend trying if you need a boos of healthy for your face. Healthy skin
