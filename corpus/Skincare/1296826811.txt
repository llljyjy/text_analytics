I compare every Vit C product to the holy grail Skinceuticals CE Ferulic which is expensive but actually works. This Tatcha product is expensive but I did not see dramatic results like I did with Skinceuticals. It was a nice hydrating serum that did not cause any irritation but in terms of brightening or firming it was just fine. The Skinceuticals is more expensive but in the future I will put the $115CAD towards a bottle of CE ferulic. Iâ€™d rather pay more and get more bang for my buck. No match for CE Ferulic
