I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for an honest review.  And the one word that comes to mind as I’m writing this is wow. This is one product that I literally never knew I needed to add to my normal routine. And I rarely change my routine as if something isn’t broke why fix it? But this will be a new staple as the amount of glow my skin has now is something I’ve been trying to achieve for a while now. Safe to say going forward I will continue to buy this. The only downside is the price but thankfully it’s a 1.69 oz so it should last. Wow!
