I am in awe of this mask. I have somewhat dry skin; after putting this on overnight, the next morning my skin felt unbelievably smooth. My slight wrinkles around my mouth even were gone! This product admittedly doesn’t smell too pleasant, but it’s 100% worth it. The size is very generous as well. The BEST!
