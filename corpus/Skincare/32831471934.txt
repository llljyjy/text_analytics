I clearly was very hesitant in using new product into my skin and I’m glad I had the opportunity to try this. I personally use this mostly during the night and not in the morning with the sunscreen. This formula is mildly scented but not overpowering and the consistency/texture feels very gel-like form that’s not heavy though light and non sticky. A little products go a long way to cover all over the face. This product is a bit on the high end but I do recommend and will consider purchasing occasionally. I love how this product is cruelty free with the anti-aging and I’ve been loving using this product every night. nan
