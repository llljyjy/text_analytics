Dr. Zenovia skincare Peptide+ Ceramide Repairing moisturizer. This serum combines bio-equivalent ceramides , a powerful peptide complex, and Dr. Zenovia‘s exclusive REG-ulate360 Complex to reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and hyperpigmentation. Potent humectants and emollients help the skin hold on to moisture, revealing a visibly radiant and hydrated complexion. This moisturizer smooths my skin well and my skin feels so soft after applying this cream. It’s lightweight, fast - absorbing, and doesn’t dry your skin. The scent of this moisturizer is light and very pleasant.This is definitely a product I will keep on hand. Definitely recommend it. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. Wonderful product.
