I felt like it was doing something at first. My under eyes appeared less sunken, less dark and well hydrated but after day 3 or 4 i found that it didn’t do much. Fast forward 1 month in, I feel like it did absolutely nothing to improve the appearance of my under eyes, despite using it daily. I’m giving it 2 stars because it does provide hydration but that’s about it. Not really worth it for the price, at least for me. nan
