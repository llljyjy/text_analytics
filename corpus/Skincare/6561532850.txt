This is an amazing toner. This is actually my first fenty product, I had high expectations and they were pretty much met. I had combination skin and this toner did a good job of hydrating my dry areas whilst controlling oil in my t zone. Also I think it helped with the tiny bumps on my skin, my skin seems to look smoother. I think a pump wouldâ€™ve been better for the packing maybe. This product is pretty thick, so a little goes a long way. I would definitely recommend this to all skin types. The scent is lowkey and goes away immediately. nan
