I love the product, the container is pretty well sized, above of what I was expecting. It lathers on like a non foaming cleanser but once you start adding water to rinse it foams up. My face feels deeply cleansed and it removes the makeup perfectly. My only downside is the amount of fragrance. It lingers on my skin and irritates a bit if I scrub my face slightly too much. If youâ€™re into Dior products then this can be your next favorite. I would love to say five stars
