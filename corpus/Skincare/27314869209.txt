I started using this and can actually see the results! It has lots of uses which why I would recommend this product. Don’t use it after waxing or shaving it can sting. But honestly it really works for clearing any hyperpigmentation. I didn’t try on my face because I don’t need it but for my underarms it definitely helped a lot. It also helped with dandruff and removing and dry scalp flakes before washing my hair. nan
