I love this Kale, Green Tea, Spinach cleanser.  In the winter time, my skin tends to be dry , so I just use a little bit of it at night.  It tends to dry out my skin during the winter time because the weather in Canada is so cold and dry.  Use it along with the Kale + Tripeptide 5 Vitamin C Hyaluronic Acid Superfood firm and brightener serum. Added to my favourite list
