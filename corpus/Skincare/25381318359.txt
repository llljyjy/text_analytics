For me, this product is absolutely AMAZING. Never in my life have i found something that works so well for my acne and this literally just dissolves every pimple i have, even the bigger ones that need 2-3 stickers to get rid of. They would last for weeks if I’d just let them be, but now i can get completly rid of them in a day without leaving any scars or redness. This is the first time I come to review a product because I’m just so impressed.That being said, it doesn’t work at ALL on my boyfriend. I have very light acne, just occasional pimples / black heads / oily skin, but he has more severe acne and drier skin. It just doesn’t seem to work at all on him, even though we apply them following the same process.Honestly, try them. They don’t cost that much, At worst you won’t see much difference, but at best it will literally solve all your life’s acne problem. Changed my life, but didn't do anything for my bf
