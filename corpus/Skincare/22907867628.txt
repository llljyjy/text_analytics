I love, love this product. I use every night after I wash my face. The product goes on smoothly and absorbs into my skin nicely without leaving a sticky residue like some serums. It does have a light fragrance but I enjoy that as well. It has made my fine lines less noticeable, my skin firmer, and my skin smoother. The bottle is an added plus and looks sleek and elegant and the product comes out in the perfect proportion. I have been using for the past 3 weeks. I received this product for my honest review. If your on the fence about it, go for it! nan
