I love the smell, I don’t think it’s too overwhelming and not streaky or greasy which is a plus if you’re getting ready quickly.  I like Ray it doesn’t stain or cling to my clothes.  Hyaluronic Acid is a great ingredient for firmness and I do find this lotion to be hydrating and love that it’s cruelty-free! Love it!
