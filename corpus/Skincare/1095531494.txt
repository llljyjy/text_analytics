I am very surprised that Kosas did a great job with this spray. There are so many in the market and their approach in this one is different. Do I think it works miracles and magic by forming the skin? No because only cosmetic procedures help with that. But, it does enhance my current skincare regimen. I have dry skin especially in the winter. It gets dry and patchy which makes my foundation look cakey. Plus you can literally see the dry spots even more. The way I use this is after I apply my serums, I apply this to lock everything in. It has collagen in it making your skin appear “bouncy” and “glowing”. I love how hydrating it is without any fragrance. The only thing I smell is the collagen (iykyk). After I apply my moisturizer I notice how much a difference this makes. I will most likely continue to buy this. Even my husband likes the spray and has incorporated it into his skincare routine as well. nan
