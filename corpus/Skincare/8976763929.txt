I decided to do this in a side by challenge so I used it on one side of my face and not the other. I have forehead creases and mouth lines, I could tell the biggest difference in my mouth area after 3 weeks!  It doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy which I love. It’s hydrating and smells nice, but it Works too!! In a side by side, it works.
