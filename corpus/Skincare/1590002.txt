The Dr. Zenovia moisturizer is very good. Although the texture quite thick it absorbs in my skin very quickly and does not leave any unnecessary residue. It is very pleasant smelling and leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth and hydrated. I would definitely recommend this product as I feel it was very effective for me. Dr. Zenovia
