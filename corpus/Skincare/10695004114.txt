I don’t get acne. Rarely since puberty. I have a regimen I follow and it never gives me acne. I added this in my routine…smells terrible. But I figured if it will get rid of the scars, who cares. After a couple days of using it, I started getting acne. It stinks, it’s over priced. I wanted to support this black brand but it messed my skin up. And I have pcos so getting rid of acne is not easy. I haven’t had acne in YEARS though. Now i have to get rid of it again. And the scars are still there so yeah thanks for nothing Gave me acne, smells terrible
