I’ve had difficulty with my skin for my whole life (i’m now 32), mostly getting acne on my chest/back. I tried EVERYTHING I could possibly think of, but would continuously have breakouts - longest I went without one was maybe a month, but it would start all over again. But since adding this to my skincare routine I haven’t had a breakout in around 3 months, which is completely unheard of for me. I’ve seen some reviews saying this product doesn’t help, which it may not for some people, but I didn’t see results immediately, it took a month or two of using it until my breakouts completely cleared. I started by using this with every shower, I’ve now reduced to using it about 2-3 times a week. I do use another sensitive/non-perfume cleanser as well, and use this product after that, but the other cleanser didn’t work until I added this too. It’s honestly been such a relief for me, and couldn’t recommend more to people struggling with breakouts!I’ve added before/after photos, before was taken in 2019, after was today, but the before photo is an accurate representation of what my skin was like 90% of the time. Hope this helps!! Couldnt recommend more, cleared my skin completely
