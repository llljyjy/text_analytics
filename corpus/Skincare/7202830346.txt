I got a sample of this and literally after one night of using it, there were immediate results. My texture was smoothed out and my acne had gone down drastically. It is drying so i wouldnt use it everyday. I wasnt expecting much from a small sample but i was very pleasantly surprised at the results. It made all my little under the skin bumps go down as well. I highly reccommend this to people that struggle with acne. I definitely wouldnt reccommend it to someone with dry skin though. Id say this product is for someone with oily or normal skin types. nan
