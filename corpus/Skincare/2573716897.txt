I’ve tried this product and the ordinary hyaluronic acid+b5. I definitely love the amino acids+b5 more! I like the liquidity texture, feel very lightweight on the face and without the sticky feeling that the hyaluronic acid has. In addition, I can layer other serums, sunscreen, or makeup on top of this product without having the peeling situation while the hyaluronic acid would peel for some of the products I use….I’m on my second bottle now! Good moisturizing serum!
