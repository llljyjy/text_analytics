Vitamin C serum is a staple in my skincare routine, and this was a new one for me to try. It feels very light on the skin and has an amazing lineup of ingredients! I took off a star because itâ€™s unscented (but in a weird no scent scent kind of way) and I personally find the dropper slightly cumbersome and would prefer a pump. nan
