Started breaking out immediately after the first use. Took a break to heal my face with my favourite la Roche Posay serum, gave this DE serum another chance, and broke out again. To make it completely clear - I haven’t had breakouts for 3 years after accutane, and now everything came back. I discontinued using this serum, but the breakouts don’t go away. Never been more frustrated with a skincare product. Can’t believe I might come back to accutane again. Will never use DE again. Worth mentioning that I used this serum in combination with polypeptide DE face cream. Horrible experience
