The best eye makeup remover I’ve ever used (and I’m in my 60s so that’s saying a lot!)  I really like the semi-soft consistency which makes it very easy to use. I use a cotton swab, swipe a wee bit over lids and lashes, then wipe off. Voila! I can see this mini size lasting a long time. Best eye makeup remover ever!
