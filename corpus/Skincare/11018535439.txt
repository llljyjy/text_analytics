I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review.  I really like it he Shiseido sunscreen. Now that I’m in my 40’s, I pay more attention to avoiding sun damage. I really like that this sunscreen has hylaronic acid. It feels good on my skin, and is not sticky. I will be going on vacation soon and looking forward to using this in the hot sun.  It’s a great face sunscreen! Great sun protection
