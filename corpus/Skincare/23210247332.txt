First off, this packaging… 10/10! I’ve been using this serum in my nighttime skincare routine for the past week, and I love it! Has a slight honey smell but nothing strong or bad! A little goes a long way, so each bottle will last you a while which is good considering the price. It’s fantastic for plumping fine lines, firming and tightening the skin as well. It makes my skin look so dewy, & bright! I also researched more on how it’s made, I recommend doing that also! I’m assuming it’s why it’s so expensive! 10/10
