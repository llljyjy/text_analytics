This is one of the best hydrating creams that I have tried for multiple reasons! 1. It contains hyaluronic acid, which very helpful for the skin moisturizing! 2. It can contains SPF and aids skin protection during the day! 3. It’s vegan, mineral oil-free, GMO-free, dermatologist tested, and non-comedogenic! I absolutely love it! ❤️ nan
