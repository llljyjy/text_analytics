I have been using Lancôme Absolue Revitalizing Eye Cream for about three weeks and can honestly say I notice a difference. I first noticed after one application that my makeup applied more smoothly and I didn’t have to “work“ much to prevent creasing. After using for a few days and nights my eyes looked less tired, even on mornings after no sleep at all. The before and after (slightly embarrassing) does show some makeup on the after shot but it is at the end of a long day and a close up to show the fine lines that were under my eyes have disappeared in just under a month. I purposefully wanted to show that the effects last and aren’t just a one hour caffiene “trick“. This is by far the best eye cream I’ve used and after turning 40 this year I have tried quite a few. Lancôme Absolue Eye Cream sets the Gold Standard
