I was so excited to try this cream out! Normally I love all of Clinique’s products, but this one just wasn’t for me at this time. It felt very good going on and seemed to melt into my skin nicely. It left me feeling soft and moisturized but a little sticky. By morning, my face was a greasy mess. Which is really strange because my skin is mostly normal/dry. So I never have that problem. I actually ended up with few breakouts after using this moisturizer for a few nights. So unfortunately I wasn’t able to try it long enough to see if I received any lasting benefits. With that being said, I would love to try this cream out again sometime during the winter months when my skin is at it’s driest. I feel like I’d be able to tolerate it much easier during that time of the year. Regardless I am still very happy that I got to try this product out and I would absolutely recommend it to someone who has dry skin. I think it’d be perfect on dry skin! Would be best for dry skin
