I received this item free for review purposes from Influenster. I was surprised at this cream. I’ll admit that I don’t think of Shiseido often when figuring out a moisturizer I love from Sephora. I have normal/dry skin in the winter and normal/combo in the summer. I tend to go for gel or gel creams so that I can stay hydrated and not have dry skin on my nose but I don’t want my forehead to look greasy. I tend to use creams at night. However, this one is so nice. It hydrated my skin without the greasy look. The spf is a nice bonus for when I don’t reapply right before sunset. The smell is moderate/minimal. I only wish the top was flat so I could stack in my bathroom area and maybe a scoop for it. Definitely worth a try. Also my skin has never been clearer so I will stick with it. Surprisingly good.
