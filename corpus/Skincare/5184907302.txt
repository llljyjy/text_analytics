I love these gel patches. I like that they have eye and face ones and they are thin so you get a lot of patches in the tub. There’s also a lot of product on the patches which is great. I love sticking them on when my eyes are extra tired and I didn’t get enough sleep. There’s also no scent which I prefer. nan
