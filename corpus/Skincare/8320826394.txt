This product was complimentary from Tatcha. This mask is luxury in a bottle. From the beginning, the packaging transports you into a spa, then the heavy jar and the smell and texture of the mask. The mask was easy to apply, it has a gritty texture which was nice for exfoliating. After removing the mask there is a cooling effect that makes you feel extra clean. I wouldnâ€™t say I noticed a huge difference im my pores, however, It was a great experience. Luxury in a jar
