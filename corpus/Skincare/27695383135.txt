I have oily skin and The Light Cream is a more lightweight version of The Cream, but delivers the same deep hydration and anti-aging results. But what sets The Light Cream apart is the addition of powerful botanicals like rice bran oil, baobab leaf extract, and Australian lemon myrtle extract, which help control sebum and oil. It’s also completely vegan and free of gluten, parabens, fragrance, and sulfates. This moisturizer has a matte finish, left my skin feeling smooth and soft with no greasy residue.  It’s hydration helped eliminate fine lines and wrinkles over time.  Leaving a glowing plump complexion.  I love this one just a little pricey for the amount you get.  But a little bit goes a long way Great moisturizer for oily skin
