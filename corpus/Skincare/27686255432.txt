This is a great tanning lotion. It does smell like watermelon when you’re applying which is great. After a while though it starts to smell like tanning lotion and I guess that’s just hard to get rid of. It’s a little difficult to run in and took some time but it did apply smoothly and I saw a small color change after just one use. So I love that. I’ll be adding this to my routine. I got this free from Influenster. Love it!
