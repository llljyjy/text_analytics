I was so excited to receive the beauty sleep overnight repair treatment from Influenster and Tula to try! I am already obsessed with the Tula protect and glow sunscreen gel and the Tula Lip SOS treatment! Packaging is 10/10. Scent is very mild (I can’t stand the scent of the cult classic cleanser, but this is much more mild). I have sensitive, eczema prone skin and have been using this cream without issue. It’s surprisingly lightweight given how hydrating it is- I love that it is fast absorbing so I don’t have to worry about my face sticking to the pillow at night! Another Tula product I’ll be adding to my skincare regimen! Clean products and cruelty free!
