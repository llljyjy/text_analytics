I sought out a forum to give my opinion about this product....I am THAT impressed. (Exfoliate Paula’s Choice). I eat organic, healthy, no fragrances....but for some reason in the past few years, I have been breaking out daily with little pimples. I went through menopause 10 years ago, was wondering if it was chlorine in the water - it was driving me crazy. So I caught a youtube video with a girl talking about different facial bacteria/yeast/breakouts etc., and this was one of the products she recommended. I use it after bathing, and NO more breakouts! Happyhappyhappy....I am SO relieved to have clear skin again.I am a well-preserved 61, btw, and didn’t get anything for this review. I need to buy this in bulk for the future.
