Totally useless in hydrating lips—-just lays on top and doesn’t seem to sink into skin.  Used on early morning walks and ended up with cracked chapped lips!  This together with lip mask at night resulted in severely chapped lips.  Going back to my favorite for years (Fresh Sugar)…never should’ve strayed. Doesn’t hydrate lips…
