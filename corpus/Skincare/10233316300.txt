I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review, and I chose the YTTP serum. I love their brand, so I wasn’t surprised that I would love this serum too. I was impressed with the construction of the bottle as well. I’m a bit clumsy, I’ve dropped it a few times and it’s still intact. The texture of the serum is a mix between liquid and a gel, it’s the perfect consistency honestly. It glides onto the skin with ease, and my skin was instantly plumped and hydrated. I tend to layer my serums especially in the colder months, but to my surprise I didn’t have to do that with this serum. My skin remained hydrated throughout the day with just this serum and a moisturizer. I use this serum in the am/pm and I absolutely love it. I even noticed a difference in my smile lines as well. My skin definitely has a youthful appearance, and the texture of my skin has improved. I’ve even used this serum under my makeup to achieve a “glow from within” look. The YTTP Oasis serum is definitely one of my favorites in my collection, and I can see myself purchasing it in the near future. Everyone needs to try this serum!
