I’ve been using this product for at least a few weeks. I used to just use some of my face cream around my eyes instead of a dedicated eye cream. I’ve noticed a slight improvement in wrinkles. They’re still there but softer looking. I’m hoping that there will continue to be improvements as I continue using it. I haven’t noticed much of a “lift,” but maybe it’s just because I need to use it longer. The most noticeable change I’ve seen is brightening. I had some slight under eye darkness, and the area now seems brighter. I like that this cream absorbs pretty quick and doesn’t feel like I have a layer on my skin the whole day. You only need a small amount, so the container will last for a long time. I’ll keep using it to see how much better the results are. Even though I haven’t seen a dramatic improvement yet, I like where it’s headed. nan
