I think it’s so creamy and luxurious. I definitely noticed that my lips were more moisturized in the morning after use. I’ve been using it at night as a lip mask and under lipstick during the day.  The moisturizing texture is on the thicker side, but not balm level thickness.  There is no scent. The packaging and color are gorgeous! So moisturizing!
