this moisturizer is just okay. itâ€™s a hit and miss depend on what products i used before it. sometimes my face feel dry 30 mins after applying the moisturizer. there was no obnoxious scent & the packaging is made of glass so it can be recycle. i think you can get better bang for your buck elsewhere in sephora. expected more for the price
