I like this product. Lots of foundations wear off quickly throughout the day. This one stayed on nicely. It was easy to apply and didnâ€™t feel greasy or drying. I would consider this product the next time I need foundation.My one complaint is that it seemed a little white, like maybe there was zinc oxide in it that impacted the color. It also could have just been that it was summer and I was tan compared to usual. I received this product free in exchange for my honest opinion. Great, Long-lasting Coverage
