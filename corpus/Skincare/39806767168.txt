Two formulas contained in two separate vials and housed in one bottle. One side oil & one side gel. I received these samples in little disposable pouches that you crack and mix together.  I imagine the bottles are easier to blend the product together before use. I did find it quite oily and made my face initially quite shiny, so using this product at night worked best for me. It did make my face feel very soft and smooth and I can see using this as a winter serum to aid in the dry Canadian winter air. There wasn’t a strong smell that stood out and nothing lingering on my hands. Anyone who has read my reviews before know strong scents are a deal breaker for me, so no issues there.I wasn’t able to use it long enough to determine whether it helped in any visible signs of aging. Smoother skin, a bit oily
