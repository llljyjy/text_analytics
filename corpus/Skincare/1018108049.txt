When I saw this go out of stock for Ultaâ€™s 21 days of beauty, that should have given me a clue. I bought this during the Sephora Spring Sale event and what a game changer this priming moisturizer is. I have combination skin and this makes my foundation (Estee Lauder Dbl Wear) glide on seamlessly and gives you that airbrush look. This is my new HOLY GRAIL primer! INCREDIBLE!
