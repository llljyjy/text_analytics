I love this cream! My eyes have always been sensitive to most eye creams but I didn’t get bad reaction with this cream. I’ve used it day & night for two weeks now and love the fact that it moisturizes well and also reduces puffiness which makes the eye area looking very nice. This cream is light, silky and easily absorbed. Definitely brightens the under eye area, for a nice refreshed, well rested appearance. Brightens the eye area
