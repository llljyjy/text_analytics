Petrolatum/petroleum jelly is a good occlusive ingredient but it’s also a very cheap ingredient. That’s all that La Mer does. They sell overpriced products made with cheap/affordable ingredients. Just use vaseline on your lips and you’ll get similar results for far less money. don’t waste your money
