I absolutely love this product! It’s the second type of vitamin C I’ve used and I didn’t see results with the first one. My skin was brighter and glowing within a few weeks with DE.  It has a slight smell, but to me it’s not offensive. It also leaves my skin skin a little tacky, but after using Protini serum and moisturizer it goes away and my skin is don’t and supple ! yothat you mix it yourself My favorite skincare product! Amazing results…
