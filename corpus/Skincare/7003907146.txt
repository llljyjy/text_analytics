Just buy a pack of Smackers lip gloss. Thats literally all this is. Wears off very quickly, smells bad, and is far more sticky than an oil should be. It doesn’t moisturize at all. Im not sure who wrote the positive reviews, but this product isn’t worth more than the few dollars for a children’s lip gloss. It’s a cute bottle, thats it. Very disappointing Overpriced Smackers lip gloss
