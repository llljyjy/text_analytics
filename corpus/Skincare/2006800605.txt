I’ve repurchased this oil multiple times. If you are someone who enjoys facial oils this is a MUST for your skincare routine. I personally like to use this during the day or night. If i wear this at night i like to use it with a thicker moisturizer. I typically apply my oils as a first step. Just works better for me even though i know they say to apply it last. Lightweight, great for acne prone skin, really CALMS my skin down. Doesnt clog pores if you’re worried about that. The scent is natural & lovely not to be mistaken for fragranced. It’s good for transitioning between seasons aswell from winter to spring. Overall its one of those oils thats a go to for lightweightedness. Its pricey but you wont regret it. Its a top 5 for me lightweight/effective to calm skin
