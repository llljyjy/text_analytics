OK, I’m a guy, I use this thing, and I LOVE IT! A friend of mine bought it for me once, because she though I would like it and I keep re-buying it... Over and over. The texture is just AWESOME! There is a slight tingling sensation at the beginning that you stop feeling after getting used to this. I used to use Burtt’s Bees chapstick or Dr. Brooner’s Chapstick and they always dried my lips. I had to reapply so often, it became a minor tic, I think. This thing does not need reapplication all the time. I feel like I am putting pure coconut butter on my lips! I --- LOVE --- IT. LANEIGE, I lOVE YOU! I have the night one for lips too and the vanilla flavor one is BOMB. A couple of things about this product for LANEIGE (if you’re reading this obscure post... I know you are): _ I wish the color of the container was different. Y’all pink is cute, but that would look AMAZING with an iridescent holographic unicorn silver or something --- HummmmmK._ I also wish that the shine was a bit less. The formula of this product is GOLD. I wonder if you could make a men version of this product with maybe a mint based or even nothing for smell or flavor. A-D-O-R-E and Not Even DIOR - But LANEIGE Y'all
