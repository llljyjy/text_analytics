I used to use a body hydrating mist from Fox Tan on my face because I never considered using an actual face mist. When I ran out of that stuff I saw this and how inexpensive it was so I tried it and I’m on my second bottle now, it’s so hydrating and does not irritate my skin at all. I use it to layer between moisturizers and certain serums and throughout the day. This stuff is amazing I highly suggest it for anyone no matter your skin type. very hydrating and inexpensive
