Love this product!! I got it as a sample and started using it immediately as I been looking around for new cleansers. It smells AWESOME SO GOOD!! My face isnt left too dry its beautiful and I feel it also lightened my complexion some as its gotten rid of the toxins. I have combo skin so it also feels that its gotten rid of some of the oils in some spots to balance out my face. ID DEFINITELY recommend this product!! I have combo skin and still loved this product!!
