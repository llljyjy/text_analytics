I’ve used this product consistently day and night for a week and I’m loving the results. The first time I used it, I thought the scent was a bit too strong, but I’ve come to really like the herbal, gingery scent. It goes on very smoothly and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. Overall, it’s brightened my skin tone by getting rid of some dullness and given me a healthy, hydrated glow! I’ve attached 2 pics a week apart in the same light for some comparison.I would recommend anyone looking for a Vitamin C serum to try this! Hydrated Glow
