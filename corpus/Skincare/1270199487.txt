I’m so impressed with the IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream! This stuff is really good and it makes my skin feel so soft, smooth, and hydrated. It is a very thick, rich cream but it absorbs nicely into the skin... it doesn’t leave my face feeling greasy or leave behind an annoying, heavy residue. Also, my skin can be very acne prone, so a huge plus is that this moisturizer did not clog my pores or cause any breakouts or irritation. I love that the IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream Moisturizer provides my dry, dehydrated skin the hydration it needs and leaves behind healthy looking, refreshed and smooth skin without any of the negative effects so many other heavy moisturizers have had on me. I have tried so many other brands and they often either cause breakouts, don’t provide enough moisture, or leave behind a disgusting feeling heavy residue on the skin. This stuff is awesome! I must also mention that a tiny bit of this cream goes a long way, so the full size tub will actually last you quite a while. I really have enjoyed using this moisturizer and have absolutely no complaints about it. I would definitely repurchase it and i highly recommend trying it out for yourself. So Good!
