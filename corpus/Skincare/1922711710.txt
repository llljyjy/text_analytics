i waited a long time for the reformulation to come out and it is such a letdown. The new squalane based serum feels super oily and does not sink in, it just sits there looking and feeling oily. i can’t touch my face and wouldn’t dare to apply a moisturizer on top. The older version was aqueous and sinked right in so I could use other skincare and makeup on top. What a mess. nan
