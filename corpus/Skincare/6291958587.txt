I really liked this moisturizer. It wasn’t greasy, it absorbed well, it wasn’t too thick or goopy. The smell wasn’t something you’d even notice. It did not cause my face to break out at all. My only complaint was that it pilled badly with my sunscreen. I even tried switching sunscreens. It still pilled. I preferred using it at night for this purpose. You could feel the active ingredients being active :) but not so much that I had drying around my nose or lips. I can’t say I noticed smaller pores, but I’ve only used it two weeks. I did receive a sample of this for free from BzzAgent in exchange for an honest review. So yes, I would recommend, but only for night. pills with sunscreen otherwise great
