This moisturizer was pretty good. The consistency was just thick enough but not too oily. It absorbed pretty quick into the skin and didn’t have an offensive smell. I don’t think this moisturizer would be the best for those with extremely dry skin but would be a good everyday product. I would get this again. Pretty good moisturizer
