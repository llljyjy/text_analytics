I thought this was a nice serum. It didn’t have a strong odor, if any at all, which is a plus. I’m not against perfumes/scents, but strong scent is one I’d prefer to avoid. It applied nicely to the skin and felt hydrating to the skin. I tend to break out with new products lately, and didn’t notice this serum caused any issues. I wouldn’t say I applied it and noticed a wild glow, it seemed more subtle than other products I’ve used. But I’d definitely recommend this as an option, and definite plus if it bodes well with your skin. A great serum among the massive market
