I used this cream both AM and PM on my face and neck.  I loved the smell which smelled like citrus.  The cream is very moisturizing on your skin and makes your face and neck very soft.  I did notice some improvement in my skin which was wonderful and I will continue using this cream.  The only thing is you donâ€™t need alot of the cream because a little goes a long way.  The jar is a good size and will last you a while! nan
