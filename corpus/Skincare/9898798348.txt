Now that I have figured out the right amount to use and how long to let it set before applying other products, I LOVE IT. If you use too much, and/or put moisturizer on too soon after, it WILL pill. Start with a small amount, and give it plenty of time to absorb. Itâ€™s super hydrating and gives a slight glow. Makeup even seems to go on more smoothly when I have this underneath! nan
