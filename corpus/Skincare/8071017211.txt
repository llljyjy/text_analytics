This serum works wonders! I’ve seen a huge difference in my discoloration and uneven skin tone, as well as improved texture. The only downside, as everyone is saying, is it really does smell like burnt sulfur. However, it’s not overpowering and it fades as soon as I apply the next step in my routine. I use this every morning between my Timeless vitamin C serum and PTR moisturizer steps, allowing 5 minutes between each step for adequate absorption. I’ve recommended this to my friends and they are in love as well! Stinky but works!
