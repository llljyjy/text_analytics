I was given this product for my honest review. I love the smell of this product. Itâ€™s not a heavy smell at all. I also love how the cream was not sticky and didnt make my face feel weighed down. It was quick and easy to put on which for a busy mom of four is much needed. I really felt like it made a difference on my face. I also noticed I didnt have a lot of blackheads. I highly recommend it. nan
