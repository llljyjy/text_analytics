I bought this product because I wanted something with centella to calm redness on my rosacea skin. I had tried their color correcting cream but I wanted something not tinted. I like this gel cream because it doesn’t feel heavy but I’m not sure how effective it really is. I might try a different Dr. Jart product if I can find one that has a higher concentration of centella. On a side note this product feels REALLY good on my face after being kept in the refrigerator. I feel like the gel consistency allows for it to get nice and cold. Pretty good!
