So the texture is nice and creamy but the scent is so bad. I love the pump jar style because it maintains the freshness of the ingredients and it’s also very hygienic since you’re not dipping your fingers in the jar. It pumps out the right amount to cover your whole face. Unfortunately that’s the only good thing I can say about this product. I couldn’t use it to justify if it is good for your skin as I couldn’t get past the strong scent. I don’t recommend it. A No for me
