If you can get past the smell of the mask it does wonders on your skin I almost didnâ€™t even use it cause of the smell but I have to give it a chance! It worked amazing made my skin feel so silky instead of dry but unfortunately cause of the smell I will not be purchasing If you can get past the smell it works great
