Kiehls clearly corrective dark apot solution actually is one of the few products I’ve found that works! It doesn’t happen over night at all, but with consistent use- it has lightened my dark spots *caused by years of ance* at least a shade or so. The formula is very lightweight didn’t feel heavy on my skin like I half expected it to do, and the subtle smell isn’t overpowering. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated after just a few moments of use! I’ve never heard of this product until I received a free sample from BzzAgent to Try in return for my feedback and I’m so glad I was able to! I’ve been using this for a while now-  and noticed a slight difference about 1 week after use. After a few weeks, the results were noticeable! I’m going to continue using jt until my dark spots get to a hue that isn’t bothersome to me. It works!
