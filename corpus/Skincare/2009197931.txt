I wanted to love this product based on the reviews and how good it felt on my skin when I received a sample a few months ago. Unfortunately, it made my skin feel drier and it did not moisturize the small dry patches on my face. For reference, I have normal to dry skin, a bit dryer in the winter. Will be returning and purchasing something else. Disappointing
