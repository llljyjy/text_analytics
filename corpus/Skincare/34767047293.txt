I am in love with this brand. I am currently using vinoperfect radiance dark spot treatment serum in the morning and this cream during night. I use it after cleanser, serum and sometimes apply moisturizer after. I have oily/combination skin and this one suits me. It has somewhat thick texture like creams do and small amount is enough to cover face and neck. It has herby smell that fades after applying. I found my skin is even and clean than before. I also noticed that my pores are less visible after applying this. My face looks bright in the morning so this cream is definitely working its magic overnight to nourish and brighten my skin. I am a fan and would definitely buy again. Wowww product
