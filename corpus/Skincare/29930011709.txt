I received it in my Trendmood box and was very excited to try a Glow Recipe moisturizer. I love the pretty packaging and it works well, doesn’t feel greasy and smells lovely. It’s a nice one, and I like it just as much as the FAB Collagen moisturizer  - has a similar effect but a little lighter so it’s good for daytime use. I haven’t noticed any dramatic improvement in the texture of my skin and I’m not sure if I’d purchase a refill yet, but I’m happy to have it and think it would make a lovely gift. nan
