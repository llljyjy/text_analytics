I am so disappointed! I just got the hyper skin fade and glow aha mask, and to my surprise it’s literally 1/3 full only! Not even half. Who the freak does that to their customers?! This product is 48.00 freaking dollars and you can’t even provide an adequate amount of product worth the price tag?! You really only fill this 1/3 of the way and sell it at 48.00???!!! Will not recommend or repurchase. Do better, either fill up your product or get better packaging for the actual amount of product your REALLY going to provide. DO BETTER!!!
