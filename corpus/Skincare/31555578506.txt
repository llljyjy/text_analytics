I received a complimentary sample of Goopglow Cloudberry Exfoliating Jelly Cleanser from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. It did a good job with exfoliating, as my skin did feel smoother after using. I do feel that it could have done a better job with cleansing,  as I had to wash my face an additional time in order to get my makeup off. The scent was just ok; I couldnâ€™t really make out what I was smelling. For me, I do not feel it is worth the money. Goopglow Exfoliating Jelly Cleanser
