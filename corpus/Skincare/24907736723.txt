My medications require me to use sunscreen so I always have to be careful and then this came along, it works great I absolutely love it. I think it gets the job done and it doesnâ€™t have that weird sunscreen smell It actually smells great. I will keep this one in my makeup bag and definitely keep buying it. It works! And it smells great.
