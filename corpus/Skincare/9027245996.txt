I love using this moisturizer in the AM. I have combo acne-prone skin and this did not break me out! Instead, it made my skin feel really smooth and hydrated after a few uses. I also love that it comes in a hygienic bottle with a pump and how the texture is lightweight and cushiony like yogurt. Overall, my skin feels a lot smoother, brighter, and bouncier than it was a few weeks ago! A Beautiful Lightweight Moisturizer
