I tried the mask accompaniment maybe a year ago and was indifferent. It did a lot of drying and tightening and that’s about it, other than it was annoying to take off. I’ve had some of the worst acne In My adult life and recently found a regiment after discovering a lot of my problems were due to congestion. About a month ago I discovered the GlamGlow sheet mask-- which is great, except not economical to use on a nightly basis. So back to the drawing board for pore cleansing and decided to give this line another try. For reference I have an oily t-zone, scar easily and experience hyperpigmentation with breakouts. On a nightly basis:I wash my face with a gentle creamy cleanser. Followed by this pore cleanser. A disclaimer is that I only use this back-to-back on days where I’ve worn makeup. Otherwise I use this every other night. Also every other night, I finish my washing with a benzoyl peroxide cleanser. I follow with a lot of hydration immediately after-- Caudalie moisturizing toner, Caudalie hydration and a “double moisturizer“. My results? My skin does not dry out due to all the hydration, and my skin is so very clear and my pores feel so very clean due to this pore cleanser. The cleanser is definitely *not* St Ives, but it has a subtle grit to it. It’s not very abrasive. I would recommend this pore cleanser hands down. I don’t think I’d recommend it be used twice a day, and maybe not every every night -- it is quite drying. But I do think it could have a place in many peoples skin care routines.
