Upon first trying this serum out, I did experience a bit of flushing and irritation which I’m assuming as a result of the niacinamide. Typically I don’t experience any issues with niacinamide products but for some reason did this time. Besides the brief initial irritation, I do enjoy the thicker, milky texture of this serum and its barrier supporting benefits. You can see how it helped calm down my skin in just a few days. nan
