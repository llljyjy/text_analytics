Every one of Murad’s day moisturizers has been great alone or under any concealer/foundation; I have fair skin and I’ve never burned my face when I’m outside for hikes or at sporting events; I Use it EVERY day and never have breakouts. I’ve tried all of them and don’t notice a difference between them so usually choose based on what is in-stock; All of them have a light creamy texture that doesn’t leave any white residue and doesn’t require harsh rubbing to absorb. I would not use it alone when going to the beach, but I still use it as a base under my heavy duty sunscreen. My go-to for daytime SPF & moisturizer,double-duty
