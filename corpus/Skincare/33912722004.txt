I tried this product free with Topbox Circle. I really enjoyed the opportunity to try the Wrinkle Correcting Serum. I added this to my morning routine for my trial, and the serum is a smooth pearl gloss. Loved the feeling of the serum, I applied a small amount with fingertips and was pleased with the results. My skin appeared refreshed and remained hydrated. I will definitely purchase this #freeproduct again! Hydrating Pearl Serum
