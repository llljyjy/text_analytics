Okay so after the first few minutes of using this, I came on the Sephora site and added it to my cart. My face felt nourished, smoothed and had a lovely glow. This doesn’t have too much of a scent and the scent it does have goes away quickly after it dried. I put my moisturizer over it and everything was fine. I’d recommend this to my besties. Love at first use!
