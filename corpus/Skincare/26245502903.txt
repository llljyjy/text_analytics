I have used this product off and on for four weeks. I do not notice a glow, nor do I notice extra moisture beyond a few minutes. The consistency is almost water-like. I will finish the bottle, but I see it as just an extra bit of primer rather than a glow serum. Goop’s Glowscreen with SPF and Glossier’s Future Dew are better products for a moist, glowy look. Better Glows Out There
