It’s been a while since I’ve used a manual cleansing brush. I like that this brush is lightweight and the bristles are soft, and vegan for those who interested. Ideally this is the type of brush that I would use while traveling but it’s missing a key feature: a cover. This also makes storing the brush a little more tricky. Two other improvements that would make this brush stand out: a larger brush head to cover more of the face and stiffer bristles to aid movement of product and to provide a deeper clean. nan
