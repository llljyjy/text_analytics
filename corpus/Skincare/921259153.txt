I am an avid eye cream user and have tried so many. What I loved about this eye treatment was the easy pump dispenser and the lightweight serum-like texture which allowed me to easily apply this around my eye area. It glided so well and absorbed nicely into my skin. I mean it when I say a little goes a long way. There was no fragrance, no stinging, and no irritation to my eyes. I could immediately feel a soothing and firming sensation, and I could visibly see improvement in my puffiness and the brightening of my dark circles within a few days of consistent use. I have only had great results with Dr. Dennis Gross products, and this has confirmed even more for me what a great brand they are. I wholeheartedly am amazed by my results. This will be a permanent product in my skincare routine. Immediate results
