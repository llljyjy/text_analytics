I love this face wash. I’ve been using it for around 4 months and my skin has never looked better. I pair it with the ordinary hyaluronic acid serum after and it’s great!Definitely good for oily skin. Only issue is the amount you get is not a lot. The bottle is not filled to the top. Also the scent is a bit strong but does not irritate my skin so I don’t mind. nan
