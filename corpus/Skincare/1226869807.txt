This tanner looked uneven and blotchy on me.  Now, I know water tanner like this can be harder to apply, so it could totally be user error.  The pluses are that the color it gives is a very nice shade and natural looking and the smell isn’t that bad (it’s doesn’t really have a scent when you apply it, but as it develops, you can smell it). Blotchy, but nice color
