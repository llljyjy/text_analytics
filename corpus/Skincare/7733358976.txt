This mask is so good to your skin. It’s not super abrasive but it leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth. I use it about twice and week because it’s really easy. You put it on, wait five minutes, then lightly scrub and wash off. The mask washes off really easy unlike some masks you have to scrub off. It helps my textured skin even out and makes a great step in a makeup prep routine. I love this product. nan
