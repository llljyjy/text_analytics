I bought this for a trip.  I tried it once at home to see if it was compatible with my skin and it wasn’t great but it worked.  Now I’m on vacation and the pump worked for one day.  The top doesn’t screw off.  I had to cut the bottom off the tube and stick my fingers in.  When I head home in a few days I’ll have to toss the tube since I’m flying.  I have only carry on luggage so the tube wasn’t subjected to luggage atrocities, it is just crummy quality control by first aid beauty.  Waste of money. nan
