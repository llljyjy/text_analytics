This cream is rich. It’s very creamy and a little goes a long way. It appears to reduce puffiness fairly quickly (I’ve used quicker products), but I’m not sure I’d recommend using it as a day cream under makeup as it’s thickness alters the way cream products lay atop it. I like using this as a night cream and I apply a reasonably heavy layer around my eye area and my smile lines. While I don’t think I saw a significant change in my fine lines or instant depuffing, I did notice increased hydration in the area and a bouncy resilient feel. I am unlikely to repurchase, but will definitely use up what I have! Good cream, maybe not worth the price point.
