I didn’t love or hate this product. I was pretty indifferent however my boyfriend seems to like it so it will get used. For me personally I feel as though it is a decent exfoliation but I have been working on my skin for a long time so I am used to come close hurry us or things that are a bit more powerful. It feels like it leaves my skin feeling clean but doesn’t exfoliate or remove exactly what I want out of a refining & exfoliating mask!! Hardly no scent on any of the products I received on my influenster box. nan
