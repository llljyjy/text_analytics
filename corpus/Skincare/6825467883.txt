This cream really does work like magic. As I age, my skin becomes more easily irritated. So many products I have tried and once I apply them under my eyes, they start to burn. With magic cream, that doesnâ€™t happen to me. I will say this does contain a small amount of fragrance, so if you are sensitive, be careful. This cream works like a dream!
