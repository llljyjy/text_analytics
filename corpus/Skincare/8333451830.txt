By far, the best thing I’ve ever used for my dry, crusty, and dusty skin. I’ve tried a million different things as moisturizer and nothing ever helped me and my eternally irritated/ dry skin. I went away from this for a while because I didn’t know if this was the holy grail product in my routine and suffered the consequences. Never doing that again. Please… take the chance and try it. Even if you have oily skin, it’ll be a great mask! MY HOLY GRAIL FOR DRYNESS
