I would say this is a pretty good digestive pill. It works, and definitely prevents some bloating. I like how I only have to take one pill for this digestive versus three that I take with another brand! Iâ€™ve noticed more regular movements, and my stomach has been relatively flat throughout the day, which is nice. nan
