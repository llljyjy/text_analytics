I like this as a first step for taking off makeup at night. It is super simple to use, just rub between your hands to warm it up a bit and then rub it all over your face and rinse. It removed my light makeup, even mascara. On the days i wore heavier foundation it didnt remove as well. It did leave my face feeling a bit greasy so I followed up with the gel cleanser to get the remaining traces of makeup off. nan
