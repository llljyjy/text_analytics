I received this product free from influenster and shiseido in exchange for my honest review. This has quickly become one of my favorite SPF products. It is super hydrating and leaves your skin with a beautiful sparkle-free glow. Definitely don’t recommend this one for oily skin, but it will be a dry skin beauty’s best friend! It layers well over my other skincare products and wears well under makeup. No pilling as long as you let your skincare absorb before applying and let it absorb before makeup. It has a slight SPF scent, but in a fresh way, it’s not a heavy scent at all. No white cast. I love it as much as my other glowy SPF products, if not more because of how hydrating it is. This review is incentivized. amazing
