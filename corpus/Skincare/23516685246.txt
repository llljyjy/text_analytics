The product has an oily texture that turns white soapy once you start using it to remove makeup or cleanse your face. It does not have that slick weird oily feeling, so it feels great on the skin. It really removes all the impurities and even eye makeup. I like to spat a few pumps, and it is good to go. Must have for cleansing, and face wash.
