I wanted to try this free sample of Ilia C Beyond Triple Serum because I have sun spots on my face that darken a lot during the summer. I was also interested in trying a sunscreen that’s was a tinted serum and could also help my skin with other concerns other than just sun protection. I’ve been using it for a little over a month and can honestly say that it has protected my skin from further sun damage. The dark spots on my face have not darkened at all since using this  serum. When applying this serum, make sure you shake the bottle well for a few seconds to ensure the color pigments have blended with the serum. This product does not act as a foundation even though it has color. It has a very light coverage and will pill up a bit if not applied properly by patting it into your skin. The picture I took was from after using the serum after a month to show that the dark spots had not gotten any darker since starting the product. I like this serum, though I found that it doesn’t absorb as quickly as I’d hoped. I use about two drops on each side of my face and can still feel that my skin is a little greasy a couple hours later. Other than that, I found this to be a serum worth purchasing as it does brighten my skin a bit and works great for sun protection. Effective Sunscreen Serum
