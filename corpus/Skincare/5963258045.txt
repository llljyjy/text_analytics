I’m sorry but I don’t know what anyone likes with the actual product!! It is sooo THICK and heavy on the lips and stays that way even when you continue to rub your lips together and turns sticky after an hour. It’s so thick that there’s even a residue left after you wipe it off your finger. It legit smells like play dough and has a bad taste too! I only gave it 2 stars because the packaging is cool and chic. Thick Play-dough
