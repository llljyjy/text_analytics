First of all I just got very excited to know Iâ€™m going to try a Dior thing but after the first time use it was clear why Dior is Dior! The package is incredible, I liked the easy way to apply without getting the finger dirty, the consistency is great, the light fragrance is perfect! And the effect is just fantastic, I just felt my under eyes skin much more hydrated and did a lift effect too! nan
