I received this product free from Influenster for an honest review. I have been using Clinique skincare for many years and have loved the ones I normally use. This one was okay, but I didn’t love the texture as I felt it didn’t really moisturize, it more just sat on my skin. I do like that it’s unscented and I would also say it’s good for sensitive skin. I won’t be adding this product to my skincare routine. Not a great moisturizer
