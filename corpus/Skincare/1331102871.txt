I adore the results from this product but man you have to work to get them. The container always arrived half full which, even if it is the right measurement,  is a terrible marketing feature because you feel like you are getting less than what you purchased. Also, twice now I have received a bottle with a small amount of dark yellow gelatinous product in the bottom. Clearly it has dried up. And, of course, when trying to return it the Sephora employees are suspicious that I just dumped it into another jar. This last time I brought one to show what it should look like. You canâ€™t buy it in store and now I worry that it will happen again and I might have a harder time with the return. All in all, not the experience I expect when buying such a pricey product so I might keep looking. It does work well for fine lines though. nan
