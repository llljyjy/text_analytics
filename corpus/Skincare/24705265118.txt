I was gifted this product, but this review is my honest opinion! I was a bit nervous to try this product since I have sensitive skin and some exfoliants are too harsh, but I had no problems with this cleanser! I love that itâ€™s fragrance free, and it left my skin feeling clean and fresh. Works great with Sephora Collection cleansing brush! Surprisingly gentle + fragrance free
