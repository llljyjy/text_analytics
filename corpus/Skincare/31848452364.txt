I can’t imagine my life without a good SPF and this one from Laneige is amazing! I love its texture, it feels creamy and nourishing on the skin, but not heavy at all. I also love that it absorbs in seconds and doesn’tleave any white cast. Isn’t it amazing? I think someone with combo or oily skin can use it on its own, I have dry skin and prefer to use this sunscreen together with my moisturizer. And they work perfectly together.I received this product complimentary from Laneige. nan
