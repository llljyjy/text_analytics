When I first opened this product I must admit I was taken aback by the packaging. I usually never pay as much attention to packaging as I do the actual product.. but the sleek gold felt so good in my hand! I have been using this product for the past two weeks consistently and I can say that I definitely see a difference in my skin tone. I feel like it has evened out my complexion and I think lightened some pigmentation! Be warned that the formulation is more of a thick cream than a gel liquid but I love this about it. It felt very luxurious when applying and melted into my skin soon enough. I am going to get one of these for my mom. Thick and luxurious feel
