This moisturizer almost has a blurring effect. I havenâ€™t seen a reduction in my pores but I do feel like my pores a blurred when wearing which I like. It sits well on my combo oily skin and under makeup. Overall I like it and will continue to use! I received this item for free in exchange for honest review. Blurs your pores
