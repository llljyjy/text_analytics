Way to expensive, not worth the hype. Not suitable for sensitive skin. I have sensitive skin, for first few days my face was glowing after use but after that my face got red after every use. Doesn’t moisture your skin at all, just sits on the skin. I do not write reviews but don’t waste ur money. Too expensive - not worth the money!
