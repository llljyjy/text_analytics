I am perplexed at all the negative condiments on this product I have been dealing with dry under eyes for the last year and just using this product for a couple of days has completely getting rid of that creepiness under my eyes. I’m actually blown away by this product I haven’t tried it yet under my make up but when I rub it in I don’t have any peeling so I don’t know what the problem is maybe it’s their make up or sunscreen but if it changes in the future I will definitely update my review. Regardless if it peels or not I will still uses because the moisturizing that it gives me it’s like nothing I’ve ever used before, I have fallen completely in love with this product and it’s my first youth to the people product that I tried I received it I believe by using my points but will definitely be purchasing the full size once I ran out. And will also be picking up quite a few other products from this brand to see if I can find any other amazing gems within this company. I highly recommend trying this and if you do have issues with make up application afterwards just use it early in the morning let it soak in before applying anything else give it an hour or two and you shouldn’t have a problem. The stuff is amazing so glad I found it and will continue to use it from here on out. nan
