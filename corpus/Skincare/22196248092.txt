I’ve been wanting to test out niacinamide products more often and Merit’s Great Skin serum couldn’t have come at a better time! The serum’s texture was different than most I’ve tried in the past, but oh my goodness it made my skin feel so hydrated and smooth. I couldn’t believe how fast it worked, either. On the first day of using Great Skin, my skin looked amazing after application. I was a little caught off guard but I was impressed with how glowy my skin looked, especially since I have a busy lifestyle.I’ve only been using it for a week now but my skin feels so much smoother, brighter, and supple since then. It looks amazing with or without makeup, too! Definitely a serum I can see myself use again and again. Major LOVE for Great Skin
