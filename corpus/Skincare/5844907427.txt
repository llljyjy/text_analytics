The only product I’ve found that helps my rosacea. My aesthetician recommended it to me, because how many facials can you afford?  I can’t speak to the firming effect, because I use other products for that.  But for the first time in years my redness is greatly reduced - almost unnoticeable - so I’ll keep using it for that.  Hint: buy it in the combo pack; same price and you get the full sized serum as well as an eye cream (not useful for me) and night cream (also probably helping my redness). Works for my rosacea!
