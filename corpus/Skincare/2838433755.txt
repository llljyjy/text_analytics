I’ve struggled with my skin/acne since I was about 12 (I’m almost 30). I’ve tried a million different products but never really found anything that worked or wowed me. I’ve been using this serum for not even two weeks and the results have floored me to tears. My texture is already completely gone, my acne scars are fading and no new breakouts! My skin is so soft to boot. It’s a pricy product but worth every single penny. I can’t recommend this serum enough. Miracle Serum
