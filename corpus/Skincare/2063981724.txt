I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Dr Barbara Sturm in exchange for my honest opinion. This is a beautifully crafted hyaluronic acid serum. The bottle is sleek, you can see how much product is used, and the applicator is sturdy. I used this product twice a day for over a month, in AM and PM after washing my face and still having some water on my skin, this absorbed like a dream, and quickly. I noticed my skin felt softer, looked smoother and brighter, and no discoloration or abrasion from the harsh winter air or dry heat indoors. I followed this product with the brands moisturizer, and they complimented one another nicely- the ingredients are solid and the brand performs better than any other I’ve tried in the past 2 years- I like to dabble until I find favorite products :)I will continue to use this, but will have to save for repurchasing as it is much more costly than any other HA serum I’ve tried. Feels like bliss
