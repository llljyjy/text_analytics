This Confidence in a Cream has such an nice consistency and you donâ€™t need much because a little bit goes a long way. I use it as the last step of my day and night time skin care routine and I love the way that it makes my skin feel firm and provides a slight glow to my face. It is very hydrating and the packaging is nice as well. Moisturizing!
