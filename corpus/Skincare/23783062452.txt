Comfortable, and hydrating on my combination skin. And there was no irritation or breakouts. I did have to use more than the packaging recommended to feel like I was covered, and to be completely transparent, I do follow my moisturizer with a bit of oil as an extra bit of barrier protection so that kind of seals it in, and I donâ€™t know how it preforms long term without that. nan
