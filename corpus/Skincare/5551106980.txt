I was gifted this product and I was so stoked about it. I’ve previously used Tula’s Rose Glow + Get It Cooling & Brightening Eye Balm and I absolutely loved it. This product is super similar and I’m not sure which one I like more tbh - they are both cooling on contact which I love, lightweight with an extremely light scent. They go on super smooth and leave a great brightening dewy glow. Would highly recommend. Love.
