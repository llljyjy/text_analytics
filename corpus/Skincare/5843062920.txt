Was recommended this by a sephora employee and making pores appear smaller. It did a really good job of exfoliating. It left my skin soft and shiny. Some of my fine lines around my eyes look less prominent. The only bad thing is that it caused me to break out and my skin feels a bit dry.  I dont use a lot of skincare products so it may just be from adjusting to a new product. Not great for sensitive skin
