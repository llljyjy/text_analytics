I received samples of the Smart Clinical Repair products via #topbox #freeproduct to write this review. This was my absolute favourite product of the trio because it felt so delicious going on and my skin felt and looked suuuuper velvety after application. I typically use a retinol toner, which I skipped before applying this retinol serum- sometimes my toner can feel a little stingy, but this serum had no sting or tingle. I noticed over the next couple days that around my upper lip and eye area felt a little itchy, but I think that was because the retinol was effective, so I don’t consider it a downside. Because this was a sample size I wasn’t able to figure out how often I would use it in my skincare routine to maximize my results and minimize sensitivity, but I would love to incorporate this product into my ongoing skin care routine to figure it out... it just felt soooo good on my skin. nan
