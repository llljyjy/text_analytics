This is the first review I’ve written because I dislike this product so much. While I didn’t get the tingling/uncomfortable sensations that others have written about, the product is SO DRY AND THICK. It is nearly impossible to spread it on if your face is drying down and is just so uncomfortable because it will pull on your skin while you try and massage it into the skin. You cannot use this without a more slippy/hydrating product because unless your face is damp from water or something else it just is the worst experience to put it on. I think I bought this one after using another Inkey list vitamin C since this one was cheaper but that was a mistake. I am using it up because I don’t like wasting product and hating every minute of it and counting the days until I open my other Inkey List product. I honestly haven’t noticed any major difference so absolutely not worth any money. Spend the money on another Inkey List product.
