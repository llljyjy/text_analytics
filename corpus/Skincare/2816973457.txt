I received this balm complimentary and am I glad I did. This balm not only is a good brand but, it does what it states. My skin gets so dry in the winter but since trying this balm out, no dry tightness or flakes! My skin is so smooth and hydrated, I love it! A little goes a long way so the price is actually not bad at all. If you want smooth, supple skin then, this is for you. nan
