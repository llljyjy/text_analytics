I have been using this cleaner for years. It’s one of my absolute favorites. It cleanses well without stripping my skin or making it feel tight. It has a nice pleasant scent with a jelly-like texture. I like to lather it up well in my hands first before I go in to cleanse. In the years I’ve used it it has never broken me out. love it!
