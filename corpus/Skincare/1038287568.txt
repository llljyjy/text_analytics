I really liked this serum which I received as a #freeproduct sample from Topbox. I really like this serum. It spreads really well so a little goes a long way. I applied it before bed and in the morning, my enlarged pores in the t-zone were noticeably smaller after the first application. My skin looked so good, I didnâ€™t need to apply a tinted moisturizer. I will definitely be buying this serum. Great for enlarged pores
