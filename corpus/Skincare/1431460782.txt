I want to start off by saying I gave the 4/5 stars because the packaging is very confusingâ€¦ it comes in this tube that I found out later, can be removed. Its very lightweight this cream and I noticed after a few days it shrunk the pores with my nose! The price point is a bit steep in my opinion but the product glides on great and has no strong smell! I also noticed it helped balance oiliness with my face!I received this product for free from Influenster, however it did not sway my opinion! best pore shrinking cream
