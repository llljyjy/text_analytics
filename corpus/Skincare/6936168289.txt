No white cast!!! I was so impressed whit this new formula. I am brown and stopped using foundation because I feel more secure using face mask. But I hated the white cast from all the other sunscreens I have been using. I read in the reviews that was no white cast, so I needed to try it. I am so happy I tried. Since the summer is still here, and the formula says is moisturizer and has hyaluronic acid I skipped the moisturizer to give it a try. My skin feels ok. And since I have combination. I noticed my nose shiny. But that happen with all the moisturizers. I am happy whit this sunscreen/moisturizer that I will definitely buy it again. No White cast!!!
