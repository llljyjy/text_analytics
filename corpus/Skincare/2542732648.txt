I’ve never used this brand before so this kit was a great intro to four different products. I thought the cream was super small, but since you only need a pea sized amount, I believe it can last 1-2 weeks depending on how small of a pea size you use. The other products are a bit bigger so there’s definitely more use out of those. All of the products are travel sized friendly and have quite the cute packaging as well. As far as the actual products go, I didn’t find them as hydrating or moisturizing as I would like. With each product being such a high price point, I did expect a lot more so I was a bit disappointed. I’m glad I was able to try the trial kit before purchasing the full sized, but sadly I don’t think these products are for me. nan
