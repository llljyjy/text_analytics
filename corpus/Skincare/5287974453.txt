I received this box of toner pads from influenster as a free sample. I have never heard of Tula before receiving the sample. From what Iâ€™ve read, Tula is a clean beauty company that uses maybe superfoods in their products. This purifying toner pads did the trick with removing impurities deep within my skin. You can feel the ingredients working on your skin and the dirt on the pads. The only thing is you can feel the sticky film on your face after. I recommend using it before bedtime or it feels uncomfortable. I like the fact that the pads are biodegradable! Surprise
