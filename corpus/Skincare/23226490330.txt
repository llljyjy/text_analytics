I mainly used it for clogged pores and blackheads on my nose and chin. I saw a significant reduction in blackheads on my nose after first use. It did not absorb really well but I am only using it at night so it did not bother me. Also I have dry and sensitive skin. I saw some redness on my skin but no discomfort. Great for blackheads
