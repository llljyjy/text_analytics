It smells absolutely horrid- they really need to do something about that as 80% of the reviews have said that. It works okay I think, honestly I can’t bring myself past the smell. It smells like rotten and it’s so strong I have to try not to breathe while I use id. If the got rid of the terrible smell i’m sure it would be a better product Horrid smell
