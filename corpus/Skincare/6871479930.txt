I’ve been using this product twice a day for the past week and my skin looks and feels amazing! The scent is very pleasant and I enjoy using it. The only drawback was that I found the dispenser a bit too small for application and tend to screw the bottle open instead, which isn’t a big deal. Other than that love the glow and hydration it’s given my skin :) I received this product for free in exchange for a review. nan
