If you have never used a retinol before, this is a good first one to have. I did not experience any of the side effects that usually come from using retinol (irritating, itchiness, dryness, etc.). It also has niacinimide, which is a plus. However, this product is very expensive. If you have good insurance, I would recommend getting a retinol from a dermatologist, because it would be less expensive and more powerful than this one. If you cannot go to a dermatologist, then this is one is a good one to use. A good first retinol
