I was hosted this sample for my honest review, I can say, the cream does feel very luxe and moisturizing, however I cannot go into details regarding the fine line refining. I donâ€™t feel a week long use wi up of not produce results, that would require at least one full sized jar. I will say I used this every evening, and found it gives a radiant glow which does make the skin look great, because of the richness of the cream I chose not to use during the day (though the jar indicates you could) for the sake of my oily skin. After evening application I did not find I woke up oily. I did enjoy the feeling of my skin and the appearance was nice. I would buy :) Very nice
