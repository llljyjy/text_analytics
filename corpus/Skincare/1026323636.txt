The first time I tried it I did not like it. I was also using an AHA my aesthetician has me using and they did not mix well. My face felt super sticky. But then I tried it without the AHA and also with the AHA but really allowing 5 minutes or so to absorb and it feels really nice. I have combo (more on the dry side specially in winter) skin but super thick creams still create some shine. This one moisturized really well and absorbed well. I have been using it for over a month and I really like it. I am glad I gave it additional tries outside of my first experience so make sure you do too if it didnâ€™t workout really well. nan
