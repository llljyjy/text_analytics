I received the Tula Skincare Beauty Sleep Overnight Repair Treatment complimentary from Influenster for my honest review.  I really like the container and the dispensing system - it keeps the cream fresh and prevent contamination. And the cream - I think it’s a good moisturizer. I didn’t get any irritations from using this product (I have been having more skin issue for a past year or so, and it’s important for me that skincare products do not cause issue with my skin). nan
