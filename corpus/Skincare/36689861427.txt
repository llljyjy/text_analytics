I’ve used this lip mask for about a week so I could write a trustworthy review for those looking to buy this product! I have sensitive dry skin for reference. The product wasn’t irritating thankfully! This lip mask was very moisturizing to my lips but when washed off it felt very sticky, and not just on my lips; on my fingers too. The moisture from the lip mask does last long, but don’t expect it to be a replacer for a lip balm; I’d recommend applying your fav lip balm after washing the lip mask off. It’s a okayish lip mask, but I don’t think it’s worth buying because of the stickiness. nan
