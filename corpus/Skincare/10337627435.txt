I’ve received it as a free product to test in the Influenster programI am a fan of Make-up removing oils and balms. I really wanted to love this product but it is such a disappointment. The packaging looks good (big plus for a mirrored lid- great to see if product did the job when you are in the shower ) but you actually need to dig your hands and nails in it which makes it very messy, especially that this one contains charcoal. Would rather prefer liquid oil with a pump or if they would at least include a scooper in this packaging. I’ve tested many balms and oils and this one is very mid quality for me. You need to use a lot as the product seems a bit “dry” and your REALLY need to get in in there to remove mascara and eyeliner. It took me 2 tries to get my makeup off which doesn’t happen with my regular oil. I would not recommend it There are way better products on the market
