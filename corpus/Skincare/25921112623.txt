The texture and consistency of this is great and makes my skin feel super hydrated after using this. I previously used another vitamin c that burned and had an unfavorable consistency and would pill with my sunscreen. I can’t speak to the long term results as I’ve only been using it a couple days but I am super hopeful and will update with results! For the price point I think the amount of product you get is a really good value. nan
