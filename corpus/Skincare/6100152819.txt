My skin is sensitive, sometimes it’s a little bit dry. It helps with my redness but in some parts that I have dry skin, I saw that I need a little bit more of moisture. I’ve notice that helps to minimize the appearance of my pores and I like that.If you have sensitive skin and you don’t like fragrance or essentials oils be careful. I think I’m going to use this one as a makeup primer! So I can give it a good use.I would recommend this for people with combination or oily skin. nan
