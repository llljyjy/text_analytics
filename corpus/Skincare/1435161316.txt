WOW! This new formula of the coconut lip balm is horrible. I used to use the old formula (MY FAV) under my liquid lipsticks to help keep my lips moisturized and the old formula didn’t mess up the liquid lips. But this formula is hard, waxy, sticky and doesn’t make my lip feel moisturized but flakey and dry.  Sephora shouldn’t have changed something that was working great. Sephora please change back. It took me so long to find the perfect lip balm! Extremely disappointed. Why Sephora? Extremely Disappointed
