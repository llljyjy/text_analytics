I really liked this product. It feels like a gel moisturizer, it goes on very smoothly, but absobrs into your skin very quickly. It doesnt leave your skin feeling tacky or oily. It has a very faint scent, but i quite like it. My skin feels really soft after applying this, but i do have really dry skin and i find myself having to apply a heavier moisturizer on my driest spots. Overall i really like it nan
