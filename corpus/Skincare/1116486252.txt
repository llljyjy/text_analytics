I received the Clinique smart clinical repair wrinkle correcting rich cream from Influenster exchange for my honest review. I would definitely need to use this longer to present conclusive findings but I like it. This formula is like a gel cream which works for my combination / oily skin. Here’s what I noticed in using this product, my skin appeared to have more of a taut look under my eyes. I don’t have heavy wrinkles but definitely the start of some and it seemed to pull things back into place. I would not say that your wrinkles will be banished if you use  this product but you will see noticeable improvement in the firmness of your skin. I will get the full sized product to test this longer,  it so far I like how it leaves my skin looking and feeling smooth.This paraben free formula is good. You’re on to something
