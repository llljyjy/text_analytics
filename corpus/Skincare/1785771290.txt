This is an amazing moisturizer.  The texture is so smooth and light that you may think it will be lightweight when it comes to moisture but it hydrates your skin so well and leaves such a nice and plump feeling. I have combo skin so for day use, I have to use very little so I donâ€™t get too greasy. Very subtle scent. Amazing ingredients,  beautiful packaging.  Really leaves your skin hydrated and looking healthy. nan
