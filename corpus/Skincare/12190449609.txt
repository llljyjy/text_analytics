I am in love with this product. I received this after coming home from getting sunburnt at a football game (the one time I forgot to use SPF) and my face felt like tanned leather. I started using this, and it’s gentle enough that it didn’t irritate my sunburned areas at all and I honestly think it’s speeding up the healing process a bit (I’m also moisturizing like crazy). It’s day 3 since I got burnt and my face is already almost back to normal. I can’t wait to see what this does on not-sunburned skin! This rescued my sunburnt face
