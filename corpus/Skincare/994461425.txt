I have hereditary dark circles that are nasty. No other eye cream has done anything despite claims of helps with dark circles. Not. Ren is the FIRST product where after about 7-10 days I noticed a difference and I usually donâ€™t may much attention because nothing has ever helped. I only wish I would have taken a before photo! nan
