I was gifted this moisturizer by the Sephora Collection brand and I thought it would be a great fit because the winter always makes my skin so dry.  I tried it the day of when it came in the mail and I was shocked at how moisturizing it is! It leaves my skin feeling super bouncy and hydrated. Its my 3rd day of using as an AM moisturizer and I’m in love. It also works as a great base before wearing concealer or foundation. I’m always on the lookout for clean and cruelty-free/Vegan skincare, and this one really knocked it out of the park. Skincare doesn’t have to be expensive to be good quality!! Super Hydrating//Great as a base for makeup
