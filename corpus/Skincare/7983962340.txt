I’ve tried so many hyaluronic acid from different popular brands, and this one from Dermalogica didn’t disappoint (gifted by Dermalogica)! I like how runny the texture is and how it didn’t feel sticky upon application on my dry skin. It spreads easily with my toner and my skin felt so supple the whole day! My skin felt so supple!
