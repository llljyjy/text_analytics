I’m so surprised I’m loving this as much as I am! I’m not a fan of rose scents but this is a very pleasant and light smell. I’ve used this as a refreshing facial mist and as setting spray and it more than exceeded my expectations. Ive never had a bottle with such a fine perfect mist! The bottle itself is just beautiful too. This was my first ever Gucci product and it definitely did not disappoint. Ill be purchasing this in the future for myself and maybe some loved ones for a gift. Loving it!
