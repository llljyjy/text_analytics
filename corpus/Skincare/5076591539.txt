I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review and I chose this retinol stick as retinol is one of my absolute favorite skincare products. I love this stick and how fast and easy it is to apply the product. I love it. Since this formula uses encapsulated retinol, Ive had no issues with any irritation or dry skin using this. I love how dewy and healthy this retinol makes my skin, like I just a applied a nice, light serum. It’s definitely keeping my skin super smooth, soft and even. I have no complaints! I’d definitely recommend this product to anyone new to retinol or anyone searching for a good retinol. Love it
