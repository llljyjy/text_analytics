Love this moisturizer. My skin was getting flaky this winter. The sales person recommended this moisturizer. It is silky and luxurious. My skin has loved it. I am having trouble with the press down dispenser not giving me a full amount after a week of using it. With the screw of cap, I may need to change how I get the product out. But I liked the portioned amount and not touching the full container Great moisturizer
