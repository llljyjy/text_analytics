This product didn’t correct any wrinkles that I noticed, but it is a nice moisturizing formula that goes on smooth, doesn’t pill under makeup, has very little scent and keeps the eye area moisturized. It doesn’t leave a sticky tacky feeling like some other moisturizers do. I thoroughly  enjoyed it. nan
