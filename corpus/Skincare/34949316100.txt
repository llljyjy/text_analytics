I decided to splurge on this product and was impressed with how good it made my skin look and feel. I ran out a few days ago and have noticed a huge difference in how dry it is so I repurchased - only took off a star because it didnâ€™t last as long as I was hoping since the size of the container is a bit misleading (about 2.5 months) nan
