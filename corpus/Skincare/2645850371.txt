I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review in addition to the Belif Aqua Bomb. Personally, this one was my favorite as it felt more deeply moisturizing and my skin felt hydrated from the time I applied it before bed until I did again the following night. I live in Colorado and winters here are DRY so this is the perfect solution for me. I have very sensitive skin and surprisingly I didn’t experience any breakouts from this product and I liked that it didn’t have a heavy scent. I will definitely be buying the full size. dry skin savior for Colorado winters
