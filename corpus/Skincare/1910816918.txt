I got this to have the lightest possible coverage so as not to irritate my acne. Unfortunately, I’m also using heavy duty retinoids for said acne which are already drying me out. I love the look of this product when it first goes on but by the end of the day it seems to exacerbate my peeling issue and the pale flakiness makes me look like the terminator. It’s not convenient for me to wash it off and reapply mid day. I would say it does it’s job if you have oily skin but for the price point it should have a little longer wear imo Works great!…for the first few hours.
