This worked well for my skin, I was 2 months postpartum and my skin had been THROUGH it with all of the hormonal pregnancy changes. I was extremely dry, itchy, flaky, & it hurt. This was recommended to me in store and after the first use my skin started to “cool down”. I’m still using it and it offers a great first layer of hydration, I struggle with very very dry skin so no matter what I’m using I always need 2-3 layers of moisturizing. The colour or smell wasn’t a bother for me at all. The only downside is the cost, but it has lasted way longer that I thought it would because it’s in such small packaging but I still have it, a dab goes a long ways. Works great for dry flaky irritable skin.
