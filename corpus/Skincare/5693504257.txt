I received this eye cream for free for testing purposes. I haven’t ever used an eye cream before so I didn’t have anything to compare it to but I really liked this one. It’s very light and it made the skin around my eyes very soft and my skin felt refreshed. I noticed a decrease in the dark circles around my eyes and the sunken look after a few uses. I would buy again. nan
