My first bottle of this is nearly out, so it lasted me about 9-10 weeks with an application every night. Love the texture and feel of it, but for $100 post-tax, I don’t think it’s worth it. I took a before and after picture, and personally I don’t see a difference. I was really hoping it would address the fine lines coming in and my dark circles, or at least the bit of dryness on my outer corner, but I see no real change like others have. Not saying it’s bad, just not for me.About my face: 31, only wash my face and put on moisturizer daily, with sunscreen when I remember. Rarely wear makeup. Nice texture, but false promises
