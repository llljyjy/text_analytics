I really wanted to love this but it did not pair with my skin care at all. I use Sunday Riley products and the new CEO moisturizer in the morning. I let the moisturizer soak into my skin for 30 minutes before applying the silk canvas and it was pilling like crazy. I tried also patting it in in another try but my foundation still looked horrible /: Pilled too much
