I have used this product a couple weeks now and I love it! The texture is creamy and feels very hydrating when applying. It gives the skin a healthy glow and seriously stays on the skin all night. See the last pic for a comparison on the skin (left hand has cream, right has nothing). I feel like coming off when I wash my face the next morning, so I know it replenished my skin. It has a nice smell, but would prefer it to be fragrance free. The packaging is very luxurious and feels good quality. I use this as the last step in my nightly skincare routine and would highly recommend. Repairs all night long
