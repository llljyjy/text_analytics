Love everything about this product besides one issue. I love the applicator, the formula, the wear, the hydration, and that it’s refillable. That being said, BEWARE. I have lash extensions and this caused me to have so much more fall out than normal. I will have to do some research to determine which ingredient is causing it. But when I put it on at night, the next morning I’ve had so many lash extensions fall out. Other than that, it’s great. I just try not to touch my lash extensions to the product and now only use it in the morning. Great product, but BEWARE
