I would like to have received a larger sample in order to see everything this product can do. I preferred to use this at night, as it was a bit sticky on my face. It soaked in and made my skin feel extremely soft. I wasnâ€™t a big fan of the scent. It was a bit too florally for me. Overall, I give it a 3, with the possibility of a 4. Solid Product!
