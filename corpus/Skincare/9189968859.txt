I was really hoping I’d fall in love with this product since my past experience with Laneige has always been extremely good. Unfortunately this moisturizer just wasn’t it. I found it to be extremely light weight and after not even 10 minutes of application my skin feels dry again. It definitely does not reach the amount of hours it claims to keep your skin hydrated at least for me personally. The packaging is cute and simplistic but the product itself wasn’t really worth the price point for me. not my favorite
