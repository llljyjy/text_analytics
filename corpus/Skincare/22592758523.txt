I am a die hard Tatcha fan and I was excited to try this product as I already use the deep cleanse, deep rice polish, water cream, peony eye cream and the silk cloth. Unfortunately the texture tonic caused me to break out more than I every have in my life - including my teen years. Although I know skin can take some time to adjust to a new product, considering it took 5 days for my skin to clear up, I didnâ€™t want to take the chance. Disappointed
