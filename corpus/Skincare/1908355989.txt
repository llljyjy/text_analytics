I received this product for free in exchange of a review. The texture is light and smooth. It spreads easily on the face and doesn’t feel sticky after the application. It moistures my skin well. The scent isn’t too appealing, but it dissipate after a while. Thank goodness for that. I haven’t seen a difference yet on my very little fine lines that I have, but it’s only been 2 weeks that I’ve been using this serum day and night. The pump is great since you don’t contaminate the product with the hands and bacteria will not go into it. I tend to buy skin products that are “clean“ since I have sensitive skin. This product isn’t cheap so I expected a lot from it especially at $99. Tula deep wrinkles
