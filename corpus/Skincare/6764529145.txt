This is real bad on my dry bare skin because you can’t spread it around or rub it in. But genuinely THE BEST to reapply sunscreen in the heat/when sweating or swimming. It doesn’t get in my eyes or cause breakouts either. And because it’s mattifying, there is no greasy or heavy feel. I’ve repurchased several times. Best For Reapplying In Heat
