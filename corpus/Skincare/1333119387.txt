I recieved this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I really enjoyed this moisturizer.  I have oily skin and a lot of moisturizers leave me feeling and looking extra oily throughout the day, but I did not have that problem with this one!  It’s a nice, thick cream, but it has a smooth consistency, so it goes on super smooth and leaves my skin feeling silky soft.  Unlike most moisturizers I’ve tried, this absorbs really well, so it doesn’t feel like it’s just sitting on my skin all day.  With other moisturizers containing SPF, my skin feels like it can’t breathe, but this one felt amazing and I had no issues with that.  It has a light, pleasant scent to it, too.  The only thing I would change about it is adding more sun protection, like increasing it to at least SPF 30.  But other than that, I absolutely loved it and would definitely recommend it. Great Moisturizer!
