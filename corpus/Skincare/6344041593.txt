I don’t get how anybody lighter than a chocolate bar is saying this has a white cast. I am a dark skinned Jamaican woman and this blends into my skin within 10 minutes of application. On the bottle it tells you to wait 15 minutes before sun exposure. By that time it is undetectable. There is no obnoxious scent and it is not greasy. This is the first Zinc Oxide sunscreen I’ve used that delivers on every level, specifically no white cast. You need to take your time and thoroughly rub this in. Black girl friendly
