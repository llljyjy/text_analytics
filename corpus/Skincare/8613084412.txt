I really don’t get the bad reviews this is one of my favourite moisturizers just ordered a second bottle.  I did not notice any smell and my skin has looked so much healthier since using and little bumps on forehead are gone.  The price is so good too I would say try it yourself and make a decision i struggle with my skin absorbing cream moisturizers but it being water based, doesn’t have that problem nan
