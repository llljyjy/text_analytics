I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion!The sample I received was enough for 7 days.  That was long enough for me to determine it’s a great serum and my skin loved it.  I cannot afford to pay regular price for this item but would definitely purchase on a good sale.  I used it at night before bed.  I applied it after cleansing and toning and before my moisturizer.  It smells really nice, almost like maybe a nice tea scent.  Not sure how to explain it but I liked the smell.  The serum is a 2 in one (dual) so you mix them together in your hand and apply it to your face.  It went on really smoothly and wasn’t sticky feeling.  The next morning my face felt really soft.  I can definitely say that after 7 days my skin felt smoother, looked more radiant and generally felt nice.  I would have no problem recommending to others. I can’t see any negatives about the product quality at all.  I like the fact that it contains turmeric and has 21 plant extracts. Another bonus is that it comes in recyclable packaging.  Thank you so much for the opportunity to try! A very luxurious serum!
