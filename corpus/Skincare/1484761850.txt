Not sure how well this will moisturize yet because I cannot get past the smell.The packaging is great! Really nice floral pattern on the cylinder container. And,the bottle is very very nice too.BUT, the smell of the product is hard to describe. It’s a plastic smell, or a car wires kinda smell, not anything enjoyable at all. I will keep using it because it feels good (so far).But no way would I buy this again because of the weird industrial plastic smell.Lotion smells I prefer:Kiehl’s (multi-corrective cream)Tatcha (overnight repair)Origins (Original skin) Weird Smell
