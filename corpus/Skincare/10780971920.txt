I was thrilled to be able to test out the ultra facial cream by Kiehl’s. It was on my list of moisturizers to try out as I was looking for a winter moisturizer. My skin gets very dry in the winter so I was looking for something to help with that. This moisturizer was great for my skin as it made my skin smooth like butter. I was pleasantly surprised that this moisturizer didn’t make my skin oily but just left it feeling refreshed. I will definitely be adding this moisturizer to my normal routine. If you are looking for a product to make your skin feel moisturizer and refreshed I highly recommend trying out this product. You will not be disappointed. nan
