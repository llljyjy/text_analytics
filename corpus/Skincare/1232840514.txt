This cleanser smells sooooooo good, i want to eat it! It’s a great way to inspire me to wash my face because I just want to smell that deliciousness and have my face smell so yummy! It also works rather well! i only use this as a cleanser, not as a makeup remover, so i can’t attest to its makeup removing abilities. It does leave my skin super soft and just lovely in general. as others have mentioned, the twist top isn’t ideal but i believe it can be removed for recycling purposes & if it can be removed, there’s hope of getting most all the product out.One thing i noticed when going through reviews is that some people don’t love the scent. They say ‘no scent is better’ - I wholeheartedly disagree! I don’t like using nasty smelling or suspiciously non-scented products. There’s so much in a scent and the scent that’s part of this cleanser makes me want to wash my face in those lazy moments when i’d rather just use micellar water. Fenty team/Rihanna, if you do decide to revisit the formula to make a non-scented version for sensitive skinned/nosed people, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE keep this original scented version! Honestly, it’s the main reason i came on here to review. I’d wear it as a perfume if i could! Super impressed✨ SO GOOD
