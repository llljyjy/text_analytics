Really nice sunscreen. Great under foundation if you want that little extra glow (not glittery!). Can also be worn alone. I have sensitive skin and have not had any issues with this in terms of breakouts or other irritation.The only reason I took away one star is that if you are wearing under foundation, I feel like you have to work fast, else this gets a little sticky. Maybe I was just hoping for more of the texture of the Supergoop Unseen Screen which is one of my all time faves. glowy not glittery
