Haven’t found an all around good moisturizer like this one for years. It’s the perfect consistency. It doesn’t feel greasy at all. Very hydrating. Softens my skin nicely. Pairs well with other products. I really like the applicator as it outputs the right amount every time without wasting product. Perfect Moisturizer
