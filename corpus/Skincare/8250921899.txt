Unfortunately, this pills with any tinted moisturizer or foundation I apply afterwards and it does feel as though it sits on top of the skin without fully absorbing. I will say though, that I did notice brighter skin when I was using this. If it didnâ€™t pill/feel tacky, I might really enjoy it. Perhaps it is just not compatible with my skin. nan
