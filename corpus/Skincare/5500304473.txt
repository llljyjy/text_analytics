I’ve been using this for a little bit now and I think their is a surprisingly good moisturizer. I saw some improvement in the short term I’ve been using it and for a tired new mom that may or may not be difficult. It’s not overly expensive and smells really nice. It’s not floral which is a great difference to a lot of skincare Smells nice
