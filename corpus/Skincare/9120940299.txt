This is my guilty pleasure. I’m fairly minimal when it comes to my skin and while I know oil isn’t necessary, this is my favorite facial oil of all time!! It feels so lux and hydrating. Knocked a star off because it is pricey/not a necessary step but it’s so good. Probably the only facial oil I’ll repurchase nan
