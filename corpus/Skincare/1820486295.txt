This is a much needed addition to the GR family. The blueberry cleanser is too drying for winter and I donâ€™t always feel like double cleansing so skip the papaya. This one is great. Gentle enough for my sensitive acne prone skin while still effectively cleansing. No offensive scent. Would definitely recommend! Much needed addition
