I have recently started to use this product in my AM and PM routines and have been loving it. I wear a mask at work in a hospital for my whole shift and have been finding my skin was getting dry spots that would hurt and get itchy.  Since adding this product to my daily skincare I find that my skin is hydrated for a long period of time and I have less irritation for mask wearing.  I also really like that is doesnâ€™t leave my skin feeling greasy and has a light fresh smell to it. @dermalogicacanada, @sephoracanada, #giftedbydermalogica hydration!!!
