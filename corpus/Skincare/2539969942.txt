I received this product free from Influenster for my honest review.  I really love this product!  It doesnâ€™t have any scent, which is wonderful for my sensitive nose.  A little bit goes a long way, so it will last awhile.  It is smooth and makes my skin feel soft.  I experienced no breakouts at all while using this moisturizer, which surprised me with my sensitive skin - I usually always breakout when trying new products, but with this, I had no issues.  The same of this product line was easy to use and got me into a better skin care routine and I notice a difference in my skin.  I love it and I would recommend giving it a try! nan
