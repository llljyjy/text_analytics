I am new to retinols, and I was so excited to try the Drunk Elephant serum! This formula is so mild that it doesn’t irritate my dry, sensitive skin. I use it 1-2 times a week before bed, and I wake up with soft, supple skin! I haven’t noticed a crazy difference with the fine lines I’m stating to see, but I do love the formula and how smooth the texture of my skin is after using. Definitely a staple in my skincare routine. LOVE!
