I was so excited GR came out with an SPF. I wanted to love it. But every single time I use it it PILLS like you would not believe! The smell is nice, it’s very light weight and doesn’t make me look greasy like my other sunscreens, but the pilling is so bad. I put 2 fingers worth on like I normally do. Maybe that’s too much? I’m going to keep experimenting and trying with this SPF because it wasn’t cheap and it makes my skin look nice. a little disappointed
