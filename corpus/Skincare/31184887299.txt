I didn’t notice any difference at all. The consistency is nice however that’s about the only good thing. With regard to the effects on dark circles/puffiness I can confirm that instead of getting rid of them it causes them! I have dark circles but not puffiness (normally) I now have both. Further to this, it has also made my eye area look tired, dehydrated and resembling crepe paper with all the fine lines. nan
