I have dry skin and was dealing with age spots as I just had a baby. I noticed my skin tighten and the age spots lighten just enough to notice a difference after daily use for 2 weeks. I also noticed a reduction in redness. I think a combo of PTR products of the pads and serum really made a difference. Improved skin post partum
