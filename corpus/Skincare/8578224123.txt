This is my new favorite sunscreen!!! Loving the mineral non fragrance formula.This is one of the sunscreen on the market with the most clean ingredients also rated on Yuka 100/100 made without Nanoparticles! Love the  smooth lightweight texture, and it gives you the hydration you need through out the day without making your skin oily.I’m exposed to sun all the time so for me it’s really important for sunscreen to last all day and so far once I apply this in the morning on top of my moisturizer I’ve yet never got a sunburn or redness.TRULY IMPRESSED def my go to sunscreen now Literally love this product !!!
