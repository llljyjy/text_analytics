Wanted to love but unfortunately a big no. There are better mineral sunscreens out there for half the price. Goes on smoothly at first, but after drying down, it becomes a flaky piling mess. Doesn’t blend well with any of my skin care or make up. Just makes my skin look flaky and I want to rub it all off. Disappointing product. Flaky and doesn’t blend well with skincare/makeup
