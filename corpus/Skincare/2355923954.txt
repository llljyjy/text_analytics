My skin is combination and has concerns pigmentation, aging spot, wrinkles. I wasn’t familiar with “TFC8“ but this means a compound amino acids, vitamins and synthesized molecules. I’ve already using some serums that has amino acids and vitamins for a long time and it works well on my skin so I was thrilled to try this light cream. The texture was lightweight and seems good for summer or the person who has oily skin. No perfume, fast absorbing, no sticky feeling so it works great under makeup and sunscreen.  I used this every night after my skincare routine and i found my skin is still hydrating next morning. It’s still little expensive but if you are looking for premium products this suits you very well. Especially if you are type of a girl who use la mer during winter time, this one is good alternative for summer. Great for normal to oily skin
