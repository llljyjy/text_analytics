I love the ingredients in this product, as well as the scent and texture. Unfortunately I have very dry skin and itâ€™s just not moisturizing enough for me. It sinks in very fast and leaves a tight feeling on my face. It was nice to use before makeup application as it sinks in quickly and leaves an almost matte finish to the skin. I would recommend this moisturizer for oily skin! I love the quality and ingredients so I am interested in trying other products from this brand. nan
