I’ve struggled with finding a good exfoliant for my face. Sugar scrubs would be too inconsistent and AHA serum didn’t seem to work well for me. This toner works great for me and is gentle on my skin. My face is the smoothest it’s been and I will keep it in my routine. As others have mentioned, the pump is a bit fussy - took me a lot of pumps upon initial use to get it going. I haven’t had any issues as long as I keep it upright to dispense. Gentle yet effective toner
