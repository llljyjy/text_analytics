It does the job! You will see it drying out the pimples in a couple of hours! I get occasional pimples here and there, sometimes more severe sometimes not so much. I have been using this for the past month whenever I see them pop up - for the smaller pimples it took 1-3days to go for the bigger ones it took a week-week and a half. So depending on your severity the longer it takes which is expected so I wouldnâ€™t give up on the product too quickly because you will see positive results! It works!
