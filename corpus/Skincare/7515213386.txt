Yea, I don’t love that it pills up so badly on my skin.. also it’s got like this fine gritty texture when you’re applying it and it feels like it’s exfoliating which is too much for daily use. Also, when i first got it, it used to sting, which I read is normal, but I took a break and now it doesn’t sting anymore so it’s probably not very potent anymore. Because I can’t use it everyday, i cant use it consistently enough to see if it’s even making a difference in my skin. Not going to repurchase. Nope
