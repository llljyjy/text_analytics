Slushy has been a miracle product for me! I have sensitive skin and have a really hard time being able to use Retinol products. The bakuchiol in this is a retinol alternative that actually doesn’t bother my skin! I haven’t seen any irritation, flakiness, redness, etc. while using this product. What’s also amazing is that it’s super hydrating and layers so well under my makeup! I’ve noticed brighter, more even + hydrated looking skin from Slushy. I could not recommend this enough. the best thing ever
