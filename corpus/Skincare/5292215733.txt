After trying a few other eye creams, this is the oneee!!! I absolutely love it! I’m on my 3rd bottle and only use it on days my eyes need that extra help (sometimes its daily lol) but a little goes a long way. It smells really great too, and really helps depuff my eyes and helps with fine lines and dark circles. I have super sensitive skin, and have had reactions to other eye creams (specifically those with retinol) but this one feels great and luckily it really worked for me. So far I really love all the fresh products I’ve tried! this is the one for me!!
