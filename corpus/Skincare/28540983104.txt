I was very impressed with this eye cream. The first time I used it I saw results and I was amazed. I used it over night i and woke up and my under eyes looked rested and fresh. But when I used it during the day, and I am not sure this was me not using the product correctly, the eye cream seem to make my eyes cry. Like throughout the day I guess with the wind or sweat this will end up in my eyes somehow. So if you live in a humid area, hot, or windy maybe don’t wear it during the day. Besides that I really like this eye cream it’s a good size and the packaging is great! The pump seems to give a little too much product then I need. But this works and I recommend it. I received this product for free from Influenster and drunk elephant in exchange for my honest review. I love it and it really works
