I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. I have dry and sensitive skin and liked this product. It hydrated my skin and was great as a primer underneath my makeup. It is easy to blend in, has a light bubblegum scent, and is refreshing. I also like that the packaging is reusable! Great Pick!
