*I received this product free for honest review from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury.*I was excited to try this product, but ultimately, I wasn’t very impressed. Here are my thoughts on the Charlotte Tilbury Magic Eye Rescue cream.*Beautiful glass packaging. I appreciate that it is refillable, although the refills aren’t much cheaper than the full package.*It’s a tub, which I know some people don’t like (but it didn’t bother me).*I don’t detect a strong added fragrance, but it does have a pleasant scent.*Kind of a thicker consistency for the under-eye area, needs to be dabbed on, because I could feel a bit of tugging on my under-eye skin if swiped on.*If any of this product got in my eyes, it made them sting and water (which made even more product migrate into my eyes, which made them sting more). *Takes a little while to absorb, but it felt moisturizing and I didn’t notice any issues applying makeup over it. Moisturizing but made my eyes sting
