I love this! I start with the Laneige Cream Skin Toner, then mix this with the Drunk Elephant B-Hydra Intensive Hydration Serum. I let it dry for a few minutes, then follow up with the First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream! Ive been using this serum with these products for almost three years now and my skin is clear, except during that time of the month. This is kind of a ridiculous price, and I am on the hunt for a vitamin c that also exfoliates, but I haven’t found anything yet. I have extremely sensitive skin that burns if I use the wrong thing, and this doesn’t irritate my skin. It gives me such a beautiful and healthy glow. This really works for me and helps not only combat my acne, but it also brightens my skin! nan
