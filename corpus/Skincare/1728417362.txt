This sleeping mask is absolutely wonderful. I tried it a few years back when the original one first came out, and I think they have improved it immensely. My skin is normal/dry- especially dry with the colder weather, and this has been saving me from any dry patches. It has a beautiful light scent, that does dissipate once it sinks into the skin. It doesn’t leave my face feeling heavy, sticky or tight like some masks can. It’s lightweight when applied and once it sinks in both upon application and once completely dried. It doesn’t irritate my eyes- I even use it underneath my eye area and it helps give some added moisture. About a quarter size covers my face, neck and ears. It comes wi the an applicator that gets enough product but also cleans well. I put this on every night before bed after my night moisturizer and when I wake up my face is soft, smooth and hydrated. It has not broke me out at all. I also enjoy that in the A.m. my face doesn’t feel like it has to be washed (no sticky or greasy feeling)Overall, I really enjoy this and recommend to anyone who needs a bit of extra moisture. It’s beautiful to apply and leaves your skin feeling and looking fresh/glowy.#freeproduct #trywithtopbox #laniege #dreamskin A beautiful sleeping mask
