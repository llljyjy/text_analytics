I received this product complementary in exchange for my honest review. The sample I received was very small so I wouldnâ€™t be able to say if the product truly does all of what it claims however from my experience I loved it. The formula is thicker than most toners, it has a great mild smell and it works well with oily skin too. I have combination skin and work a fast paced job outside so now that the weather is warmer I tend to sweat and get oily more. The days I used this toner my face was less oily and had more brightness to it. I would definitely recommend it. Brighter and less oily
