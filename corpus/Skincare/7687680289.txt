If you have $80 that you’re just itching to get rid of, maybe this product is for you. Sure, it was hydrating for thirty seconds after I first applied it, but for any amount of time after, my face was just as tight, dry, and flakey as it was before. So I was left feeling like I shouldn’t have even bothered putting the stuff on in the first place. I had no difference in “plumpness.“ I guess if you know these ingredients work for you and your skin concerns, and you’re absolutely desperate, try it? But I honestly can’t tell you that this was even a good product at all. Doesn’t do anything. Smells nice though! nan
