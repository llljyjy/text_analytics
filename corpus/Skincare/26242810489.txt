I thoroughly liked this cleanser so much. It lathered very well and I didn’t need to use much product to get a good clean. The texture is very nice and creamy, so it feels gentle on the skin. It didn’t strip my skin of hydration as other cleansers have. I also enjoyed it at night as well as when I woke up in the morning. This cleanser is gentle but its work is mighty. Gentle but Mighty!!
