I’m really disappointed that they changed the colors with the reformulation. I still like the feel and coverage, but compared to Light Medium of the old BB it’s a LOT more yellow. It’s hard finding creams with pink undertones and I have to work at too hard to make this work on my skin. Too yellow compared to old formula
