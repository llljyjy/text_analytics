All skin types are different. It is very hard for me to find a moisturizer that actually hydrates and doesn’t have that shiny look to it. I love this product as a daytime moisturizer. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for that matte look and during warm humid months. It doesn’t cause extra breakouts and is light. I wear a more hydrating moisturizer at night due to the fact that I work in cold conditions all year long. But, if you have oily skin and congested pores, this product is a winner.
