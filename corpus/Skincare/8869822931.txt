I keep this cleanser in my rotation. I have dry skin so I can’t use this daily, however I find that it works well for my rosacea. If I use it more than 3 times a week I get dry spots on my chin. I just use a dime-size drop and leave it on my face while I brush my teeth, but it does take some work washing it off. Overall, I’m really happy with the product and will continue to buy it. Good for rosacea
