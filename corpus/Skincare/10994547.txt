I have very noticeable discoloration on my cheekbones. Iâ€™ve tried many products hoping to reduce the dark pigment on my skin. Nothing has worked. I decided to try the trial side of topicals and noticed a difference the next day. My only issue is the smell. It stinks and lingers all night. The scent is similar to perm solution, but the results are worth it so far! Pleasantly Surprised
