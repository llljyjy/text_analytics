I received this product for free from Influenster to try and give my honest review.  I like the idea of this being a mess free way to apply an eye product. You don’t have to dip your fingers into the product to apply it which is great. I feel like this product would be best for this who are younger and don’t have many eye area concerns. When applied it gives a bit of a pearly glow but does not personally do much for me other than that. It glides on smoothly with no tugging which was a nice plus too. I wasn’t amazed by how my under eye looked. To me it was just OK. I also did not notice the cooling sensation as the name suggests, but that’s just me. It has a bit of a balmy feel which gives it some slip. Not overly moisturizing to the point you can’t apply makeup on top. Overall it got 3 stars from me. I would say if you want just a little peek for your eyes this would be a go to for you. Balmy Eye Balm!
