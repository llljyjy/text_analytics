This moisturizer has worked wonders for my dry skin! I donâ€™t typically enjoy gel type moisturizers because of the lack of hydration afterward, but this one blew me away. It is thicker to begin but melts into the skin so effortlessly. It absorbs in no time and leaves the skin looking so healthy and glowing. I love that this supports the skin barrier and provides 120 hours of hydration. I have skin tot he point it flakes in certain areas and this completely took care of that. Less dryness in the skin & a gorgeous hydrated canvas! Loveeeee!
