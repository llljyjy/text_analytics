I bought this cleanser to help with my blackheads and congestion. I have combination/oily skin, pores, texture, and sensitive skin. PROS: it REALLY exfoliates your skin, removes buildup of oil, sunscreen, etc, non-drying, non-irritating, helps with blackheads better than other products (Paula’s Choice BHA did nothing for me after 3 bottles), softens your skin, and skin feels balanced and fresh after washing. CONS: I noticed my skin got bit more oily in t-zone from using it twice daily. I would really recommend this product for blackheads/texture. Also, every time I squeeze some product out, there are 1-2 small white particles in the formula. I think it’s just some ingredients that clump up and create this. THERE ARE NO SCRUBBING PARTICLES IN THIS FORMULA. ITS A PINK GEL LIKE CONSISTENCY. PRO vs. CON
