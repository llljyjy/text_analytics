I received this product for free from influenster and was excited to give it a try. I donâ€™t tend to use toner often but was quite please with the Tula brand. I noticed a major difference in my typical break out areas, which seemed to clear up. The toner pads left my skin feeling soft and after using them every night I have notice that my skin looks tighter. I do have sensitive skin so the first couple time I used them the tingle was a bit too much for me but after the 3rd time I barely noticed anymore. If I were to buy toner again I would definitely reach for this product! I also loved how convenient the product was. Clearer skin
