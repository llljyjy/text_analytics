I always use a vitamin C serum for my face, but I have never put it under my eyes so I was excited for this! It is very thick and moisturizing, definitely helps concealer glide on better. It is a little tinted to mitigate the purple of your dark circles. It is also really good to know this is part of the clean beauty movement. My only complaint is when I put it on without putting concealer over- like when I go to the gym- you can definitely tell it is there for a bit, it is glowy and doesnâ€™t immediately absorb. I love how it makes the skin under my eyes FEEL though, so I will definitely keep using it! Banana Bright
