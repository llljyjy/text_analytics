I got DIOR capture totale Le Serum from Influenster as complimentary for my honest review. My first impression is the packaging and the bottle is as elegant as all DIOR products and then the smell which I really like. I don’t find it really strong and not overwhelming but just right that disappears after sometime. And after that about the product, I really like the anti aging products which can be apply anywhere around the face. I like to focus it around my eyes because I have eye bags and dark circles plus tired eyes. I use it in the morning and at the night after washing my face. It’s hydrating and I feel my skin refreshed. It’s been over a week now since I’m using it and I can definitely feel the difference my skin feel plumped and firm. If we can argue about the price i can say it can worth every penny. I really like it and recommend it. nan
