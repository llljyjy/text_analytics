If you’re hesitant about spending this much money on a lip balm, I’m here to tell you it’s worth it. I am totally fine with my Vaseline and aquaphor, but this stuff is next level. It lasts for HOURS, gives your lips the most beautiful wet glossy look, moisturizes so well, and smooths out the lines I have on my lips. It’s not sticky, and applies beautifully with the applicator. I have had it for 2 days and I’m about to go get another one. SO worth a shot. If you’ve tried the laneige sleeping mask, I find that this is less sticky and more moisturizing. nan
