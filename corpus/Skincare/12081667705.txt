This cream is very hydrating, not greasy or oily, light weight, absorbs quickly and has a mild fragrance. While all those are good points for a product I was still left disappointed. I used the sample for just over two weeks and saw no difference in firmness, plumpness, reduction in fine lines or tightening. For the high price point I need a product that’s going to work for me in those areas. I have basic moisturizers that hydrate equally as well, if not better. It’s a pass for me. It’s a pass for me
