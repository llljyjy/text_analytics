I really have been enjoying using this moisturizer. My face routine is really only washing my face and wearing a good moisturizer. This is a good moisturizer. It does what it says. The formula is thick, so a little goes a long way but it melts in my face when I apply it. I have not used any other moisturizers since receiving this product. I highly  recommend it. Highly recommend it
