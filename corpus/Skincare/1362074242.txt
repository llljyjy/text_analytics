I love this moisturizer! I have tried everything from drug store moisturizer to La Mer and I really think this moisturizer does the trick! If you’re into skin cycling like me and just want a basic moisturizer to pair with your other serums and oils this is it! It’s simple, yet effective. This moisturizer is neither too thin, or too thick it’s just right! FYI my skin is normal (not dry or oily and I very rarely break out) and this works great for me! I’ve repurchased several times and will most likely continue to do so! A great basic hydrating moisturizer!
