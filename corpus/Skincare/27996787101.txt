If you’re sensitive to scented face creams, this product definitely is not recommended! I’ve got the sample to try on and the first thing that bothered me after application was the strong smell! Also I like to layer my moisturizer two three times to feel extra hydration but definitely not recommended for this product as it kinda peels of after reapplication. Strong smell
