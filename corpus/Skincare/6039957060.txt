I was very excited to receive a free sample sized product of this eye cream from Influenster for my honest opinion. The very first few days I applied the eye cream I did notice a slight stinging feeling under my eyes. I did not notice any redness or irritation. The consistency of the cream is very thick, a little goes a long way. I have noticed a huge difference with the darkness under my eyes. As for the wrinkles and fine lines,the results are less noticeable. Overall I am very happy with the results I’ve received from the Estée Lauder eye cream. I will be purchasing a larger size once my sample size runs out. Bye Bye Dark Circles
