I wanted to love this product because of how viral it went. However, itâ€™s not good for fair skin tones with neutral/cool undertones. The scent is too strong but other than that it does look pretty on the skin but the colour is just bad. It turns so many shades darker than your skin tone (for pale skin) with a strong yellow/orange undertone. Not pale friendly
