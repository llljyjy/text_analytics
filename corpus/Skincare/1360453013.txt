Rich balm, not quite like serum but very moisturizing. I have had this awhile and swear from the first time I tried it, I’ve seen results. I use it under my eyes and the area between my nose and mouth. Anywhere there are fine lines. I can’t see it once it’s applied other than it’s silky and moisturized. I put it on under my makeup and my makeup doesn’t slip or melt. Love this stick!! nan
