I’m so sad this product didn’t work out for me, I loved the way it felt on the back of my hand in store so I purchased but since I’ve been using it I’m having the worst breakout all over my face. I thought it would get better so I kept using but it’s just getting worse. I really love the feel of this product on my skin and the fact that it doesn’t have a strong smell. I’m surprised it’s made my skin breakout like this since it’s not a heavy moisturizer. Try as a sample first for at least two weeks before wasting your money! Caused Acne :(
