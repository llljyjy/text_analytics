Let me start by saying I just received the cleanser and have only used it once. My face feels clean, but not tight or dry. HOWEVER, I HATE the scent of this product. Maybe it’s the cucumber extract, but to me it smells like something sour. I don’t know if I’m going to be able to continue using it - that’s how much I hate the scent. My rating of the product (at this point) is strictly about the smell. Horrible Scent
