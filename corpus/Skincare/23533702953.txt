Anytime I hear about a product with Retinol I am cautious and curious. Cautious as how much it will really work and refine my aging skin. But curious, as retinol had the power to do so much to my skin. Dr. Zenovia products are becoming my go to, as they are packed with quality products that do what they say they are going to do.This Retinol Night Repair Cream did wonders to my skin. My acne scarring start to look minimized after about 3 weeks and the overall appearance of my skin looked better. It looked tighter and brighter. When I first started to use it, I only used it 2 times a week, as my skin became dry and flaky. I had to allow my face to get used to the Retinol.But even with just a few applications for the first couple of weeks, I saw a difference. This night cream will become part of my skincare routine.
