I had the opportunity to try this #freeproduct as part of Clinique’s wrinkle correcting line.  I used it in the morning along with the eye cream and moisturizer.  Unfortunately I only had enough of a sample of the serum to last a few days so I’m unsure how effective it really is.  I think I notice a bit of a difference in my overall skin tone, but cannot say for sure it’s from the serum alone.  I think all 3 products work best with each other than just one on it’s own.  The serum absorbes quickly, without leaving any residue feeling. Better as part of the line
