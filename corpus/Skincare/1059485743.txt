I received a small sample from Topbox in exchange for my review. It was just a small sachet so I was only able to get about 3 applications out of it. The serum absorbed quickly into my skin and did not have any scent. My face felt soft after applying the serum. I used it both in the morning and evening as part of my nighttime routine. It worked well with my other products and used a moisturizer with SPF in the morning. Since my sample was so small, I am unable to speak to itâ€™s effectiveness long-term. The little I used, however, was nice. #freeprodcut Good serum
