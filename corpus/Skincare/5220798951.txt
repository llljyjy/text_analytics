I was so excited for this product. A resetting spray with spf that could be easily reapplied over makeup throughout the day. My dream come true? NOPE. This is so oily, and it NEVER dries. It does the opposite of setting your makeup. Any touch to your face would wipe your makeup off because of this. Makes you feel greasy (I have dry skin, and never knew what that felt like before using this product). The other issue is the smell. Before reading the ingredients for rosemary and mint, I thought it smelled like bug spray. The rosemary is overpowering and if you get this in your eyes it burns. I honestly donâ€™t know how this product got released. nan
