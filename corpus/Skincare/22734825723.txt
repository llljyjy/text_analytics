I was so excited to receive this from influenster! I hate how a lot of serums because they make my skin look greasy. My skin is pretty dry but I still don’t like it when serums make my skin too dewy looking. This serum was just right! I felt super hydrated and glossy but not too over the top. I love the ingredients of this serum and for the price I would say it’s worth the buy! Love this
