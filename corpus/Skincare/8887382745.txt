Disappointed that I wasted rewards points on a sample of this. It’s extremely greasy and does not sink into skin well, at least not for me. I have oily T zone and normal/dry elsewhere and this just didn’t sit well. It also made me break out really bad, which is super annoying. Just a hard miss for me. Greasy, oily, doesn't sink in.
