I’m on my fourth jar of this and I’m REALLY hoping they never discontinue anything from the line.  For reference, I’m 38, avoid the sun when I can, and wear sunscreen when I can’t.  I’d say whatever fine lines I do have are about average for someone my age with a healthy skincare regimen.That said, this stuff is that miracle cream everyone talks about.  I use this in conjunction with the rest of the collection, but this immediately reduces any “imperfections“ and gone lines.  Not to mention it just makes my face look lifter, more plump, and glowy.  I get more compliments on my skin now when I don’t wear makeup (my makeup is intensely minimal, as it is).  I have strangers straight up tell me my skin looks incredible.The trick to this is the seasoning method: you can always add more, but you can never take it out.  In the morning, I simply add a small dot to the quadrants of my face and neck, then gently pat and massage it in.  I only add more of I feel areas need it.  Like a pea sized amount is more than enough.  At night, I’m a little more gracious with it for obvious reasons.One thing I do need to say is that Dior products are historically heavily scented.  I really don’t mind the scent at all.  In fact, I’ve come to enjoy the signature fragrances of Dior skincare.  If you don’t like fragrance skincare, Dior is probably not the brand you should splurge on.  If you’re like me, trust that this will be a cream you’ll be sorry you didn’t buy sooner. nan
