Used this twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. It’s very light and never affected my make up routine. I appreciate that it wasn’t greasy or oily! After 2 weeks, I saw a difference in my dark circles and eye bags! Not I feel even more confident and don’t have to use so much concealer! Does what it says!
