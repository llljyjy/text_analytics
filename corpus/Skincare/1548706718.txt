I appreciate that this is unscented and doesn’t contain irritating ingredients. It’s very emollient. It was too rich for my face (I got greasy), so I use it on my hands instead. One quibble: it should probably be packaged in a tube, since jar packaging can spoil the good ingredients. Rich; needs different packaging
