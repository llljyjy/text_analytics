This is an excellent retinol type of skincare serum! My skin did show improvement after use and I didn’t find this to be too harsh. Overall, I really like this product and do recommend. It doesn’t have any aspect I dislike. The bottle is easy to use and its simple to dispense product. It also measures out a reasonable and small amount with each pump which helps me know how much to use. I really love this and will keep using it! nan
