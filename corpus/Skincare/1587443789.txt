I have sensitive eczema skin and when flare ups occur I am very careful of what my skin can and cannot absorb. This cream is on the expensive side so when I was able to try the formula I wasn’t sure what to expect. The consistency is similar to many moisturizers on the market. Doesn’t require a whole lot to cover your entire face so use sparingly I’d say. I do try to avoid the eye region as I’ve read that many users have had sensitivity to this product when applied in those areas. It does provide my face the moisture it needs and when layered with other skincare products I use there isn’t a major reaction thank goodness. Due to having sensitive skin the last thing I’d need is a flare up due to a new face cream. nan
