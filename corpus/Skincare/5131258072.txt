Lancôme does an amazing job with their skincare products, and this one is no different.  I love that the bottle dispenses the perfect amount of each serum simultaneously, and it’s also the perfect amount to put on my face, so no wasted product. I also love how it feels on my skin. It’s not super heavy  or sticky, and goes on beautifully. I have been using this for about 3 weeks now, and can see a difference in my fine lines and wrinkles. My complexion also glows, and my skin looks healthy. I will definitely continue to use this!! I received this product from  influenster in exchange for my honest review. A new staple for my skincare routine!
