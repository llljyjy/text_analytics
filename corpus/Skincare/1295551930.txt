I’ve been using this religiously now for 2 weeks. I definitely noticed a difference even after the 1st night. My under eyes look much less puffy and tired. And they look refreshed and brighter. Almost tight but not in a bad way. I can’t speak for really long term use but it can only get better from here right? I was almost hoping to not like this because the price point is a little on the high side but i’d say the price is worth it. A little goes a long way soyou could easily get several months from one tube. The packaging is beautiful as Dior always is. Size is good. It has a slight fragrance but it’s light and classic. The only downside is the applicator. I like the idea but it’s kind of hard to squeeze out and not very easy to control so I feel it wastes product and is a pain that’s why I took away 1 star but the product on its own is 5 stars. LOVE THIS - DIOR FOREVER
