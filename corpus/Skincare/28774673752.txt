The biggest thing wrong with this product is the instructions. It says to dampen your face first, use the product, then rinse off. Because this is a balm (and an oily one without emulsifiers), using it on damp skin won’t work well. It also won’t rinse off. As the first step in a two-step cleanse, it works, though not that well with mascara. The oil in the product does separate, and you can’t really shake the tube to blend it back together. While it has no added fragrance, it does have an earthy aroma which you may (or may not) like. I’m using it up, but don’t plan to purchase again. Meh
