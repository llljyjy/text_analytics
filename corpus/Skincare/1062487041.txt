I received a #freeproduct to test this serum. I did not receive a full size product, so my experience is limited to less than the expected length of time needed to see any effect on wrinkles. The serum itself is pretty nice because it is primarily using hyaluronic acid as the base and that is a proven moisturizer when it comes to skincare. Of course, I would advise layering a cream on top of the serum to seal things in and for maximum juiciness. The serum has some form of retinol, which, again, is another proven anti-aging ingredient. To me, this ingredient is what sets this serum aside from an average serum as I can’t think of any other one that has a retinol in it. There wasn’t any overpowering scent to this serum and it was pretty standard in texture with a more watery formulation as it is not oil based. I did not notice any adverse reactions from my skin from the retinol, but if you are sensitive, you should do a patch test. It does give a temporary glow to the face right after application, but like I said, you really should follow any serum with a moisturizer to lock it all in. Hyaluronic Plus Serum
