Hands down BEST spot treatment out there!! I used to have acne as an adolescent and young adult but have not had any issues with it until 2020 and MASKNE became a thing. It could also possibly be hormonal acne as well. I have never had such huge deep painful cystic pimples all over my cheeks and chin (mostly chin) until recently and I have tried it all to get rid of them. Until now the only thing that helped was Peace Out pimple patches but that was getting to be VERY expensive! This works so much better and much less costly! A little product goes a long way. It gets rid of the pimples faster and reduces the redness too!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! Iâ€™m trying the face wash next! BEST SPOT TREATMENT EVER
