I’ve been asked to review IT Cosmetics “Confidence in a Cream” (which is the perfect name for this item!) It is pleasantly fresh scent was barely perceptible as I smoothed the cream over my skin, but I did notice that the cream was very lightweight compared to some of the more expensive moisturizer I’ve tried.After two weeks of use, I did notice firmer skin and less dullness than I’d experienced before.This is a cream of buy again for sure; it’s one of use everyday! nan
