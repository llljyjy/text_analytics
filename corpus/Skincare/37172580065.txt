Iâ€™m absolutely in love with this product. My biggest pet peeve is when I cleanse my face and when I dry my face with a towel, I still see makeup on my towel. With this milk makeup cleansing balm the makeup was fully and easily removed and left my skin feeling hydrated and rejuvenated without leaving any residue on my skin. This product also easily removed my mascara without leaving my under eyes stained. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that wears makeup. nan
