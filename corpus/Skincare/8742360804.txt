I really like this product. I have very sensitive skin, and most retinol products are too harsh. I find that this one doesnâ€™t burn my skin or dry me out. It makes my skin feel soft and bouncy. It gives a nice glow. I am not giving it 5 stars because of the smell. It smells like straight up glue and vinegar. It is super off-putting and makes me not want to use the product. Nice but horrible smell
