Very disappointment in this product.  I do have dry skin but I used my moisturizer before applying this serum.  I bought it because of the ingredients.  I bought Tone 2 which must of been by accident as I am definitely fair and should have bought Tone 2.  I will not buy this again because I had the same results as others resulted in the pilling.  I do not recommend for drier skin. Very disappointed
