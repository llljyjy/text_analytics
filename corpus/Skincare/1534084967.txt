Let me start by saying that I’m obsessed with sunscreen. Particularly Japanese, Korean and French sunscreen. I’ve been looking for the perfect way to reapply on the go. There are times that I’m not able to wash my hands and reapply my daily sunscreen throughout the day. I was skeptical at first about this particular product. Everyone is raving about this stick, specially influencers. I decided to give it a try, worse case scenario I could always return it. I’ve been left speechless. It applies so smoothly without pulling or tugging on the skin. It does not have a strong fragrance. I’ve also used it over makeup and experienced little to no smudging of my blush and highlighter. It does not burn your eyes. Due to different anti aging treatments that I use, my skin is sensitive to the sun and easily burns. I feel protected with this sunscreen. Also, did I mention that it does not make you look like a disco ball?? No shiny / oily looking skin. Worth the hype!
