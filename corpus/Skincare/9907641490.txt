For starters, the packaging of this product is on point. Regarding the product itself, it’s liquid which I wasn’t really expecting. As someone with darker skin, I look for sunscreens that don’t leave a tint and are easy to blend. This product wasn’t the easiest to blend, but it left no tint which I like. This product smells good and has a nice glow to it. I would recommend this product! Great Sunscreen
