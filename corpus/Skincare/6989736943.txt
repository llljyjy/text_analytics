I received this complimentary from Influenster. This works alright. It’s definitely not my favorite cleanser but it does the job. I felt like my skin got a bit oilier after. The fragrance bothered me. It’s not a scent I generally like and it was a little strong for my preference. I will be sticking to my CeraVe cleanser. fragrance
