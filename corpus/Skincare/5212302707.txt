I was sent this Guerlain Abeille Royale Advanced Youth Watery Oil by Influenster and Sephora in exchange for my honest review. This product uses a blend of different honeys sourced from France and other places to create a complex that provides hydrated and fuller-looking skin within 8 hours of application. When I took it out of the package I loved how the little golden flecks of honey caught the light from my window. The fragrance at first seems overwhelming, but it is a beautiful scent that dissipates quickly. My skin did look fuller and luminous after 8 hours, and I didnâ€™t have any adverse reactions to it nor did it just sit on top of my skin. I would consider purchasing it in the future. nan
