I received this product free to try from Influenster. I’ve been using it consistently for a few weeks now and while at first I was skeptical I’ve really started to like it. I use it at night before going to bed. It is a very thin, light consistency but a little goes a long way. It spreads easily on the skin and after a few minutes fully absorbs. My skin feels light and has no shine. Overall if the price was not so high I’d definitely consider adding this into my nightly regime permanently. Light and Airy
