I got this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. It’s a great moisturizer. Soft texture and absorbs really well. I use it in conjunction with their Glycolic night serum and after two nights I noticed a huge difference in my skin. It’s a great moisturizer but for the price it doesn’t stand out. That’s the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5. Great product
