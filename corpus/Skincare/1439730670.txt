Frequent reader of reviews, but I never write them myself. This serum made me do it!!! I started with the sample and was so blown away, I didn’t mind pulling the trigger on the full size. YOU GUYS. I am 32 and have never been able to NOT wear makeup. This stuff has me out here in broad daylight with glass skin, no makeup, and I’ve received so many compliments. Usually when I don’t wear makeup, I get “are you sick?”, “have you been crying?”, “are you okay?”. No more!! It is unbelievable and works right away. It’s not just the hyperpigmentation too - its crow’s feet, acne scars, dark circles, pores, hydration - I mean, truly, EVERYTHING!! Get a sample first if you’re scared of the price. You won’t regret it!! Miracle Milk of the Gods
