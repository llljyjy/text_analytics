I purchased this product because I am an avid sunscreen user and was excited to try something new. If you use the recommended 2-3 finger amount for face and neck it makes you look very greasy and it did pill on top of my other skincare products, even when I allowed them to sink in for a good 30+ minutes. I don’t have a pilling issue when using other sunscreens on top of my normal morning routine. It also feels pretty heavy on the face and although I have dry skin it doesn’t feel as hydrating as some other products. It doesn’t leave a white cast and doesn’t really sting my eyes when applying so I will continue to use the bottle but I don’t think it will be repurchasing. It’s alright
