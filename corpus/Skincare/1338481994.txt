I was looking for dewy, unfortunately it was not. I felt it didn’t deliver with the mist and hydration. I wish the mist was finer so the coverage is nicer. It dries really quickly which is nice but I didn’t feel like I was rehydrated. The price doesn’t reflect the performance. I like Tatcha but this fell short
