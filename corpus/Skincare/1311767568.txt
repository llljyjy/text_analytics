This was my first time using Drunk Elephant and it was a great first introduction. The Ceramighty AF Eye Balm is thick and hydrating but sinks into the skin quickly. The packaging is elegant yet fun, so it looks great on display. Itâ€™s definitely not a cheap brand though. High Quality & Sleek Packaging
