I love this product. I’ve actually gone through a few on my own now. Dior sent me this one and I realized I never reviewed it. I love this. I have dry skin and am quite fair skinned. I’m in my late 30s with two young kids. This helps to smooth and soothe my under eyes and keeps me looking awake. I love the applicator which adds a nice cooling effect. I’ll often times just apply and massage it in with the applicator. I’ll forever be back to this product. I doubt I’ll ever bother to try any other eye serums/creams. nan
