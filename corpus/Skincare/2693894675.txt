Took a chance on this from all the good reviews and I was not disappointed! My skin tends to be a bit oily and I have always struggled with whiteheads and blackheads. I started off using this daily and my skin instantly became so smooth. After 2 weeks of use, I notice that my pores are smaller and much cleaner than they used to be. My skin feels softer than it ever has. Iâ€™ve come to find that if I use it daily, it is drying to my skin, so using it every 2-3 days seems to be the sweet spot for me. Take a chance on this if you have similar skin concerns, it has been really effective! Definitely recommend. Effective to minimize pores and smooth skin!
