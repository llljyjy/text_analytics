Definitely a nice product. I can say it’s not an overnight miracle by any means. You need to be consistent and use it daily. However even with that I would still need more to really see progress. I have combo skin and so using at night really assists in addressing the dry and sensitive skin. It’s not oily but is thick which is nice for nighttime. It’s better than a lot of other night moisturizing creams so worth giving a try. Nice night cream
