Pros: Overall great product. I use it strictly as a face wash, not to remove makeup. It’s so creamy and doesn’t strip your skin at all but still leaves your face feeling clean and fresh.  My skin always feels soft and hydrated after use. Cons: The smell and the packaging. It is scented, and while the scent is light, I really hate the smell. Scent in a face wash seems completely unnecessary when you’re going to be putting other products on your face afterwards. It’s not enough to make me stop using the product because the formula is amazing, but the the scent was enough to turn me away from a few other Fenty Skin products, specifically the moisturizer and body cream. The packaging is also really difficult for no reason. The cleanser is thick, and the tiny hole gets clogged easily and you end up wrestling with the bottle to get the product out, especially as you get near the end. I get Fenty is trying to be different and unique, but a regular pump or normal squeeze bottle would’ve been just fine. I really love the formula so I’ll keep using the product, but the cons are really really irritating. Some repackaging and unscented verisons of the main Fenty Skin products or even the entire line would go a long way. If I were to find other cleanser thats on the same level and doesn’t have those issues, I’d definitely switch over. Great formula, but has avoidable issues
