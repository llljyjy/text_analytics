Fantastic first cleanse to help remove makeup and especially mascara! It’s definitely a FIRST cleanse, though, in a double-cleanse routine. You’ll need to follow up with another cleanser to remove the residue, but that’s to be expected in my experience with these products. It really removes EVERYTHING and I feel like it prevents overs-tripping in the cleansing process. Such a good makeup removing balm! This is my second purchase and so happy they have a travel size now! Amazing FIRST cleanse in a double-cleanse routine
