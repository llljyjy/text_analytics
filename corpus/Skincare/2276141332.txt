The packaging is super luxurious, almost feels like a perfume bottle. The serum feels rich and hydrating on the face. My only issue with this product is I broke out after using it for a few days. Unfortunately, I didn’t use this product long enough to see results as I didn’t want my face to keep breaking out. I don’t think the ingredients are designed for oily or sensitive skin. Not for everyone
