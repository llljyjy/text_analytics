I received this product free for review from Influencer and Ole Henricksen. As a new mom, my under eyes are truly in a state of struggle. Sometimes they look bruised! It’s been a nice addition to my skincare routine every morning to apply this under eye cream and do a little extra self care. The product feels great on my skin and does have a slight brightening effect. I’m hoping that with continued use I can see more pronounced results. nan
