Nice texture, works well. This product isn’t really that different from other facial moisturizers, and that’s a good thing. I usually use the pink Clinique gel, this is similar. My aunt swears by Estée Lauder, and I do like their eyeshadow palettes. I haven’t used this moisturizer long enough to tell if it’s anti-aging, I suspect it’ll take years to tell if anything has an effect (short of Botox anyways). I haven’t really tested the SPF either, but it’s a nice thing to have. Overall, decent moisturizer, from a good brand. I have no doubt it’ll work for many people, won’t give you acne and issues.
