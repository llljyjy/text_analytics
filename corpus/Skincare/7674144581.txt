This product completely saved my eyes. I developed what I thought was Blepharitis, but turned out to be eyelid dermatitis. I woke up one morning with extremely red, burning, itching, sore, scaly eyelids and under eyes. Such a painful and unsightly condition for 11 weeks until I found this product. Couldn’t even wear makeup at all. My eyelashes were falling out. I will say, it took 3 whole days to work and at first, I thought it was getting worse. I stuck with it and everything disappeared. This product contains 5% colloidal oatmeal! Most products that contain colloidal oatmeal only contain 1%. So very glad I found this; and no it’s not just Vaseline. This can be worn under makeup and that it wonderful. It saved me. Stick with it. Works on elbows too. Saved my Eyes! Just Stick With It
