This would be a 5 star sunscreen if both tints being offered were not so warm-toned. It’s not so much that the tint is too dark (unless you are very fair and try to use the warm shade), but that they add an orangeyness - so imagine instead of a white cast there’s an orange cast. There are those of us who are brown-skinned with neutral or even cool undertones that these tints exclude. They really needed to have made the medium tint option a neutral. As for the formula, it is actually very beautiful. It just melts into the skin and on my combo skin it doesn’t feel too heavy. It is definitely more on the dewy side so it may not be for people with oily skin. There is however a way to make this work even if neither of the shades are your match. It’s to combine either shade with the untinted one to get your perfect match. The white untinted version tones down the orange-tone of the warm shade and then it wears beautifully. I understand people may not want to buy both shades though so having to mix and match makes it less accessible, which is a shame because this is one of the nicest feeling zinc formulas out there and that is why I purchased both warm and untinted. I do hope the brand can improve their tint options in the future. Also beware the warm shade has a very subtle sparkle to it. I find it is very pretty but everyone may not like it. Finally, I’ve also been experimenting with mixing the warm shade into other mineral sunscreens that I am currently trying to use up that have some white cast issues and it is helping to make those wearable. Beautiful formula, tint might be too warm
