Great gentle exfoliator. I never used chemical exfoliants before and decide to purchase this and now I love it! I use this every 2 - 3 days at night time and apply this first. It is very gentle and you do not need too much. This small bottle also lasts a long time. I have normal to dry skin so this really helps get rid of dead skin cell build up. It is also very affordable and vegan so that makes it even better :) Long lasting and gentle!
