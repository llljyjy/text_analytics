I was so excited to try DAMDAM Nomadâ€™s Cream Purifying Exfoliating Cleanser and was not disappointed! I start off by rinsing my face with lukewarm water and working a dime size amount onto my palms then onto my face massaging in circular motions letting the granules dissolve and lightly exfoliate as well as this is also a scrub. It is made with Japanese Konnyaku a plant based exfoliant used to purify the skin, Tea Tree Oil reduces the appearance of breakouts and Phytic Acid an AHA in Japanese rice that shrinks pores and evens skin tone. I also love that this face wash is cruelty free, vegan, and gluten free so a win win! Overall my skin is left feeling so clean, fresh, and exfoliated! I love the way it feels on my skin too! And use it morning and night and love it! I highly recommend Clean and exfoliated skin
