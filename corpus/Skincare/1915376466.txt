This is my first time using retinol. I’m 32, and I have extremely sensitive, combination, breakout prone skin. Until this product, the only thing I used is rose water and hemp oil. This is fantastic if you are new to retinol and sensitive! I was able to do my regular routine, the retinol pad, and after 20 minutes (that’s how long you should wait after applying) put my regular hemp oil on. I saw an amazing glow right away. Right now I am only using one pad per week, which I recommend if you have sensitive skin like me. It also makes it last a lot longer. Since retinol takes two months to get used to, it’s a great way to slowly introduce yourself. After two months I may go up to twice a week. I will update this if so with results! Best for beginners and sensitive skin!
