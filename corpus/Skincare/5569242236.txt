This product has a really weird smell and I also find it very oily, it just sits on my face all day and itâ€™s not a good feeling. However I do notice that it brightens my skin, I noticed it within the first few days of using it. I just wish it had a nicer feel on the skin. It feels like there is a grease layer on my face all day! nan
