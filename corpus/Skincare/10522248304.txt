I added this into my routine and now I am obsessed. Magic in a bottle. This has done more for me than most AHAs I’ve tried. My complexion has improved so much and without drying or irritating my skin in the process!! It does have a funky odor but once you push past this it isn’t bad at all. Incredible Exfoliant!
