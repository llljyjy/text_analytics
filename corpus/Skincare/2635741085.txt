These are too good! I love the original ones for their effectiveness but being able to apply makeup overtop is a real game changer for me. I always hated how crusty my blemishes looked when I tried to cover them with foundation or concealer but that doesn’t happen with these. It does take an extra minute or two to make sure that it actually is traceless, but if you’re willing to take the time to carefully conceal, these are going to be your favorite invention ever. Not to mention the difference it made in fighting my blemish underneath. I love that I can treat and take on the day with these. I received these complimentary from Peace Out, but that did not sway my opinion. 5/5! nan
