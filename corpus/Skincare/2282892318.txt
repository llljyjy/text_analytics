I was selected to try out a product before it launched and share what I thought! .• First … a little goes a really long way.• Small but mighty.• My skin felt smoother to the touch after using this sample.• I felt I saw a small change in my crows  feet, under eye area, however I would like to try for a longer period, this sample while it goes a long way, I would need to continue to really see the full results of this product. • Based on what I did see and feel, I would say definitely something I would say try. #CliniqueSmart #complimentary Wrinkle Cream
