to save you from reading this lengthy review, it’s good, kinda pricey, left a whiteish cast at first but went away (just keep patting it in), and it’s buildable! so originally i was going to get this in store, but they only had the original size (which i was not going to pay for), so i got it delivered at my house for the mini. i got this for redness that’s very prominent on my cheeks and when i tried it, it wasn’t full coverage. i wasn’t really expecting my skin to be absolutely flawless, but i can still see some redness, but it definitely reduced it! so my final verdict is that its pretty good! if you want more coverage, just build it on, i applied very little product when i tried it. i will say, this product is aimed for those who have light/fair skin. i don’t really know what my skin tone is because i have the worst mask tan line. my forehead is pretty tan, but the rest of my face is light-medium haha. oh and it kinda looks like it left a white-ish cast in my face but i checked again about 4 hours later and it didn’t seem like that, just keep patting it into the skin! thanks for reading this review! writing reviews is quite relaxing.^ btw sorry i don’t have pictures of it on :/ PRETTY GOOD BUT NOT FULL COVERAGE
