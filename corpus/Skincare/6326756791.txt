I really love this cleanser! I marked it down 1 star because it can be a little drying if you use too often (at least for me). At most I use it once a day when my face is on the oilier side, and every other day when I’m in a dry phase. That being said, it’s amazing at exfoliating gently, and makes your face feel truly clean without your skin feeling tight or squeaky. It essentially cleanses, exfoliates, and tones all in one. I definitely can say that my skin texture has improved and my skin has cleared up since I started using it several months ago! nan
