I received this product free in exchange for an honest opinion of the product.  I love that this product is SPF 40.  There are a lot of reviews that state it is oily/greasy but I did not experience that with this product.  I tend to have dry skin and when this product is applied, it easily absorbs into my skin and leaves my face feeling smooth and silky.  I tend to spend quite a bit of time in the sun and I used this product every time and had no adverse reaction and it kept my face from getting sunburned. nan
