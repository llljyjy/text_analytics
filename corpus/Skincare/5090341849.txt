I had never really tried Tula products before. I was excited to receive this kit. I do like the eye serum and wrinkle drops, but the combination of wrinkle drops and moisturizer make my oily complexion feel a bit greasy. The skin around my eyes is definitely smoother after using these products for only a few days though! nan
