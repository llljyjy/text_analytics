My absolute favourite cleansing balm to take off my makeup and SPF at the end of the day. This is my first step before I go in with a second cleanser. Repurchased multiple times and always have another one as a back up just incase. Doesn’t make skin feel oily or like there’s a residue left behind, and removes all my makeup. Definitely recommend! nan
