Okay at removing makeup, it doesn’t remove all of my mascara and my vision is blurry after using. My biggest problem is that it leaks everywhere. There is so much oil leaking out of this bottle. I’d take it back but the sales associates would for sure say I’ve used too much to accept the return or something. Ugh. Blurry eyes. Bottle leaks.
