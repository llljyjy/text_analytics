This is a cushiony non-sticky gloss that leaves a subtle red tint on the lips. I was concerned I might dislike it because of the scent, but somehow I don’t mind it too much. It smells like Haribo gummies to me and has a subtle sweet taste. Also, love the huge applicator, it’s very chubby and cute. I ordered the berry one from their website because I enjoy this one so much. Wonderful formula
