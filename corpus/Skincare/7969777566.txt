I think this is a good eye cream, but it’s not worth the hype… It also tends to sting under my eyes when I apply it (I don’t really have sensitive skin, and am able to use other eye creams perfectly fine without this issue) so not sure why that is.  I wouldn’t say that it has brightened or improved my under eyes much either.  Will use up, but meh. sensitive eyes proceed with caution
