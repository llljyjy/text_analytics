Don’t like the price point or the JLO name fool you, these masks are incredible. Yes, there are cheaper masks out there, however, I am not kidding you when I say you truly glow after using these. The tingling feeling is fine (kind of feels extremely cold) but it is so worth it in photos. 10/10 Don’t be deceived, these are incredible!
