I really like this new eye cream! It feels cool, soothing, and refreshing going on.  It is just the right consistencyâ€”not too heavy and not too light.  In the week since I have been using it, I can see some difference with my under eye area feeling smoother and more moisturized after consistent use.  I highly recommend trying it and will purchase this when I run out. Effective, new eye cream
