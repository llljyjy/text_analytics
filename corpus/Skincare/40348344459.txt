This serum is lovely, works great to smooth, hydrate and plump the face. Smells nice and a little bit goes a long way. I love that it absorbs quickly and isnâ€™t sticky or  greasy. Been using it for 5 days morning and night, notice some changes in my face already like lines smoothing and complexion more even and bright. Definitely recommend! A must have for my routine!
