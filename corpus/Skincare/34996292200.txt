First, Iâ€™d like to note how lovely the scent is, I was so pleasantly surprised by how fresh and light it is. I look forward to putting it on in the morning. The cream is airy and light but still feels very hydrating, I love that it has salicylic acid in it to help with my hormonal acne. Including it in the cream just makes for one less skincare step. Highly recommend! Weightless and lovely
