The best face wash I’ve ever used! So gentle on my sensitive skin and leaves me skin so soft. I suffer from acne on my chin. I’ve been using for less than a week and my chin is clearing up. Highly recommend if you have acne prone or sensitive skin. I’ve tried many different face washes and this one is by far my favorite! a must have!
