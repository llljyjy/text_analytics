“Brightening” is misleading with this product. I have used this product consistently enough to report it does not truly address dark circles. The “brightening” effect that it has is really just the highlighter-like sheen the cream leaves on your face where you swipe it. I will say that I am obsessed with the cooling effect it has so I am not 100% dissatisfied (just don’t get too crazy with the application because it will get streaky!)… but the pricing is too much for what this product really does. Just a highlighter for your undereyes.
