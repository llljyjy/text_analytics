This product is so nice and moisturizing.  It applies nicely and feels so silky.  I have combination skin and this product left my dry skin feeling moisturized, soft and supple without being greasy.  It kept my skin feeling hydrated all day and it felt and looked better still the following day.  I will continue to use this product and would definitely recommend it to others.
