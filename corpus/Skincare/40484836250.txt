I received Caudalie Premier Cru from Caudalie and TopBox Circle for my honest review. I have always had combination skin. I don’t know if it’s the fact that I am getting older or the very unseasonably cold weather but my skin is very dry. So much so that my nose peels. I have tried countless serums, moisturizers and heavy night creams and it just doesn’t seem to be helping my very parched skin. I have been using this for awhile now. So far I like what I’m seeing. I think we all want a product to work immediately but that just isn’t the nature of skin. It takes awhile and consistent use to see a difference. Finally my nose has stopped peeling after a 1 weeks use. The rest of my face is very soft and moisturized. I have been using this in the morning and in the evening. I am hoping that with continued use my fine lines will lessen. It has a very nice light fragrance. I use both unscented and scented skin care products. This particular scented cream almost feels like aromatherapy. The cream itself is luxurious and feels soothing on your skin. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox nan
