I love that it has Activated C that Attacks deep-set dark spots while diminishing the formation of new discolouration’s.I’m a huge White Birch Extract fan especially because it Supports natural skin elasticity and collagen production resulting in the appearance of increased skin density, volume, and thickness. Peony Extract and Activated C Facilitates the reversal of discoloration for skin clarity. All those combined makes for an excellent product to target Dark Spots, Dullness and Uneven Texture, and Acne and Blemishes. It really helped my acne scarring and really helped bring a nice glow to my skin. It Made it less dull and evened out my skin texture. I like that this product is more natural ingredients and feels extremely gentle on my skin. It genuinely makes a difference. It can be used on normal skin. Combination and as I mentioned sensitive skin! It works well. I’m grateful to Have tried this product. nan
