I have dry to normal skin. I’ve been looking for a sunscreen that doesn’t leave me oily and also that doesn’t get into my eyes. I use to go to target and buy sunbum. That brand literally made my eyes itch and irritated. So I found this guy. It has no smell and it did not burn or get into my eyes (the only good thing). What it did was just made my face so oily and I have noticed my pores opening up more. After trying it for 12 days I had to return it. Once I applied it again after 2 hours it just made my face worse. I was too shiny and oily. Makes face so oily
