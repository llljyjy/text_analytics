Kiehls new vitamin eye serum is very good! It is very creamy without being greasy. It hydrates and absorbs quickly. I did not notice it taking away any wrinkles but I didn’t notice any new wrinkles after using it for two months. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the price. I don’t know if I would pay for price for the eye serum. nan
