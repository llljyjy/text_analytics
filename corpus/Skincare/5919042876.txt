I used an entire mini size of this I was gifted and didn’t want to like it because it’s so expensive—but tragically I really liked it. I have sensitive, acne prone combination oily t-zone / dry cheeks and this feels soothing, hydrating, and firming all in one. I also noticed more even skin tone and improvement in texture! I see some reviews comparing to Paula’s Choice BHA but my skin hated that stuff…if this was more affordable I’d give it 5 stars, but if you don’t mind the splurge it’s worth trying. amazing but expensive for a toner
