Solid 4.5 stars - it goes on so smooth and is lightweight and I love that it doesn’t add a sheen look like a lot of sunscreens - instead, it adds an almost blur look to the skin. Only negative is that I have acne-prone sensitive skin and saw a small bump after a few days. Double check if this works for your skin type! But a great alternative for typical sunscreen use if you’re wearing makeup! I am not a daily makeup user so it almost felt like a light foundation for me, which was fun! nan
