Overall it leaves a nice, glowy finish. However, take your time when first applying it. It took (way) longer than expected for it to settle and I didn’t have much of a problem with that because I rarely wear makeup and if I do, it’s just blush and mascara.Also, be mindful if you have sensitive skin. For some reason, it tingled a bit on my skin and I’m not sure why. It went away after approx. 10 minutes so I definitely avoided wearing a mask right after applying this. If you’re interested in trying this product, go for it but allow extra time when first applying it and seeing how it will fit into your routine. I’m not sure if I will be buying this again because I already have a pretty decent sunscreen (neogen airy sunscreen). Nice but take your time
