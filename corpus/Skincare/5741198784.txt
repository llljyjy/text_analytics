The name says it all. This truly is light. The mattifying aspect is not something I need necessarily, but for someone who has oily skin, this would be a selling point for sure.  I really love the lightness of this cream, as I have a very simple skincare routine and don’t wear a lot of makeup, so heavier products make my skin feel like it can’t “breathe”. Overall, I would recommend this. nan
