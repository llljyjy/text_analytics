As far as Kiehl’s products go, this doesn’t hit the mark for me. I feel like there’s no point to the extra step of adding the powder since once you do it the product just sits there. It’s not like you’re adding an active ingredient for better efficacy every time. So what does the one time do? It’s just more work and more wasteful packaging in my opinion. But, the retinol itself works well and if it weren’t for the whole dog and pony show of adding the powder, I’d give this a higher rating. nan
