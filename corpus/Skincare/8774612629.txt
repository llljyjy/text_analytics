In my experience, this product has changed. The product I received no longer has the Glow Daily Vitamin C Gel Cream, it has been replaced with the Overnight Glow Dark Spot Sleeping Cream. Sephora customer service sent a replacement and it is the same thing! I am really disappointed in this and wish that the website would reflect the actual products correctly. That being said, the Sephora customer service employees I have dealt with have been great - I just wish there was something else that could be done to be compensated for the waste of time this has been - phone calls, chats, the return, the replacement, the second return etc. Misleading product description!
