Gives an instant glow ; looooove the texture and the fact that there’s no perfume in it ; it’s the only product I’ve been using for a week before doing my makeup, and my skin feels very hydrated. Had a littttttle breakout when I first used it, but everything in under control now!!! Pretty sure my skin just needed a little time to get used to it.Overall, highly recommend Sooo soft and gentle on the skin
