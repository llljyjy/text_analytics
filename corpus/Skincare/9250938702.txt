Absolutely love it I received the free trial used it a week and I can see and feel a difference . Very smooth and hydrating I usually have dark circles but I do see a small difference in a matter a short time. I have oily skin but this doesn’t affect it. I love how it doesn’t affect your eye some serums burn if it gets to close to your eye. Definitely buying it full size and using it for my skin routine.  I love that it doesn’t have a strong scent. Hydration here we come
