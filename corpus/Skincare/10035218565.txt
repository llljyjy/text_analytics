It’s most definitely a balm. It’s decent at melting the makeup away but it’s hard to keep out of your eyes. Using it for eyeliner and mascara was difficult because I had to really get in there with it and it got in my eyes (no matter how hard I tried to keep it out.) Once I started wearing my contacts again, I realized I couldn’t use this anymore. It would be a nightmare if it started swimming over my contacts! I might recommend this, as it’s what they use in Sephora on tester makeup, but it’s a little greasy. Good, But Not My Favorite
