Influenster & Clinique sent me this free sample to try for my honest review. Well, I have been a consistent customer of Clinique for over 35 years! This was my first time trying the Smart Clinical Repair wrinkle correcting cream. I apply it under my eyes after washing my face. It’s consistency is light, and really no scent, (which I like that for face creams). It’s silky and smooth. Not oily at all. I clearly have been a huge fan of this because I’m on the last of the container and just ordered one online! I love that Clinique has skin care for all ages. This is why I have been a faithful fan! Thank you! #CliniqueSmart #complimentary @Clinique @influenster @influenster @clinique @sephora @ultabeauty Silky & Light
