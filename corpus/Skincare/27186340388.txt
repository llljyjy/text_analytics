I have redness around my cheek bones and this has solved the problem perfectly. My skin is pretty fair and I don’t have acne but I deal with unevenness sometimes. This stuff smells good, makes my skin feel soft and bright and supple. It does take some time for it to work but it’s totally worth it and it only take one pump of product so the bottle lasts a while. nan
