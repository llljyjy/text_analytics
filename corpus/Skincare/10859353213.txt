Honestly, I was skeptical about using an eye balm, if only because I am so used to using creams and gels for the undereye area. I was intrigued about trying a new format though, and now I can say that the eye balm didn’t disappoint. It’s easy to apply, and I would say makes less of a mess than gels or creams and allows for more control of product placement. I usually do a swipe and then gently smear with my finger outward to the outer eye corner to set in the balm. There is no scent, so I found it does not make my eyes water. It’s slightly greasy but not oily.The hydration is pretty good, especially since it helps to plump out fine lines. I have noticed a reduced puffiness as well, so it’s definitely a beneficial product to use first thing in the morning. I have applied concealer on top and didn’t observe any issues, so it’s possible to use some form of makeup on top if needed. Overall, its usage is convenient for me because it is so quick to apply and then go. nan
