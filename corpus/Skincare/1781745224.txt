Love this product. I’ve been using it for two months and really enjoy how my skin looks and feels after using it. The only drawback is the packaging split where it tapers down from the main tube.  Now every time I squeeze some out it leaks out the crack. Hopefully it’s just a fluke. perfect hydrating sunscreen
