The cleanser itself works well with all the jelly beads, doesn’t lather much, has a mild fragrance and cleans the face good. However, I personally didn’t like the packaging (prefer a pump packaging for easy usage of the product) hence I didn’t reach for this cleanser as much as I use my other face cleansing product. I wouldn’t buy this cleanser again. Nice product, packaging could be better
