I received this as a sample and I’m pretty sure I’m going to replace my current moisturizer with this one when it runs out, I liked it that much. First and foremost, it seems to be doing a great job at keeping my very dry skin moisturized, without feeling too heavy. I really like the unique balm-like texture. The texture’s not going to be for everyone, but I felt it went on smoothly and absorbed well. I’m one of the people who feel the scent is too strong, although at least it fades quickly, so you only have to bear it for a little. nan
