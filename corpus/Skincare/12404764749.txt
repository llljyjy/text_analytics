I was looking for a salicylic acid spot treatment and this works great for me. My acne was worse in the past (grade 3) but has calmed down until recently I started breaking out again. Using these pads once a day on days where I feel extra oily has helped my skin clear up. I use it mostly on my t-zone but occasionally on my cheeks if I feel I need it. Great value and very effective; I saw results within one week of use. nan
