Hands down the best face oil out there for combination and sensitive skin! I have rosacea and the texture and redness can spread all over my face, starting from the sides of my mouth. this oil changed my life. I wear it under a light moisturizer and the rosacea is gone. No breakout! Absorbs perfectly and it doesnt feel greasy at all! THE best oil
