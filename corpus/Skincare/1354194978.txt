I have never tried anything skincare that looked jelly like consistency like this before. It did leave a nice dewy finish to my skin. It was a bit sticky but looks overall was beautiful. I will definitely continue to use this product and I love how cute the packaging is.  I was gifted by innisfree and is very thankful to try it out. Dewy Finish!
