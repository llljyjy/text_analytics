I love this cleanser! I have normal-dry skin but I break out a good amount so this has helped. I donâ€™t use it everyday because it does dry my face out but every couple of days I do and my whole existence feels so cleaned. Especially my nose area feels so clean and nice. It is quite pricey which is why I opted to trying this as the mini first. It is very thick and I use just a bit which is perfect. :) I think I will be purchasing the 36 dollar one heehoo. i feel so clean :o
