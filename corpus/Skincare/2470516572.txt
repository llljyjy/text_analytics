I love this face mask! I tried this today for the first time and it was so cool! The texture feels like exactly like whipped cream there isn’t a smell it’s unscented but it’s so nice! I feel like my face feels so clean now not dry not oily but just clean and smooth but still moisturized.It is kinda expensive though but I think it’d be worth it if you can make it last . Cookies 'n so Clean!!!!
