This is the best serum I’ve tried. It has a watery consistency which leaves the skin refreshing and hydrated. After trying to apply this product for 7 days in a row 2 times a day, I noticed a significant improvement in visibility of my pores, my skin is more glowing and looks healthier. I am very happy with the result. If you are considering to buy this product, do it! The best serum I’ve tried
