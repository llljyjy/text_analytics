I liked it, but I didn’t think it did anything life changing for my skin. Smells refreshing and a little goes a long way, so it will definitely last you a while ~6 months for me). Perfect if you don’t have any blemishes/problem skin. Does what a cleanser is meant to do, but I don’t think I would purchase again since I’m looking to target more skincare concerns. Simple but Effective
