A similar product to Drunk Elephant’s T.L.C. Framboos or Sunday Riley’s Good Genes so depending on your skins needs and your thoughts on a night serum/ mask will determine your success with this product. They’re all in the same price point. For me, this isn’t my favorite of the three. There is a weird homemade play doh-ish smell and it’s tacky on the skin. I typically don’t mind the thickness that sleeping masks bring, but the stickiness/tackiness can be felt on the skin. To combat that, using moisturizer on top calms the texture down. But a product marketed as a mask, shouldn’t need extra products to feel pleasant in the skin. I will say, I do feel like the product did lighten so acne spots fairly quickly and I didn’t notice my skin breaking out with use. It’s just the texture that I don’t live about this product. I can prefer DE’s version over this product. Weirdly Sticky
