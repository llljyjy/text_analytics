I have been using this for a couple of weeks and I have to say I absolutely love this product. It has made my skin so happy (in conjunction with the retinal serum and daily moisturizer). I have been very careful to use spf 35+ daily and I can tell a huge difference in my skin. I now have a dewy glow with fewer visible wrinkles. This is the first time in my adult life I look forward to my nightly skin routine because I can actually see the difference. Get. It. Now.
