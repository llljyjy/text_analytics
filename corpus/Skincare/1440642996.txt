This is a great everyday eye cream.  It is super moisturizing.  My eye area feel plump and hydrated. It brightened me up on the days I used it but I didn’t see much improvement with dark circles long-term. but I haven’t found any eye cream that gets that right.  I like the packaging, love the mirror, but I do wish it wasn’t in a pot and came in a sealed tube instead. Moisturizing
