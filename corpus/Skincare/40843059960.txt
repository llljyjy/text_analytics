This has to be the nicest serum I have ever used! It slips onto my skin really smoothly and leaves my skin feeling buttery soft like silk. It has never pilled with any of my other products and 2 pumps is all I need as it spreads so effortlessly. I love that it is fragrance free and I could not detect any fragrance whatsoever A must have in my 30 year
