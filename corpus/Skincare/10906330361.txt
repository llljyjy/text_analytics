this face mask is my new favourite, i really like how it isn’t too drying on my skin. any previous clay mask or mud mask i have used always dries out my skin and leaves it feeling very tight but not this one. i really like the clusters in this mask and how it gently exfoliates my face as i’m washing it off. my new favourite mask
