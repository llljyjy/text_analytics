I would recommend this serum to friends. I liked the fact that the serum is mixed prior to the first use, though I found the instructions to be a tad bit confusing. I have previously used tretinoin and found this product to be more beginner friendly. It absorbs super quickly and spreads nicely. I did experience dryness and peeling, though thatâ€™s expected with a retinol product and is easily combated with a great moisturizer! Great Retinol Product
