I really wanted to love this product, but it makes me breakout badly every time I use it for a few days or more. I used this for 2 weeks and then noticed my face breaking out. So I stopped using for a week and I cleared up. And just to be sure, I started using this again for about a week with no other skincare product changes. Sure enough, my face broke out again. I love the feel of this on my face and the beautiful glow it gives me. I love how it looks under makeup. But i can’t use this due to it causing red, painful bumps. I use retin-a and spiro on the regular for years now, and this still made me breakout. Maybe this is good for someone who doesn’t have sensitive skin, but unfortunately, this is a no-go for me. nan
