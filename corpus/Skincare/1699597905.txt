I received this product Complementary from @influenster and @drjart in exchange for my honest review. I was surprised how much I liked this. It’s perfect for the minimal makeup wearer like me. Loved the coverage and that it has SPF. A little bit gives the perfect coverage. And the shade match was perfect. It’s not Kki and doesn’t have any of the strange make up SPF smells A little goes a long way
