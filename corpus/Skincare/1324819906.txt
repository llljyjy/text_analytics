After 2 weeks it did minimize some of my lines and wrinkles around my mouth and chin that I was impressed with. However, I do believe this is not for more mature skin and would do well for persons with younger skin for 20’s and 30’s. I’m 57 and need more moisture than this cream provides. Did get compliment on my skin without make up. I was using it am and pm. nan
