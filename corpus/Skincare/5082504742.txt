The new formulation of this product is awful! DO NOT BUY. I bought the old water bank cream moisturizer twice and loved the product. I have very sensitive skin and this was the first moisturizer I’d found that doesn’t irritate my face or make it oily. After using 25% of the container, I have had to stop using this formulation. My under eyes are so dry and my skin looks tired. I’m so disappointed because of the money I’ve wasted and now that I have to search for a new sensitive skin friendly moisturizer. New formulation dries out under eyes
