This product works well but 100% do not recommend to use if in the sun at all within 2ish weeks of using. I use sunscreen and still ended up with a pretty intense sunburn after only 1 hour outdoors. I will use in winter months sporadically but definitely won’t become a staple as we are outside alot. It also has a burn when applying more than other retinol products of similar price points I’ve used. For me it just won’t work well for my lifestyle as a must have beauty bag add in. Avoid sun at all costs
