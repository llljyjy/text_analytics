In the past, it’s been hard for me to find cleansers because I have combination skin. The stripping ones dry me out too much, and the gentle ones don’t help my acne. This cleanser is a perfect balance - it’s able to keep by skin hydrated while still getting rid of unwanted dirt and oil. Would repurchase! Good for combo skin!
