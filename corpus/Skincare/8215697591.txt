I like the spray bottle and refill option for at home tanning BUT i’m orange :( only left on 4 hrs rinse thoroughly and went to sleep. woke up orange like an oompa loompa. and the tan isn’t that even, especially on my legs which should be impossible since I used a mitt. I will end up trying it again since I have a lot now and see if there are any tricks. Oopma Loompa
