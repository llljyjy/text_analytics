I like this product! It’s hard to find a clean vit c serum that doesn’t have added fragrance or essential oils. Knocking off one star as you need a lot of pumps to get protection- so I could see this being used incredibly quick. The pump also doesn’t dispense well. I might try mixing with my ELTAmd tinted spf to get the best of both worlds (spf and vit c without wasting the ilia product or using excessive vit c). I have rosacea and noticed a few small bumps the next day but I think that could be bc I used several pumps to get the extra coverage (resulting in excessive vit c being applied). nan
