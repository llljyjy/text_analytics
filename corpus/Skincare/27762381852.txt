I am always skeptical to try new skin care. I have used everything high end from Skin Medica, to La Mer, to IS clinical, skinceuticals. After a month of using this serum my skin has completely cleared up. I used to get breakouts around my chin and neck and now it is gone. I think the niacinimide really agreed with me combined with the HA. I would highly recommend this Lancôme serum. I have very sensitive skin and a lot of products don’t agree with me but this one has done wonders. Obsessed
