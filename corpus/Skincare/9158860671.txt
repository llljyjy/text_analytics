This is the first Lip Mask I’ve ever tried that actually works. I originally planned to use at as an overnight mask but my lips were so plump & hydrated the morning after I first used it that I started using it during the day. Love that it actually stays on the lips throughout the night and doesn’t dry out! Best Lip Mask!
