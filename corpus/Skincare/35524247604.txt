This overnight cream is a godsend.  It’s light on the face and doesn’t clog pores.  I have very sensitive skin and I didn’t have any reactions or breakouts.  For someone who will buy every product because I’m afraid of botox, this actually works, feels good and smooths out fine lines on your face.  I even had to hide it from my hubby - he wanted to try it!  I also love the packaging, it’s both magical and dreamy.  It’s the little things that count! Better (and cheaper) than botox!
