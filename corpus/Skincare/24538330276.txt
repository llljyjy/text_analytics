This product has been a game changer for me. I used to just expect my acne spots to take a week or more to heal but now sometimes they are healed within days with this product! Iâ€™m blown away! I use this all over instead of using it as a spot treatment. I wish that they could make this product thinner like a serum and give more product in the tube. This lasted me less than a month. Selling a Half an ounce of a skincare product is just crazy. It is very thick and in order for me to rub it all over my face it takes a lot of effort.  That could damage my skin to rub it like that. Please make this a thinner consistency or make a different serum but with the same ingredients and more product in the tube. nan
