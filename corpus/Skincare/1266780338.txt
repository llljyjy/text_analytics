I should have listened to the other reviews. I never got to try this product. First, the directions are itty bitty white on orange paper.  Used a magnifying glass and a lot of bright light.  Second, the hole to pour the liquid into is way too small, thought I’d use a funnel but even my smallest was too big.  Poured very slowly and carefully and still wasted a lot. Third, now that’s done and I’m still excited to try it.  Nope, the pump doesn’t work.  Don’t know if the product is good or not!  Very disappointed! Don’t waste your money
