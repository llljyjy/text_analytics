I was excited when I received this product to try in return for my honest opinion. Iâ€™ve never used a product of that sort so I gave it a good go but was left disappointed. The product did nothing for my eyes but leave them feeling sticky , dry with a blue-ish/silver-ish shimmer that lingers and looks tacky and weird. I would not recommend this product to anyone and especially on darker skin tones. Weird tint to it..
