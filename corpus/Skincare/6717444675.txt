I have incorporated this serum into my routine to hydrate, soothe and heal my skin barrier. I recently switched to clean beauty after a perioral dermatitis outbreak, and this serum has not caused a flare up at all. Itâ€™s definitely a new staple in my routine! Perfect to use for gua sha as well! Love this product!!
