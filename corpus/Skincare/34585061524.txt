I received this product for free from Influenster and WASO in return for my honest review of the product. So far this treatment has helped my acne and has made the redness of my acne spots less noticeable! However, I’m not the biggest fan of the smell. But as long as it’s working, I don’t mind the smell! My skin is dry, but it doesn’t seem to dry my skin out too terribly. nan
