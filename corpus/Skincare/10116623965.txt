This initially made my skin burn on my recovery skin cycling days (when I’d use it for extra hydration). I ended up cutting out my azaleic acid and chemical sunscreen and found one of those to be the culprit and now it goes on just fine. I have combo skin and I’m not sure it’s revolutionizing my skin but it’s an ice extra layer on recovery days. I think it’s good?
