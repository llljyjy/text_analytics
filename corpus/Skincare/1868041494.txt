I like the ingredients and that the formula didn’t irritate my skin but I’m not a fan of citrus smelling products and this one was strongly citrus scented. If you like this smell than I would definitely recommend but it gives me a headache if I smell it too long. Otherwise it’s a good product and did make my skin look brighter. nan
