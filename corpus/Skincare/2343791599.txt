I have been using this for about a week and a half. The biggest difference I have seen is that my dry skin looks and feels moisturized. When I got pregnant last year my skin became very dry and has stayed that way postpartum so this has been really helpful. I like that its a lightweight serum and that it comes in a bottle with a pump. nan
