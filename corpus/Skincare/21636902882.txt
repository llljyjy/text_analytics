I wanted a natural and oil based cleanser to remove my makeup. This does not work to remove makeup well. It never emulsified the makeup or really made it come off easily how I wanted. I have to follow up with a microfiber cloth to actually clean anything off. I can’t recommend this product. Doesn’t work for removing makeup
