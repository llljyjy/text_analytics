I LOVEEEEEE TATCHA RICE WASH SKIN-SOFTENING CLEANSER. I have tried almost every product from Tatcha and all of them have no disappointed me. I have combination skin and I don’t really have breakouts so this was perfect for me. The breakout that I did have, this helped it and made my pimples go away. I would recommend to people who do have acne prone skin to not really use this because it was have little “rice” bits in them that can cause your face to get irritated. Also, if you have super dry skin, this probably wouldn’t work for you either as this can irritate the skin as well. My Favorite Cleanser
