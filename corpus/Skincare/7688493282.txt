I have combination skin that leans a little oily, especially during the summer. I thought this would be a nice lightweight moisturizer that could reduce my PM skincare routine. Even though this accomplishes that, I just don’t like the tackiness on my skin. This is so nice to apply but, after a few minutes, it feels like there’s a super light layer of oil on my skin that doesn’t go away--my pillowcase will even stick to my cheek. This is one of those products where skin type really does matter. Really for dry skin
