This product does what it says and I’m obsessed. Its really gentle on my sensitive skin and cools every time you swipe it. I prefer to use it at night or on days I don’t wear makeup as I did notice it made my concealer look a little sticky and grey. It will be great it the summer for hydration and calming my skin after the sun! A cooling stick that actually works!
