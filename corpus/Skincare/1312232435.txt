I loved the thick consistency and how it goes on smooth. It doesn’t really have a scent , it kinda just smells “neutral“. I do feel like this is a great moisturizer for my dry skin. no clogging or breaking out from it. I havent really noticed any changes in wrinkles , but I haven’t really had this long enough to . need more time
