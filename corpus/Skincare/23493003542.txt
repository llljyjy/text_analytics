I see a lot of reviews saying it doesn’t fully take their makeup off so I will preface this by saying I don’t wear a lot of makeup. With my natural makeup routine, this works wonderful. The most impressive thing was that it was not strongly scented and it didn’t irritate my eyes. Two things that are a deal breaker as I’m sensitive to strong scents and have sensitive eyes. This left my face feeling fresh and clean, without that tight or dried out feeling. You only need a nickel sized dollop to get the job done. It lathers really nicely! Great for light-medium makeup removal
