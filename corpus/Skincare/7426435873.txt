I saw someone recommend this product on an IG story and put it on my wishlist. A few friends got this and the Tatcha Violet-C Brightening Serum for my birthday, and WOW. Over the past few weeks, I have had to double-check myself in the mirror because Iâ€™m shocked by how smooth my face looks! My complexion looks so soft and brighter, and many of my sunspots and scars have faded into the background, which was my biggest concern. They are still there if you look hard enough, but they are not as noticeable as before. The moisture also works incredibly well for my normal-dry skin during the winter season. Love this product!
