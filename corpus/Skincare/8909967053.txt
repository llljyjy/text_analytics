I love the Tula skincare line & was excited to try this! I was happy with the quantity of product but I wasnâ€™t a huge fan of the way it comes out of the nozzle. It is a bit runny & seems to make a mess. Other than that it works great, my skin feels clean & refreshed after using it. I have been using it nightly before my nightly skincare routine. Looking forward to how my skin looks in another month or so. Good!
