I really love the consistency of this cream, but it didn’t work on my T-zone because I have oily skin. When I applied it to my cheeks and jawline, I noticed an increase in breakouts. BUT I did apply it to my undereye area and all over my neck, and I am noticing a difference already! I also like that it doesn’t have an overwhelming smell. The cream is definitely hydrating and lasts all day. I’ve been applying after a shower and again before bed (when I remember to). So far I’d say it’s really helping to “fill in“ my under eyes which is something I struggle with. if you have eye bags or saggy skin, it definitely helps! I would recommend this and would probably buy it again to keep my neck and under-eye area smooth and hydrated. Great Cream but not for oily skin or oily areas
