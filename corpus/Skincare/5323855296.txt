I have been using this product nightly in conjunction with the Vinoperfect Radiance Dark Spot Serum for about two weeks now and Iâ€™m really loving the pairing. This cream has a thick consistency that works well with my normal/dry skin. A little product goes a long way and I would caution against using too much if you have oily skin. It absorbs into my skin easily and does not feel greasy or too heavy. I live in a moderate climate and this would be a great year-round product. While I am not sure if it is single-handedly responsible for fading acne dark spots, this cream leaves my skin feeling softer, smoother, and looking brighter. #freeproduct Luxurious cream
