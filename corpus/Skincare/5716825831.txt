I have very fair skin especially on my legs and most tanners always take me from white to orange. I like this light product because it’s very subtle and takes the edge off the whiteness without being too obvious. I’ve tried it for about a week now and seems you would really need to use quite a few drops to get a darker look. Using 1-2 drops each application is more subtle. nan
