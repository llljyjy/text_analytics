This cleanser is extremely hydrating. It does have some exfoliating beads, but it’s not enough to physically exfoliate with. It’s more so a chemical exfoliant. It doesn’t give me that clean skin feeling, but does leave my skin feeling hydrated and glowy. I would recommend this as a gentle cleanser. Glowy
