Love these face pads!  I always used a light AHA lotion under my moisturizer but have switched to these pads because I heard they contain TXA, the latest touted beauty ingredient.  I donâ€™t know much about TXA but I am sold.  The pads are gentle yet exfoliating and have a clean citrus scent.  My skin feels soft and ready to receive my regular moisturizer.  I am on my third jar and will continue to use them. Is TXA the new thing?
