I never write reviews but I feel like I had to with this one. I have very oily and acne prone skin and this has CHANGED my skin. I usually hate retinal because it makes me break out horribly, but this didn’t make me purge at all and instead left me with incredibly smooth and acne free skin. My discolouration and acne scars have vanished in 2 weeks and this product has given me the confidence in my skin I haven’t had in a very long time. Take it from me who is super fussy with what I use on my skin, 10000% Give this one a shot nan
