I reluctantly kept this as the search for an eye cream was so hard. I should have returned it considering how expensive it was. I was looking for a replacement for he Bobbi Brown eye repair balm that was discontinued. This was not it. The forum also is thick but not like an ointment. I couldn’t put my finger on what the texture was like so I checked the ingredients again. Tons of silicone. Like the first few ingredients. It seems to sit on the skin and not like an occulant. I also wake up and my eyes are a bit red. $95 is going in the trash. Don’t recommend. tons of silicone
