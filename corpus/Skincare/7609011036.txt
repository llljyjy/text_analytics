I’m so impressed with Biossance as a whole for their clean beauty products. From the packaging to the product, it’s very transparent about what you get especially as far as ingredients. While I’m not sure about the plumping effect of this serum, my face always looks so hydrated and refreshed after using. My skin is combination and it’s on the extremes of both sides oily in the center of my face and extremely dry around eyes and jaw area. This serum doesn’t make my skin oily, but it does a great job moisturizing my skin. For a nice cooling sensation, I place it in the fridge. Pricey, but worth it.
