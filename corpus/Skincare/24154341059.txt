I went from using cleansing oils and now this. And I honestly like this so much more. It doesn’t burn my eyes like the oil does as I take off my makeup. This does not clog my pores like other balms have, it doesn’t irritate my skin like some oils I have tried, and it doesn’t dry out my skin like makeup wipes. Removes makeup easily, including eye makeup. Doesnt feel tacky or heavy after rinsing. My face doesnt feel tight or stripped Perfect cleansing balm
