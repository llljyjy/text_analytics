The oil is great and I’ve been using it for years. This bottle can last me over a year (since I only need 2-3 drops per day). However, they changed their packaging and the dropper top is the worst I’ve seen. I’ve spilled more than half the bottle because I took it traveling with me and the top of the dropper popped off. It is not like this oil is cheap, so I was really bummed my cosmetic bag now has 22 dollars worth of oil all over it. Great oil, worst packaging
