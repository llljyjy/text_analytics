I have been using the Glow Drops for quite a bit and can honestly say they are 10/10 amazing. Used at the end of my routine, they provide a radiant healthy glow to the skin. These drops are so so hydrating and contain ingredients my skin loves, like Purslane, which boosts levels of Vitamin A and Omega 3 to reduce irritation. After applying the Glow Drops my makeup applies so so smoothly like never before, with a radiant glow that lasts all day long. All day Glow!!!
