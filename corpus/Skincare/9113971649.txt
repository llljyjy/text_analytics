I donâ€™t really consider myself as having sensitive skin but I did NOT react well to this product. My skin was basically inflamed after the first time I used it, I tried again a day later to see if maybe I just needed to get used to it and it just got worse, so I ended up throwing it away. It has a very strong herbal-y smell that I found off-putting, not like something I wanted to put on my skin. I generally use unscented products on my skin so maybe I am just accustomed to something gentler, but I was definitely surprised that a moisturizer this expensive would contain so many known irritants like botanical extracts and fragrances. Definitely do not recommend. Stay away
