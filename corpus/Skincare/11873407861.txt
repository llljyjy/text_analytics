it’s a nice product, but u gotta be careful with how much you use. i used 3 drops w/ moisturizer and i thought i applied it evenly but its very splotchy and some spots have more colour than other. it gave me a nice colour, but i’d start with LOTS of moisturizer and 1-2 drops…. i would not use more than 4 your first time. it’s nice, but you gotta be careful!! i hope it fades quickly. nan
