This is fabulous! The serum is pretty lightweight, and sinks into your skin fairly quickly. There is a fragrance to it, so if you are sensitive to fragrance I’d suggest to maybe stay away. But other than that, I’ve noticed that within a week of using day & night, my skin looked brighter. I can’t wait to continue using it and seeing more results!The packaging is also super gorgeous - perfect for sitting on your vanity or sink area - and feels luxe & heavy. great!
