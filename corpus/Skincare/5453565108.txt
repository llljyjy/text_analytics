First off, this smells amazing! I received this as part of a free sample program, however, I will continue buying this bar because of the cocoa butter scent, Rih just needs to add a body butter with the same smell because I wish the scent lasted longer. After use my skin feels refreshed and clean, this soap lathers very well. I donâ€™t use it on my face because I have a very specific routine and I try not to introduce too many other products, however, this works well as a body cleanser and would definitely recommend.
