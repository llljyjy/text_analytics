I’m absolutely obsessed with this product. Recently I started using the Anhydrous Salicylic Acid 2% Solution (which has squalane in it) and it’s done WONDERS for my combo-DRY skin... My skin just drinks it up and wakes up refreshed and supple. That said, I do find it difficult to use during the day, under makeup. So when I saw this, and realized it’s less heavy than, and more dry, than squalane, I had to try it. And, boy, oh, boy, am I loving it. It’s exactly what I was hoping it would be. Hydrating, moisturizing, smoothing, and glowing; yet thin, fast-drying and quick-absorbing.  It’s also great for my daughters’ hair, which tends to frizz and tangle easily -- though still a bit much for my really thin/fine hair. I can use it on day-one of freshly washed hair on just the tippy tips, but that’s about it. I also find it EXCEPTIONAL to use on top of my Lactic Acid, which was purchased at the same time, and which I have NEVER experienced dryness or irritation from because of the Hemi. I do notice it pills the slightest bit when layering on top of other serums... Though not all serums. I can layer atop my anti-aging serums no problem, and especially over-top my toner or bare face. Basically, Hemi-Squalane is an excellent choice for added moisturization, to combat dryness, or even to prevent dryness and irritation from other acids or products. A well-rounded product I would not want to be without. I imagine it’ll serve well in the summer, too, when using squalane in the humidity will likely feel too much. I'm in LOVE!
