I used it a couple of times and i didn’t overly care for it because using it around the eyes did give me a bit of foggy vision for a bit which wasn’t my favourite feeling, but I held onto it and one day, my daughter’s dad came home asking if I could help remove some tar from his back (he works construction and is constantly getting tar on his skin that he usually has to either take off with GASOLINE or scrub off incredibly hard in the shower and it usually doesn’t take it all off! I tried this on him and it came off SO EASILY!!! I said it was his now. It gets on his face too and he has black stuff all over his eyes and when I used this on him, he was shook! He’s been telling all his coworkers about it to spread the word that you don’t have to soak yourself in gasoline anymore!!! Lol. As far as makeup removing, it’s good for like, getting the bulk off, but again, careful around the eyes, but just saying that this stuff removes tar... That’s actually impressive. So yes, I would recommend it and just giving a heads up in case anyone has any hard to remove products on them. An unexpected use for this!
