I love it his face cream for hot weather months.  During the summer I prefer the light weight face moisturizers, but it’s hard to find a good face cream that is light and still does a good job hydrating.  It’s light, feels weightless and not like it’s caked on, which is exactly what I need in the hot, humid, Midwest!  I have dry skin, so the balance between a light cream and main thing great moisture is hard to find, I have tested it out for 2 weeks and  I HAVE FINALLY FOUND IT!  Love this product Great product
