I was excited to try IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream! My skin always seems dry, especially in the summer and I was hopeful that this cream would improve both the look and feel of my skin. I can say that my face definitely feels more hydrated! The cream goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. It has a mild scent to it. I use it in the morning and evening to help keep my skin smooth and hydrated all day.  Iâ€™m going to continue to use this cream to help keep my skin looking and feeling good! Hydrates my skin!
