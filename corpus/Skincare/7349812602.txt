I have sensitive acne prone skin and this is the best sunscreen I’ve found so far, and I have tried a lot of sunscreens from across the board. No pilling, doent leave a greasy or pasty feeling on my face, and best of all, it doesn’t break me out. It does leave a slight white cast since it is a mineral sunscreen but its mostly unnoticeable once its all on and rubbed in. Best sunscreen for my acne prone skin
