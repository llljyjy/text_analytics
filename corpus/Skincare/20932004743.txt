I used this product for the first time last night, and as always with YTTP products, I loved the consistency. Obviously itâ€™s a little on the early side to really reports results, but I did notice some of the redness in my face evened out and I felt slightly moisturized this morning than I do on average. (I sleep with rose water toner + YTTP dream mask+rosehip seed oil every night). I look forward to using it again! nan
