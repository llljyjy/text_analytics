I received this #freeproduct thanks to Topbox Circle in exchange for my honest opinion.Innisfree’s Green Tea Seed Hyaluronic Acid Cream exceeded my expectations. It has a light gel texture that absorbs quick and deep into the skin. I was expecting a stronger fragrance, but instead this cream has a mild earthy floral scent that smells absolutely lovely. It wafts into my nose throughout the day without being overpowering, just sweet and fragrant. It applies smooth, leaving behind a soft dewy finish - a perfect base for under daily makeup. My skin feels incredibly hydrated and quenched all day. A light gel with the moisturizing strength of that of a heavier cream. It really gives that ’slept 8 hours & drank 8 glasses of water’ radiant GLOW. Lovely product, worth purchasing. Light yet incredibly hydrating
