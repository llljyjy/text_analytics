I was very excited to try this product, but was disappointed when I did. It is a very thick crème that doesn’t spread easily, so you need more product to cover your face. I didn’t see a difference when I used this product. It felt like I still needed moisturizer after using this product and I have normal/ combination type of skin. nan
