I badly wanted a moisturizer that didn’t have dimethicone, shea butter, or fragrant oils, and I wanted something thinner than the vani cream I use at night. This checks those boxes. This applies nicely immediately after washing my face, or over serums. I’ve had no issues with it under sunscreen or makeup. I haven’t noticed a major brightening effect after using a full bottle, but that’s not what I bought it for, so I don’t mind. (There’s maybe a slight shimmer to the lotion itself due to reflective ingredients, though.) It has a really natural finish; not flat/matte or overly glowy/shiny. It doesn’t seem to break me out, dry me out, make me more oily/shiny, or otherwise change my skin texture, which means it’s doing its job: keeping my skin and moisture barrier stable.This wouldn’t be something I’d grab for repairing my skin, deep moisturizing, or fading scars/marks, but there are other products for that. This is great for staying the course and layering up. I think it will be especially great when summer comes around. My acne-prone skin hates most moisturizers on the market. They sting or cause breakouts or both. But, I still need a layer to keep my skin from getting tight and dry. Finding a basic, affordable product like this has been awesome. Blessedly Basic
