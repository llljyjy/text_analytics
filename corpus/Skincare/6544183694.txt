Works amazingly well! It definitely has a smell but, the results are worth it. I had a lot of dark spots on my arms thanks to hyperpigmentation and they’re now leaving. I use to feel extremely embarrassed wearing short sleeved shirts. Now I feel confident in whatever type of clothing I wear. My next skin goal is exfoliate the skin and possibly work on it with more serums. Disclaimer: I jumped in with the usage to almost daily. However I’m happy and my skin feels normal. The dark spots on my arm are nearly gone and it’s only been 2 weeks! I plan to use this product for 3-6 months then move on to other parts of my body. I also want to get rid of the strawberry legs I have as well. Stinky but works like a charm!
