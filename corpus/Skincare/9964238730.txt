I loved everything about this serum. First of all what a smart idea to have the retinol tablet separate and mix it right before using it! I used the serum for 2 weeks and started noticing that my old skin is lightly exfoliating and getting smoother and improve elasticity. The packaging is great because you can control the amount you music through the little rubber valve at the bottom. It’s sanitary and clean and you can see how much product is left in the bottle through a small window on the side. It’s a lightly scented and feels great on the skin. I highly recommend it. Product of the future
