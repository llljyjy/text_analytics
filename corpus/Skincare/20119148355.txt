Gucci did so well with this product! I received this from Influenster for free in exchange for my honest review and oh boy am I glad I was chosen. Skincare is one of my favorite things to indulge in for self care and I was excited to try this product out. I used it right after I wash my face in the morning and then use it as a setting spray after applying a full face of makeup. The mist is super hydrating and makes for a glowy, dewy finish to your skin whether you use makeup or not. I also use this list as a setting spray and it is long lasting and helps to keep my makeup set all day long. The packaging is so luxe and gorgeous. The bottle is real glass and has a nice weight to it. I will definitely recommend this product to my family and friends and will repurchase this product for use in the future. Gucci did amazing with this one!
