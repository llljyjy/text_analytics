Tried this until the jar was completely empty. I received this item from Influenster and Estee Lauder and Sephora for free in exchange for an honest review. Made my dark under eye circles worse. Made my lower lid swollen at times. Once my entire eye area was red and swollen and this was the only new skincare item. Just wasnâ€™t for me. Maybe it is because I have rosacea. Ouch
