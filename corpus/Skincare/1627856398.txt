Once in my mid-30’s, I started noticing first signs of aging, fine lines and loss of firmness.I’ve tried several anti-aging creams from several brands but this ended up being the best one. It gives my skin firmness the best. My skin feels moisturized throughout the whole day. It doesn’t accentuate my oily T-zone and works wonders on dry areas.With this cream, I can completely skip using serums. That’s why I don’t feel guilty buying this product as it’s the only thing that I need these days. Staple since turning 35
