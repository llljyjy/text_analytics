I recently received this sunscreen in the mail from FAB and I am pleasantly surprised at how good it feels on the skin! All of the claims on this product are true! I love that it is a mineral sunscreen, not chemical, it’s lightweight, hydrating, gentle, does not leave a noticeable white cast when we’ll blended into the skin, and it is almost completely fragrance free, as it describes on the packaging. The only scent that I can pick up from this sunscreen is the scent of some of the natural ingredients included in the product, and even so, the fragrance is not very noticeable and it is not bothersome to sensitive skin types. Overall, I enjoy this product and will be using it throughout this hot summer! nan
