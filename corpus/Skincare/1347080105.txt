Really wanted to love this.  The packaging is nice, it feels smooth and lovely going on, and the moisture it delivers is great for super dry skin. However, my skin hated something in this cream. Especially after using my Rx tretinoin my face would turn beet red hot and prickly. Other moisturizers haven’t had this effect and I certainly do not have sensitive skin. This would randomly happen on my non-tret nights too. I must be reactive to one of the ingredients, just wish I knew which one. I can see how this would be a beautiful cream for those of us with super dry skin, it just didn’t work for me. nan
