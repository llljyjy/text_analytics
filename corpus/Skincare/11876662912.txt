Glowy! They really named this product well. This sunscreen is so shimmery and glowy. Perfect for summer!  It’s a bit thick and chunky if you don’t agitate the bottle before applying but it goes on very smooth. I’ve gotten tons of compliments on my skin when I’m wearing just the sunscreen and nothing else! It’s not too thick and doesn’t irritate my skin or make me break out like other sunscreens. Love it! Glow is right!
