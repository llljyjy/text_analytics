I adore this cream and have purchased for a 2nd time. Yes, the bottle size is tiny, but only a little bit should be used each application, so it lasted me a while. The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because the company stopped packaging this with the little plastic spatula that it used to include. Once the bottle is anywhere past 1/4 used, its extremely difficult to get product out. I actually went to the store to return, thinking my box was missing it but while there, checked many others and it’s definitely jot included. Major design flaw in this bottle without the spatula, but I just snagged a couple of Sephora’s spatulas they use for samples! must have, but need a spatula!
