I wasn’t too impressed by this product. The applicator feels nice but I still I have to use my fingers to get it to fully apply. Then the cream gets a little chunky being exposed to air so the first little bit that comes out of the tube has a bad texture. The cream also stings a little for the first 30 secs. Lastly, my skin is very dry in the winter and I don’t feel this to be super moisturizing. I definitely need to find something a little thicker. nan
