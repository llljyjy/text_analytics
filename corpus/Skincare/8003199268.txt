I wish I took before and after pictures of this! I got this in a FabFitFun box and now I’m going to have to buy it when it runs out! My skin always has fine bump breakouts from my mask (nurse problems). I’ve used this product consistently for two weeks and my bumps are almost completely gone and my skin is tighter/ brighter. My skin is usually pretty sensitive and burns from serums/ retinols, but this product isn’t harsh on my skin at all. Only good things from this serum! Solved my mask acne!
