First of all impressive, quality packaging that’s sustainable and durable with ingredients sourced from Jeju. It smells incredible with that green tea seed aroma coming through that’s just the right amount. It has a nice light cream texture that’s easy to apply evenly and quickly without requiring a significant amount. It also absorbs quickly without leaving any greasy after residue and causes zero irritation to my sensitive, dry, combination skin. I’ve been applying to both my face and neck twice daily(mornings and before bed) for over a week now and my face looks/feels slightly more hydrated than the week before. It’s less dry, white and flaky so I feel confident that with continuous use I’ll see and feel a huge difference.
