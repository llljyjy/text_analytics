Saw the reviews so I figured I would try- never again. Put them on for the recommend 4-6 hours and when i took off they left HUGE red marks on my face. You can completly see where I had placed them. Thought it would go away but after 3 days it’s still there. My face looks way worse then it started off with and couldn’t be more noticeable. Incredibly disappointed and for anyone out there, don’t be fooled by the good reviews that immediately show up first. Be careful-
