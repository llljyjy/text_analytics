I received this product from BzzAgent in exchange for my honest review. I was so excited to try some mini skincare products as I’m always on the hunt for new skincare! I love that these products are cruelty-free, recyclable and free of harsh chemicals. My skin is sensitive, combination and these products all were fine on my skin. I feel with continued use the beautiful citrusy scents of them all may cause slight irritation though. The face cream was really nice, lightweight yet hydrating for my dehydrated skin. The peel I wasn’t a big fan of as it left little pieces of product which were annoying to remove; but my skin felt amazingly soft and looked brighter after use! I’m not a big fan of cleansing balms But this took off several layers of heavy mascara. I can’t speak in regards to heavier makeup looks and full coverage foundations. The smell of all these products are amazing, especially the face cream. I really enjoyed the products and will continue to use them. Thanks Nudestix & BzzAgent for the opportunity!
