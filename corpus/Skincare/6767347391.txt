I love reapplying sunscreen with this! It doesn’t move your makeup and since im more on the oily side it reduces my shine, it’s also very easy and convenient.  I think that on some people it could look powdery. It’s also a bit hard to know how much to put on to get the fully benefits of SPF protection. nan
