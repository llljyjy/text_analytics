I highly recommend this mask! The texture is really interesting and different from other charcoal masks Iâ€™ve used before. There are tiny charcoal beads that dissolve when rubbed into your skin, which makes application kind of fun. It will feel tightening on your face as it dries down. This made my skin feel very soft and refreshed after I rinsed it off. Overall, great mask! nan
