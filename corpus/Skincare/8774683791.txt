Did nothing for me. Didn’t help with pores , blemishes , uneven texture or uneven skin tone. It felt a little too rough to use . Glad I didn’t purchase the whole tube. Herbivore Brighten is the best as it evens out the skin tone and texture and tops it with a glow that others actually notice and mention. nan
