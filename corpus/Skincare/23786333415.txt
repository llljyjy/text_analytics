This isn’t the best nor the worst. But here are my Pros and Cons:Pros- don’t burn the skin- doesn’t look greasy or shiny- fine mist spray easilyCons- smells like strong nail products- product will get to your hair and feels crispy nasty- get little fuzz sticking on your facial hairs from the product so, need to pat it into skin and brush away from your lashes without reapplying mascara. - The seal is loose and product leaks outOverall, Coola needs to advice the formula, smell and packaging without looking for another brand. nan
