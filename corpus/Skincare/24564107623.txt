I wanted to love this product. but with about two weeks of use I found out it was making me break out... liked it at first but it’s very astringent and a bit drying. my chin started having blackheads and sebum because of that. I love my other Shiseido products so I really hoped this would work. I guess it will work for some, depending on the skin type. I like the packaging, I like the smell which is very subtle and I really like the consistency since I don’t like too runny or too thick. nan
