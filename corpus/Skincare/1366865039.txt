The only cleansing balm I have found that takes off all my make up, including my mascara! Normally I have to use micellar water to remove eye makeup prior to using this product. But this takes it all off without leaving my skin feeling greasy or stripped of moisture after rinsing! Definitely my new favorite cleansing balm! Holy Grail!
