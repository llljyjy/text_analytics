love this cream. It feels so rich and luxurious, but it is not heavy or greasy at all. It feels velvety smooth going on, sinks in well and does a great job moisturizing. My skin feels baby soft when I use it. I donâ€™t think I have found any cream or even serum that makes a huge difference in deeper wrinkles, but this is so moisturizing, it really does minimize the appearance of crepiness and fine wrinkles. My pores are not a big issue other than across my nose, so this does seem to even out the overall texture and make my skin look pretty flawless - most days, no makeup even. I think this has helped balance my skin moisture levels so that I have that very subtle glow, evened out the texture and pores, toned down some redness, and overall make a big improvement in my skin. KORRES carries a much larger line that is in my local Ulta, and I would love it if they expanded to line so I could try more of their products! influenster review
