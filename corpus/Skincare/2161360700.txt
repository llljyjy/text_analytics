I love many YTTP products (the Superfood Cleanser, Air-Whip Cream, Mandelic Acid Exfoliant, etc.), but this product was highly disappointing. I have combination oily skin, and this moisturizer was nowhere near hydrating enough for fall weather in New York. I’m shocked that it’s listed as being for folks with dry skin.Overall, would not recommend. Not very hydrating
