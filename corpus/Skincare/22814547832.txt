I really like how this takes off my makeup. It’s so easy, and melts everything off pretty well. The only thing is, when removing my eye makeup, it kind of gives me foggy/cloudy eyes. I haven’t found a cleansing balm that doesn’t, but I just wanted to point that out. Overall, it’s a solid cleansing balm at an affordable price! nan
