Ive recently received this product complimentary to try out and i really enjoy it. Ive been using it for a couple weeks now.  At first i was impatient and was t noticing anything but after using it for a while i notice my skin is more hydrated  and glowing. I like the texture of it and how it absorbes into the skin quickly. Doesnt have a strong scent. I have sensitive skin and havenâ€™t had a problem with this or with mixing on top of other products. I would definitely recommend it. nan
