I have combination and very acne prone skin and this worked well for me. It helped out my breakouts I had going on, and helped leave no marks. Even had a subtle glow. This works best after exfoliating. Disclaimer!!!!! I recieved this product for from Influenster and Sephora for my honest review. However I will be purchasing this to be apart of my routine. Worth the try!
