I’ve been using this for about a week and have found the lotion-to-foam cleanser left my skin feeling hydrated and thoroughly cleansed. I am not a fan of the scent as I was spoiled by the blueberry one. My skin didn’t feel tight which is always a plus and it removed all the day’s dirt & oil without feeling I needed to wash my face a second time. I would recommend this to everyone but especially for those who double cleanse. Double cleanse No More with this Treasure!!
