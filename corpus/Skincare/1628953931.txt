This is the best product I’ve ever used on my skin no doubt. I have dry skin and have always struggled with breakouts the only thing that has ever helped me with them is antibiotics. I was on them for a few months last year but had a very rare and severe reaction and they almost caused me to go blind. After that I struggled trying to find anything else that helped my skin like the antibiotics did and it took me a year but this finally did it. I still will have a break out here and there but I swear to god this is liquid gold. It’s much better than most salicylic acids because it’s hydrating and that really helps my dry skin. I’ve been using it for about 4 months now and things just keep improving. If you have dry skin and struggle with breakouts and have never found anything that’s worked for you, highly recommend giving this a try. I never leave reviews but this product is so good I needed to share. I’ve been trying all sorts of products for almost 10 years now and this by far is the only one that’s ever had clear positive effects. I hope other find it just as amazing! LIQUID GOLD.
