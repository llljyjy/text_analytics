Not only does it smell amazing but it feels so good on my skin! It glides on very easily without being super runny and dries in a dewy light sensation. I’ve noticed a huge difference in the brightness of my skin especially on those pesky dark spots. It’s also super hydrating to keep my skin feeling smooth and plump all day long. Better than Vitamin C Serums
