I hate it when I love a product that everyone else hates. I did not experience the pilling that other reviews were experiencing. This serum is lightweight and covers the redness on my face, which is what I wanted. I like that the tint is a serum formula because I’ve found it less likely to transfer compared to when I use a tinted moisturizer or tinted sunscreen type of thing. I previously tried the summer Fridays skin tint and hated it and will continue to purchase this. For those in a similar situation: I work in a lab where wearing makeup or fragrant things (lotion, sunscreen) can mess up our samples, and this has been my best find. This doesn’t flake and doesn’t smell strongly so now I can still feel good!! Perfect for my work day
