Recently I got the opportunity to try Ole Henriksen Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer. As someone who really cares about my skin, especially as I’ve gotten older, I’ve really focused on products that are easy to add to my regimen. This product has not only improved my fine lines, it has also given me all day hydration. I am an avid user of hyaluronic acid cleansers, moisturizers, and serums, so I’m pretty confident in what works best for my skin and what doesn’t. What I love about this product is it doesn’t leave a white cast on my skin like some lotions can, and it absorbs very quickly, saving my time. Another thing I love about this product is it is creamier than other formulas, but it doesn’t feel greasy or heavy on my skin. When I think of buying skincare, an aspect I consider is the fragrance, and this product is perfectly subtle. It is important to me not to put a lot of fragrance in my skincare, and this smells light, pleasing, and it doesn’t linger after it absorbs. I highly recommend this product. Easy Hydration
