I have combo skin (oily T-zone, normal/dry cheeks) and this winter has been EXTREMELY dry in my area. I got this and I love it but it’s not enough for this type of weather. I’m going to continue to use it after winter. Although, it always leaves a dewy look which I love (even if it’s not hydrating enough for now) NOT for dry skin— better for oily/combo/normal
