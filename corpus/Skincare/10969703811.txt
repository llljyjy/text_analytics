I received a sample for this as a #freeproduct for my review from Topbox and Clinique. I hadnt used Clinique products in a number of years and was excited to try this.  I wasn’t disappointed. I have combination/sensitive skin with fine lines and a few wrinkles. use some repair for age. The consistency was smooth and it glides on effortlessly. It’s a lightweight and fragrance free and I didn’t need to use a huge amount to get full coverage. It feels good on the skin and would definitely recommend!  I will be looking into buying the full sized product for my birthday! nan
