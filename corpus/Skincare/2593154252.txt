Right up front, this smells badly like regular self tanner. Anyone who says it doesn’t is….well let’s just say it stinks. As it is worn over the first few hours, the smell really comes out just as any other self tanner. Honestly this is nothing special at all. It also have me a small rash. It’s just a smelly gradual tanning lotion. Not worth the money for the smell we have to withstand with little color payoff. Likely returning. nan
