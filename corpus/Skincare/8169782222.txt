I was given this serum to try in exchange for my honest review. Thank you Butterly & Clarins for the opportunity. After using this serum for a few days I have noticed my skin retains moisture more, is smooth and glowing. Mixing the two serums together is strangely satisfying and the consistency when mixed is smooth and rich. I find it does have a rich but lightweight oil finish which I was pleased absorbs nicely. The scent isn’t over powering and I really like that it’s full of fruit oils and brightening vitamin C. Double Anti aging serum
