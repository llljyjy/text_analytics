Received this complimentary of Bzz Agent. I love products from Origins so I was looking forward to trying. Definitely is frothy and has the feel of it. I love this face wash and it leaves my skin feeling dry and looking great. My face gets pretty oily, even during the winter. And it has a nice spearmint scent and it only takes a small amount to use Love it!
