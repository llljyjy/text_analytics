You don’t know how much I have been looking for a gentle cleanser that doesn’t dry up your skin. Finding good ones and seeing what people like, I came across this beauty. This product is the best, well for me. Knowing that Mrs. Scarlett have been developing this product for 7 years is amazing. You can tell she put the effort in perfecting this and for only $32!? That’s a steal! I highly recommend it. nan
