DO NOT BUY this. I purchased this 6 months ago at Sephora and I was alternating it with 2 other eye creams I have. I went to use it and within the 6 months the consistency of the cream changed. it just globs on in thick pieces. It is no longer a cream and it is essentially unusable. I went back to Sephora to see if it can be exchanged b/c this is defective and Sephora said NO b/c past 2 month mark. Pretty upsetting. I would not expect an eye cream to go bad in 6 months and terrible for Sephora to NOT STAND BY THE QUALITY of the products they sell. I will probably not be shopping at Sephora much anymore.
