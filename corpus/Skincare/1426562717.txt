This cleanser is just okay. It cleansed my skin and eye makeup pretty well, although there was some residue on my eyes. It didn’t sting my eyes. The smell is very natural and earthy and I just couldn’t get past it. I also don’t like the packaging. It looks beautiful, but I don’t like having a glass bottle in the shower. This might not be relevant to you! Overall, just okay. I like the Inkey List cleanser much better. Okay but smell is off-putting.
