I received this product for free from Influenster and Guerlain in exchange for my honest review. I was so grateful for the chance to try this serum!  It comes in an exquisite bottle, and I love that itâ€™s a dual action serum comprised of natural ingredients.  The formula is thick and rich and has a lovely perfume scent.  It really felt like I was indulging my skin every time I applied it and immediately made my skin feel softer and smoother.   After a few weeks I have noticed my complexion is brighter and more radiant, and my pores are more refined.  This is a premium beauty product, so for me, I would probably splurge on it every once in awhile. Worth A Splurge
