As far as eye products go, this one is pretty decent.  It absorbs pretty quickly and plays nice with other products (no annoying pilling).  The balm texture is pleasant and it does feel good, especially if you keep it in a fridge.  Is it some kind of miracle worker?  Nah.  But I did like using it and  would happily use it again if I came across it in a sale or promotional  package. Not life changing, but feels nice
