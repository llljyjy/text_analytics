If you have sensitive skin - proceed with caution! I’ve used this for a couple weeks and broke out. I gave it a break and used it again recently and I ended up breaking out again. I got red bumps so I’m not sure if it was an allergic reaction or if the 20percent was just too strong for my sensitive skin. I noticed after the first day or two of using it things looked fine but the third day and onwards it made my skin so congested and red. Yikes. sensitive skin proceed with caution
