While the packaging is lovely, this product is very tacky and smells like silly putty. Very, strong, unpleasant fragrance. Every time I used it, the product felt heavy on my skin and left my skin feeling dirty. I would have to use another toner to get the refreshed feeling I wanted. Terrible Smell, Tacky Texture
