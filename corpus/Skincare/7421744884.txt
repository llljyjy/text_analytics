This product set my skin back by several years. I patch tested before applying and spaced out application but my face was still left broken out and painful to the touch. It’s been over a week since my last application and I still can’t get my skin to bounce back. I’ve heard this is a holy grail product for so many people but beware if you have sensitive skin! nan
