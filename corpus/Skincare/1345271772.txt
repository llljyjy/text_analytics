I am a skincare enthusiast and let me tell you - this is an EXCELLENT addition to my skincare routine and you bet it is definitely in my rotation now!  I have dry/sensitive skin and this oil is perfection, especially in the cold Chicago winter!  It’s also a great retinol starter.  I rarely give out 5 star reviews but I really do love this.  I’ve been using it for about a month every other day so I could see a bit longer-term effects.  I use it after my serum, but before my moisturizer and typically at night.  This has helped to REALLY correct the redness in my skin, add moisture, and all-around make me GLOW!  It has not caused me breakouts (hence dry skin) and apart from other reviews I don’t think it has a scent and if it does, it’s definitely not negative.  I will MOST definitely be purchasing it after this bottle runs out.  LOVE! GLOWING review for a fabulous product!
