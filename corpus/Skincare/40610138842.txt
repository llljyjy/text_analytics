I’ve tried all the moisturized I can think of. For years I would change it every few weeks/months. Drug store, expensive, cheap, but this one? This isn’t cheap but it’s worth every penny. It’s light as water and I don’t feel or notice it at all after a minute or 2. It doesn’t clog my pores EVER and I am a believer. Daily greens for life. Worth every penny
