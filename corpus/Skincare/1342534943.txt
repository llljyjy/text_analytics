This is my favourite moisturizer from Ole. It is a lighter mousturizer, which I use for the summer. The scent is like natural essential oils. The consistency feels thick and dense, so you would expect it to be heavy or greasy, but it is not. I recommend this for people who are looking for something less greasy, or a summer cream.
