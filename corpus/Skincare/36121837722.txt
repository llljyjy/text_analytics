I’ve been using the Kiehl’s Super Multi-Corrective Anti-Aging Eye Cream for about a month now. I really like it. I like the way it makes my eyes feel. Silky and soft. There is a very light scent but I can’t quite name it but I love the smell! A little goes a long way. This bottle will last for a good 3 months or so. Unfortunately I haven’t seen a difference yet but I’m hopeful and I will continue to use the Kiehl’s Super Multi-Corrective Anti-Aging Eye Cream until it’s all gone. I received a free sample of Kiehl’s Super Multi-Corrective Anti-Aging Eye Cream from BzzAgent in exchange for my honest opinion. I hope to update my review to 5 starts in the future. nan
