Unfortunately, this eye cream was awful all around. There is shimmer which is supposed to create that brightening effect but it doesn’t set. It looked like a shimmery peach crepe sitting on top of my eye bag. This also means it does not work under makeup. It pilled no matter what I tried. I tried using less product/more product, using fingers to blend in, using a sponge, layering eye creams, on its own, and not a single thing worked. I was extremely sad about this as the claims were promising. This is one of the very few items I had to return because I simply couldn’t justify keeping it knowing how pricey it was. Didn’t work for me. Had to return.
