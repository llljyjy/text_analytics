I received a free sample of this serum to review and have enjoyed my experience. Let me preface this by saying my facial skin was destroyed by the extreme cold weather we had a few weeks ago when I went out to shovel the snow. My cheeks were peeling and my forehead had a rough patch. Then, this serum arrived! Seriously, within one use my forehead felt smoother and my cheeks were more moisturized. Now, after using it for a week, my skin is in much better shape. My forehead has returned to its normal smooth self and my cheeks are no longer peeling. I have noticed some tightening of the skin under my eyes as well! I love the benefits of using this serum, I just wish it wasn’t so expensive! I also would have preferred a fragrance free serum, but that’s my personal tastes. It doesn’t smell bad, I just don’t like fragrances in my facial care. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Wonderful Repairing Serum
