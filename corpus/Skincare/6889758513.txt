I am 40+ with very oily, acne-prone (mild rosacea) skin and this product has made a huge difference in my skin. It has evened out my skin tone considerably - reducing red marks from previous acne - and smoothed the rough, bumpy texture I perpetually had.  I use it AM and PM, but started with just PM until I felt I had passed the initial drying period.  Excellent product. My new daily treatment
