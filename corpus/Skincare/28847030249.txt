For a mineral sunscreen, this is probably the best un-tinted one I’ve ever tried. Even with a pretty tan (though definitely not deep) skin tone, it still blends in pretty well when I apply a good amount. That said, it’s obviously super expensive and it’s pretty oily (I find it difficult to reapply because it’s too greasy like that and a little bit of a purple-ish/white tint starts to build with layers). Nice but not the best
