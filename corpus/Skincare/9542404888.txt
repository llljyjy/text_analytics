This retinol serum is fantastic. I’ve used it nightly for 3wks+ and have already noticed some results. Fine lines around my lips and eyes have started to lessen in depth. I would advise starting slowly though bc I used it for 3 nights in a row and started seeing a little bit of irritation so I started every other day foe a wk then moved to daily. I also love the fact that the retinol is in powder form until you mix it with the serum so it doesn’t lose it’s strength if it sits on shelf in the store. Definitely recommend!! Extremely potent!!!
