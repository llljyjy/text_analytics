I am honestly surprised this has such a low rating. In my opinion itâ€™s not meant to be used as a normal chapstick/balm, but instead as more of a lip exfoliator during your nightly routine. The fragrance is very lovely and I have noticed a difference in softness. Actually love it enough to purchase every color. I wasn't disappointed.
