Great serum! This is a higher end serum, but luckily I was gifted it in-kind. The smell is fresh and light, and smells a bit like tea. When applying, I did a patch test on my inner elbow. It was soft and smooth yet a bit tacky when I first put it on. It absorbed quickly. I havenâ€™t used enough to see a huge difference yet, but I have had no reactions! Great!
