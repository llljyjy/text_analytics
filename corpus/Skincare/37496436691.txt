i was looking for a new cleanser when i found this and i was super excited about it :) the texture was very weird (at least for me) but after every use, my skin was bright red. i shrugged it off and continued to use if for about a month and a half and i’ve been breaking out more and my skin has been so dry. it may work for you but unfortunately it didn’t work for me. maybe in the future i’ll come back to tatcha :)) nan
