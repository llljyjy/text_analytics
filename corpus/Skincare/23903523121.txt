I received this product for free and the opinions are my own. I found this easy to apply and doesn’t take  much to cover the whole face. It is slightly greasy yet as it dries it doesn’t affect the whole affect. Additionally there is a slight tint but it does go away. I am happy to also find a product with a higher spf that can be worn longer with beach and summer weather. Doesn’t take a lot
