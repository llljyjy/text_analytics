What I like about this: it makes my skin feel soft, it has a light fresh scent that isn’t strong, it’s a nice thick consistency and absorbs quickly.What I don’t like about this: the second ingredient is a silicone! The price is way too high for the first 3 ingredients to be water, silicone, and glycerin. You could buy any cheap moisturizer to get those ingredients in the top 3. All the “good stuff” is buried further down and with two silicones creating a barrier on your skin, hardly any of the nourishing ingredients will be able to get through to your moisture barrier. I’m not convinced this will actually improve your skin but just makes it FEEL nice.However, if you don’t care about silicones and price doesn’t matter, then you will probably like this product. It will make your skin feel soft and moisturized and smell good (whether or not it will ACTUALLY improve your skin is debatable). I may use this on my neck, but my face needs more direct nourishment and I don’t use face creams with silicones in them because of that.I received this complimentary item from Influenster for review. Silicones galore :(
