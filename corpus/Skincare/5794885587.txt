I was excited to receive this product.  The packaging is elegant.  Not to much of the hoopla going on. The sorts was big enough that you could read it without having to steal your motherâ€™s readers.  Upon opening it the texture was smooth on my skin. It left my skin feeling cool and evens out the tone and redness. As far as the lines go I saw minimal improvement with that and that is only because it was to soon in my treatment. I did feel like I got a lot of moisturizing from this product. For me this product did improve the overall appearance of my skin and texture.  I absolutely would recommend this product to others.  It had provided all the benefits that it said it would from the beginning. More people should be informed about this product line and what it can do to improve the overall health and beauty of your skins appearance. nan
