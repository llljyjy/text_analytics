I’ve been using this face mask for 2 weeks( 2-3 times a week) and I can see why I like it so much. Fenty skin mask is gentle yet very effective. I used to love Kora tumeric mask with AHA’s before, but since I started to use retinol I feel like my skin can’t handle it anymore and I like this face mask much better. It helps me to get rid of excessive oil and pesky sebaceous filaments. Also the mask doesn’t smell like anything and doesn’t burn my skin. my new favorite mask!
