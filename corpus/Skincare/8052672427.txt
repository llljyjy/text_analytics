I have combination skin on my face , and really dry skin on my body! And I love this product , I have use it on my hands and I can see the difference in one use which I’m excited about! The texture of the balm is not thick and not too thin , just perfect! It absorbs really good without leaving your skin greasy! Also you can put it in your bag and apply anywhere! The package is so simple and the smell not perfume strong, it’s smells so natural and green if that make sense. must have for dry skin!!!
