This microfoliant is my favorite exfoliator I have ever tried. Makes my skin feel so clean and refreshed. It is not abrasive which I really enjoy. It doesnâ€™t dry out my skin at all, but I always moisture after. This was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling, but my review is still 100% the truth on how I feel. My favorite exfoliator!!
