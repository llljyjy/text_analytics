I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I was first delighted by the scent- it smells more citrusy in my opinion, which I would much prefer over the berry scent that the name of the product suggested. The smell was mild yet fresh. Unfortunately, this product did not do much of anything for my skin. Nothing good, yet nothing bad; it simply made no difference at all. I also did not care for the exfoliating micro beads within the cleanser, as they felt cheap and plastic-y. Needless to say, I would not recommend purchasing this product as the only benefit in my experience was the scent. Not impressed
