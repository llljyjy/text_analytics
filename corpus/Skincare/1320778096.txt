I love the sleek packaging. Shiseido skincare is one of my faves. This sunscreen feels super lightweight on the skin and absorbs nicely. Used it under makeup with no issues. Could easily be used as a stand alone product too without layering make up on top. My only remark is that if you use it on its own, it does have a very minimal white cast to it. Other than that itâ€™s wonderful. loved it.
