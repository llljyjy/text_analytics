If this product was only like $20 I would probably repurchase. I do feel like it soothes my skin a little but after using it for 3 months I do not not see enough of a difference to justify the EXTREMELY high price for a hyaluronic acid. Not a staple for me unfortunately! Iâ€™ll finish this product but move on the something else. Not Worth the Splurge
