This lip oil is phenomenal. I have naturally dry lips, and I hate stickier lip oils and gloss, but this stays without being sticky, moisturizes, tastes and smells great, and is extremely easy to use. In particular, I absolutely loved the applicator; in itself it’s a wonderful experience because the head is so fluffy and helps fill the natural creases of your lips. I would add also that because the applicator is so porous, it looks like the oil won’t last very long, but I experimented and was able to use the applicator for 3 coats of both lips. All in all, a lovely product I’d see myself getting again. My boyfriend LOVED it as well, drove him nuts :) **I received this product as a free sample Best. Lip. Oil. Ever.
