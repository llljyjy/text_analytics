What I am using AM: Alpha Arbutin, vitamins c, Hyaluronic acid, moisturizer and sun screen spf45 PM: Hyaluronic acid, Tranexamic acid from Inkeylist, retinol from ordinary ( weak one) moisturizer.   So I really donâ€™t know if it is alpha Arbutin doing the work or maybe all of them helped. 1oz. Bottle lasted me 6 months, I only spot treat not all over the face. Can you tell the difference?? nan
