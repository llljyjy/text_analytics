I received this product from influenster in return for my honest review. I have been trying it out for the past week and I must say I’m in love with it. The roll on balm makes it very easy to use and mess free. It is soo hydrating and definitely de-puffs my eyes. I have even tried to put it on my whole face and u know what , my skin felt super soft, non greasy and well soft and hydrated ♥️ I definitely recommend this product to anyone that wants some extra hydration around their eyes. Soft and hydrating product
