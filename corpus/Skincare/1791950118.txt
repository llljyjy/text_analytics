I initially got this as a small sample, tried it and wasn’t impressed at all. I just thought I looked green and it was drying. So I threw it out. Of course, the sample came with no directions, which was key. I then received a larger jar in a gift pack with the cicapir serum and moisturizer as a stocking gift from my husband. That one had directions, which said you needed to put it on OVER MOISTURIZER. That’s the key. It’s NOT a moisturizer, it’s a correcting cream with sunscreen. And you have to blend it in, the same way you would with a foundation. I have light skin and dryness on my cheeks but over a moisturizer it’s not drying at all, for me. I think maybe many of the reviews saying it’s drying aren’t using it over a moisturizer. It REALLY corrects well, and I find I can get away without foundation pretty well without it if I want a no makeup look. Which is saying a lot because I really don’t like how I look without foundation and wear it most of the time. Really works to correct redness
