My skin has been graced by these products for almost two years and has SAVED MY SKIN! I was using argan oil based products for a while... When my face started getting so dry, and started flaking, leaving red irritated spots around my inner cheeks around my nose. I made the switch and I’m so glad I did!!! The squalane oil in Biossance’s products rehydrated and helped balance and heal all of the redness, no more flaking, ALL GLOW! This set is a must have for anyone that wants to try a new skin care line, as a gift for a friend/loved one, or you just need your favorites in a smaller, travel-size! 4 Holy Grails in 1 Set
