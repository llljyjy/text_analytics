I received this #freeproduct from top box #trywithtopbox for reviewing purposes. This moisturizer is a game changer for my combo acne prone skin. I use a lot of drying acne products, so this is such a great product for my “off” days of benzoyl and tretinoin. It is super hydrating, and a smooth velvety jelly texture. The best part is how light weight it is and how seamlessly it sinks in the skin before makeup application. It is currently a winter staple, but I feel like I can get away with using it all year round since it is so light weight. It also keeps my skin hydrated all day as I don’t see any makeup flaking or patches after my long work day! I’m usually not a scented person, but the green tea scent is very light and pleasant. Highly recommend trying this! A must try!
