I’ve been using this for almost 3 weeks now and I’ve seen a huge difference in my skin! I have a lot of acne scarring around my chin that is now starting to go away, and new pimples are also fading faster. My skin tone which has always been very red is looking a lot more even and redness is lessened. I also started using a new face oil around the same time so I think some of this is attributed to that as well but this product is certainly helping a lot! Great texture, makes my face feel super soft after application. I follow up with moisturizer once it’s absorbed. I like the smell too, it smells like rooibos tea. Great results in 3 weeks!
