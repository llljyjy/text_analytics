Clinique is a makeup brand that I associate with the word “trust”. Its skincare, however, has been really hit and miss over the years. I have normal skin that errs on the dry side in the winter months, and my main concern is staving off first signs of aging. I received a sample of Clinique’s Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream, which I used for a week, in the morning and the evening. The texture is odd; it’s thick and creamy on first blush, but when I rub it between my fingers, I detect a very faint chalky residue. When I apply it on my face, I did feel a tightening sensation but saw no highly visible results – perhaps because I don’t have that many wrinkles to repair, or perhaps because the instructions did state that it takes a couple of weeks to see results, and I didn’t have that much product. Most disappointingly, this moisturizer did sting a little bit upon application. Not good. I also use a retinol product, so any moisturizer I use needs to be gentle, gentle, gentle. This is a moderately priced moisturizer with an innocuous scent, and it may work for you if you’ve had favorable results with other Clinique skincare products. nan
