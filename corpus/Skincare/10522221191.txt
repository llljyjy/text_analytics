Like that it was low scent. Felt that it was minimal lather, but that is not a big deal to me. It did sting my eyes, which is disappointing - because it is marketed as makeup removing, I like something that is gentle around my eye area. I felt like the first few days using it followed by my normal skincare routine, my skin would get overly oily, which I usually do not experience. After a week of using it tho, I think my skin adapted. All in all, I would recommend this as a morning cleanser, or after a day wearing minimal makeup! Certainly did not have a negative experience.
