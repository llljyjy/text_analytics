I received this product through Influenster. I have tried this moisturizer consistently and I am in love. It has a nice, slight, cucumber scent and I love how thick the cream is. I have found that although I have combo/oily skin, a thicker moisturizer always nourishes my skin more than a water based moisturizer. Worth the money and proves that Est√©e Lauder will remain a pioneer and trailblazer in the skincare and makeup industry. Great Moisturizer
