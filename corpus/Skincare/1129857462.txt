I’ve been putting off trying this because I knew I was probably going to love it and it’s crazy expensive. I love how smoothly it goes on and the radiant finish that it leaves. It dries down quickly, which is great because tacky sunscreen feel is annoying. The slight tint is good for my pale skin but I can’t speak to how it may look on darker skin tones. It does seem pretty transparent. The only reason I’m taking off a star is because I think the price is too steep for what it is, and it will be used up quickly due to the nature of the product. Amazing light sunscreen
