I really wanted to love this because of the brand, but it slightly burned my face and I don’t even have sensitive skin. In the time frame that I had to use it (2 weeks), I didn’t notice any difference. I’d rather use Roc Deep Wrinlke Serum. It’s cheaper and I had better results. It did make my skin feel silky and not oily and a little goes a long way. Overall, I would not recommend this product and would not buy it. nan
