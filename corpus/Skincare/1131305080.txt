im really enjoying this cleanser! it is very soothing for angry skin.for reference, Im 40 with menopausal sensitive finicky adult acne prone combo skin. this cleanser has no scent and Iâ€™ve had zero bad reactions while using it! I personally prefer to double cleanse since I use a heavy moisturizer in the winter but this is a perfect second cleanse without stripping my skin! dare I say, I prefer this over blueberry bounce... I think i do! Excellent for Sensitive Skin!
