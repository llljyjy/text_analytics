Absolutely love this serum! I’m hitting the age where I really need to focus on my skin, and routines, this after even one use made my skin look and feel super soft! I use it in the morning after washing my face and right before bed to lock in moisture. It does have a strong floral smell, so there’s that, but the consistency makes it to where a little goes a long way! Use sparingly! Love it!
