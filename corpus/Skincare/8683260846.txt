I have a fair-medium skin tone. This self tanner gives me the darkest and most even tan so far out of all self tanners I have tried (isle of paradise drops and untinted mousse, Jergens, true blue, Hawaiian tropic, etc). The color unfortunately does rub off on bed sheets but not a substantial amount. I prefer to lotion my entire body and then apply this tanner then have a shower after 5 hours to remove the fake tan scent. Does the Job
