This powder-based exfoliant was gifted to me by Dermalogica. It is perfect for daily use. It makes my skin bright and leaves it really smooth. I have seen a visible change in my skin texture within a week and I highly recommend it. Itâ€™s easy to use and is perfect for all skin types. It is a bit pricey though but worth every penny. Must have!
