This was such a great product for my skin!  I started using this Dermalogica daily microfoliant a few days ago, and my skin felt smoothe and soft after the first wash.  I really like that it’s a powder, and you only need to just barely get your other hand wet in order to rub your hands together with the powder to make a paste like substance to wash your face with it. I have combo to dry skin, and I’ve noticed after the 3rd day of using this face wash that my makeup sits better on my face, and my face feels more hydrated and soft.This is definitely a great face wash for people of all skin types.Complimentary from dermalogica sampling Great for all skin types
