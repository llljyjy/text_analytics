Love this! I received from #trywithtopbox as a #freeproduct. I recently became introduced to essence and was excited to try this as it had Vitamin C. I use it after i cleanse, before doing the rest of my skin routine to give the products a boost. I love how refreshing and cool it is on my skin. The Vitamin C has helped brighten, and soften my skin. Which is amazing with the hot weather weâ€™ve been having. I use this in the mornings and in evenings when I skip the retinol for the night. I noticed changes pretty quick. I also love the bottle it comes in and how easy it comes out. Amazing refreshing on the skin
