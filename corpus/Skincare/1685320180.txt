How can people made up full on can write reviews about this product. True I was skeptical at First, why are people made up professionally reviewing this product?. “Influencers“ wanna-bes. I realized that to name something oil/serum/toilet water is not the point! Did it make my skin gorgeous, and did it improve the condition and elasticity and even tone of my skin? YES!!! only downside is that it expensive. But I can afford it. Best thing ever~
