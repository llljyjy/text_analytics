I was worried this gel cleanser would dry me out especially because I’m on the drier side, but an employee helped me pick it out and said there was an ingredient in it that would help with not drying it out? Anyway, it’s been working well and I don’t think it’s been drying my skin out more than it is. I find that my acne has been less and if I do get a pimple, it doesn’t take as long for it to go away. I like it
