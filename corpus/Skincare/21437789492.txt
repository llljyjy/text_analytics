this cleanser has changed my skin. I’ve been using for over a year now, and I keep it in heavy rotation in my skincare routine. I always use at minimal 3x a week. When I can feel my skin starting to breakout, I’ll use it once a day. It has helped to reduce multi pimple breakouts and breakouts in general. If you have hormonal acne - you better buy this now!First photo is pre- trying this product & second is after 5 months of using cleanser. holy grail for taming hormonal breakouts!!
