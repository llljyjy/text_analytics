This product was hydrating and more of an oil than a lotion. I found the product to be minimally sticky when you first put it on but the stickiness faded quickly once it soaked into the skin and hydrated. The smell is very soft and clean and minimal. I enjoy the packaging of this product. I would repurchase. Yes: purchase
