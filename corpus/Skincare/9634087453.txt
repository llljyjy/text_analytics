This was just an OK sunscreen.  The first thing I noticed after shaking was the consistency.  It’s very drippy and watery.  However, that does mean it’s lightweight and great for layering.  I just wasn’t fond of the watery feeling.  The second thing I noticed was the low SPF and protection time.  35/40 minutes isn’t the best reapply rate.  Ideally, this would be perfect for under makeup for running errands and expecting light sun exposure.  I wouldn’t feel the most confident using it basking in the sun all day. It’s a solid ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️
