Doesn’t have a strong smell and it’s pretty gentle on my sensitive skin. I have combo/dry skin with acne and it has helped so much, especially with the texture on my forehead. I initially bought the mini size to try it out, and after finishing the bottle, I went and bought the full-sized version. It’s now my go-to cleanser. Highly recommend giving this a try! Great product
