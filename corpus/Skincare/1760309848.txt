I love this spray!! I have used other facial sprays from La Roche but none are as Hydrating and gentle on my sensitive skin as this one. I had extremely damaged skin from using too many abrasives and my skin has always been sensitive so it took a while to get my skin back to what it was but this spray helped me so much! I couldnâ€™t use any toners even ones designed for sensitive skin because it would irritate me more but I just spray this once I finish washing my face and I have no irritation, it makes putting on hyaluronic acid easy and helps absorb it better. And then after moisturizing I spray one more time. It really is worth it. I have already purchased my second bottle and will continue to do so. Great for sensitive skin!
