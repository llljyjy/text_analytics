I usually never try or purchase Sephora brands because i don’t see much reviews. However, I was sent this item and was in need of a brightening product for my eye bags! I used it under my eyes and over my pimples, and they dark spots did lighten up!  i also love how it’s a vegan and clean and how Sephora is coming out with better products for our skin! It’s a reasonable price so you should get it and try it out! Surprisingly good!
