Two stars because this did clear up my mild rosacea during the month that i used it. That said, this product created wrinkles like i have never seen before!!! I am 39, but people tell me i look 29 because of my skin. After using this product for a month every evening, i ended up with a two-inch long indentation/wrinkle going vertically down the middle of my forehead that was never there before. I read more about lactic acid after this, and it apparently thins your skin, so it must be showing the grooves of my face now. The articles say that it “temporarily” thins your skin, so i will be hoping with fingers crossed that my skin eventually thickens and smooths back out. Very upset with myself for using this. This product could work for you, but i wanted to write this as a word of caution! Your mileage may vary
