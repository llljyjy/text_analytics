I got this moisturizer because it’s one of the only brands with good EWG scores. I wasn’t expecting much because on the whole I don’t think clean beauty delivers as good results as regular skincare, but this surpassed my expectations in every way! I have rosacea and quite sensitive, very dry skin. Despite this, I hate creamy creams so I’m always looking for a gel moisturizer that still packs a punch. I’ve been using this throughout the Chicago winters (harsh winds and dry heating) and my skin has stayed dewy and plump. I would never normally apply a moisturizer without cleansing my skin first, but on my laziest days I felt I could apply this just throughout the day because it’s non irritating and would never break me out. My skin used to be so dry it would get tiny bumps all over as a coping mechanism / to hold onto moisture and they’ve completely gone since using this product. This also doesn’t pill no matter what I put underneath. I’ve used different vitamin c serums, acids (lactic, Glycolic etc), different hydrating serums and different eye serums all together (like 5 layers) and it has never pilled! Some clean products don’t hold up well over time, but travelled to Brazil with hot temperatures and dipped my fingers in here at the gym, in the airpirt and different hotels over the course of 4 months and the color, consistency, smell and efficacy is the same as when I first opened it. I seriously wish I could bathe in this. Obsessed
