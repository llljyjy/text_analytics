I got this product to test out from Influenster and I was disappointed because in 2022, it’s weird that darker shades are still not a common thing. I got the darkest shade and it was so ashy on me. Texture wise, it was light and didn’t feel like I had something on my face but I obviously couldn’t try it as I wanted to. If you’re a dark skinned person looking for a bb cream, I’d tell you to not do it. For everyone else, I’m sure it will be what you need. nan
