I received this as a free sample from Influenster and Clarins in exchange for an honest review. I LOVE the counterpart facial product to this but I’m not totally sold on this one yet. The moisturizing component of this is great but I’m  it sure it did much for my dark circles/overall brightness and any firming. I will stick with the facial product and my current eye cream, but I appreciate having the opportunity to test this product. good, not great.
