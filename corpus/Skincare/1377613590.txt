I really like this product, I use it in conjunction with the SOS spray and they’ve both really helped my sensitive skin. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars was because of the delivery system. A lot of product gets lost because it kind of splatters. I cup my hand around the nozzle to keep the product from landing everywhere, but my hand. Please change the delivery system Tower 28! I'm a fan!
