It says you can use day and night, but from my experience night is best. When I use it in the mornings, my makeup pills and looks like my skin is peeling. I appreciate that there isn’t fragrance and I haven’t noticed any negative effects other than when using during the day, but I haven’t noticed any improvements yet. It’s only been a couple weeks so I’ll give it another 2-3 weeks. Not bad not great?
