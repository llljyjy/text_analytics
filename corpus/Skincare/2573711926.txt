I can’t believe how light and moisturizing this product is. A little bit truly does go a long way. When applying, there were a few times I actually had to remove excess product from around my eyes. You really get your money’s worth with this eye cream. I noticed quite an improvement in the skin around my eyes-no more dryness, and more supple. I received this product from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. Look no further for your new eye cream!
