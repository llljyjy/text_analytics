I reallt wanted to love this but I found it super heavy and clogged my pores. When applied it’s a new heavy gel texture so for someone who doesn’t have dilated pores it honestly would be super lovely! The gel cream did make my skin feel baby smooth and really moisturized, it was just a little to much for my pores. Good but not great for pores
