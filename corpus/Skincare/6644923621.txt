Brought it multiple times and it has become over the years one of my favorite moisturizers. The creamy texture and how light it is on the skin make it a must for me. The only con is that it is a bit too rich for oily skin thus I don’t apply it on my T zone. Overall this brand never disappoints me, the product is great and I like the fact that it comes with a little “spoon“ to scoop the product. A VERY GOOD PRODUCT INDEED
