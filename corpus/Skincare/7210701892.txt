Wanted to try something different from my Ole Henriksen and the reviews led me to believe this was it... Sadly no. I have chin acne and tend to be on the oily side so we gave it a shot. Stuck with it since December and it did nothing but make my breakouts more severe. I did the whole regime of clear and it left me worse for wear sadly. My skin just couldnâ€™t handle it. As soon as I stopped using it/everything all together, my face seems to be clearing up. nan
