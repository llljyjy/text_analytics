Had the opportunity to try Lancome’s Regenerie H.C.F. Triple Serum for over a month and can confidently say it is one of my favorite serums for night time use. It’s a combination of a cream, gel and emulsion with ingredients I’ve used before and work well like vitamin c, hyaluronic acid and ferulic acid.Let’s start with the superficial things. Beautiful bottle and love having it on my vanity. It is made from plastic and wish it was made of glass given the cost. The pump required little force BUT it was annoying to really pump several times before all 3 formulas came out at the same time. The first formula to come out was the gel first pump and it was out, then after 3 pumps the emulsion and last is the cream and I lost count by the time I got it to come out.It has a light scent which others might not tolerate but I like it. It has a nice texture however, it left a rather oily residue on areas of my skin that were normal but my dry areas absorbed it completely. For this reason, I used it at night only since the residue made it hard for my make up to stay on even with a primer. That said it worked beautifully on my dry areas which also happen to be where I have a lot of fine lines. I saw the gradual improvement and my skin looking plumper to reduce the appearance of the fine line and a bit more elastic.It is not a miracle potion that works overnight but I did see results on my 40+ yo skin and felt and looked great after use. I would definitely buy this again. Love the Serum, Hate the Pump
