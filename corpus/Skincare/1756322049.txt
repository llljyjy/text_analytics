After using this 5 times a week, and using my last one today I can confidently say you can 100% SKIP these. Barely any serum. I even kept them upside down hoping the serum would spread to all of them. I also closed the lid tight to ensure they donâ€™t dry out. I love PTR acne clay mask and their green cucumber mask. I recommend those. But stay away from these eye patches. The cucumber eye patches from PTR had way more serum than these ones. Major disappointment
