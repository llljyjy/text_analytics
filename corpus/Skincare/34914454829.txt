have been wanting to try this for YEARS and finally splurged and got it. it’s SUPER thick and was not good on my dry/combination skin. it just felt so heavy EVEN when i used or mixed with a lot of moisturizer. you don’t need a lot cause it honestly makes your skin pretty green tinted. i know that’s the point to cancel out the red but it’s a lot. wanted to love this SO bad too thick and heavy
