As someone with very pale skin i expect this show up easily on me but it toook almost 4 layers of puttin git on before the colour showed up and now its all spotty and streaky i look like coffee spilled all over me. it also leaves a sticky residue on the skin when you first apply it and makes my skin a bit itchy, i dont like that its transparent when it comes out makes it very hard for me to see where the tanner is being applied and I have to wait for 3 hours before knowing if i missed a spot or not, do not recomend this one go with their other tanner instead patchy. sticky and misleading
