This product gets the job done. I have normal-combination skin and it just feels very heavy on my skin. I would say this is for very dry skin, or it should be used as a night cream. It’s really heavy and not ideal for use under makeup or throughout the day.It definitely moisturized my skin, so it does the job there. However, I didnt feel like it provided my skin with the benefits of a good moisturizer. It didn’t make my skin baby soft or dewy. It felt mostly cakey and kind of greasy.I would only recommend this to those who have dry skin or to those who want a night cream. But there are still way better products out there that can be bought for cheaper. It's okay.
