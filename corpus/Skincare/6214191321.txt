Great summer time moisturizer, I was given two containers of sheseido energy cream to try. I like it, but it can’t keep up with winter dryness for sure.  It has a sun screen that doesn’t bother my skin, so that was great, but I don’t feel like it offered enough for the end of winter. I needed more layers. Great but not for winter or really dry skin
