It’s a nice enough cream but I didn’t notice any big change in my skin. My skin seemed to soak it up but then left it looking not moisturized and I had to add more before I went to sleep. I did like the texture of the cream it was very silky it made me think that it was going to be very moisturizing that’s why I was a bit surprised that it wasn’t at least for my skin. I don’t think I would search this out on my own to purchase. So so
