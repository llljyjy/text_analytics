I’m going to be honest, my eyelids have betrayed me over the last few years. I’ve always had what’s termed “bedroom eyes“ but the last 5 years or so they’re just...tired. A little saggy. Sad. So I gave this ’lil jar of goodness a try and lo and behold, it helps! I look perkier, more awake, you can see more of my eyeliner AND it smooths and plumps my under-eye area! I’m still considering an eye lift, but this just bought me some time. Love it! The Only Reason I Look Awake Right Now
