The multi dispenser of this product is interesting and the serum has a lovely creamy gel texture. It sinks into skin leaving it really nourished without heaviness- I appreciate that. There is instant plumping and I did notice luminosity in my skin over the testing period.However, the scent of this serum sadly completely ruined the experience of it for me- it’s so perfumey and it made it very difficult for me to test it properly. I don’t mind scented skincare if it’s more subtle or herbal, but this seems floral perfumey.Overall this is a nice product, but the scent didn’t work for me. Lovely texture, really disliked the scent
