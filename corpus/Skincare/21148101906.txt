This new product is so nice. It’s so soft as I applied and it literally melts on your skin, easily spreading even a small amount. Reminds me of the consistency of supergroups unseen sunscreen and the old maybelline baby skin. I am acne prone so I was curious how this would work. It’s not as green as the product images; it has some beige tones in it. But I don’t mind it. The green tones covered up my redness and felt like a very light foundation. I My skin looked so nice and smooth without having to use a ton of product. I also love how it has skincare ingredients that help my skin heal too. It will for sure be an every day staple for me. VERY cool new product
