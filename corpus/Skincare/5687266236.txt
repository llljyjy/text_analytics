I have never left a review for a cleanser — I mean, it’s just soap, and most soap do the job of cleaning fine. However, I’m highly impressed at how gentle and creamy this formula is. I was initially worried because this product didn’t have a lot of reviews compared to the other “famous” brands and hyped cleansers; however, it’s now my new favorite. I have washed my face multiple times over the course of the day today, and it didn’t dry it out at all. I’m impressed! I just wish it was a little more affordable lol. I’d totally use this as a whole body wash. Holy grail cleanser — gentle, milky, foams!
