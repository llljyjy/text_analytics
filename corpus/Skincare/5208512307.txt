I love SuperGoop, and this was my first summer wearing the Watery Lotion since I have to stay away from vitamins c and oils because of the chin laser. This product is small but last months, and I use it every day for at least 2.5 months thus far. It has a watery lotion feel (much lighter than a cream). It also leaves a slight glow and shine. I love the glow and hate the look of dry skin. And it feels perfectly moist and smooth. I like not wearing make-up with it, because of the even tone it gives me. But to each Itâ€™s own. :) Long Last Wear, Product and Protection
