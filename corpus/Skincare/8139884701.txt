it’s expensive, I totally get why someone would pass it by based on that alone. I personally love this and a little splurge on skincare makes me happy when I know I already love the product. I use it at night in the warm months and morning and night in the cold months. so far my skin loves it! I’m sure you could find a cheaper alternative, but I love this one personally. my skin thanks me for this
