I am currently using a face soap and Shani Dardens lactic acid (toner on nights i use it) and it’s absolutely one of my favorite products. I was super acne prone in high school but then just  monthly breakouts, a mix of stress and hormones. It’s been making a huge  difference on my scars. I use it 3 times a week  and after the first time, I started to notice that my cheeks looked calmer. I’ve actually been going out in Public without any foundation on! This is the softest my skin has ever felt! I’m actually in love, highly recommend! nan
