I bought this to try something different than the classic laneige lip mask. It’s *fine*. The smell is very pretty and rosy which I like, but moisture wise, the laneige wins by a mile. I use the rose stick balm and I feel like it actually does a better job than this. It’s not bad enough that I think I’ll return it, but I definitely wouldn’t repurchase it. Fine as a balm, not as a mask
