Received this  Augustinus Bader soothing cream complimentary from augustinusbader and influenster in exchange for my honest reviewFirst let’s talk about  how gorgeous this glass jar is !!  100% recyclable glass jar and 100% recyclable PP refill insert The  cream is thick and has no fragrance which I love Little cream goes a long way on your face/neck.My skin was not irritated after putting it on. Was non-greasy which was great and did absorb fast making my skin feel super soft & smooth.My skin was instantly hydrated. I used this  in the A.m and in the p.m Loved how glowing my skin looked also leaving it very hydrated. I didn’t notice as much with the firmness , but I did enjoy the cream and days I only had this on my face no other makeup ! This cream helps to reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles and hyper pigmentation(after a few weeks of using I did notice a slight difference with fine lines) I was using it morning and at  night Thick cream
