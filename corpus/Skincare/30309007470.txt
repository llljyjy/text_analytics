First of all, pay attention to the quantity. This thing is tiny. Here’s a comparaison photo between the ordinary 60ml niacinamide (twice the amount of product) which is basically the same price (oops didn’t realize the picture was blurry). So get the Ordinary instead if you want this product. Even then, I don’t recommend this product because the concentration is 10% which is way too much for niacinamide and will probably have reverse effects. The ideal concentration of niacinamide is between 2-5% for maximal effectiveness. I tried cancelling this order because I realized it was 10% only after placing the order but it was too late. Anyways, I don’t recommend and neither do dermatologists Skip this one
