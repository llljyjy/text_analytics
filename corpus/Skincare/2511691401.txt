I was the first one to try it in our family and knew I had to introduce it to my mom, who instantly fell in love with it. The Bobbi Brown moisturizer is frequently repurchased because we go through it so fast and it makes foundation look stunning! I don’t believe in buying primers, I find most of them to be a gimmick BUT this one is fantastic! I’m actually kind of annoyed Jeffrey Starr made it so big because now it’s sold out almost everywhere. The entire family loves this moisturizer
