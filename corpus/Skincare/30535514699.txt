I love this stuff, I’ve been using it for a year, I managed to make one bottle last that long! I love this sunscreen, though sometimes it does pill I found that when I add more sunscreen it doesn’t pill.( also, don’t press to hard when applying)  I love how it makes my pores look invisible after using, my face gets greasy easily so on really bad days I’ll avoid it but it rarely gets that bad. this saves my skin and it’s my favorite primer as well for makeup days! it comes out whipped and fluffy and blends in to be invisible. perfection! works well as primer too!
