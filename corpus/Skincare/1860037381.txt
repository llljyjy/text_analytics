Unfortunately, this moisturizer did not sit well for my skin. I have normal to dry skin. I tried a sample of this on my skin hoping to like it. First of all, the smell was decent until I placed it on my skin. It just wasn’t pleasant. Next, the moisturizer just sat on my skin. It wasn’t absorbing at all. It got white marks all over my skin. Sadly, I won’t be purchasing this. Not for my skin
