so lately i’ve been under a lot of stress and i’ve started breaking out on my forehead. i applied it on my acne and within an hour, they’ve decreased in size. i was so shocked i had to touch my acne (yes i know, that’s bad lol) to make sure! this serum is a little greasy in texture but don’t let that scare you! this works wonders and it’s only a couple bucks! i’m reaching for this again :) wow... just wow!
