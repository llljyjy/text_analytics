I never write reviews but I just had to come here and share how much I Absolutely love everything about this face wash. It smells amazing, feels like a mini spa day every time you wash your face. It removes 99% of my makeup (even the heavy stuff) after just one wash. After 3 weeks of using twice a day (morning and night) everything about my skin has improved! Texture, tone, pores and even oiliness has reduced significantly. Just to be clear, I haven’t changed anything else in my daily routine. This face wash is magic and if you’re exhausted from going to dermatologist to dermatologist, buying expensive face washed and creams and oils and routines like I was… you might as well give this a try. I hope it works for you like it did for me! XxV nan
