I loved it after one try! it didn’t irritate my skin and left my face baby smooth! the one thing i don’t like about it is that i can’t use it with my Mandelic acid exfoliator, but that’s to be expected. It did, however, stain my neck yellow longer than my face but i’m also really fair skinned and it didn’t last much longer. can't wait to look younger
