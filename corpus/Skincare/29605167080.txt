My skin has been dry recently so whenever I just use sunscreen as a base, my makeup always clings to my dry patches. This has been a real game changer. I apply it over my cosrx sunscreen and it doesn’t pill at all, leaving only a slightly tacky texture on my face which is perfect for my concealer (Dior forever). I don’t apply any powder over it aside from my under eyes and my makeup doesn’t crack all day! Very impressed. best primer for dry skin
