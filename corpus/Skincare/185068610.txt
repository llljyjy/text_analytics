I am a new Invisalign user and my lips have been horribly dry, flakey and painful. I am sensitive to a lot of ingredients and have a hard time finding lip balms that don’t make my lips worse (I have bought so many).This has saved my lips! Hasn’t caused a reaction and my lips feel great. I started using it only at night but now I also use it during the day. I can’t recommend this enough. Magically stays on and moisturizes
