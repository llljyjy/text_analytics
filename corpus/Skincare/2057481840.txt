This product is great for everyday cleansing. I used it at night to wash off the impurities of the day. It has a good lather and doesn’t irritate my skin. But for some reason when I used it to wash off makeup, it would burn my eyes but it doesn’t burn when I use it to wash my face when I don’t have makeup on.  Maybe it’s because of the products on my face. But anyway, it doesn’t wash off makeup well. I would need to wash my face twice to get everything off. Nice no make up cleanser though.
