I honestly never expected to fall in love with a product as much as I have with this balm. It absorbs so well and your skin instantly feels so incredibly smooth. The morning after I used this for the first time, I could still feel the softness and my skin had absolutely no redness. I thought this might just be a fluke, but it’s been the same every morning since. I will buy again as soon as it’s back in stock. This is 100% my new holy grail serum/balm! In LOVE with this balm!!
