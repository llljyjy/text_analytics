I like that this self tan doesn’t smell as strong compared to others on the market. I thought it would be okay that there wasn’t a colour guard, but I was reaaaal wrong.. but that’s more so a user error/preference. I did find that it transferred on to my white sheets, just slightly. I really did enjoy the colour though, but I will be returning this. nan
