I have been using a skin oil from another company as a moisturizer at night for quite some time. (I put it on over a layer of acne medicine at night, because I still get occasional breakouts, even at 55!). And, although the other oil works nicely and leaves my skin soft and moisturized the next morning, but without leaving me greasy when I wake up, (so, really, the same as this one), the other brand has an annoyingly strong smell, whereas this one works just as well and has no scent at all. Also, very importantly, both bottles are the same size, but the other brand costs more than twice the price for no visible difference! I am so glad I found the Inkey List skin products. They are excellent quality at very reasonable prices, and I will be using them for all my skincare needs from now on! Very moisturizing, not greasy, great price!
