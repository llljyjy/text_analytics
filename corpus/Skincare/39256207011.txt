I really enjoyed using this Laneige water bank blue hyaluronic eye cream product. Iâ€™ve been using it for two weeks almost daily. I used this primarily in the mornings and it really helps reduce my dark circle / eye puffiness. The product has a soft silky feel and it was very soft on my skin and I like the pleasant feeling on my skin. I would recommend this product to any person that suffers from puffy eyes or dark circles #tryitwithtopbox #freeproduct nan
