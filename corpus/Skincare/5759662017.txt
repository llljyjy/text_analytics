I put it on at night and when I wake up my skin feels so soft! I hate the price but honestly it is a game changer for me. I used to avoid all oils since I have sensitive acne prone skin but I have never had a breakout related to this oil, Iâ€™m obsessed. I also appreciate that the scent is almost non existent. works amazing for me
