Wow I absolutely love the packaging because once you open it, it’s very soothing on skin! It’s lightweight and definitely feels moisturizing for my dry skin. It does have a light scent to it, but it’s tolerable for me. Overall, a good cream I can’t wait to keep using in my routine! Green Tea Moisturizer
