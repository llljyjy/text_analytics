The Vitamin C Lactic Oil-Free Radiant Moisturizer is a new favorite! I love it so much! I use this morning and night, two to three pumps each time. I have noticed a general improvement in the texture and moisture level of my skin while this product is in my routine. This product is lightweight and hydrating. In just two weeks my skin has an even skin tone with a fresh glowy appearance. New Fave!
