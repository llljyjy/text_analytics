I received this as a #freeproduct from #topbox. I have combination skin and used this product in the morning and at night. I really enjoyed this serum especially paired with their Wrinkle Correcting Cream. My skin felt very hydrated and supple after using it. The sample wasnâ€™t big enough to notice a different but I would recommend this product because of how it made my skin feel after using it. Nice product
