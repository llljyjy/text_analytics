I really enjoy the gel consistency of the product, as it sinks into my skin easily and I do believe it brightens my dark circles. HOWEVER, I hate hate HATE this tiny bottle. I just bought the thing 2 weeks ago and the pump already stopped working because it cannot get all the product! Love the formula, HATE THE BOTTLE!
