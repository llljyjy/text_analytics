I have sensitive, dry skin and normally use the Herbivore Pink Jelly Cleanser cause it’s one of the few cleansers that doesn’t strip my skin. I can use this twice a day and my skin feels soft and not overly dry afterward. No issues with irritation or breakouts. Definitely a favourite! Great Cleanser and Value
