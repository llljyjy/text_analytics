This was a nice gel cream. It moisturizes quickly but leaves a bit of a greasy feel even after a few minutes from applying until it starts to feel like a soft silk primer.There is no heavy perfume or scent to the product. I use this as prevention to prevent any wrinkles and dry spots around my eyes. All in all, I like the texture but wish it didnâ€™t feel as greasy afterwards. nan
