The cream feel rich and luxurious without the heaviness often found with products thatâ€™s have that description.The scent is so light that I doubt it would bother anyones sensitive skin.It minimized my fine lines, wrinkles and pores which I absolutely loved.The product feels like it would be perfect for all seasons as well. It was rich enough to hydrate in the dry winter months yet was not oily or greasy for long wear during the summer.I will definitely be rebuying this product! nan
