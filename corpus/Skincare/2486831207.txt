Tried this oil in store on my hand and loved how it absorbed. Most oils just sit on the skin but this will absorb and make you look like you got 15 hours of sleep and drank 2 gal of water lol. I absolutely love this stuff. I use tretinoin so it can be drying, and this Works great as the final step with my Aveda tulasara skin creams. nan
