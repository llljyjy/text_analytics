I was given this product free and complimentary. This product may be excellent for someone who has oily skin and acne, but I have dehydrated skin and am acne free. I used this for a couple weeks and saw no results. My skin felt the same way when this dried down as it did before applying. I know that this is a good brand and have been wanting to try this for a while. The Korres site did not recommend this for me. Thanks for the opportunity Not for my skin type
