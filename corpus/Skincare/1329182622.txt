I don’t write a lot of reviews, but had to for this in case anyone’s on the fence. The good:I have pretty bad rosacea and a skin condition that basically looks like a sunburn peeling constantly (I know, I know, so lucky!) so my skin is very finicky and always needs to be moisturized so I don’t start literally shedding/peeling from my face, so trust me when I say this was a miracle. I always start with a freshly moisturized face. The product is a little more fluid than I expected, but it’s perfect for blending. It goes on green, and then quickly blends into a neutral colour. You can definitely layer over it with concealer or foundation, but I find I don’t need more than some under eye concealer. It has a slightly medicinal smell (kind of like tiger balm, but lighter), but I actually really like it. There’s a slight tingle, but it hasn’t irritated my face or caused any issues, so I can take it. This has replaced primer/colour corrector/foundation/double concealer for me. This is what I’ve been looking for my whole life. The price isn’t bad for the amount - I was worried when I got it, but given it’s extremely fluid, I don’t need nearly as much as I assumed, so I think it’s pretty fair. The bad:Given how fluid it is, if you keep in your purse/make up bag, opening it up will be messy, so just be prepared for that. Also - I’m pretty fair (for my ethnicity in particular), so I’m worried what it would look like on anyone olive toned or darker. I suspect it’ll make them look a little ashy/pasty, but I think that can be counteracted with a light foundation. I think given how good the colour correction is, and Sephora’s return policy, it’s worth the try. Life Changing!
