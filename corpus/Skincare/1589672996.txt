Charlotte’s Magic Serum Crystal Elixir is just as magical as it sounds! I’ve been using this as my summer go-to for overall skincare. This serum is great for every skin type. When you apply this product, it goes on smooth and absorbs quickly so you don’t have a “layer“ sitting on top of your skin like some serums leave behind. If you need a little magic in your beauty lineup, grab this serum. nan
