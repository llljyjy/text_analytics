I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion, as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador.  I have been using this product ever since I got it and love the way it looks and feels on my skin. I have dry/combo sensitive skin. This product has no white cast when applied and wears well alone or under makeup. It also doesn’t make my face feel dry or break me out. The only drawback Is that it has a slight perfume smell to it but doesn’t have the sunscreen smell that other sunscreens have.  This is a definite repurchase for me. my new favorite sunscreen
