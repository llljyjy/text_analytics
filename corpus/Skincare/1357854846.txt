First off, they see me coming a mile away with that packaging, I’m a sucker for glass, it’s such a cute bottle! Total vanity candy! I would classify this as a great balancing toner. It’s refreshing and keeps my dry skin hydrated and soft yet clear and even. I had some bad breakouts recently and after the first day of using this toner, I noticed a huge difference! Less redness, less skin congestion, less texture, and a lasting, soft, suppleness. I totally recommend this if you’ve been searching for the perfect toner! ✨ The Perfect Toner!
