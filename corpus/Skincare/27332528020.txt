This is an amazing cleanser . Not for dry skin, i should have known by the AHA BHA, needless to say though I love how it leaves my skin looking soft and even I absolutely love the look it leaves , not the feel !!!I purchased this along with the moisturizer. I wish this wash left my skin feeing complete and whole after the wash, but in reality i have to run to grab my moisturizer or else i feel like my skin will crack open. NOT FOR DRY SKIN!! But amazing product Amazing , not for dry skin
