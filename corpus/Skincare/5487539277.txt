I’m annoyed because I was hoping the product wasn’t worth the price tag, but it actually really is… lol. My skin looks so healthy and balanced. I have combo acne-prone skin, I have hyperpigmentation around my jawline, and this moisturizer has really calmed my skin down while fading acne scars. It’s very hydrating but not sticky or slippery. Fortunately for my skin, it’s a godsend. Unfortunately, for my budget, it’s a mandatory expense. Surprisingly worth my coins
