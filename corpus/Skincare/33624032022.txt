Ok not joking here. I have weirdo combo skin that canâ€™t decide if it wants to break out from oil like A middle ugh aged woman with acne, get old and shrivel like a raisin, or do both and break out into hormonal stress acne while aging from sun damage as a teen. So, exfoliators are a MUST in my beauty regimen. Now at first I was totally in love with fresh strawberry sugar scrub. And while until I bought this baby it was my favorite ever, the Sephora collection version blows every other product out of the water. The exfoliant is very tiny fine but gritty smoothing Sand textured particles. I can only compare it to that perfect grit nail file that shapes, smooths and buffs all in one. Plus it still suds like a normal cleanser so it rinses easily. 5 star product at an awesome price my new exfoliation product for life!!!! OMG !!! BEST EXFOLIATING CLEANSER EVER!
