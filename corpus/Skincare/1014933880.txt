This moisturizer initially takes some finessing.  It’s a thicker consistency so I suggest taking a small amount and emulsifying before pressing into the skin.  That will give the best application.  While it feels thicker, it absorbs quickly, leaving a smooth finish.  Makeup glides on over it beautifully.  Right now my skin is combination and it was the perfect weight to hydrate dry areas without making other areas too shiny.  It’s perfect for the transition between seasons. Smooth skin ahead!
