I’ve used this product for a long time so I’m glad to have been regifted it. This is a gentle cleanser that is a powder and you activate it by putting some in your hand, some water, and rubbing it on your face. This is great from cleaning pores and after a heavy day of makeup. This was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. Great for oily skin
