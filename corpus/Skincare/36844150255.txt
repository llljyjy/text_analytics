I received this product as a free sample and it did not disappoint! It was so moisturizing and it was no where near as drying and some of the other toners I have tried, it also smells amazing. I know I received this as a free sample but I’m definitely buying a new one after I’m done with this bottle. I love it so much. I definitely recommend this product if you have combination skin as it didn’t break me out or anything! nan
