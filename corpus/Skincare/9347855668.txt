This product worked amazing for my skin. It wasn’t thick and heavy it didn’t cause me to get breakouts, it made a difference to my skin texture and the feel. Of my skin I feel like it hydrates my skin so much and makes it feel so moisturized and look very moisturized I can tell the difference from when I was using other moisturizers to this 1 this 1 has not made me break out. A ittle bit goes a long way and it doesn’t feel thick or heavy on the skin it  It’s light weight but moisturizing And I can tell a difference with the way my skin fills and looks it’s so smooth to be hydrating and soft I use an exfoliator ACR and then this moisturizer and I feel like it just brings back the hydration to my skin in my face This is like literally water for my skin with electrolytes it’s amazing and the texture of my skin II feel his definitely improved Amazing for my sensitive skin
