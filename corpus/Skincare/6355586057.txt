I received this as a sample. I’m so glad I didn’t waste money on a full-size! It was incredibly greasy and never absorbed into my skin. It pilled worse than any other product I’ve ever used. It also made my skin extremely itchy. This is probably the worst facial lotion I’ve ever used. It’s a hot trash product. Don’t waste your money on this. There are so many better brands out there. Don't waste your money
