This cleanser is great!!  I’m usually skeptical of anything two-in-one, but I gave this a try, and I’m so glad I did!  It effortlessly melts my makeup off my face, including eye makeup.  I love how it doesn’t totally strip my skin of its natural oils too, it’s a gentle cleanse, but somehow still cleans all my makeup off.  It’s kinda magical!  I will say that I don’t often wear heavy eye makeup anymore, and I have only used this to remove light-medium layers of skin tint foundation and light eye/brow makeup.  I’m curious how it would hold up with removing heavier eye makeup.  Oh also it lasts surprisingly long too! Replaced two products in my daily skin routine
