Glides on, not sticky and the smell isn’t strong at all which I prefer. Helps even out my skintone, perfect option for me because I can’t use niacinamide and lots of vitamin c products are sticky, unstable or have a ton of essential oils in them. One pump is all I need, it goes a long way. A bit expensive but worth it IMO, helps dark spots dissipate faster and brighten the skin overall. Staple!
