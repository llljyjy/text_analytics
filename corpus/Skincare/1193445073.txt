I love this stuff. I got a sample a long time ago, but only just recently used it, and I absolutely loved it so much that I went out and purchased the 1.7 oz tub. First of all, if you want to go ahead and purchase refills donâ€™t worry about the packaging getting dingy or losing its sheen. It remains as fresh as the day I bought it, and I have definitely thrown this entire tub in my bag several times. The cream itself smells fresh and lovely, and not artificial or medicinal. I do tend to use a bit more than my previous creams, but this just sinks right into my skin and immediately plumps it up and makes me look like I have had a proper night of rest even on days when I am leaving the house after barely sleeping at all. Before I purchased the eye cream to go along with this, I did use this as an eye cream too, and it WORKED. The skin around my eyes is very sensitive and prone to milia, and this did nothing more than smooth everything out and make me look refreshed and like I had been eating properly and taking care of myself properly when ahem.........I did not, lol. This is a MUST buy for me. I have turned on several of my friends to this cream and they love it too. Stock up during the sales. It is worth it. HOLYIEST OF HOLY GRAIL PRODUCTS!!!!!!
