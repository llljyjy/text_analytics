I love, love, love these Tula products. I had tried the face cleanser before and it’s one of my favorites. It was fun to try the moisturizer, scrub and serum. Tula products feel great on my skin. It’s fresh and clean. It deep moisturizes and makes my skin feel amazing! I would 100% recommend this product and any Tula product. Love all Tula products so far
