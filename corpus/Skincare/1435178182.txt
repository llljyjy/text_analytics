This is a nice thick cream almost gel like.  It leaves your eye area very well hydrated.  It’s not greasy and absorbs really well.  It doesn’t have any scent.  My darkness around the eye did not go away but I did notice that the fines lines I had have been less noticeable.  It is a very high quality cream and will continue to use it in the future. Nice cream
