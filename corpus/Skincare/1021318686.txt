I received this as a free sample to review &  I donâ€™t think the amount is enough to use long enough to say whether or not it is making an improvement or not. Having said that, my overall first impressions of this product is that I do like the consistency and it absorbs well. Not greasy.  It does make my skin feel softer and has a pleasant light scent true to Estee Lauder Skincare. This, to me is a lightweight moisturizer perfect for summer months. For the winter I would probably prefer a heavier moisturizer as this is not very heavy. I have combination skin that is not sensitive so I would definitely keep using this if I had more. First impressions only.
