this sunscreen is wonderful! feels light on the skin, noncomedogenic so no acne and it actually protects my face! i gave it 4 stars because anytime i get into the water at the beach my eyes get so irritated they start watering & don’t usually stop until after i’ve left the beach. do not get this into your eyes!! it is terribly, terribly painful. this has also happened after my face has gotten sweaty after workouts as well. definitely looking for a better “sport” sunscreen. great for everyday use, terrible for the beach
