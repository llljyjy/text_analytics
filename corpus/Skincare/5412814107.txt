I received this product as part of a free sample program and I have mixed feeling about it. First I’ll start by saying that the coconut scent is AMAZING!!!!! and the size of the bar is just perfect. I normally brake out when using new skin products, within the first 3 days of use, but with the Cocoa Cleans’r Soothing All-Over Cleansing Bar that didn’t happen. One thing that I didn’t really like is that the bar is a little drying for the skin. I have oily skin, and I found it to be too drying, making my skin produce more oil than normal.I like the cleansing bar, but I don’t love it. Amazing scent
