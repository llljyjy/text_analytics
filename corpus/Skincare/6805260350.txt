I love this new tanner from St Tropez! I’ve been using their other products for over a year and this one by far has the smoothest application. Definitely recommend trying it with their tanning mitt - makes it super easy! I received this complimentary from St Tropez to test out and really like the results it gave. I have fair skin with cool undertones and this gives me a warm bronze without looking orange at all. Application is super smooth and the mousse added an extra layer of hydration to my skin. I slept in it overnight (about 9 hours) and there was no transfer to my sheets or any blotchiness at all! Smells fantastic, has a light floral scent and no typical “self tanner” smell. The only downside is I felt like it didn’t fully dry down/had a sticky feel until I washed the guard color off. nan
