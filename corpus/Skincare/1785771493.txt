I wanted to love this product for many reasons. **I wish more brands offered a refillable concept to reduce packaging waste.** The price isnâ€™t bad either. BUT, everytime I used this product, the cream was pilling on my skin (I have not come near finishing mine for this reason). I tried using it here and there in between creams and it always pills. The more serum you use the more it will pill also. My skin is too dry to go without serum but using a generous amount of cream alone will also pill. (I gave 2 stars for being green, refillable, packaging + pump dispenser) Wanted to love it...but the cream pills on skin
