Y’all, the only word I can use to describe this product is WOW.  I have been fighting oiliness and huge pores since I was a kid. Everyday around noon (and sometimes before) I have to either blot or powder up again because my face looks like it’s been dipped in a vat of Crisco.  I’ve been using this once a day for about a week and I can already see a difference. My pores are noticeably smaller and my face isn’t nearly as greasy.  Haven’t used my blotting papers in days.  At the end of the day there is a little shine, but it looks like a normal, end of the day glow.  A lot of people seem to have a problem with the smell, but I think it smells pretty nice.  It isn’t overpowering and it doesn’t linger through the day.  If you’re tired of blotting day in and day out, or watching your makeup slide off your face before you can even get out the door, then please give this one a try!  Worth every penny! Where has this been all my life?!?!
