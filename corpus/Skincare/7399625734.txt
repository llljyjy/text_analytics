I’ve been using an avocado ingredient face cream, which is lighter than the it confidence in a cream. But After trying this product, I noticed a difference in my pores, they were smaller and my face looked smoother, especially in the morning. The it confidence in a cream is thicker and has a very strong minty scent. Beware if you don’t like mint or heavy scents. Otherwise, I recommend this if you’re self conscience about larger pores. Because this is a thicker cream, a little goes a long way. Once opened, the jar has a 12 month shelf life, and I’m pretty sure with the amount of a 2oz tub, it’s going to last that or longer. good product but strong scent
