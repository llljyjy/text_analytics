I have oily skin and all the products that I used before this made my skin feel completely VERY dry. This face wash changed my life. It removes make up. I do not use make up wipes or removers, I remove all my make up with this and then use a toner. My skin feels moisturized and it does not get too oily after a few hours either. I have been using this for six months and I can 100% say it is hands down one of the best face products I have used. Give it a try!! Moisturizing, balanced & removes make up
