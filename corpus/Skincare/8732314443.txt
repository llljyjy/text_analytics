I received this as a sample for my birthday gift and I loved it. I struggle with texture and started using this in my nightly skincare routine. The spoon makes it feel so luxurious. It almost feels like all the hydration soaks into your skin and makes it feel so soft and plump. In the morning, my skin feels so hydrated and SOFT. Like my texture is almost completely gone after a few uses. The price tag is heavy but in my opinion, worth it. Skincare must-have for dryness & texture
