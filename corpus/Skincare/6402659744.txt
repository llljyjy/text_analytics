One of my favorites! It’s such a light but moisturizing oil. It packs a punch and does the job for the driest skin days. Doesn’t smell the greatest but that doesn’t matter because This oil performs. So good. The packaging isn’t the best because it looks like some of your oil has spilled out and been used, but that’s how all the bottles at Sephora are (I’ve checked). Such a great find from the inkey list. such a standout oil
