Love the product it works really well I expect more of a oil Consistency but it was actually watery which works better in my opinion because I do have combination skin with some oily spot this absorbs Into my skin and doesnt  add to that oiliness. My one complaint is the bottle itself I would prefer a dropper the pump doesnâ€™t work too well Try it
