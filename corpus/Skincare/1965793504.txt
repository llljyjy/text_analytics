I really enjoy Kielâ€™s Ultra Facial Overnight Mask. First of all, I love that it is a clean product, fragrance free, and no parabens. This mask is thick and balm like in texture but turns into oil like consistency when spreading.I have been using as directed at night for 3x per week. It is a hydrating treat for dehydrated winter skin. Skin feels smoother in the morning and moisturized. I like this better than other overnight masks that I have tried with fragrances. I also feel like it is more hydrating than others. The benefits to thismask is to treat flaky dry skin all while you sleep. I would definitely buy this and recommend this to others. nan
