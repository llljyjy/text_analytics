Here comes the sun, that inner radiance that comes through. You don’t need a lot of this to cover your face, neck, and chest. It states just the face but I’m about the continuity, the flow. Too much and it can feel heavy. It takes a few moments to settle in. I don’t wear makeup so throughout the day my skin does not feel oily. I do wonder how it will do in the warmer months. The glow is all that with no irritation to my face or decolletage. Glow Up!
