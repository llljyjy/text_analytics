I’ve always had an issue with full coverage foundation, so I tend to use serum formulas now. Even so, sometimes I think they look a little chalky or gritty on my skin (which tends to be dry without a consistent moisturizing routine). This sunscreen is the answer to all of my problems. I use it as a base for my makeup, or mix it directly in with most foundations. I even find that it helps make one of my thicker foundations wearable and glowy on my skin. I skip foundation all together pretty often and just use this. It has the slightest tint to it, and a LOT of glow. If you prefer a matte look, this isn’t for you. It’s shiny. I personally love to look like my face has a nice snail slime trail look to it (exaggerating, but you know what I mean). I really feel like this just makes my skin look like my skin but better and more hydrated. My most repurchased product
