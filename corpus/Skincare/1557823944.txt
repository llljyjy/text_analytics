I received a free sample from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. I typically enjoy EL skincare and have used several different types in the past. This moisturizer has a nice creamy consistency without being too heavy. It is lightly fragranced, but not overly perfumed and obnoxious. The product absorbed well and was not greasy. It played well with my make up and did not cause my foundation to break down. This is a nice solid moisturizer for daily use. Solid daily moisturizer
