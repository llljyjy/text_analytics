I was surprised how much I liked the peel, usually I shy away from anything with lemon in the name- but I quite like this. The lemon scent  is nice and light, not overpowering at all. I have been using this for a few werks now and my skin feels smoother, brighter and my pores tighter. The texture is not overly gritty either and is easy to apply.You only need to have on for a couple of minutes and the wash off- cant get easier than that! I will continue to use this as part of my slin care routine and recommend this to anyone looking for a nice gentle peel. Great gentle peel
