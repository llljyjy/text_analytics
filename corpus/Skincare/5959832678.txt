I personally love bakuchiol due to it’s natural origins and the fact that it gives me the same results as retinol, but is much easier on the skin. The consistency is rich yet lightweight and is non-irritating, so it’s safe for even sensitive skin. My eye area looks brighter, more awake, and much more youthful. nan
