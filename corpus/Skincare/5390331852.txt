I have mild acne around my T-zone area, and the Dr. Zenovia Acne Spot Treatment works. When I feel a pimple s coming on I rub the treatment around that area, and within the next day or so the pimple hardens when disappears. This doesn’t irritate my skin nor dries it. Compared to other acne spot treatments this doesn’t burn my skin or leave it red. I use this product when needed or sometime after I cleanse and exfoliate my skin during a normal skincare routine.
