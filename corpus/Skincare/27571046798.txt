This is by far the best lip mask I’ve ever used! I use it every night before bed and wake up to the softest, smoothest pout in the morning! My lips used to peel and flake something fierce as a side effect of the Accutane I took and this is the only product I’ve found that’s been able to bring them back to life. I cringed at the price when I first bought it, but a little goes a long way (I bought this for the first time at the beginning of February and still have plenty left). It’s absolutely worth the price. If you use this in conjunction with Fresh’s tinted lip balm, you’ll have soft, kissable lips all day long! nan
