Iâ€™ve been using the Shiseido Ultimune serum for a few weeks. I have noticed some difference in terms of fine lines and brightness of my skin. I have even gotten a few compliments on how nice my skin looks. However, I do not feel that the small changes I have seen are worth the price of the product. I would consider purchasing on a good sale, but the amount of change I have observed is not worth the price point to me. I will continue using it until my bottle runs out, and if I see more dramatic results with continued use It may change my mind. The serum itself is very nice- no discernible scent, absorbs well, non-greasy. Works well but not worth the price
