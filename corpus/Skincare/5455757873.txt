This is the gentlest, most effective cleanser I have ever used. It comes out like a cream and therefore isn’t as heavy as traditional oil cleansers. Generally, I use it the way I would any other regular cleanser, and not as part of a double cleanse. It removes makeup well (although I don’t usually wear a heavy face) and leaves skin feeling clean, but moisturized. Were I to cleanse my skin twice a day with any other product, it would dry out-- but I am able to with this one. A must for normal to dry, sensitive skin. Non-Stripping, Cleansing and Gently Hydrating
