This gave me such a a natural glow! I love that I can add more drops as needed for a darker color especially since you can you use it on your face too! It felt so nice on the skin when I mixed it with my moisturizer! Not sticky or greasy at all! The color came out beautifully! Not streaky and a beautiful golden color! Great Self Tan!
