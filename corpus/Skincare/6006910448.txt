The best cleanser i’ve ever used, i have been struggling with acne for 14 years and some cleansers burn my skin this doesn’t,I double cleanse with it sometimes, i just ordered my 3rd Bebottle. The bottle could be better i pour out too much sometimes because the hole at the top is pretty wide and the cleanser is light-weight/liquidy 🤔🤷🏾‍♀️ u get it. My fav. Great for melanated acne-prone, oily skin
