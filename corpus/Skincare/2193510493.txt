This balm is feels beautiful on the skin and is SO refreshing. I’ve been chasing that cooling feeling for years since trying a Jurlique gel years ago. On top of the refreshing cooling it provides, I used it like a highlighter around the brow and cheekbones with tinted lip balm and mascara for a fresh, dewy look. My sister that is usually quite critical randomly gave my skin a complement this day! It has a bit of a blue that reflects, but that adds to brightening. It doesn’t make your skin look blue, though. The way it reflects light reminds me of an old teeth whitening blue lip gloss that Benefit used to sell! Anyway, I didn’t know I needed this product until I got to try it. Feels nice and is nice for a makeup look. Treat yourself! Excited to use this each day!
