This product is pretty thick and will make your skin feel protected, however it was a lot of slip from the silicones in it. This is why I actually like it better as a line filling priming eye cream before makeup. The silicones fill everything in preventing your makeup from settling in. So wouldn’t use as a night cream but more of a priming eye cream. Great For It’s Opposite Intended Use
