Ever find something so good you’re unsure where to start describing how good it is? For me, Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Omega-Rich Cloud Cream is that something. Supremely, luxurious with the softest, puffiest, most satisfying moisturizer I’ve ever used. Rich yet light, creamy but not greasy. Trust me when I say there must be some sort of magic going on here because my skin feels so nourished and healthy each morning after I use this. Definitely adding to my nightly skin care routine and would highly recommend giving it a try Has me on cloud 9
