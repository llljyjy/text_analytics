I used this oil many years ago and found it too oily. I’m older now, and have been researching different oils that are best when it comes to aging and general moisturizing. I’m happy to find that Sephora carries the small size of Phoenix. First, there are only a few ingredients, and all are proven in my experience to be effective. Sea Buckthorn oil is divine, it grows in northern climes and is used as traditional medicine in Siberia, where it will quickly heal burns and frostbite. (rivalled only by bear grease in that capacity, but you have to have found bear roadkill to source it). Straight Sea buckthorn oil is available (The ordinary sells an inexpensive version) but it stains your skin a nicotine colour so...not ideal. When mixed with other ingredients it’s staining qualities are no longer an issue. Meadowfoam oil is the other star ingredient IMO. This oil is so lovely and yet very hard to find. Fresh used to use it a lot, it was in their excellent soy cream that you can’t get anymore, that’s how I discovered it. So if it is so great why buy the small size, given that buying bigger is cheaper per milliliter? Because oil is somewhat unstable and once opened it starts to oxidise and having noticed either a markedly rapid loss of the oil product’s smell (or worse, a rancid smell) I just feel like it’s better to use smaller quantities to preserve the integrity of the product. Herbivore have been around awhile, and this oil was one of the original products. When I first discovered them I got the LApis oil (very good) and the facial spray (ditto). I was and still am impressed by the high quality and minimal ingredients. Herbivore has somewhat deviated from this with the newer products, no shade to them but so many have over 20 ingredients now, which is fine I guess but I prefer my skincare (oil especially) to err on the side of simplicity. This oil is going to be a g-dsend for cold dry winters, for sure. A godsend and a must for cold, dry winter weather.
