What a pleasure to discover Peace Out products—they actually *work* and these were no exception. I’m 57 and somehow haven’t developed deep “eleven“ wrinkles yet, but with age I have developed a few under-skin bumps on my forehead. (Not breakouts or cysts, but just uneven lumps from past breakouts that my dermatologist couldn’t offer any remedy for.) I decided to try these patches on them, and was really pleased by the result!  Overnight they diminished the appearance by easily 90%. A little powder the next day, and my forehead appears completely smooth. They plump up the surrounding skin so the lump is no longer visible and the entire forehead looks smooth and feel moisturized.  Brilliant. The only small downside is that results last about 3 days, so I’d need to apply them a couple of times a week, and they’re a bit too pricey for my budget to do that.  (I really hope that Peace Out can offer them at discount one day.) I reserve them for skin perk-ups and times when I want my skin to look its best. 5 stars for the outstanding product that delivers. I’m a new fan.  Peace Out offered me a free product for my honest feedback on this item. They WORK.
