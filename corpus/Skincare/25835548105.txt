I have a problem with oily sebaceous filaments on my nose so once in a while I would do pore strips but it just left holes in my nose to be clogged up again. These are INCREDIBLE. They soak up all the oil overnight. All black dots were seriously improved in morning. I don’t have super oily skin after being on accutane but my nose is still a problem to the point that I get little dots of oil on each pore. These are going to be my new problem solver for my nose and face. So satisfying too! Try it! RUN DON’T WALK
