Overall this was a good sunscreen. It seemed to protect my face and it has a nice formula. Itâ€™s on the thicker end but still easy to apply. I typically buy reef safe sunscreens and this does not claim to be reef safe but I like that it does not have oxybenzone and octinoxate in it. I do, however, wish this product was vegan and cruelty free. Decent product
