I never write reviews but I feel I must for this product. To start, I have extremely acne prone, oily skin and after using for over one year, this has never caused a breakout. I apply this in the morning before my makeup instead of at night. After hearing the hype about these drops (about a year ago), I started off with the “medium” shade. I was instantly hooked. My pale face took on a healthy glow overnight. Although skeptical, I decided to try out the “dark” to see if I could get more bang for my buck. I was worried it would end up too dark but I was wrong! I’m obsessed with the dark shade and don’t see myself buying any other brand. I tried out the ulta brand drops (many claim they are a dupe), but I found hated the resulting color/smell and ended up returning. Love love love these drops and hope they never change. A must have for glowing skin!
