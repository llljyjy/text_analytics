I found that my skin was very oily later in the day after using this moisturizer.  I tried it for 2 weeks to see if my skin would adjust but it still consistently felt overly oily by the end of my work day.  Might work for some but not for me.  That said, I do think it helped with moisturizing my skin during a cold winter. nan
