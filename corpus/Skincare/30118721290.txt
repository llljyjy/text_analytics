I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion.  I’ve been using this product consistently for the last 3 weeks. This product is a good moisturizer and does a good job at sun protection. However, this product doesn’t do well under makeup. I’ve tried this under IT Cosmetics CC cream and PUR powder foundation. Both just pill up. Also, after a bit of time this product begins to feel super greasy. Overall okay product, but I wouldn’t purchase. Ok Moisturizing Sunscreen
