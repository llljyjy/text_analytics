I have been using this for a few weeks every night under my nightly moisturizer.  The product pumps out easy into my hand (which for some reason I find way more convenient then sticking my finger into a bottle and scooping out some - I can even do it with my eyes closed). I apply it all over my face and neck, and it goes on easy.  There is no stinging at all, and a little goes a long way.  No new wrinkles so far! My new go to Retinol for Face and Neck (not eyes)
