It’s a difficult thing to have sensitive skin and have to find new skincare when a company reformulated its products, so I’m on a search for a new mineral facial sunscreen. After a nasty rash from a different company’s sunscreen, I tried this one since I’ve used FAB skincare in the past with good results. It’s in the middle of the pack in terms of texture and feeling on the skin - a bit moisturizing, but neither very lightweight nor too heavy. I can’t speak to any white cast - I’m so pale that there’s really nothing that leaves a white cast on my skin. (I have the opposite issue of not being able to use tinted sunscreens.) This doesn’t irritate my reactive skin, and it doesn’t have an expensive price tag. I like the pump, since it prevents the formula from oozing from the tube or collecting in the top. Right now, it’s my go-to unless I find something I like better. Good general facial sunscreen
