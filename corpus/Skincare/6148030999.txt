The old formula was perfect, this one does not hold up to it at all. The smell is different, usually I’m usually not a fan of scented face products but the old one was great. New one  thicker and tackier. Old one felt more silky and luxurious. Nothing special about it now. It’s so disappointing, they had a great product before. Devastating new formula
