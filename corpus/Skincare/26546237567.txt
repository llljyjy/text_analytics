I love this product! My skins looks very healthy and hydrated. I have combination skin and this works perfectly for me. I needed something hydrating because my cleanser contains salicylic and glycolic acid which strips moisture from my face. In the day, I pair my cleanser and toner with my Paula’s choice vitamin C serum, Paula’s choice omega + complex moisturizer and the Innisfree sunscreen. At night, I pair my cleanser and toner with the Urban skin rx retinol rapid repair treatment and my day moisturizer. I use my Paula’s choice 2% BHA exfoliate instead of the retinol after every 4 nights. Love the combo!! LOVE! My skin is now healthy and hydrated!
