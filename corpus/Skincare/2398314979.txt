This serum feels like such a luxury product in all aspects. The bottle itself is so aesthetically pleasing just sitting on the counter. The scent of the product is light, not overly perfumed, and relaxing. The serum itself is the perfect consistency, not watery, not greasy. It feels wonderful on your face. A little tacky to the touch, but it makes you feel like you actually applied a product. I have found that this serum makes my face look more radiant and glowing, and that my skin texture looks much nicer. I would absolutely love to continue using this product to see what it could do for my skin over several months time. The only downfall I found to this product is the price, which is a little steep, but not unlike some other brand serums. I also found that my face has become a little more dry since using the product, but nothing a little moisturizer does not take care of. I would definitely recommend this serum to friends or family, as it is probably my most favorite to date. Luxurious and Radiant!
