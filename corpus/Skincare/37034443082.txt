I’ve been looking for a cleansing balm for a while now and I purchased this due to it being a good price for the amount of product that you get. When I received this product I was pretty excited about using because I always hear good things about cleansing balms in general. I was wearing a full face of make up and waterproof mascara at the time, I really wanted to see how well this product worked. Overall it wasn’t bad and I’m sure there are plenty of cleansing balms out there that are way better. My personal opinion on this was that this cleansing balm was pretty decent. It does have that film everyone was talking about but it honestly didn’t bother me much because I double cleanse. Definitely worth looking into it. Decent product.
