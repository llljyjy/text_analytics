Let me start by saying that this was my mom sent when I was a kid. I loved the way it smelled on her. But it definitely had a very different scent on me and still does so I love everything about the actual product but I still don’t love the way it smells on my skin so if you love the smell then it’s an amazing product and really soothes and brighten my skin and gave it a few look. nan
