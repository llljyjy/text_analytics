I received Ilia C beyond Triple Serum SPF 40 for testing  from PinchMe in exchange for an honest review. I really like this serum it doesn’t leave a white cast on your skin and it gives you a nice glow. This product it’s like a all in one for me, especially on days that I don’t want to wear make up. I use a lip gloss and mascara and I’m all set. It also has a nice scent. Highly recommend. nan
