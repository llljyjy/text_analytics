I really liked this inkey list mandelic acid treatment it is gentle on the skin. It is easy to use and comes in a nice convenient tube so you can travel with it. It really helped get rid of my blemishes and helped keep new ones away. It also helped with my dark spots and really made my skin a lot brighter. I received this free for testing purposes. nan
