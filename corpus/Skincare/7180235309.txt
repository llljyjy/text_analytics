(gifted) I was really excited to hear that Merit was coming out with a skincare line. I’ve tried out the serum for over a week now and I like it but i’m not in love with it. The consistency is very runny and makes a mess when applying. Other than that, the serum gives me the perfect glow and my skin feels moisturized. Excited to see how the serum holds up after a couple months. Merit + skincare??
