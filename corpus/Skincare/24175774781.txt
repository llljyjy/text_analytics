I initially started using this in the summer time to help with the some hormonal breakouts I was having, however I stopped using it because my face got extremely red and irritated. I decided to give it a second chance this month considering that my skin is much clearer now. Also, when I used this product in the summer I was also introducing an extremely strong Vitamin C serum (which now I know was the reason my skin was so irritated). This past month I have used this exfoliant as more of a spot treatment for a few clogged pores and pesky breakouts that I have not been able to get rid of, and literally overnight it unclogged my pores, reduced redness, and shrunk the pimples significantly. Such a fabulous product! So glad I gave it a second chance. BEST CHEMICAL EXFOLIANT
