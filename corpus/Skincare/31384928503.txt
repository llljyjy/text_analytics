Although I’ve been using this products for the past few day, I’m obsessed. I love the the simple and easy application method alongside the bottle packaging. The only thing I don’t like is the scent. It’s a sweet milky like scent but it’s easy to ignore when you see how moisturizing and refreshing this product is. I love this more than other toners. Although I received this product as a part of a free sample program I am definitely going to buy it. Im obsessed with this product!!
