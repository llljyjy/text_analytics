I’ve only used it twice ( once a week) and I’ve seen a huge difference already. My face began to purge by the end of week one. My face got pretty dry (normally I have combo to oily skin) but exfoliating and using a good moisturizer helped a lot! Make sure to use a good sunscreen while using this product. I got the trial size but one I’m done I will definitely be purchasing the full size. Honestly the only negative is the smell but for the result I’ve seen already I can put it aside. must have!
