This Charlotte Tilbury serum works very well in my opinion and This serum is magic. I love how light weight it is and has a slight scent that diminishes quickly and is not unpleasant and  absorbs quickly and has a matte finish...I loved how this was packaged. The dropper is nice too, it fills up just enough...Iâ€™ve been using this for a couple weeks and I love the way my face feel and the glow. It smells good and feels great on the skin. Really good serum
