I have the drunk elephant moisturizer so I was so excited to try this retinol oil. Lately my skin has been super dry and sensitive but this has been an amazing help. Most oils will feel greasy on my skin but this one felt super comfortable. This product actually made my skin super soft and glowing! I would definitely purchase this product. I loved the packaging too. The dropper made for an easy application. I love that itâ€™s vegan & cruelty free. You can also recycle the package. Loved it
