I love love love this mask! I like to keep a lip balm or mask in my bathroom cabinet so I can use it during my morning and nighttime skincare routine, and this is perfect for that. It makes my lips so soft and moisturized, and it stays on for so long! Itâ€™s perfect for the cold winter months and even stays on underneath my face masks. I definitely recommend, this will be a staple in my skincare routine for a long time. best lip mask for long lasting moisture!
