I am 46 years old with acne and redness from RX retinoids. This cream gives me the coverage and smooth skin I want, without looking like heavy foundation. I love that it has SPF and keeps my skin feeling moisturized and soft. The feeling can be a bit tacky, so I wait five minutes after application, add a sheer finishing powder, then mist with a setting spray. nan
