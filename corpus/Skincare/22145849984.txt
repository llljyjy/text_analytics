this is the only sunscreen i have found that doesnâ€™t leave my skin with a weird texture or any type of cast. it is also relatively affordable compared to other ones out there. however, i do run through it very fast and wish it had a bit higher spf. it leaves the skin looking hydrated/dewy not too greasy nan
