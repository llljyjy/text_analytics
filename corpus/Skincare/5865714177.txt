IT Confidence In A Cream is a wonderful product.  It really moisturizes your skin.  I have been using this cream for about a month now.  I love the way my skin feels.  This product contains ceamides, peptide-lipid complex, and hyaluronic acid, all things that help the skin look younger.  I have combination skin and this cream works good on my skin.  This cream is free of sulfates and parabens.  I have recommended this product to my friends and family.  Give it a try.  The only thing I thought could be improved would be the scent.  It smells like medicine. IT Confidence In A Cream is a wonderful product!
