This moisturizer isn’t anything special in my opinion but the cons to it is that it burns like really bad which has never happened to me before and it also pills which is strange. I thought it was my sunscreen or other products but I put it on by itself, and my face started pilling. I usually don’t do reviews but I think some people should know. Pills and Burns
