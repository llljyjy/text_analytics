This night cream is fantastic! The texture is very thick, but it doesn’t feel suffocating and greasy. It just melts into your skin. A little truly goes a long way with this stuff. Plus, it smells nice!I was looking for a more affordable alternative to La Mer’s cream and I think I finally found it. I’m not just saying that! The texture is honestly so similar, as is the way it feels on the skin. It just feels so luxurious and for a much fairer price point. Recommend! Exceeded expectations
