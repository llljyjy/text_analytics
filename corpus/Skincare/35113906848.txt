I used this eye mask this morning for the first time as I didnâ€™t sleep well have my eyes were puffy and dark circles. Popped it in the fridge for five mins then applied to my under eye and instantly could feel it soothing my under eyes. I really enjoyed this and my under eyes look alot less puffy and dark , I totally recommend these ! nan
