I did like the convenience of this product. For me, the only downside was that I have oily skin, including oily eyelids, and this combined with the oil on my skin would creep into my eyes and burn terribly until I used eye drops AND washed my face. Also, the smell lived on my lips and would mix with everything I ate or drank. Not a terrible product, but just not for me personally. Strong Smell/Taste. Doesnâ€™t Feel Great in Eyes
