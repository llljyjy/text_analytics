It is wonderfully slippery and leaves my skin feeling more moisturized after shaving.  As for the scent, I’m a fan of sandalwood, it has a great clean smell for every day. It is an amazing product.  If you want a great shave I recommend this one.  It’s much smoother and easier to shave than using canned shaving cream.Gifted by hanni. nan
