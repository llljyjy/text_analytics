This was gifted by Algenist. First of all I really love the packaging design it feels and looks luxurious. The toner itself is really amazing, I have sensitive skin and was expecting some kind of reaction to it since there is some potent ingredients listed but my skin absolutely loved this!! After applying my skin felt clean and hydrated without moisturizer! I am noticing my pores reducing in size and my minimal acne dissipating! Good for sensitive skin people
