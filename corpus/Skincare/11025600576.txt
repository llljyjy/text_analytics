This was an amazing rendition of the classic take the day off balm from Clinique! I really enjoyed the extra “pazazz” that the charcoal gave the cleanser. It almost felt like I was getting a deeper clean than with the original balm, almost like it did more than take off my make up. I really enjoyed it! Awesome Spin Off!
