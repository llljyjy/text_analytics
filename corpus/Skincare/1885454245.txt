#trywithtopbox#TrywithtopboxI received a small sample of this product, enough for a few days of use. I didn’t get to use it long enough to say whether or not this product really helps with fine lines. I found the serum to be a bit tacky on my skin, once covered with the correcting cream it was fine. I did have a minor breakout after using this and the correction cream for a few days. That was uncommon for me and it went away after I stopped using them so I’m thinking that one/both of the products caused it. nan
