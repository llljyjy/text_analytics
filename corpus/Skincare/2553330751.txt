Someone slipped me a small sample of their own personal stash at a BBQ a few days ago and promised me I would love it.  3 days of applying the small amount I was given, I was in love. I ran to my local Sephora and bought my own bottle. Couple of the things I was totally sold are: The texture - it has a very liquidy texture which makes it easier for me to apply.  No smell - I also love that there is no harsh fragrance. My skin showed a noticeable difference in just a few days and I cant wait to see even more improvement in the coming weeks and months. The GoodGood..
