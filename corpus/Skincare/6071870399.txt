Let me start by saying that I really like, and use, a number of the YTTP products. So, I didn’t hesitate to try this new serum despite the hefty price tag. I have only used it a few times, so I can’t really speak to the effectiveness of the serum. I’m writing this review so early because I can’t get past how bad the pump is! You try to push down on it and it feels like it is locked in place, as though you need to turn it to release it somehow. When it finally dispenses, it explodes out. I remember reading someone else’s similar review and I thought… come on, how bad can it be?  Well, it’s bad. I’m looking to find another container to put the serum into so I can use it. I’m rating it 3 stars because it hasn’t irritated my acne prone, combination skin and I plan to keep using it. For the price point, I expected a much better pump mechanism. Does not dispense well
