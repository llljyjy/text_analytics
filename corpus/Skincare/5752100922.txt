This is a nice little serum. I’ve been using it for about a week now and it has a nice consistency that goes on smooth and feels nice on the face. I haven’t noticed a real difference in my skin, but I’ve only been using it about a week. I think with more consistent use over time, that would make a big difference. Decent Serum
