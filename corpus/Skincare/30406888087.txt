Despite other reviews I actually really like this! I love the scent and when I used it in combination of my facial cleanser my skin was great and it continued to look great through the whole day. It balanced out my tone and the makeup application afterwards was flawless. I have learned from my last purchase of a different serum but same brand that the pumps are useless. I just unscrew it and use the tube as an applicator. Will be buying again! nan
