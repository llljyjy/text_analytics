Gifted by Hanni. I knew that a weighted razor would get me a closer shave, but I didn’t expect it to be this nice! I’ve tried men’s razors like this before but the shape was  always a dealbreaker. Love that this was made for women’s contours! Love that the blades are pretty affordable too. No more spending $16+ for a four-pack of Gillette! Weighted like men’s razors but made for women!
