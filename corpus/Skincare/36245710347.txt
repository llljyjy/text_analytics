I received this product from influenster & drunk elephant in exchange for my honest review. I received this via a voxbox with influenster and I was so exited when I did! I dont buy beauty items a lot but when I do I look for quality and I like trying before I buy. The cream was really soft and silky when I touched it. It felt just as nice on my skin. I was afraid it would be thick and sticky when it dried  but that wasnâ€™t the case. It soaked in and felt great! First time user
