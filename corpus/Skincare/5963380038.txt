I received this product from Influenster and Estée Lauder to try out and review. However, the product I received was 0.24 ounces and therefore I cannot give an accurate long-term review as I was only able to use the soft clean infusion a handful of times. Immediately the product left my skin soft and hydrated, however it has a pretty heavy perfume-like scent. I’m not a huge fan of heavily scented products, as they tend to give me a headache. Luckily after applying a lotion over top of the soft clean infusion, it lessened the scent and I was able to tolerate it. I would recommend this product to someone that has dry skin and can handle scented skin care products. Heavily scented, but left skin soft
