I was so excited to try this cream from Caudalie and it did not disappoint! It targets 8 signs of aging - deep wrinkles, fine lines, firmness, volume, elasticity, age spots, hydration and radiance.  I have used this every day faithfully. I can honestly say that it has improved all of those areas. My skin feels firmer, looks plumper, fine lines are diminished, deeply hydrated my skin and gives my skin a radiance that it never had before. The cream itself is thick and luxurious yet it goes on very light. It doesn’t feel too heavy or greasy. The light rose scent is heavenly! I am not sensitive to fragrance & prefer my products to be lightly fragrant. I have combination skin and usually experience more dryness in colder weather. This year, I not only experienced more dryness but my nose was peeling which has never happened. Prior to receiving this, I had tried several products but nothing helped. After 4 uses of this cream the peeling stopped altogether. The jar came completely full and you don’t need to use much for coverage of your face & neck, it should last for quite awhile. This will be a cream that I will be purchasing regularly. It is definitely worth the price. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox nan
