This is a very light HA moisturizer. I pair it with the glow recipe dew drops ( I wash my face, apply the dew drops and let it soak into my skin for a couple minutes and then apply this moisturizer). It’s very light weight so I don’t think it’s the best for winter as I need a bit more of a heavy moisturizer when it’s super cold outside, but it would be great for fall/spring/summer. Iv had it for about 2 months and I have used about half of the bottle maybe a bit more ( I use 2-3 pumps to cover my entire face and a bit on my neck). It’s a bit expensive for the amount you get but if you have been thinking about trying it I recommend you give it a shot! pretty glass bottle .
