i’ve been looking for a humidifier to keep by my bed that isn’t super ugly lol and i finally found it! tbh i was pretty scared to set it up but it was really easy. the instructions are literally on the humidifier and show you which buttons do what so there’s little room for confusion. the color pink is just like the photo and matches the accents in my room perfectly. also even the plug/cord is cute?? my room is sooo dry and i can literally already feel my lips being less chapped. so excited to keep using it!! literally so cute, works rly well, and easy setup
