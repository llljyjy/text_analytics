I have been using this set for over a month now and am surprised by the results. My forehead lines are not as prominent and the “quote marks“ between my eyebrows are gone. I found that a little goes a long way. The eye cream helps with my crepe-like eyelids, no puffiness, but does not help the dark circles. The moisturizer isn’t too greasy, which is nice. I would buy this product again. As a reference, I’m Asian and just over 60. Surprisingly nice
