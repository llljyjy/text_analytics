Trust me when I say I’m so careful about what moisturizers I use because I’m incredibly acne prone, I’m on retinol, and have combination skin. This is the most repurchased skin care item of 2021. I’ve put so many of my friends and family on to this because it’s literally THE best. I’ve tried every popular moisturizer you can think of but nothing beats this cream. It’s so moisturizing, long lasting but doesn’t make you oily or break out not even in my t zone. Trust me you won’t regret it!! It’s so luxurious on the skin best way for me to put it. RUN DONT WALK TO CHECKOUT!
