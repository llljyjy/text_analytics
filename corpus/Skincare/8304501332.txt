I was looking for a good soothing moisturizing mask and came across this one. I got the coconut and vitamin b3 one. I’ve tried A LOT of masks I really enjoy skincare and masking. My favorite are Fresh and Tatcha masks but at $10 I figured this was at least worth trying. It’s not good though. It’s frustrating when most of the 5 star ratings on products are incentivized, it feels like a less honest review. Basically this did nothing for my skin after I washed it off. It felt no different, or maybe even a little worse. Definitely not soothing or moisturizing. I think this is the kind of mask maybe a teenager might buy for a sleepover. Like, to put on for fun, not for benefits. I’m 29 and this just didn’t do it for me. Another thing was the smell. I didn’t take off any stars for it because I try to focus on the effectiveness of a product (unless the smell is so unbearable I have to remove it). But I’ll warn you it smells and kinda feels like youre putting thick sunscreen on your face. I’ll probably be returning it (or just throwing it away). Not good be weary of 5 star incentivized reviews.
