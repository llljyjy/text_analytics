I like this cream so far. It said mochi, and I was already drawn in. My favorite thing about it is that it’s fragrance free! The cream is a perfect inbetween of a rich cream and a light watery one. It gives me a nice dew and shine while keeping my skin soft. My skin is more dry and doesn’t produce much oil, so I like this. Someone with oilier skin might find this too thick still. But it might make a good night cream for others too. I usually use during the day. nan
