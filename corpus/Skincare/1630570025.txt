I used this device every day for a good 8 months with zero results. I think that my smile lines are even more pronounced now than they were when I started using Foreo Bear. Really wanted to love it, especially after spending a hefty amount of money on it. Additional annoyance - the app, it was a pain in the rear to start with and then I was disappointed that I couldnâ€™t pause/resume the session, it only allowed to stop and re-start. Didn't do anything for me
