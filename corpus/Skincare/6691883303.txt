I was quite disappointed with this moisturizer. It pills really bad, doesn’t matter what products you use underneath, I have tried everything to make it not pill and no luck! I have sensitive, dry, acne prone skin, and this did not moisturize adequately. Possibly from the fragrance in the moisturizer, or the ingredients, but I have had very very bad break outs since starting to use this. I will never repurchase. I like Caudalie’s serums and face masks but save your money on the moisturizers. Pills, caused acne, strong fragrance
