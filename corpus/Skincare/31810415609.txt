I received a sample of the strawberry smooth serum and used it for about a week. It’s really nice—it absorbs into my skin well without any stickiness or peeling later on. It works well under my foundation as well. I saw some improvement in my acne, but I haven’t used it long enough to know if it helps with hyperpigmentation. The only thing I dislike about this product is that it has a faint smell that reminds me of strawberry flavored cold medicine. Despite the smell, I still really enjoyed trying out this serum as it didn’t cause any peeling that I typically get with other salicylic acid serums, and I plan on getting a full size when my sample runs out. nan
