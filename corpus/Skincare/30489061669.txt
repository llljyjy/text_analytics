I think this cleanser is a great staple to have in your routine. I feel like the cleanser made my skin refreshed and brightened. I do have slightly dry skin, so with claims of hydration I had high hopes. I wouldn’t say I felt dryer than other cleansers, but I hoped for a little more hydration. Still a really solid option and I’ve been using it every day since I got it. A little goes a long way which is great for a higher price point cleanser! Definitely recommend. Added to the daily routine!
