Attached a before and after of how my face looks after the face cream and itâ€™s just SO hydrated and glowy. I use this at night and in the morning religiously and I can see my skin barrier fixing in front of my eyes I swear. If you were to get one Sturm product I would say this or the HA serum if you want to stay hydrated through all the seasons. Hydration for ALL the seasons
