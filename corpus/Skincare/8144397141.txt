Save your money. Go with their glowy balm or lip masks. Highly fragrances so if you’re sensitive I wouldn’t recommend. Doesn’t nourish, hydrate, or protect so it’s basically useless. The spatula is appreciated but because of its formula you don’t really need it or a lot of it. It disappears after 15-30 minutes and if you rub your lips nervously (lol like I do) it’s gone within minutes. This is totally preference but the opalescence to me is completely unnecessary for a product like this and kind of unflattering if you accidentally apply too much. Save your money munchkins!! Their glowy balm is just fine :) Stick with their lip mask or glowy balms
