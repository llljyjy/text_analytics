I LOVE LOVE this self tanner. Super easy to apply, and I’m a first-time self tanner as well. After application, I waited 5-ish minutes to put my clothes on, and it didn’t stain them. The only thing is that it does a bit of a smell, I can’t really describe it, but nothing too bad just maybe a bit like self-tanner.I did the night-glow and dark IOP self-tanning mist and feel like I just went tanning in Bora Bora. LOVE! Amazing Tan, A Bit of a Smell
