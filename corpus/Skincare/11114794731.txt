Firstly, I received this product free in exchange for an honest review. I’ve really enjoyed using this facial mist. The packaging feel luxurious. It’s made of a heavy frosted glass and has a very fine mister attached. The product has a rose scent (if you like rose this is for you). It didn’t irritate my skin. It leaves a slightly tacky residue for makeup application, but doesn’t make me feel gross if I apply it on a fresh face only. Overall I really like this spray. I wish it had a more complex and muskier scent, but it is a facial product so I understand not wanting to use too many irritants. If you have the means to buy this and enjoy rose scented skincare/makeup, I highly recommend! Luxurious
