I received product from @influenster & @biossance for this complimentary Squalane + Vitamin C Rose Moisturizer. This moisturizer is infused with vitamin C, fermented lemon peel that delivers antioxidants that helps skin fight free radicals, pollution, and leaving the skin, looking brighter and radiant. I loved the way this moisturizer soaked into my skin and gave me all-day hydration. I have very dry skin so I felt like this was perfect for me to use both during my morning and evening routines. I also love the glowing complexion that I felt like the vitamin C added. U should try
