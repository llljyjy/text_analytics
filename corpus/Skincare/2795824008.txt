I don’t understand how this product is so hyped. I love how it feels and the 40 SPF. The big downfall is that I have very dry skin, I get eczema on my body and face. This sunscreen converted my face Into the most oilest land field out there. I started setting it with powder and within two hours I was so oily. Let’s not even talk about it under foundation. It became embarrassing when my family and friends started asking me if I was okay because I looked so “sweaty”. I would only use a pea size. Never again Super Oily
