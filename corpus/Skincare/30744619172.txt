Purchased this product as part of Sephora’s Sun Safety Kit. The product appeared to be completely separated, even after shaking. I’m not sure if this is just a bad batch or if the product is just formulated this way. Even after rubbing the product in, it left my skin with a yellow hue and the mica transferred to everything it touched. Very disappointing. Disappointed
