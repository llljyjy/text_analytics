Excellent hydrating cream. I have been through so many moisturizers trying to find the best one and so far this one beats them all! Light weight yet hydrating and it also accommodates my sensitive skin. My last moisturizer ruined my skin barrier even after being labeled for sensitive skin I had a lot of redness and tingling however after patch testing this cream I had no reaction and have seen a significant improvement of my skin. It has helped my dry winter skin and I definitely feel like it could be used year round. I plan on buying it again and I highly recommend. Saved my skin!
