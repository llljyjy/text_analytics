Not a fan of this product from Origins as it is not enough moisturizing for my dry skin! May be it will work for summer but definitely not for cloder climates! It has a light texture and good smell but when you apply it and within 5-10 mins my skin felt super dry,could be because this product has salicylic acid which tends to dry your skin. Usually I like Origins products but not impressed with this one! Original Skinâ„¢ Matte Moisturizer with Willowherb
