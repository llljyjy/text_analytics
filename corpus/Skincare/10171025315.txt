i think i just found my new night time skin care routine, used it for a week before i head on and write this review. loooove this package! you get a good amount for a trial set! all for $93, also a good price point. I loved these items and bought the full sizes. I have dark spots from my maskne recently because of how they way they make masks now. and also! doesn’t clog my pores like some products. I have very sensitive and oily skin and these products helped! If i were to pick my faves from all this, i’d pick the good genes, a+ high dose retinoid serum and the 5 stars retinoid and niacinamide eye serum, i must tell! this is by far the only eye serum i used that i saw an instant effect! recently, my eyes has been looking a little puffy and tired and this eye serum helped with the puffiness! I’ve used and still have many eye serums, even the one they call the “benz” of eye serums worked like meeeh to me lol. this 5stars eye serum for me is an easy grab!!! buying full sizes of these could be a little pricey so this is a good set to get first!!! GOOD PRODUCTS FOR A GOOD DEAL
