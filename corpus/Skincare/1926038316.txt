i have dry skin and use a thick moisturizing cream overnight, and was looking for a lighter but very moisturizing option during the day. i’ve tried many moisturizers and this is my favorite! it’s lightweight but so hydrating and after a few weeks of use i feel like my skin is dewy and glowing. 10/10 recommend LOVE!
