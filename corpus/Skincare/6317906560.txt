I am blessed to never suffer from dry or chapped lips so I never buy lip balms or anything like that BUT this intrigued me because of the shade and the scent. I bought thinking nothing of it and then I tried it!!! WOW! I loved the consistency, and it doesnâ€™t feel heavy on the lips! I love the shade and I will now be a lip balm lover! NON LIP BALM USER
