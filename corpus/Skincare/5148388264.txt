Works really well, doesn’t cause irritation for me. Unfortunately I won’t be repurchasing because of the smell. Maybe it’s because a lot of my hyperpigmentation is around my mouth/under my nose but I cannot stand to use this anymore, just due to the smell. It smells like nair mixed with human waste. nan
