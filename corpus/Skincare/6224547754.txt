I got a sample of this from the Bazaar & I’m totally buying the full size bottle! I’ve been using the sample since mid-July and it really goes a long way so the full size will last for a while. Didn’t realize an essence was so necessary in my skincare routine! My skin looks more glowy and more awake, it’s helped fade my dark spots from acne too. I have dry skin and this helps add moisture. I like the scent lol, it smells the way I would expect an antioxidant essence to smell & it’s just refreshing. I’d like to hear someone’s comparison between this & the one from Fresh. Love this product!
