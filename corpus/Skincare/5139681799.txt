This product did not live up to its hype for me. It didn’t reduce puffiness as claimed. In fairness, I was looking for a product to address upper eye lid puffiness. The Sephora associate directed me to this product. When I got it home, I read the product information which indicates it’s an under-eye product. I’m returning the product. nan
