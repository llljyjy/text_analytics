I received this product compliments of Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This product was very surprising. I would hardly guess it was sunscreen as that typical sunscreen scent was barely there! This product does not feel greasy at all - I was totally shocked when I applied it. I have combo sensitive skin and I can get oily in warmer weather. Perhaps I havenâ€™t worn this in more extreme temperatures yet, or it just holds up! Totally unexpected! I still prefer this on a bare face as opposed to under makeup. The feeling is just a bit better and I think my makeup does get effected. Not sure if continued and constant wear will change things, but so far, no breakouts. Very nice product. nan
