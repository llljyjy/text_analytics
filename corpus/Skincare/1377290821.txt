Beautiful packaging however the formula was a no for me. The formula reminds me of thick vaseline and I looked at the ingredients and it seems that it does not contain any petroleum. This was way to thick for me, it just sat there and I personally felt no moisture being embedded into my skin. Super fun to use and the sent is very faint vanilla! I just wish it were a little more moisturizing and movable.  My favorite lip mask so far are the Laneige because it has slip and moisturizes. The other is Kiehl’s buttermask for slip and hydration and it’s thicker than this Fenty but melts and moves nicely on the lips!  I also love…the Fenty PRO KISS’R LUSCIOUS LIP BALM for everyday use. My own personal opinion however, if you like vaseline, you would probably love this! Beautiful Package!
