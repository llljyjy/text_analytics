Itâ€™s expensive, but it works great. I was looking to add an eye cream and got a small sample with my last order. I loved it so much I ordered the full size. It goes one smooth and absorbs quickly .No issues applying makeup on-top.  As others have said the pump can be a big finicky, but not enough to stop me from using this product. Expensive but good
