It was ok. It had a very light fragrance to it and lathered very well. It also lasted a very long time considering the amount of showers I take.  But it was very drying and that part I didn’t like at all . It did work very well in combination with the body butter but if you don’t have a good moisturizer your in trouble because it really cleanse It was ok
