The texture is a balm, as the name indicates, and is very heavy. Too heavy for me but that’s no justification to take off a point. The things is, it smells very intense (herbal? lavender? what is this?). Also they suggest this one for night use and the other yellow one for day use but this one has a ton of shimmer/iridescence in it? Doesn’t make sense. The only good part for me is also the shimmer, looks great on the skin, sort of like a glowy and extremely moisturizing primer. Looks good on but scent too heavy
