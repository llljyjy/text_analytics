This retinol serum is so easy to apply and feels so nice on the skin. It doesnâ€™t dry out or sting my skin like some retinols. It has helped calm my skin and reduce hyperpigmentation. It has not made my skin more acne-prone. Also, a little goes a long way! I received this complimentary from drunk elephant and influenster. Works great!
