While I really like the product - the price point is WAY too much.  Honestly - small size should be $20.00 and the large size should have a price point around $60-65.  I have honestly avoided Paltrow’s product line as I think she’s a bit out of touch with anyone below the 1%.  Again, I do really like this product - but the price point is a dissuader. Goof Stuff.... But....
