If you have oily oily skin this is a MUST!! i absolutely love but keep in mind this is a very strong acid. I would recommend applying to clean skin/completely dry skin after cleansing, then follow with a gel moisturizer (i love versed dew point at target) and then using the CeraVe healing ointment and sleeping with it! i did this every night for the first month using to make sure i didnâ€™t ruin my skin barrier! I got some stinging when first using but only lasted 10 min, and to be expected with such a strong acid. Overall will be repurchasing for a while! Works so well for me :)) nan
