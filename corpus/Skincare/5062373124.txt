I really like this face oil. It’s very greasy so definitely best for sleeping but it works great to jade roll or gua sha your face with and then go right to bed. Because it has the retinol it’s like a 2 in 1 product. So I really enjoyed it. Would definitely re purchase. Only down side is the color, a little yellow so you don’t want to get it on towels and sheets etc Great for a 2 in 1 product
