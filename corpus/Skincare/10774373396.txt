I received this product for free from Influenster to try, and I was so impressed! I’m the mom of two toddlers and my dark circles are BAD bad! This eye cream made the darkness and discoloration completely go away. The eye cream is a very thick consistency, and a very little goes a long way. I lightly swipe my finger over the top of the product and the thin layer that comes off is enough for one undereye. I’ve tried a million eye creams in the past, hoping that one would help my raccoon eyes but have never had any luck. This product is a game changer for me! It makes me feel confident enough to go out with no makeup on because I don’t look like a zombie anymore! A Miracle Worker for Dark Circles!
