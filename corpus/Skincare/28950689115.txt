Gifted by Hanni - It’s my first time using a metal, single-blade razor and I can say that I’ll be probably not going back to regular razors anymore.I feel like my skin is smoother and it doesn’t leave a “strawberry skin“, also I notice that my hair is growing back a little bit thinner.Loving it! nan
