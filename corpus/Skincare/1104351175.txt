Pls note, this one star review is for the new formula.  I LOVED the old formula, honestly, it was the only thing Iâ€™ve used on my skin that I actually made a noticeable difference.  Yes, the smell was a bit sulfuric and medicinal, but that faded shortly after application.  The new formula is now fragranced and is awful.  If you have fragrance sensitivities, heads up.  I wish they would offer the old fragrance free one as an alternative.  Bring the old formula back please! New formula has nasty masking fragrance, inferior
