This product is amazing! I’ve been scratching my head over some gigantic pimples that I’ve been getting places other than my face. They are painful, takes more than a week and a half to heal. Even if it healed, it left me a hole of missing musle tissues where the giant pimple used to be. Very damaging.This product speeds up healing, the same size pimples are now takes only 4-5 days to clear.Preventing dark spots and tissue damage. Leaving me healthy skin.And I think it helps to prevent more coming back as well, because it seems the recent ones are smaller and lesser.I just made my 2nd purchase, will update if I see more results. It works!
