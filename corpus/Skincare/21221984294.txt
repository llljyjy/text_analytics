Thank you @thisisbutterly and @chickadvisor for sending me @clarinscanada Clarins Double Serum to test and give me honest review. I used the serum day and night for a week dayI liked that you had to combine the serum right before applying as it made me think it would be more affective. The texture was a nice gel consistency and it absorbed quickly without leaving a greasy feeling. My skin felt more hydrated and smoother after using. I liked using this serum and I would definitely recommend this product. #DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare #gotitfree nan
