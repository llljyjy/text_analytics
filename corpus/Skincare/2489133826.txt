This serum is surprisingly lightweight given the fact that I was expecting a very thick consistency and feeling.If you have dry skin or even dry patches, you might find yourself gravitating more towards this product as itâ€™s super hydrating on the skin.Although this product was sent to me for free, I am offering my honest opinion. Dry skin saver
