This cleanser was sent to me from Dior and Influenster for me to try and review. Honestly when I got it I thought the price-point was too high for a cleanser, but now that I have used it, I love it. You only need a pea-size amount, no more. It foams up and glides smoothly across your face.this tube will last a year.  It really cleans well and doesn’t dry out my skin after cleaning like most other cleansers. I feel like I am getting all the days pollutions off and it also takes off makeup we’ll, including mascara that’s hard to remove. I will buy again. Worth it!  Will last a long time!
