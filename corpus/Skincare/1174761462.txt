I’m so surprised at all the negative reviews! I use this as the first step in my nightly double cleanse and love it. 1- I prefer cleansing balms in tubes because it feels so much cleaner than sticking my fingers into a pot. 2- the texture is awesome to me, once you work in a bit of water it is very smooth and hydrating. 3- I love that it’s unscented, with just a natural, earthy smell. Maybe the folks who dislike it want it to be a single step, but as a 1 of 2 I will definitely be repurchasing. Great 1 of 2 cleanse
