This product reminded me of an yves rocher micro exfoliant I have used before in the way that it peels/balls up while scrubbing. It’s really satisfying to watch the dead skin being removed from your face. I found that this product was more pleasant to use than that one based on the smell and how it left my skin looking and feeling. My skin looked super glowy and felt extremely smooth after! My favourite thing about this product is that you can use it more than once a week and in the winter months with dry skin a lot of dead skin cells build up and create dryness on your face— it’s nice to have something to remove that and leave your skin looking better and better overtime.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review, but I can say I would buy this product because it checks off all the boxes as far as look/feel/smell goes. I would recommend this to any of my friends or family. I think a lot of people could enjoy this/many different skin types because it doesn’t seem like an overly potent product (I could see it being fine even for sensitive skin types). Great Scent & Product!
