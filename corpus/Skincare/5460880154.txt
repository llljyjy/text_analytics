I really enjoyed this product a lot until I put concealer over it. I tried 3 different concealers and they looked so bad over this, they all caked up and accentuated my under eye lines so badly. I was really bummed because I love how it looks and feels, but for the price I need something to work well under makeup as well as on its own. I do think this will work wonderfully for some people. Sadly returning this one! Great eye cream; terrible under makeup!
