Nothing new or exciting. The formula is like water so you have to be careful when getting it out to put on your face. I haven’t used this enough to tell how well it works but it does have a slight brightening effect. I don’t believe I would purchase it over other products but standalone without comparison, it’s fine for what it does. Alright
