I didn’t like this at first but then I realized I was layering too many products in the summer for my super oily skin. I was applying toner, moisturizer, the Unseen Sunscreen, and primer. This works perfect for cooler months. When I was still getting oily shine this summer my first instinct was to add this powder to further mattify and touch up during the day. That was a bad call because it didn’t wear well during the summer day, but neither did my other products. I took a step back and tried my routine with just toner and the Unseen Sunscreen for a week and loved the results but still wanted a little but more shine reduction. I recently added the powder and am loving the combo. Bottom line, by the time I was adding the powder my face was overloaded. It looked great at first but product would break down midday and retouching only made it worse because then it looked cakey. Now, I finally figured out the best summer skincare for my skin type. Toner, Unseen Sunscreen, and this powder are perfect. This product is great as long as you don’t pile too many products on your skin. Perfect… if you aren’t piling on product.
