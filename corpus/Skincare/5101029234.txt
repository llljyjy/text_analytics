This is the best daily self tanner I have ever used. I have light skin and this gives a nice colour after only one use. I have been using it every other day and the colour builds nicely, with no weird build-up or rub off. Pretty mistake proof to apply, just make sure you wash hands well at the end. As an added bonus, it truly works well as a moisturizer and leaves my skin noticeably soft. Finally, the best part is the smell or lack thereof! The watermelon is subtle and there is no self tan smell! I struggle to understand the other reviews complaining about the smell. You can slap this on in the morning, dries fast, and go about your day without smelling like a self-tan.  Worth the price, as a little goes a long way. where have you been all my life?
