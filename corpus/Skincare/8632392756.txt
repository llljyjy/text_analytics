I have a few issues with this moisturizer.1. It isn’t very moisturizing. It doesn’t really do anything for my skin.2. It pills on my face (I use this with a serum underneath and nothing on top)3. It smells like rubber or plastic or something similar to me. Not a pleasant smell.                      I DO NOT recommend it. nan
