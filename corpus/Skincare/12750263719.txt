I’ve been using this product for about 6 weeks now, and have been loving it! This is my first time using a vitamin C product, so it took my skin a few weeks to detox, but I’m so glad I kept with it during that time. I wake up with my skin glowing now, a much different sight than what I’m used to.I also have rosacea, and thankfully this product doesn’t irritate or make me flare up. The look of my acne scars is definitely going down and my skin has become more evenly coloured. The scent is also amazing! Especially in the morning, helps wake me up. Makes me glow!
