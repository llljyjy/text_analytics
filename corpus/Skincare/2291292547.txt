As the headline reads, love this lip mask. Have been using it for 9 months. Originally got it as a sample for my birthday gift and didn’t wait to purchase the full size. It is a little thicker but doesn’t rack your lips together. I put it on last as part of my night time routine. My lips haven’t been dry since using it. Love love love
