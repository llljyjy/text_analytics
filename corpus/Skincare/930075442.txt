This is SO amazing! I’m using it day and night because it is so hydrating and if you warm some up between your fingers and pat along cheekbones ans temples after finishing your makeup it gives a great dewy glow. My skin is super sensitive and it was very soothing and moisturizing. I even pat it under my eyes. I’d highly recommend this. I would buy this, it is a multi-use product and free of toxins for the most part. Great brand. Multi-use product!!!
