I’ve been using this cream day and night over the past month and I have mixed feelings. I really wanted to love this and I was thrilled to get it free from Biossance and Influenster. I have combination skin, oily and large pores in the T-zone but tight and dry on my cheeks. It’s a thick cream and does seem quite hydrating when it’s on but honestly I’m just not seeing the amazing results that other reviewers are. My bare skin still feels very rough. My pores are huge on my forehead and I’m breaking out a lot, which I don’t necessarily think is due to this cream, but I’m breaking out beyond the usual places and they take forever to go away/heal if they even do. I think this just isn’t the cream for me. I also hate the smell of it. I like that it’s packaged in a glass jar, but that does make it quite heavy if you’re carrying it with you. I might just set this aside to use only at night or in the fall. But I am unlikely to purchase this product. Not for me.
