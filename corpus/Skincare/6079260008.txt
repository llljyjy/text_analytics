I received this product as a complimentary sample and I have to say I was impressed. I have combo skin where my t-zones are oily but everything else will lean towards dry so it’s hard to find something that works for both. This was nice a light but somehow cured these ever present dry and flaky spots that I have about a 1/4 of an inch under both sides of the corners of my mouth. I have not found one product, and I’ve tried so many oils, moisturizers, toners, and serums, that I can find that won’t permanently get rid of them and this did! Although I’m sure I saw any of the instant claims, I’ll still take it! nan
