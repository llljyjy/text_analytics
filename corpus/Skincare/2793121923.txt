Used the entire bottle and the only thing it did was hydrate which I can get with regular moisturizer. If you want something that really works as far as dark circles, fine lines etc. are concerned try an oil. Argan oil, sweet almond oil, and rosehip seed oil are a few of my personal faves. Just take a small amount of the oil, warm it up between your fingers and gently dab it under your eye every night. You can even apply it over the cream if it makes you feel better lol. I promise youâ€™ll see results. Just remember consistency is key. Okay for hydration
