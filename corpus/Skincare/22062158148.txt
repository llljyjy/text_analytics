I have tried their original SPF mist and really liked it. Found out they had a peach scent and trying it was a no brainer. I just love how portable this is and it’s travel friendly. I took it to Coachella and at some point I was spraying it on my arm to prevent sunburn. The most luxurious SPF mist I’ve used. I will say that it might not work with people with oily skin. I’ll have to give the cucumber one a try next. smells so good and gives a refreshing glow
