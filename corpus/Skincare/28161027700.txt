I love this product. I use the entire line and while it’s not the most cost effective, the products are great  - this dispenser though, makes me feel like I might as well burn my money. Product. Everywhere! In copious amounts. Poorly designed. Beware. I have the little spoon the lotion comes with, I’ll try to do something with that. Disappointed with the waste of both product and money Dispenser pours my money away!
