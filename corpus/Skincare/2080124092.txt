I love Ren products so when they came out with a sunscreen, I was super excited to use it. I’ve been wearing this on days I am not wearing makeup. It is mattifying. This would be great for oiler skin or in the warmer weather. It also sets. Once it sets, it’s not moving so you need to spread it as quickly as possible. Do not dab it all over your face then try to rub it in, you will not be able to spread it. Do not rub. I have found the best way to use this is thin layers and one section at a time. Or on days where I’m in a rush, I squeeze a good amount on my palm and rub it together a couple of times between both my palms and smooth it thinly but quickly all over. Literally 30 seconds. Oh and it dries down, once it dries down it is not sticky or uncomfortable on the skin. Some sunscreens I’ve used don’t really ever dry down completely so I’m always aware there’s on top of my skin. So I do I like that it dries down. I like it once I figured out how to apply it. This sunscreen will not be for everyone. You’ll definitely need to try a sample before purchasing.
