I gave this moisturizer a good two weeks before reviewing and let me tell you it really does work.  If you have any little bumps they’ll be gone overnight. Texture is improved. The smell can be a bit polarizing depending on whether or not you like the smell of tea tree oil. It’s not too strong at all but if you’re sensitive it can be. My only issue is sometimes when I use it the texture of the cream can kind of “pill” on your skin but I don’t mind too much since I wear it overnight. Practically goes away in the morning. nan
