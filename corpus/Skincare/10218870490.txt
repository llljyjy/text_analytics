I have combination skin (dry cheeks/under eyes and oily T-zone. It’s easy to put too much of this cream on. As soon as I put it on my skin felt irritated. I put some water on my face and blotted with a towel to remove some of the product and it felt a little better. The next morning  my skin felt moisturized, & plump but had a few small bumps so I don’t think it will be good for my face but I used it on my neck & feel like it hydrated a lot. That area feels like the skin is thinning and sagging with age and I think this product will be great for moisturizing and plumping that area. I got a sample size with the face wash & primer for free as a bday reward, I really like the face wash so far, haven’t tried the primer. I will use the moisturizer on my neck but likely won’t buy a full size once it’s gone bc the price is too high. Unless I find it works miracles and makes my neck look 10x younger after this trial size lol Not for combination skin.
