I have fair skin, so itâ€™s very important to me that my daily moisturizer has SPF. So I definitely appreciate that this product is spf 20. I also really enjoyed the feel of this product. It was nice and smooth and absorbed well. Unfortunately it did cause some skin irritation, which is why I only have it 4 stars. I received this product for free from Influenster, in exchange for an honest review. nan
