I LOVED this mask. The last cookies and *cream* beauty product I had was a Bath and Body Works chapstick waaaaay back in the early 2000s when they used to make bottles of glitter filled fun for little girls and kept them on the back wall by the register. What a time to be alive. This mask reminded me of those days! It says that you can do it on either wet or dry skin – I tried both. My preference is to apply while my skin is still slightly damp. Too wet made it feel more like a scrub than a mask, but you could easily kill two birds with one stone by exfoliating and then letting it sit. The beads do disintegrate and turn the mask from white to grey – they take a few minutes of vigorous massaging to break down though and not all of them do so if you were opting for an exfoliating mask this would work well. My favorite thing about this was that it didn’t dry out my skin. Most cleansing products have me needing lotion right after, but this one shrunk my pores and left my skin moisturized and fresh. You could tell that it wasn’t full of old-age, dehydrating chemicals. Will continue to use and would definitely recommend! I need it cause you know that I’m a fiend
