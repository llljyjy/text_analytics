Got it to help my rosacea, been using it for a bit, haven’t noticed any huge difference but also haven’t had any major flair ups in that time either. I wish it didn’t squirt outta the bottle so fast & hard cuz it actually sometimes makes the product bounce off my palm & fly away, wasting a kinda pricy & small serum. So just a small critique there Rosacea Serum
