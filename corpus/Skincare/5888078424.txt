This exfoliating cleanser really surprised me! I rarely use physical exfoliators so this was a nice addition to my skincare routine. I have combo skin with some texture, dark spots, and have been experiencing some dry areas because of the winter. When I first used it I noticed it made those dry patches drier so I decided to switch to using the cleanser about 3 times a week at night. It’s been working out well for me and has allowed those dry patches to go away without more irritation. As for the formula, I really like it! It doesn’t feel too harsh and the scent reminds me of orange marmalade. It’s really been working well as a good cleansing/prep step for my clindamycin lotion, Differin gel, and moisturizer during my nighttime skincare routine. I can see a visible difference in my skin. Lately it’s been looking so much smoother, brighter, and feels baby soft. I’ve even gotten comments from my family about how great my skin has been looking! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who’s looking to up their skincare game! This was just what I was missing in my routine!
