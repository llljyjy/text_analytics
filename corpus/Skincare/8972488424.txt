First impression was great, product is appealing and comes with a cute spatula. I have very dry skin which could’ve been a factor to my results. It does have a strong fragrance. With the first use I experienced burning and itching to the face (which I’ve had with other non fragranced products as well), that eventually went away, and did not occur for the second time. i’m going to continue using this product, it provides great hydration to my face. My husband (who doesn’t notice anything) noticed how hydrated my face looked. Very Hydrating
