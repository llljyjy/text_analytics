I have tried countless sunscreen/ moisturizer combos before and this is by far my favorite. It sinks right into the skin, isn’t too heavy, and makes my skin feel hydrated and protected. It has been an amazing product to be able to try out and I’m so glad it worked this well for me! Best sunscreen/ moisturizer combo
