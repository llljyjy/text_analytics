I am new to eye creams & never prioritized using them in my skin care regimen. I decided to give this a try as I started getting dark circles after pregnancy. The dark circles were a thing of the past after about a week of use. I have been using this twice a day since purchasing. Although it is small, I feel it will last a long time because only about half a pump is necessary for each use. It’s very lightweight, so doesn’t feel heavy or affect makeup. Now that I have been using this, I cannot see myself not using this, or something similar in my regimen because I definitely have seen major results. Would I repurchase?! I may, but I would love to dabble in an eye gel next. If I can find an eye gel that screams my name when I need to re-up, I will definitely purchase this again. Kissed Dark Circles Goodbye
