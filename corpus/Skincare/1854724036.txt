I really love the gentle clean feeling of this cleanser. The scent is pleasant and not overpowering and it feels perfect for my sensitive skin. My skin is very dry and many cleansers leave it feeling stripped and even more dry, but not this one. It leaves it feeling soft and hydrated. Great for sensitive skin
