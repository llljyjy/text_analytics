This is my new must-have final step for my morning skin care routine. The Shiseido Urban Environment Fresh-Moisture Sunscreen is everything I need in one product; a hydrating moisturizer, and a protective SPF. Not having to use two separate products saves time AND money! Plus, it leaves my skin super radiant with a dewy glow. I do not feel sticky, or greasy after applying either. The fragrance is light, subtle and super pleasant. I use this every day! A must have if you want to honor your skin! Must Have!
