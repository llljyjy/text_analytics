After using this moisturizer for the past month or so I’ve concluded that I enjoy it a lot. I have combo skin and I love using this moisturizer not only at night but also to prep my skin for makeup. You only need a little bit for your entire face and it does not leave you feeling greasy at all. I also have acne prone skin and the skin around my eyes is very sensitive and I’m happy to report that I have not experience any breakouts nor any kind of burning or stinging sensation on my eyes after using this product. Bottom line it is really good and I will buy it again. Combo Skin Friendly!
