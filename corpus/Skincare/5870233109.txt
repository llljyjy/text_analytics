I’m amazed by how many reviews there are that mention the stench. Although it is somewhat unique, I absolutely enjoy it. Perhaps it is a genetic trait like cilantro, which some people adore (including me) while others claim tastes like soap. I used this after using a retinol treatment that dried out my face and got pretty excellent results. Although some reviews claimed that this product has a strong odor, the odor is VERY low (maybe unless you are very sensitive). I put off using this product for a very long time, and I’m so pleased I did! I adore it since it is so calming to the touch, doesn’t clog my pores, absorbs quickly, and I feel/think I see the results already after a few mos. I’m repurchasing! Smell is not as bad as people complaining
