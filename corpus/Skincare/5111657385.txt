I have used this for around 12 weeks. After the 2nd week, the spot on my arms and hands began to fade. As I continued to use they faded to the  point of being only slightly noticeable. I do not have many spots on my face but when I used it on my face, my skin tingled way too much and it made my face red. I would purchase to use again on my arms and hands but would not use on my face. I would suggest this to friends who do not have skin sensitivities. Effective but perhaps not for sensitive skin
