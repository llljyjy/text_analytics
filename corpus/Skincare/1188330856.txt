While I am receiving free product in return for my review, I have already purchased the retinol eye stick numerous times on my own accord. I like to put it on in the evenings after work when I am watching tv. I like that it feels moisturizing at the time of application. I also seem to be reaping the results of continued use, as my under eye area and crows feet seem to be the least aged thing on my face. I am tempted to slather this all over my face, lol! They make a face stick now, but I’ve had better results with the eye stick than the face stick. For me, this really does help to minimize fine lines around the eyes. I’ve tried numerous other under eye items, and I keep coming back to this one (and will continue to come back to this one), for the ease of application, the moisturizing effect and the wrinkle reduction. Really does minimize fine lines!
