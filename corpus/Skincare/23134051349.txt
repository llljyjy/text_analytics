This is a good soap bar. I feel like it did help with clearing my skin up. However it really tightened my skin, which I didn’t love. I wish it had a moisturizing element. I also wasn’t a fan of the scent, but for the price it did what it said it would do. I received this item complimentary from Bzzagent to review. Great for the price
