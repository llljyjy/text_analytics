i received a free sample of Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum from Topbox. This lightweight,  fragrance free serum contains Clinique’s expert peptide-rich blend, CL1870 Laser Focus Complex™., plus potent retinoid and hyaluronic acid.  The first time I used it , I could feel the strength of it- slight tingling but I think that would disappear if I used for longer. It has a lot of claims like visibly reduced wrinkles after 10 days, effective as one laser treatment after 4 months of using. But since the sample is a foil one & done, I can’t evaluate those claims. I definitely think it’s worth trying if it produces those results! I wish there was a ’not sure’ category for recommendations. I can say that I did really like the combination of ingredients. #freeproduct #tryitwithtopbox Great ingredients
