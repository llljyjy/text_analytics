I’m generally used to thicker serums, as this serum was very thin/liquid in my opinion. This made it a little difficult to apply, in my opinion. After applying it to my face, my face was noticeably brighter/shinier. The serum has a tightening affect once it has dried. Overall, it’s an okay serum. Take it or Leave it
