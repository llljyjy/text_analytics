This product was so fun to use! When you first put it on it is mostly white with little speckles/ beads of black. As you rub it in, the speckles break apart and mix with the rest of the mask. It turns a charcoal- like color. The mix of the whipped mask and the burst charcoal leave a light, yet cleansing effect. I LOVE this product! It’s not heavy, but feels strong. It’s cleansing, while still hydrating and doesn’t feel like it strips the skin. I could not recommend more! Favorite New Product!
