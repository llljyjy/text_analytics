I love this makeup remover! I have used cold creams and makeup wipes by diffrent brands and I always have to use more then one makeup wipe or with cold creams it feels like I have to scrub my face off to get the makeup removed. I put a little of this Melting Cleansing Balm on my finger and gently rubbed in circular motions all over my face and eyes, then I took a warm wash cloth and BOOM just like that I wiped all the makeup away with ease. It even removed my mascara with ease which is a big problem I’ve had with other makeup removers I am always having to scrub for a long time to remove my mascara. I highly recommend this product as a little bit goes a long way. Not only does it remove makeup but it also softens your skin, my skin feels so soft and looks so bright and fresh. This balm does have a light rose scent but it is not overpowering. It does not leave my face feeling greasy. This balm has really helped my dry skin. I’ve been using this for over a week and my skin looks and feels so much better. You can use it to remove makeup and also use it as a mask. I’ve done both and I really love this product. I highly recommend! Quickly removes makeup
