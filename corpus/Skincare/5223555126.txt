I was provided this product by Influenster and AB in exchange for and honest review.  This is a nice lightweight moisturizer that absorbs quickly into the skin but there were noticeably several drawbacks for me. One is the price, for such a high price I expect magical and this just seemed “good.” Two-I actually had several white heads appear after using this product which I haven’t had happen lately even with oily skin and thicker moisturizers.  Three, the tube shape-I love the metal tube and the weight of this, but with a rounded bottom this has to be laid flat, making it prone to rolling around on my counter.  My actual star review would be 3.5 for those reasons, but selecting 4 in fairness. Nice but drawbacks
