I bought this for myself because I like to use a gentle cleanser in the mornings. I have very dry skin, rosacea, and hormonal acne on my chin. I need something that won’t trigger my rosacea or irritate my acne, also without stripping my skin. This does a great job at doing all of that, and it has a very pleasant smell to it. The texture is really nice, gel at first and then builds to a nice small velvety foam. My husband saw me washing my face with this and was really interested in trying it. He has very oily skin and gets acne from clogged pores. I’ve tried getting cleansers for him for years but none of them were right for him so we gave up trying. He actually loves this cleanser and it got him into cleansing his face! He agrees that it does a great job with cleaning our pores without leaving our skin dry. I’m shocked that we’re able to use the same product on our faces since our skin is so different, but it goes to show how great of a product this is. Truly a miracle worker! Me and my husband love it!
