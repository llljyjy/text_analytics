This was so so sticky on my skin. I put it on before bed and my face would stay sticky for at least 1-2 hours (if not more) after application). I used it a few nights thinking maybe I could put up with the stickiness since I was just using it at night, but it really didn’t seem like it was doing much for my skin. Not hydrating, didn’t feel like it was really absorbing, just sticky. Sticky
