I have tried a lot of facial sunscreens that feel too thick and don’t easily absorb into my skin, so I was very glad that I was able to try Nudestix Nudescreen Daily Mineral Veil SPF 30. The formula moisturizes, acts as a makeup primer, and offers protection from sun damage. I often have quite oily skin, and I was thrilled to find out that daily mineral veil made my skin look matte in addition to moisturizing and protecting from UV rays. Two more great benefits are that it is 100% reef safe so you can feel good about using it, and it’s also one of the few mineral sun screens I’ve tried that doesn’t leave a white cast at all. I would gladly recommend this to others and the only reason I’m giving 4 stars rather than 5 is because I’m very fair and ideally need a higher SPF. nan
