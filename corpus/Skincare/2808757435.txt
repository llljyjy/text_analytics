I have been using this product for two weeks and I am in love with night cream!!! It literally melts on to the skin as soon as you start rubbing it in and it feels wonderfully light, which is a plus because I usually sweat at night no matter the season! I really love how moisturized and refreshed my skin feels in the morning!  I  don’t have to apply this every night I feel because I do get really oily overnight and my skin loves this over night cream if I apply it every other night.  It  doesn’t have a crazy fragrance, it’s barely noticeable and I enjoyed that about this cream too because I don’t want to smell florals as I sleep. Light weight but effective
