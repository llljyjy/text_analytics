This is a really nice, light, non-greasy moisturizer which has worked well for my combination skin. I like wearing it under foundation, though I wish it provided some sun protection. I appreciate that it’s made with relatively clean ingredients. I can’t say I’ve noticed a significant difference in the quality or appearance of my skin after using it for a few weeks, but overall I’m pleased with it. Great non-greasy moisturizer
