Spot tested it on my arm and everything seemed fine....until I tried it on my face and neck. My entire neck became red, swollen, itchy, and hot to the touch. Not sure if Iâ€™m allergic to the bakuchiol or something else in this moisturizer. Trying a serum from another brand before ruling bakuchiol out entirely once my skin calms down Itchy red swollen rash
