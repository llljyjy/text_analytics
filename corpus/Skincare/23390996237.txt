This was a very generous amount in the packaging. I love eye lotion because it last so long. This one is so nice. I dab it around my eyes & my eyes are very hydrated from it. I don’t really notice it having a smell, which is a plus. I’m not sensitive to smells, but I’d still prefer my face products not to have any on them. This was nice. I’ll probably buy this about every 6 months I’m guessing. Happy I tried it. nan
