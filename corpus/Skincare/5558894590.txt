I received this product from #topboxfreeproduct the sample provided was for less than a week so I did not see significant results. The product was easy to apply and did make my skin feel smoother. It did not cause my face to be oily or irritated in any way and I do have sensitive skin. I think if I were to continue using I would see the desired effects Smoothing cream
