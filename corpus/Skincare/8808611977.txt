I got this through Influenster. I wore it for a while to make sure I was seeing results. I was putting it on like a lotion, so covering me entire face. I feel like it did help with pore size, but it also made my skin dry. I know it’s cold but I’m don’t usually get the flakiness I got with this product. Meh
