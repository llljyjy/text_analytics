I don’t experience redness and have no issues with moisture because my skin type is oily. I was mostly interested in the pore tightening benefits. I think it does a decent job in that aspect. There are other options at a lower price point that can do this. It isn’t a bad product but just didn’t amaze me either. It's decent...reminds me of SK II
