I received this cream in an Infuenster box! My god do I love it!!! I have dry skin and it can get irritated at times. I put this cream on my face and it looks like silk!!! I couldn’t stop touching my face. And the smell omg!!!! This really is now the only moisturizer I’m using for my face. The plus side too? When you put makeup over it, this cream makes your makeup look porcelain. I see it’s sold out on here. You can see why! OMG!!!!!
