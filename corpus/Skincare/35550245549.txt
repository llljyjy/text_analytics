I was amazed that this wonder mist was formulated with hyalironic acid as I try to incorporate it in my skincare routine every day. I wear make up almost every single day, and even on days when I’m just wearing a sunscreen I always use a priming and setting sprays. I love that Gucci combined the two, and this magic spray not only adds hydration to my dry skin theoughout the day it also can be used to prep the skin in the am. It has a slight scent, but it’s not overwhelming at all, and just smell so fresh! Perfect for summers! Would definitely recommend! My skin loves it!
