While I think the line-filling eye balm may have done a tad bit of under-eye brightening (at least on the outer edges of my eyes), I didn’t really experience much benefit from using it for the last few weeks. I will say that it has a fantastic, buttery texture that’s surprisingly light so I may have had too high of hopes for it. The eye balm is comfortable and moisturizing, but in my opinion not worth the price tag. I do plan on using this product until it is out, but then I will most certainly be switching back to my go-to eye cream. Solid but not worth it
