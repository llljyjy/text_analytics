This is a fantastic serum that I think would work for any skin type. I have combo to dry skin and it does a great job at hydrating my skin. It absorbs so quickly and works well under all of my moisturizers that I use. There is a slight fragrance but it’s natural and very light. Not over powering at all. You can use the serum both day and night but I’ve only been using it during the day. A little goes a long way!! It is packed full of highly concentrated Hyaluronic Acid and I notice plumper skin right away. I’ve been using it for a month now and I’m really enjoying it. This was a #freeproduct sent to me from #trywithtopbox. I will definitely be repurchasing! nan
