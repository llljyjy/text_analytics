Very confused by the other comments on this product. This moisturizer is HIGHLY moisturizing and does not feel sticky whatsoever. It leaves my skin feeling super soft and is really perfect for pairing over other products (I often use Sunday Riley good genes/ lactic acid serum under this first without issue). Each of Clarins moisturizers are designed for a specific age range, this one (Multi-Active Day Cream-Gel) is for people in their 30s. Check their website to see that you’re ordering the most age/skin appropriate cream for your skin. I have combo skin and have had no issues with this, it provides a similar feeling to fresh’s Rose Deep Hydration cream without over powering scent. so good for 30s skin!
