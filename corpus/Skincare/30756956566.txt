I loved that there is no fragrance to the cream. I am sensitive to fragrance. It’s not greasy and leaves no oily feeling. Very light-weight and it feels like nothing is on your skin. I like it better than my usual daily moisturizer that leaves an obvious residue. My nose is always dry and Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Advanced Barrier Cream helped with relieving my dry skin all day. No fragrance. Light-weight. Lasts all day.
