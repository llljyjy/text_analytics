I was very disappointed at the beginning of the product size but it’s definitely enough! A little goes a long way! It is very hydrating for my skin that is sensitive around the eyes. I feel like it’s preventing and delaying the great «smiling» wrinkles! I really appreciate this product at night with my night cream more than included in my morning routine. Will buy again!
