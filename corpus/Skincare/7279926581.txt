I used my points to get the little sample of this moisturizer. I’m glad I didn’t cave and purchase the whole jar because I had a horrible reaction to it and had to throw it away. In less than five minutes, my face was bright pink and itchy. I have acne-prone, mostly oily skin but I my face has been sensitized after I had an allergic reaction many years ago. Overall, in the five minutes I experienced this moisturizer, it definitely matted down my oil, but my face felt horrible. If you don’t have sensitive or reactive skin this might work for you, but avoid this product if you get reactions easily. (Or if you’re not a fan of lots of fragrance... the scent should have told me I wasn’t going to like this immediately. My own fault there.) not for sensitive skin
