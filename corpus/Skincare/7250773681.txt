Omg so I’ve recently started using this cleanser and it has made such a huge difference in my skin. My skin feels amazing and I really love the texture of this cleanser! I’ve noticed a huge change in my skin and honestly after turning 30- skincare with collagen is such a must! Would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to have a soft and smooth skin. Also, I love how it’s easy to take off all of your makeup with it and it has all natural ingredients! Love this cleanser!
