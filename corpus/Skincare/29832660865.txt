I’m in love with these moisturizing sunscreens!! They have Hyaluronic Acid and none of the harmful chemicals like Oxybenzone, Oxtinoxate, Parabens, Cylic Silicone etc. This leaves my skin feeling naked but fresh and moisturized, it doesn’t clog pores or make skin oily. The Urban Environment Oil-Free Sunscreen with SPF52 doubles as a primer so it’s great for using before makeup application.I use the Urban Environment Fresh-Mousturizer SPF 42 when I don’t plan on wearing any makeup. They both smell amazing and these will definitely be my every day wear now! In love!
