I have loved using this as part of my nighttime routine it leaves my skin so moisturized. You can feel the difference in the morning. It has made a huge difference on my skin living in such a dry state. After consistently using it for a week you will begin to feel the differences and see your skin much healthier. I will be repurchasing it again. Also, a little goes a long way! Hydration without feeling Sticky or Oily
