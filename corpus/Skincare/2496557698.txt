My PCOS/hormonal imbalances definitely have caused me to have much more oily skin the last few years than I used to. So, it’s very rare these days for me to find a really good quality moisturizer that doesn’t leave my face feeling like an oil slick. This moisturizer really shocked me though! It was not too heavy and my skin really absorbs it well. I have to say this is the best I’ve been able to use for a nighttime moisturizer in quite some time. Definitely recommend for those on the oily side. nan
