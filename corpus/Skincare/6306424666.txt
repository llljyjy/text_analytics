I really wanted to love Biossance products but am super disappointed (I also wish I’d read the reviews first because my experience is not unique ). This is an expensive eye cream and sadly I can’t even use it because it causes intense burning and itching whenever I put it on. It burns and stings and dries out my skin to the point of flaking and peeling. Beware of trying this product. Burns and dried out skin
