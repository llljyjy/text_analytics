Received free from Influenster, for my honest review) I have been using that Creme Moisturizerfor about 2 weeks in a row, It was the first time I tried ESTÉE LAUDER my skin feels more balanced and moisturized, brighter, fresher and more, more, more......Even after a long day, I can still feel moisturized and it’s big +for my dry skin.I like a creamy texture, very light formula( not rich /heavy cream )fast-absorbing, lite smell.
