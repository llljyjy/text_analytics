Double Serum applies smoothly and absorbs well.  After a week of use, skin feels plumped and lines softened. It isn’t too thin or oily and I liked learning it’s made of 40% natural materials. @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor @clarinscanada #DoubleSerum #ClarinsSkinCare #gotitfree Clarity and Confidence with Clarins
