I add this to a few pumps of my moisturizer and apply as a body treatment to keep skin soft. It’s much cheaper than other anti-KP products and is essentially the same active ingredient as most of them. I also put it in a spray bottle and apply to my back to keep blemishes at bay (a side effect of getting an IUD). It’s much too strong to use on my face. Affordable Treatment for KP on Arms
