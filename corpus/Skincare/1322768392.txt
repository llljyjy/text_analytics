I have chronic dry skin and very few creams have really made a difference. I was skeptical that this one would be any different but tried it since it was the Lancôme brand. Lancôme is one of those brands that I love but because it’s been around so long I often forget about it and use the next new thing instead. It really is a wonderful moisturizer, it feels light going on, not greasy at all but really does do a great job of keeping my skin moisturized throughout the night. I’ve been using it for a month now and my skin seems much calmer and less irradiated and the dry patches I was experiencing prior to using have completely cleared up. My skin feels so smooth and soft now. The moisturizer also has such a pleasant, light scent that it’s really become a necessary and luxurious part of my nighttime routine. Beautiful and effective moisturizer!
