So I decided to try something new as I received a sample and I was really surprised.  I used it after washing my face and I applied a layer allowing it to melt into my skin and I felt my face immediately hydrated.  This hydrated feeling lasting though out the day.  As for the texture, it is soft and light, not too heavy and goes on smoothly, it absorbs well and doesnâ€™t leave a greasy film despite being hydrating.  The fragrance is light, fresh with a hint of rose, I really like the delicate fragrance.  This cream brightens as well, but it takes a few days of continuous use to start seeing the brightening effects, almost like a glow. I highly recommend this product, especially if you are working from home, you can put it on before you start working or use it as a night cream if you preference is something on the less heavy side especially during the summer months.  As an added perk for all of us trying to reduce waste, this container is a refillable jar, so when you run out of product, you can just buy the part where the cream is and pop it into the jar. Hydrating, smooth and my new fave
