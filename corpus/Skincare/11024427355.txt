I wanted to love it because it’s affordable, and I love peach lipbalms. But the texture doesn’t feel moisturizing, it’s waxy, and doesn’t really taste/smell like anything (I thought it would taste a little peachy) . It’s also not tinted, which I don’t mind, but I thought it would look a little pink on my lips since it looks so pink in the tube. All in all, it doesn’t moisturize or change the way your lips look. Weird texture, not moisturizing
