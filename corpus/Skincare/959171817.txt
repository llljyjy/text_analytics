I love it! I purchased a mini-size and once it runs out I will be purchasing the full size. It is very gentle on my reactive skin. I have a difficult time finding a cleanser to gently remove my makeup and non-drying at the same time. This cleanser is non-foaming lotion-y serum. It takes off all of my make up and rinses clean with a very clean feeling. It does not sting/burn or leave my face dry afterwards. I also use tretinoin and the cleanser does not irritate my skin which is very rare. Great for sensitive/reactive skin!
