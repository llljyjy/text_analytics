This product just like any other skincare product takes time to work but when you allow it to work holy moly it works great. I had full skin texture and needed extra brightening help and this cream did that. The scent was not to overpowering, the vitamin C wasn’t to harsh and it has numerous types of hylaronic acid which is so great. I would put this on with my other serums at bed and wake up feeling gooey and beautiful! I highly recommend getting this product and trying it out. I received this product free from Influenster for testing purposes! Run don’t walk!
