After using this product for a few weeks, I do believe my under eyes are softer! I don’t have many wrinkles yet (I’m 23), but I’m using a retinol to help prevent future ones so I can’t say if it helps a lot with that but it might be! I only use 2-3 times a weeek. Sometimes my eyes do feel puffy after wearing this to sleep but they feel soft! I love the application personally and I feel it keeps the product clearer than other eye cream jars. I let it warm up on my skin before I move it around my under eye and it helps it glide on. It does not feel heavy, very light! Love the application, results so far so good
