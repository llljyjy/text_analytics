I adore this product, which is a new summer staple for me. It seems quite dark coming out of the bottle, but itâ€™s sheer and has amazing SPF coverage and a really light feel to it. Great for days when you want just a hint of colour and do not want to have to wear a heavy thick foundation. Light texture and easy to wear. nan
