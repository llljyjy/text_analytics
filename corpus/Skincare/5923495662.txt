I’ve been gifted the peace out acne day and night duo, and it has been a life saver! Anytime I have a random pimple pop up I can count on the pimple patch to quickly to reduce redness/irritation over night. I really like the clear patches to wear under my makeup to ensure I’m treating my pimple while out. Worth purchasing for sure! The best pimple patch I’ve tried!
