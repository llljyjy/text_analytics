I was given this and was SO excited to try it, but it smells like hotdog water. I hate it. It may be a wonderful, miracle-working product, but I will never know because I refuse to put this on my face again. It’s smell is just too off-putting for me. There are too many other wonderful vitamin C serums that work well that I don’t have to resort to using this on my face for the benefits. I am genuinely baffled by the number of people who like this cause it STINKS. Before you buy it, please at least give it a sniff in store, cause if you’re sensitive to smells like me, this is not for you. It Smells Like Hotdog Water?!
