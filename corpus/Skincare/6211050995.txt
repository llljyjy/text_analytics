I’ve gone through 3-4 tubes at this point so here’s my take. 1. As some other folks mentioned, a new tub is often MUCH harder and needs a good bit of massaging before it can be squeezed out. I find after the first couple days though, it remains soft and easy to use. (Just give it a shake and light massage beforehand cause there is some settling of the product.)2. Love the packaging because it limits exposure to air and I don’t have to stick my fingers in a tub. 3. Fragrance-free - thank you!!4. Price - perfection5. Effectiveness - A+. I don’t wear any heavy duty foundation, but routinely apply SPF, concealer, blush, + mascara. This breaks all of that down as any other cleansing balm I’ve tried. 6. The only slight con I can mention is that it’s a journey to get it entirely rinsed off - BUT as long as you’re properly following this up with a double cleanser, it really isn’t a problem at all. I start with this and massage it in for about 30 seconds, rinse for about 30 seconds and then go in with my general cleanser (usually CeraVe foaming wash). After the double cleanser, we’re good to go. Should also mention that combo leaves me skin feeling really nourished and not dry like most cleansing routines (for me). 7. plastic free too! As someone else said, it’s so cheap, you really can’t go wrong trying this out. and they now even have the travel size so I’d definitely recommend it! For context: I’m 28, light to medium complexion, combination - oily skin type. A learning curve, but *great* product
