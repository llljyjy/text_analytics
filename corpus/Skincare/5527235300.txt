I got the sample, I open and put into small zip lock because it last only 2 days to test and try it. My skin feels like glowing, fresh and smooth! I immediately purchased the jar in store. I don’t use it every day, just only for one night before a very special occasion in next day. It will make your skin feel nice and smooth. Especially the next day, I put my make up on, there’s no greasy left, no breakout and helps my makeup stay fresh. This mask stuff will make your skin happy. I believe this is good for sensitive, combination to oily and acne skin. This will help your skin smooth, calm and it gets the red face gone. I gave one star out because it’s very expensive and the product is very limit. Treat yourself like you came from spa! Happy skin!
