Thick and creamy consistency that goes on nicely  without  being too greasy. I was able to put it on and then put makeup over top of it if I wanted to. The smell was a lovely smell that I really  enjoyed,yet it was not irritating. I think it could be a little more moisturizing in the winter...however this is definitely  something  that would be lovely  year round if your not dry like me. Smooth consistency& works well
