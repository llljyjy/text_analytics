I LOVE this product. For those of you who hate the smell of sunscreen, this is for you as it DOES NOT smell like sunscreen whatsoever. The smell is kinda florally without being overbearing. It applies super nice and gives my skin a very nice glow without being greasy looking. It’s very moisturizing and doesn’t break me out which is rare as I have acne-prone skin. Highly recommend! OH- and the packaging is to die for. You can retract the pump so it’s flushed entirely which is a dream for traveling and on the go stuff! Absolutely incredible
