This product isn’t meant to give any coverage. Just even out the skin tone a bit. So if you’re looking for a foundation or skin tint, this product is not for you. This is a great skincare product with added color. Would’ve been a 10/10 for me but the product pills like crazy! I can’t rub it into my skin without it pilling. I’ve tried applying several ways and could never make it work. :( Really wanted to love!
