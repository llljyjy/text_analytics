Nah, RIRI was not playing with this one!!!  I initially tried this as a sample. I loved it so much so I brought the cleanser and toner duo and the cleanser smells so freaking GOOD!  and I have used so many different toners and cleansers and I LOVE this toner. Literally will legitimately will never use another toner again. I hope she never changes the formula. Iâ€™m light skinned with dru skin and this toner does not strip my skin or make it feel tight or over processed. I recommend this for any skin type and is now a permanent part of my DAY AND NIGHT skin care routine. buy it cause it WORKS WORKS WORKS WORKS WORKS
