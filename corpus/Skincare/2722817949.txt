This is my favorite vitamin-C serum and I use it every morning! No issues with pilling or oiliness. This has drastically helped my post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and faded them all away. Love that it is water-soluble and makes it easier to use with the rest of my routine and is non-irritating to my skin.Visit the Ordinary’s website to see their advice on which products you can or can’t use together, and how to layer products if you’re using multiple based on their pH and if they’re water and/or fat containing. Skincare is really an art! Fav non-irritating vitamin C serum
