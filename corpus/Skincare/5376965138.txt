For years I have been hearing nothing but great things about the KS Dry Skin Saver. Ive had dry and sensitive skin for most of my life, lucky, I guess. To top it all off, I now have a severe case of rosacea. Ive needed to change my skin care completely, as most skin care ingredients react and cause a flare up of my rosacea. I had really high hopes for this product but unfortunately it was a “no go” for me. On freshly washed bare skin it “pilled” like no bodies business. I tried it with a facial oil…same. I tried a heavy hand…same. I tied barely any at all…you guessed it…same. My face wash is non reactive and is not something I can just switch up like I used to do. In the end, this may be a holy grail for some, but for me, even for the price point, I’ll have to pass. I really wanted to love this…
