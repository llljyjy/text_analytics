I have been on a long search for the perfect eye cream.  I find that I sometimes overlook tried and true big name brands in search of something new, but there is a reason Clinique has been popular for so long.  This eye cream has the perfect creamy texture that nourishes delicate skin yet absorbs quickly avaoiding a cakey mess.  This cream performs well in 4 out of 5 of my must haves.  The only think lacking is it doesnâ€™t help with cirles or puffiness.  All in all, I will continue to use this and do recommend. Very nice texture
