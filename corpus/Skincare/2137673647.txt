Love. This. Serum.The wild nettle and niacinamide in this product help balance excess oil production. I have dry/combo skin with my t-zone pulling more oily in the summer, and since having started using this product there has been a noticeable difference. Normally by mid afternoon my t-zone will look wet with excess oil and I need to blot multiple times throughout the day, not anymore. I will blot my face once a day at work and every time I am shocked at how little oil there is. My skin looks and feels hydrated and glowy.I use this with a vitamin c serum in the morning and finish with a light moisturizer. Great for combination skin
