Nice packaging but pretty disappointed in this cleanser. Doesn’t get my makeup off and I need to use another brand’s foaming cleanser as a second cleanse to get all my makeup off (I don’t even wear that much makeup too). I love so many of their products but this one is a no-go. Not the best and and there are better options out there. nan
