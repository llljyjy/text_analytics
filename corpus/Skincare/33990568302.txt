I really like this cleanser. In my opinion it’s not too much nor too little and I honestly seen and felt a difference after the first wash. I’ve had worse acne during school and now my skin isn’t as bad but I have times I breakout and have a blemish here or there so I needed something such a this product to help my blemish prone skin nan
