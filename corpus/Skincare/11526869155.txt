This is a winter must have!! I have dry skin and am always looking for a new go to product. This feels like a balm and melts instantly on your skin to give it a beautiful glow and hydrated barrier. I use this as a sleeping mask after doing my normal skincare routine. I have seen great hydration after using this consistently and will continue to buy this. This was purchased with my money- not as a gift. LOVE. New winter staple!
