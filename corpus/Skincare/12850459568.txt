Been using this product for 3 months. This has a very smooth application, it doesn’t sting or have that warm feeling when applying on your skin. It also gets absorbed fast. I  have a noticeably dark spot from acne which I had for a very long time and it has lighten up. It’s still there but this is the only product that I think made a result, at least. I have tried several vitamin C and for now this is my favorite. I will let my girlfriend try this. nan
