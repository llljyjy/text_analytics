Get for hyperpigmentation. I’ve been using it everyday for the past 6 weeks and my skin  has never been this even in complexion. I will definitely buy again once my bottle runs out. I had no issues mixing it together. They have you mix it together because it loses potency shelved in it final form. *I wouldn’t wear it with makeup. It makes your foundation patchy. But soon your skin will be soooo clear you won’t need makeup. Buy it NOW
