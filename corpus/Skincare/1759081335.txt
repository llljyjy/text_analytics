Not for pale skin! I was really hopeful after seeing it all over social media. Bought it the second I got the email saying it was available. Did not work for me. I have pale skin with a lot of red. It blended okay but left my skin looking like I put on a really thick, way too tan foundation. Returned and bought the tiger glass cream instead! nan
