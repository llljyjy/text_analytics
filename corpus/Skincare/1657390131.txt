I keep returning to this product and find it really versatile. It can be used on itâ€™s own for  moisturizing, evening out skin tone and subtle brightening glow. I also sometimes mix it in with my foundation when i want a more natural coverage. Or use it as a base with foundation over top. I keep trying other primers for fun but always return to this one as a staple in my makeup bag. Versatile primer.
