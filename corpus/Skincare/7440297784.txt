I have been self tanning for years now. I used to like the super dark look but as I get older the more I desire a more natural look. I also don’t like to dabble too much when it comes to skin care products because I have sensitive skin. After just one application of this product I am hooked. It is so beautiful and natural looking. The product feels lightweight on my skin and doesn’t smell nearly as strong as other tanners that I have used. It also doesn’t clog my pores which is a huge game changer. I did apply too much to my hands and they turned out darker and more orange which isn’t cute. But this is an application problem, not a product problem. I really like this stuff!! SO pretty!!
