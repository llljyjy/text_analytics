got this product because every youtuber I watched was obsessed with it. it’s nice and the smell is light but relaxing, it’s not drying, BUT it does not take off even my day-to-day makeup. I have to go in with a different more heavy duty cleanser first and then follow up with this. For that reason, it’s not really something I would repurchase when I run out meh… not worth the hype
