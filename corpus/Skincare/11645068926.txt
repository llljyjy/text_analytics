I have to admit this is a great product and has helped with my acne and redness. But this is literally a glorified saline solution that you can get for less than $10 at any store. The bottle is nice with a good sprayer head but this is DEFINITELY not worth $28 when Iâ€™ve basically already had this type of product in my first aid kit :/ Glorified Saline Solution
