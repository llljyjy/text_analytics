I got this product as a sample to try from Influenster for my honest review! The products was great, worked amazingly my skin felt radiant and more hydrated! Sadly it was way too scented for me! Heavy fragrance  made me dizzy and it being so close to my nose! Doing warmer days I was more lighter then I would like! That’s why the one star less! If you don’t mind the heavy perfume smell I’m sure you will be fine, Other wise the products was great! Easy to put on not sticky and made my skin feel great!! Great product!
