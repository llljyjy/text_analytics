I have very sensitive, cystic acne prone skin from a lot of health issues and have struggled my entire adult life with my skin. Once I got my acne under control, I was left with uneven texture and scaring. Not to mention the pores from my oily skin. This product has changed my skin incredibly! My over oil production has diminished. My texture and large pores are smoother and smaller. My acne scaring has almost completely went away, and the glow and firmness makes me comfortable enough to go out without foundation! I use this once a week, for no more than 8-10 minutes. It does sting at first and if you leave it on too long, so may sure to set a timer. It is a chemical peel after all. The stinging subsides quickly. I follow with moisturizer and always use sunscreen with this product. Everyone needs this. It is a game changer. Not to mention the price!! Holy grail forever
