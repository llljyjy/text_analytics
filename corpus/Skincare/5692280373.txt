I received this product in the mail to try and I am so glad I did! This moisturizer is the first gel crème that I’ve tried, and I liked the thickness of it. A little bit goes a long way! When I put the moisturizer on my face it instantly felt refreshed and hydrated. I also liked how matte my skin looked, even at the end of the day when it can look oily with other moisturizers. I would definitely recommend this moisturizer to anyone with dry or combination skin like myself, or especially for a skin pick-me-up for those dry Canadian winters! Skin instantly refreshed
