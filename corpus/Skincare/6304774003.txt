I don’t know how it’s possible but Shiseido hydrating cream is so soft and smooth. It soaks in your skin almost instantly leaving your skin feeling soft without any residue. Since being in the sun more lately, I have found it’s not taking care of all the dry skin on my face but it’s still wonderful. If you are looking for a light layer of hydration this is for you. In the picture the right is the regular hydrating cream and left is their same cream with spf sunscreen to see the difference in texture nan
