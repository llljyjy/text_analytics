This is a great daily moisturizer for fine lines and wrinkles. It absorbed thoroughly and never felt greasy which is ideal for my combo skin. As I received a sample for my honest review I cannot speak to its claims after several weeks of use, but I did use it daily for a little over a week. My skin felt well hydrated and I could see an improvement in overall skin tone. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a daily moisturizer to combat fine lines and improve the appearance of your skin. Great daily moisturizer for fine lines
