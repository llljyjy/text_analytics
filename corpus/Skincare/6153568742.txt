This is literally only good if you have EXTREMELY dry skin. Before using this my face was completely clear and now I have breakouts in places I never usually do on my face. I also didnt get a dewy look I just felt oily and had to use a powder to control this, and even after a couple of  hours I looked extremely oily again. Will be returning this for something better. Oily not dewy!
