Disclaimer: This product was received complimentary from Influenster and Estee Lauder. A unique and rich hydrating formula; which after several weeks of use improved dryness, thus reducing the appearance of fine lines. I wouldn’t say I have major dark circles but from the ones I do get I can’t they’ve improved dramatically, if at all. The claims of dramatic change doesn’t hold up nor does change more than most other eye creams, it does however absorb and hydrate dryer under eyes well, leaving the area softer and smoother with continued use. Perhaps someone with more dramatic undereye problems may benefit more, but otherwise best to save your precious dollars. nan
