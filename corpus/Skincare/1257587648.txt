This BHA treatment is the best BHA product I’ve ever put on my skin. Ive had Fraxel lasers, chemical peels, and applied the strongest AHA/Glycolic and BHA/PHA/Salicylic acid products to my skin. Some very expensive. Pimples are not a problem for me but clogged pores/blackheads are. Nothing unclogs and shrinks my pores like this product. I do NOT follow directions as a ’spot treatment’ No, honey; I slather it all over my face and my skin loves it. If pores are a problem this is the ultimate solution. Nothing else compares for pores
