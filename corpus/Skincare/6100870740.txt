I absolutely love that this serum dries so smoothly and quickly, and doesnâ€™t leave my skin oily or sticky like most other serums I use. I have only seen a slight difference in brightness but I do think with continued use the difference in my skin will be more noticeable. I love the packaging as well, and that Tula has clean products! nan
