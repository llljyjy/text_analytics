I saw an improvement on my sensitive rosacea prone-skin after a few days of use. My skin has never has been clearer of my whole teenager-adult life. I also notice I have less imperfections. I like this product so much, it’s the best skin care product I have ever tried. Even people around me noticed my skin was better.I first bought the sample size which comes  with the YTTP cleaner sample size, and then buy the big format of the serum. A little goes a long way, I use approximatly 1 to 1.5 pump per evening.It’s super expensive, but I will buy again and recommand it to everyone which can afford it. Such a great serum
