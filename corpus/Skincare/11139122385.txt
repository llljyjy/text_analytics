I received a sample of the original cleansing balm, loved it. To be honest, I can’t remember why I decided to buy the Clearly Clean when I purchased the full size. Sadly, this doesn’t break down well with water, and has left me using a micellar water afterwards to remove the remaining product. If *only* it rinsed off the same as the OG.I’ve been using oil cleansers for several years now and love them. And although this one does leave my skin soft, I’m going for the original balm next time! Doesn't dilute well with water
