In between my before and after is just taking a shower.  I started having dry patches after it got colder outside. This serum immediately helped. Itâ€™s more creamy texture than serum texture but i like it even more. It feels like extra light cream.My skin is definitely glowing and so soft and so peachy to touch. Absolutely love it. My most favorite so far.
