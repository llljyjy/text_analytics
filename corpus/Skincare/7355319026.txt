Any dermatologist would tell you that you aren’t supposed to put retinol around your eyes because it causes eye irritation/burning and chronic eye dryness with long term use. I wondered why my eyes were so sensitive & tearing since using this product. Somehow I missed retinol was a main ingredient. I usually love Paula’s Choice products but this one is not worth the risks! Buyer Beware
