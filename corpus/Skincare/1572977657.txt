I’ve recently gotten to try out this double serum as part of my skin care routine and after a number of uses I really enjoy the softness of this serum. It’s a neat combo that works well together. I love the smoothness on my face after I apply this and under my moisturizer. A nice addition to have The softness is a bonus!
