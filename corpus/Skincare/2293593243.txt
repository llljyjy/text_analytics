I am a sunscreen junkie so I was excited when I received Iliaâ€™s C Beyond Triple Serum SPF 40 Mineral Sunscreen.  I used the sunscreen for 4 weeks.  It is a good sunscreen but not a great one.  It feels oilier than other sunscreens and pilled up when applying.  It does soak into the skin shortly after and made my face feel smooth.  I had to use 2 pumps to cover my face.  One pump is too little. I used Tone 1, which matched my skin tone pretty well.  I did not notice a difference after using it for 4 weeks.  The photo shows my progress, which does not indicate any change really.  Pros: the tint, ease of use.  Cons: the bottle design, greasy feel.  I do recommend the sunscreen if you want a tinted moisturizer with SPF. Good but not great
