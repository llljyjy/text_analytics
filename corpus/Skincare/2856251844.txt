Love this product. I use it as a base layer underneath my daytime SPF moisturizer or at night prior to a face oil or on its own. This to me is more like a treatment gel rather than a moisturizer and that’s why I love it! It brightens, smoothes fines lines, and reduces pores, and gives me a dewy glow! I’m also really sensitive to fragrance and whatever fragrance it may have is not even noticeable. The price point is a hit as well. Great Base Layer
