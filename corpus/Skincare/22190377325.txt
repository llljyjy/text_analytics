Such a nice moisturizer, super hydrating and makes my skin feel super soft and gives a subtle glow. It’s definitely thick and creamy but it’s not so thick that it just sits on your skin and doesn’t sink in, actually sinks in pretty quick for how thick it is. No real fragrance, just smells like a skincare product, so it’s not gonna irritate your skin if you’re sensitive to that. And it lasts a pretty long time because a little goes a long way. 10/10, will buy again
