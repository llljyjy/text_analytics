I was a little worried at first because I didn’t think SPF 20 could protect your face as well as this does. My skin felt moisturized all day and I didn’t need to reapply it. I didn’t look greasy at all. My skin felt so soft and hydrated. Even after being in the sun all day. This stuff is amazing. nan
