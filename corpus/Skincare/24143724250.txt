I use the cleanser bar everyday now as well as the exfoliating bar twice in a week. Leaves the skin feeling so fresh and soft when used as a second cleanser (after cleansing balm). Also, I think it might’ve helped in reducing my acne scars as well but it’s difficult to point which bar worked the best for that purpose since I use both of them regularly. Staple cleanser + moisturizer!
