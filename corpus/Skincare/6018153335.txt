There is literally nothing special about this Gloss. I say Gloss because it doesnâ€™t feel like an oil at all. It can be kind of sticky and if you lick your lips after it has a really weird slippery texture. I like the smell and it is nice for a little sheen on the lips but not what I was expecting. Just a Gloss - Not Bad Though
