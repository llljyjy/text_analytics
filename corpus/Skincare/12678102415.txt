I received this product to test compliments of Influenster. Let me start by saying the packaging is luxurious! Glass bottle, nice and heavy. I’ve been using this for a few weeks and honestly I expected a bit more. It’s very hydrating, but can be a bit tacky on the skin, and I like for my serums to absorb completely. This didn’t help with my dark spots but my skin did have a nice glow and was very moisturized Nice, but pricey
