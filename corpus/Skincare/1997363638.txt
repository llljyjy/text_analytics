This moisturizer is perfect for drier skin types like mine. I’m an esthetician in my mid-thirties and live in the midwestern part of the US where it can get pretty windy and cold. As you can see in the before and after pictures, my skin looks pretty hydrated and supple after application. I can wear other serums underneath the moisturizer and concealer on top and it doesn’t get streaky or pill. The scent isn’t overwhelming like how many sunscreens can be; it has a faint aroma of tea. I love how it offers broad spectrum SPF 50 protection without a heavy greasy, white cast. Dynamic Skin Recovery is ideal not only for those with concerns with dryness but also with fine lines and wrinkles. The combination of hydration and sun protection makes it easy to incorporate this all-in-one preventative treatment in a daily skincare routine. Bye bye dry, dull skin
