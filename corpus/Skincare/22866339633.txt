Iâ€™m really fond of this product and was fortunate enough to receive the Fenty Skin toner as a part of a free sample program! Unlike other toners that I have used, I was surprised by the consistency of the liquid. It is much thicker than the toners I have used before. There is a rose-like scent to this product, which I really enjoy. The packaging is pretty cool too! I would definitely buy this product again and recommend it to my friends and family because it makes my skin feel more hydrated after use. A new product to my collection!
