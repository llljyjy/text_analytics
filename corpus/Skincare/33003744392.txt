This product made me a bit dry, but if I only put it on my oily spots (which happened to be where I had dark spots) it was completely fine. I did see some brightening over time but I have discontinued use of the product due to its drying factors on my skin. I would maybe recommend this product for oily skin but otherwise I wouldn’t use this. Eh…
