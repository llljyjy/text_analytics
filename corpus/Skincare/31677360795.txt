I have been using this product for the past two weeks now and I am liking it so far. After washing my face with a cleanser, I apply the toner using my finger tips and go in with my moisturizer. This visibly brightens my skin, fading out acne scar and all when I wake up in the morning. It also doesnâ€™t dry out the skin or anything. The packaging is beautiful, the slender bottle with a pump, the yellow color just tops it off. I hope I continue to see positive results. #trywithtopbox #freeproduct Nice Essence
