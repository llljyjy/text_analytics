i’ve been very loyal to biossance but love trying new things. i didnt think i would like anything more than their probiotic gel until i tried this. it really does keep the skin hydrated long term, and i don’t need to use as much as i do with my biossance one due to the more moisture in this. this is excellent, the perfect moisturizer that you feel all the ingredients and effects working. perfect
