I have been using this new Herbivore NOVA brightening serum. I wanted to give enough time to see any effects before I gave a review. I was excited about the brightening effects after only three days. I woke up on the third morning and noticed a remarkable difference. I have tried Vit. C products in the past but always stopped since they were too harsh on my sensitive skin. I would get red angry skin. There’s something about this creamy turmeric formulation that is perfect - I am getting the positive brightening and smoothing effects of the V without any of the normal negative side effects. You can really smell the turmeric in the bottle - it’s the first thing I noticed opening the bottle as well as the yellow turmeric tint. I highly recommend this product, especially if you’re looking to try C on your skin without burning it. After two weeks I still see a new complexion even if I don’t use it every day. The perfect C for sensitive skin
