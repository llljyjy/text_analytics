I have tried high end and in between cleansers for my hypersensitive skin. My skin reacts if the wind blows in the right direction. Skin care can be overwhelming and disappointing when bad reactions occur. IN my case redness, burning, hives and breakouts along with dryness that feels like crusty glue. This cleanser has not contributed to any issues! The price point is exceptional and zero fragrance that I can detect. My skin feels clean not stripped yet supple. Please donâ€™t change a good thing, I plan on stocking up. Happy
