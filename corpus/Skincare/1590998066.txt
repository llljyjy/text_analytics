Clarins Double Serum. Contains 21 plant extracts.This double serum includes a non-greasy oil and melting gel.It smells fruity and floral, light and refreshing. I found in the samples there was a lot more oil than gel, but it mixed nicely and absorbed quickly, with no greasy residue.My pores seemed smaller, and my make-up is going on smoother and nicer.I did unfortunately have a breakout while using the serum, but it wasn’t from using the serum, more because of not eating well for a few days 🙈 otherwise I’d have posted pics. So you get pics of my sample packs :)Overall, I really like this product and would buy it ! I recommend it to you 👍@clarinscanada @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor #gotitfree #doubleserum #clarinsskincare Clarins Double Serum
