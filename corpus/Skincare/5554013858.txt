This took me a while to notice a difference, but once it started working... wow! I have very oily skin with lots of dry patches as I use tret, but after about a month of using this my skin has transformed. It feels noticeably softer and plumper, and the dry patches where my skin would peel that used to ruin my makeup, arenâ€™t there anymore. In will be repurchasing (sorry to my wallet). I Only took a star off as it is expensive and runs out quickly for the price. Softer and plumper skin but big price tag
