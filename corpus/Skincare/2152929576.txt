My skin was always kind of oily with dry patches on my face, around my chin area and it gets worse during the winter. I do not like putting on moisturizers on my face when it’s hot out because it feels sticky after. Confidence in a Cream Hydrating Moisturizer is very light and not uncomfortable to wear in the summer. It keeps my skin from drying but does not make it oilier either. I am close to my 50’s so feeling my skin in better condition is very satisfying. I don’t hate the smell of it either so that’s a plus for sure as strong scents give me headaches. A very good way to have a little confidence boost for sure! Confidence in a Cream does give me confidence
