I have been using this for years and absolutely love it! Occasionally when I travel I’ll forget it and use another product and I’m always disappointed. Other products leave my skin feeling dull but this is hydrating without a strange sheen. Also the smell is mild/natural--like cucumbers, which I appreciate because I do not do well with strong fragrances. Best moisturizer!
