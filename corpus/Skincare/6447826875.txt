I’m always looking for killer products that are multipurpose as I like to keep my routine fairly simple. This is my new favorite otc retinoid. The fact that it has niacinamide which helps protect the skin’s barrier helps reduce the irritation that some retinols can cause. It is a bright yellow initially, but absorbs nicely into the skin and neutralizes. I’ve been using it for about a month and as anyone knows, retinols are about long term results but thus far my skin is looking glowy and bright with minimal breakouts, so I’ll keep using this along with my favorite cleanser and moisturizer and hopefully my skin will continue on its glow up.
