Not great and I was really looking forward to this product. The holes are to small on this mask, the nose area and eye and especially the mouth it’s like charlotte designed it for only her slim face. Two, the bottom chin strap makes this mask so hot after a minute of wearing it, I leave this sucker in overnight and it’s not cold after 3 minutes of leaving it on and again it make make face sweat with how much it covers. The eye part doesn’t even touch your bags so it more for just cooling your upper cheek bones. To I just just cut the bottom half of this mask off and the lower cheek parts and it works way better. Next time I’ll stick with my 10 dollar target cooling eye mask next time. Not the best
