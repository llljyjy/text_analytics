So I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. I’ve been trying this product for a couple of weeks now and I absolutely LOVE it! It feels amazing on my skin, sinks right in without feeling greasy, and hasn’t broken me out at all. my skin texture has also improved since I started using it as well. I know that it’s a bit pricey, but I definitely am going to keep using it and will most likely pre-purchase it as I love it that much. if price is a sticking point, just keep it in mind when sales happen or you’re looking to splurge on something. I am thoroughly impressed with Tula skincare as this is the first product of theirs I’ve ever tried and I highly recommend it now. 10/10 would recommend
