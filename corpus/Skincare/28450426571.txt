It’s a pretty good average face cream in my opinion. I liked the texture and consistency of the product and how it felt on my skin. I also liked the smell and left my skin feeling soft. There isn’t anything beyond that though that would make me want to purchase this over any other vitamin C cream but it’s not bad. Pretty good average cream
