Alright, I glow like a darned lightstick on moon rocks. I got this stuff and thhe very next day I saw results. The scent is not heavy and in your face, the serum texture is awesome, not very sticky and soaks in beautifully. Price isnt bad for the ingredients and work put in. Full disclosure - I recieved this product as a free to test.As you can see from my picture, this serum is shiny in itself, but don’t let that fool you into thinking that’s the only reason youre glowing - this helped my scars and pigmentation fadenas well as even out my skin texture, causing a diamond in the rough to shine. You need to not overdo it though.  I found using it every other day or 2 days worked best for me or it would be too much vitamin c for my skin. I have very dry, sensitive, acne prone skin. I mean EXTREMELY sensitive and dry. This did NOT break me out but overusing it did make my skin feel a little uncomfortable and that’s normal for me when using these types of products - vitamin c, retinols, peels, etc. Anything of that sort can have this effect on me so know your skin and dont overdo it. This worked wonders for me. I fell in love with the ingredients and that it is a glass casing. I am all about ingredients for my face and hair with how sensitive I am and how many skin issues I have, I have no choice but to get the very best. This is definitely up there. Go for it
