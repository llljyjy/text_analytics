I was recently able to try the Abeille Royale Double R Serum from Guerlain and am so impressed after using it for just a week. First - the packaging is superb. Itâ€™s beautifully designed, and it dispenses the serum from two chambers, combining the separate ingredients into one really nice textured serum. It feels really light (so not overly oily or heavy) but also rich going onto the skin. Usually, it takes me a few weeks to notice a product making a difference in my skincare routine, but after sleeping with this on my face for just two nights I could feel it hydrating and smoothing out my skin. My skin felt really nourished and looked more radiant almost immediately. Also, typically a product that is able to help minimize pores and control texture in the skin can be too harsh to use daily - this does not have that problem at all. In fact, it feels like it is able to both help restore moisture and repair the skin barrier while also controlling any imperfections and blemishes. I am already impressed and excited to see how it performs in the long term. Would absolutely recommend for a multitude of skin types! So impressed
