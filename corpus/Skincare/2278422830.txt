I like the way this product makes my skin look. I was expecting more of a makeup coverage as this has a tint color to it. I found it is very important to follow the instructions or you will not like your skinâ€™s appearance when using this product. You have to shake the bottle really well and tip it down when dispensing. Then I use my fingers to pat it on my skin...mostly on nose, and T-zone area. It dries in/absorbs quickly and does not show any smears from being patted on. I have worn this with makeup on top and liked my skin and have also skipped makeup and liked the way my skin appears. I always like having the added benefit of sunscreen and feel this product protects as intended while also making my skin appear glowing and smooth. This is a different product than I am used to-you need to use it differently. I recommend it as it makes your skin appear smooth and healthy and also providing sun protection. I received this product for free but all opinions remain my own. Makes skin glow!
