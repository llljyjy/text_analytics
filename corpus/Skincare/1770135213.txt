It’s good for what it’s supposed to do! Definitely makes my lips feel plump & hydrated. Need to use this continuously to see overall lip health improved. A little goes a long way with this product. Love that there’s HA in this. Leaves lips feeling slightly tacky but that doesn’t bother me. Not as shiny as lipgloss either which I love. nan
