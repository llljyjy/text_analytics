I have clear skin and never break out, but after using the product I broke out after one uses. Tiny little bumps all over my face.  I tried it again a second time just to be sure and sure enough broke out  again.  The breakouts look like a rash all over the bottom half of my face.  Disappointed because I wanted to like this product! Causes breakouts after 1 use
