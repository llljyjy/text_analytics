When I first tried the cleanser, I was a little surprised by the sent. The products are usually a bit more fruity, but it wasnâ€™t unpleasant, just different. It lathered quite nicely and when I put it on my face, it felt rich and almost oily.  It was very smooth, but also kept its lather through the whole minute of washing. When I written it off, I expected it to leave an oily residue, but it washed off clean and clear and left my face soft. Altogether,  I loved it and it was a very effective makeup remover and cleanser. Wonderful Cleanser!
