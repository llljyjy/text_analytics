This is the second cream I’ve received from the Hyaluronic Acid Red line.. I love that the packaging is uniform because it looks great on my vanity next to my other @shiseido skincare. I’m so in love with this brand. This cream is very thick and hydrating while still feeling light upon application and providing the Hyaluronic acid that I love in the day cream. It’s not overwhelming and is moisturizing without causing any breakouts, as some heavier creams tend to do. While the day cream has the spf needed to protect from the sun, this cream provides extra hydration for thirsty skin, keeping it soft and supple. I highly recommend all of their skincare, and the beautiful packaging is definitely a plus! Leaves skin super soft!
