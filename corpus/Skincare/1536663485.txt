I received a complimentary trial bottle of this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I used the Micro Essence consistently for three weeks and did notice an improvement to my skin’s overall appearance — enough that I’ll likely buy the product despite its hefty price tag. My skin really did seem more hydrated and radiant. But, calling this a “lotion” is a bit misleading, as it’s a thin liquid that needs to be applied with a cotton ball or round. nan
