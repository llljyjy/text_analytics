As the colder days approach, this serum is a must-have! I love that it is packed with great ingredients like four different types of niacinamide, cacao seed extract, and Japanese goldthread root for deep hydration! This serum absorbs very well and leaves a beautiful glow on the skin. I have very sensitive skin, so the best part is that this serum is fragrant-free! Perfect for winter months!
