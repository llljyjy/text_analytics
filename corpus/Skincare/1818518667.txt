There are so many HA serums out there, but this one definitely stands out to me. I bought it because it has multiple molecular weights of HA and I do notice that it hydrates my skin more deeply and for a longer time than other products. Itâ€™s also more watery than sticky, which makes it easy to use during the day. Apply/pat on damp/slightly wet skin for the best effect. Will keep purchasing! Better than other hyaluronic acid serums
