This soap bar has an AMAZING smell! It has a mild shea, coconut, and vanilla scent that isn’t too overbearing. I didn’t think this bar would be able to do much other than clean my body, therefore I was surprised to find out that it could also moisturize my skin and treat some of my body acne. Love the size of this bar as well. It is a bit expensive for a bar of soap, but after using it for a few weeks, I haven’t even scratched the surface. Definitely an excellent value for the money, and I’ll buy it again! The only drawback is that it’s tough to hold in your hand and use because it’s so big and shaped like a circle. nan
