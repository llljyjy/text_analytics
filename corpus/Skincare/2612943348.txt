This is my holy grail for battling fine lines & wrinkles. I fell in love with the Eye Stick several years ago and it’s my go to every night! It’s super easy to use, not greasy or messy and provides results!! My 11 lines have faded as well as lines around my eyes. I even got my 70 year old mother to use it and she loves it just as much! Definitely a must have in my skincare routine! The holy grail for battling fine lines & wrinkles!
