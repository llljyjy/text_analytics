This moisturizer looks like a cheap drugstore sunscreen when i put it on. It just sits on top of my skin for like 10 minutes until it absorbs. I hate it. It also left my skin feeling kind of tight after, so it didn’t even provide that much moisture. Will probably follow another reviewers advice and use this as a hand cream. Definitely wouldn’t repurchase. Doesn’t absorb
