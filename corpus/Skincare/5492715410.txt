The cooling eye stick is okay, it’s a nice addition to my night time routine but it doesn’t blend in well with all my other creams/serums/makeup so personally for me it’s not good for my morning routine.It feels really nice but I think I’ve tried similar products on the market that work better for me. Nice and refreshing!
