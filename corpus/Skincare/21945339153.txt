The product reflects the price. Overall it seems to work well to keep my lips soft but it smells very cheap (think childâ€™s play makeup). I was disappointed as I thought I was going to be receiving a scrub but the coconut is only a lip balm. The title of the product is misleading. Overall would maybe buy again but a different colour. nan
