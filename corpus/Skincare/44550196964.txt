I have struggled to find a retinol that doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. Usually with harsh products, my acne gets worse or my redness is inflamed. With Dermalogica, that was absolutely not the case! I am so happy to say that this product worked great on my sensitive skin. I’ve noticed an improvement in skin texture, as well as those tiny bumps that are so hard to get rid of. I’ve even progressed to using this product on my neck and back of my hands as well for anti-aging purposes. This was gifted to me by Dermalogica, and I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to try! Great for sensitive skin!
