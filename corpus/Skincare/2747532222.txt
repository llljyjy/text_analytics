I wanted to love this, but alas, all I’ve really noticed is my nose peeling. I have combination skin that can be a little sensitive. I’ve used this about four times, spanning a week between each use. I also use this in combination with very hydrating products from YTTP (dream cleansing balm, adaptogen mist, cactus oasis serum, dream oil, and dream mask), but that doesn’t seem to have helped reduce the peeling. I also exfoliated with YTTP’s unity exfoliant a couple days after use, but alas, my nose is still peeling. I do love YTTP and will continue using the line. This product is just a miss for me. Not for me
