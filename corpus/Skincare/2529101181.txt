This is the gentlest formula. I was scared it would make me breakout/purge because I wasn’t using an exfoliating toner before. My skin is also pretty dry in Canadian winter and this product has done wonders. I’m half way done the bottle and my skin looks and feels ten times better. It hasn’t stopped me from completely breaking out but it’s completely changed my skin texture for the better. Take a chance on this you won’t regret it! buy it!
