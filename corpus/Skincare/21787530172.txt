I received this product via Influencer and I am so glad I did. I have been a huge fan of Biossance products, specially their Omega repair cream, Lactic acid night serum and the squalane lip balm, so when this plumping serum was launched, I was super excited to try it. I have been using it for the past month as a day time serum along with my omega repair cream and it has added a noticeable plump and bounce to my skin. Added bonus is it is light enough to wear under makeup. I’d definitely recommend to my friends. Absolutely love it ❤️
