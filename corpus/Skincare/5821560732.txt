I am almost 40, so I know I should be getting into serums. I was happy to try this one out. I like the way it feels on my skin and it goes on smoothly and it doesnâ€™t feel too greasy at all, which I think was something I was scared of with someone with acne prone skin. I would like to continue to use it and see how the long term results are, but so far, so good! Smooth and effective!
