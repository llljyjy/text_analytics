I had been looking to add a new moisturizer to my skin care routine now that the weather has gotten much colder. I was thrilled to receive this one as a #freeproduct with #trywithtopbox. First impressions, the green glass jar packaging was sleek and gorgeous. I love the herbal scent. I’ve been using it after my shower in the evenings overnight as I don’t usually like to wear moisturizer under my make up on account of my greasy combo skin. Definitely happy to have this as part of my routine. It’s an affordable alternative to some of the more pricier moisturizers available on the market but does the trick for me! Green Light for this Moisturizer!
