I received this product complementary from Influenster to test and give my honest opinion about. The consistency is pretty thick. It absorbed well, but felt a little oily after. It didn’t affect my sensitive skin, which was a plus. It did leave my eyes a little less tired looking. Not sure if I would purchase this product due to price, but it wasn’t bad. nan
