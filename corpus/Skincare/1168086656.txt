I was appalled when I first sprayed this - the product looked and felt like water and smelled like chlorine. I thought I got scammed. How could this be $28?!! Out of concern, I looked up peer reviewed data on hypochlorous acid and skin conditions and it seemed promising so I continued ahead and sprayed this after cleansing, ahead of any other parts of my skin routine. After about a month’s use, I noticed a huge reduction in stubborn mask acne, mask rashes, and overall redness and irritation. It worked so well that I’ve also begun to use it after laser and microneedling treatments as a way to gently cleanse the skin without irritation and speed up healing. I’m still amazed that this works - it seems so unlikely that it would do anything at all so if you are on the fence, I suggest giving it some time to work before throwing in the towel! magical healing spray
