I was very excited to receive this product that was gifted by Laneige for my honest review. I had heard good things about it and was hoping it would live up to the hype. The first thing I learned with this product was that a little goes a long way. The product was instantly hydrating. As someone with dry skin, this product moisturized my skin and helped it to stay moisturized throughout the day without making me look oily. I used this moisturizer as a base when applying makeup many times and it left my skin hydrated and blended with my makeup very nicely. After application, my face felt very soft and smooth. The only thing I would say negatively is that although this product is recommended for oily skin, it just makes them look even more oily and did not go away through out the day. Aside from that, love the product and would definitely recommend. Loved it
