By far the best I’ve used. The reviews saying they “fall apart” must be very rough with the pads when removing them from the packaging, or something. I’ve used a ton of different pads, these are definitely the nicest quality I’ve found. (and yes the sides aren’t sealed, so if you’re rough with them it can split the layers apart, but that doesn’t happen 99% of the time if used normally) These are BY FAR a better quality and better value than sephora collection. $11 for 165 pads, that are a better size (not huge like SC) and better quality.
