I rave about this item whenever someone says they have any kind of dry/flakiness on their face! My only complaint is that I wish I bought this sooner!!  during my trips I have dry & very sensitive skin - I tend to break out easily and dry skin occurs above my lip whenever I go on an airplane to where Iâ€™m in so much pain and discomfort. This is my fourth tube, I use it after anytime I wash my face as a moisturizer instead of a mask.  My skin thanks you, Summer Fridays! on my fourth tube
