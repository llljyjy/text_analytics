I love this product. It is definitely getting a permanent spot in my skin care routine. They took an already excellent product and improved it immensely. Was surprised to see results as quickly as I did. Have only been using it for 10 days but can already see an increase in firmness and a decrease in fine lines. It goes on easily and sinks right into your skin. Gives you a nice glowing sheen but is not greasy at all. Nice lightweight formula. Not quite a water cream but does sink in like one. Extremely hydrating and moisturizing. Have been using it twice a day and wake up to nice plump and bouncy skin. It plays well with all my other products and have had no issues with pilling. Does seem to be repairing my damaged skin barrier because after I cleanse my face with no product on, I can still feel the effects. Have received multiple compliments on how beautiful my skin  is after using this product for about 7 days. Would recommend it to anyone who is concerned with aging, dry or damaged skin. Would definitely consider it a holy grail product after 10 days of use. Cannot wait to see it’s full effects. The only bad thing I can say about it is it does have a medicinal smell. It’s not enough to be unpleasant though. nan
