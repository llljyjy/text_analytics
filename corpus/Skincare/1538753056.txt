It seems this product is a hit or miss and depends on the person. For me, I loved the thick texture. It made my under eyes feel hydrated and it appeared to brighten my dark circles a bit. The only drawback was the oxidation (because, avocado) so the color of the product got darker; however, I’m not sure how it affected the products efficacy itself. I will say, if you’re prone to milia, this product may not be for you. Well…EYE liked it.
