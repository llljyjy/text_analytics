I was given this free to try through an Influenster VoxBox. I actually really wanted to love the product, but after a while my eye area felt.. Tacky to the touch. It goes on nice, but when it settles..  I am very aware it is still on my face, as it feels it just sits there.. And I’m not a fan of that. If you have sensitive skin, you really nwed to do a patch test! Don’t skip it! nan
