I’ve only had this product for 2 days and i already notice a meaningful difference in my skin. My acne was calmed after the first use. The consistency is really nice and i don’t feel like it strips my skin at all, just leaves it feeling soft and clean. The smell reminds me of a blueberry scented kids shampoo- slightly artificial but i don’t mind it at all. Fantastic
