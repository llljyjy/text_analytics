YEARS…. And I mean YEARS and thousands of dollars later of trying to find products for my dry, hypersensitive and reactive skin. This whole time sephora was creating this gold mine of a product. First aid beauty has nothing on this formula, and actually FAB products gave me one of the worst breakouts of my life. This is literally the best moisturizer i’ve ever used. My skin looks amazing and is glowing from the inside out. I am forever grateful for this product!!! I use it with the firming eye cream and glow serum, it is simply a chefs kiss. Don’t think about it just buy it for real PLEASE RUN TO SEPHORA FOR THIS NOW
