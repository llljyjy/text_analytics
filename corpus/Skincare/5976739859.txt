I received a sample size of this product to test for free, and I’ve been really enjoying it! First off, the sample of the product that I received is somewhat small, but I’ve been using this every night for weeks if not months, and I feel like I’ve barely made a dent in it. The moisturizer is a super thick, gel-like consistency. I really like the way it applies, as the thickness makes it feel really moisturizing and luxurious on the under eyes. I’m not sure that I’ve noticed any visible difference in my under eyes since using it, but the way that it feels going on makes me like an enough to recommend it! I’m excited to keep using it and see if it can plump up that new wrinkle I’ve gotten from baby sleep deprivation! Luxurious eye cream!
