I’ve always wanted to try this cream.  I’m so happy I finally did. It’s a wonderful cream! I love how it feels rich, and hydrating on my dry skin. I get dry patches still because of the masks and the crazy weather, this has helped me a lot,  but it isn’t enough on it’s own for me right now since I have very dry skin in certain areas. I started using it while it was still winter going into spring.  I think it would be better for me in the coming months when I don’t need as much moisture. It has a semi-strong fragrance to it, but it doesn’t linger (I’m sensitive to fragrance).  I like that it’s is refillable!Lucky me! I received this complimentary to test it and provide my honest feedback. Rich cream
