I wasn’t sure what to think of this when it came out and both looked and smelled like Elmer’s glue. I tried it, and my face immediately soaked it up. It didn’t break me out, and my face felt hydrated. It did it’s job, and isn’t terribly expensive. I’ll likely repurchase this. If you like Elmer’s glue, this is the goo for you. Works great
