I usually never write reviews but I decided to leave one for this product. I purchased this about a day ago and I’m already breaking out. Since I have sensitive skin, it immediately gave me tiny bumps all over my cheeks. I will say I do love how much moisture it gives my face! It also leaves my skin glowing. I just wish it wasn’t so harsh on my skin. It may work for others with less sensitive skin! Nonetheless, I will have to return this product. Beware if you have extremely sensitive skin!
