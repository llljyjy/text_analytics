I LOVE FAB products so I was very excited to be among the ones to receive this in return for my honest review. First off, I love the bottle and the pump, it comes out easily. With this serum you only need a little; it will go a long way, so I usually get about half a pump out each time I use it. It goes on smoothly, and I thought that maybe it would be slimy, but as it dries itâ€™s fine. I love it so far and it has become part of my daily routine! nan
