Absolutely love this cleanser. I have dry skin & thankfully my face feels clean but not stripped after using. My skin appears brighter & I have experienced less breakouts. A little goes a long way. My bottle has lasted me several months. The smell is a little off, however thatâ€™s a small trade off in my opinion. nan
