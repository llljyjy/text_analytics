Gucci Brume de Beaute Beauty Mist is hands down the best beauty mist I have ever used. I am a professional makeup artist and a Licensed Esthetician and I have tried and used just about every beauty mist and setting spray on the market. This one blows them all away. It has a soft, clean scent that smells amazing, without being overpowering. It can be used by any skin type. This product is made with great, moisturizing ingredients that not only make your makeup look amazing, but it’s also really good for your skin. I like to spray my face before applying my foundation, as part of my skin prep. The Hyaluronic Acid and Black Rose Oil really hydrate and plump your skin..making any fine lines and wrinkles or skin imperfections look alot less noticeable. Then, when applying my foundation, I spray my damp beauty blender and really press it into my skin. It gives your foundation a beautiful healthy, dewy glow. Then, after my makeup is completely done (powdered and all)..I apply it again, all over my face. It has this magic ability to really melt your setting powder and foundation together.. getting rid of any chaulky or cakey powder residue left on your face. As a setting spray, this product really does its job. There are days where I can’t touch up my makeup and I go 12+ hours and my makeup doesnt budge. My makeup still looks as good as it did in the morning, in the evening, after a long day. I really cant say enough great things about this product. If I could give it 100 stars..I would. This is one product that I dont mind splurging on and will continue to purchase it forever. Gucci really knocked it out of the park when they developed this product. BEST BEAUTY MIST EVER
