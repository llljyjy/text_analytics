Confidence In A Cream is my new go to moisturizer. It’s a thicker cream, so a little goes a long way. It absorbs fully in about five minutes. I find that my skin is smoother and brighter since I’ve started using it a few weeks ago. My skin is much more hydrated and calm. The fragrance is nostalgic for me and doesn’t cause any breakouts with my sensitive skin. So far, I’m very pleased! nan
