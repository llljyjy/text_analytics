I love FAB and their products, I have super sensitive skin and almost their entire line my skin loves. The cleanser I have been using for three years now with no issues, a little goes a long way I find. However, they released the jumbo size of the cleanser with the pump which I was excited for, but have been very disappointed with it. I got half way through my bottle and it no longer pumps and I’ve tried new pumps with it, cleaned the old pump and nothing works, so now I have to manually scoop it out and it’s just making a mess and wasting product. Even the regular cleanser bottles once they seem empty if you cut them open you have weeks left of product still in there. Great product, not the greatest way to dispense
