I love this stuff. It’s a great price-point, very moisturizing, and sinks well / sits on the lips nicely without becoming gunky or gross. I use it overnight after my face skincare routine, buffing my lips first. When I wake up, my lips are always soft well moisturized. Hubby always comments on how soft my lips are ;-) It’s a nice size to keep in your pocket or purse for being out and about. Note: it isn’t hydrating (the description says it’s “moisturizing“). There aren’t any hydrating ingredients here. Technically honey is a humectant, but it isn’t actually putting water back into the skin. For moisturizing, I like this product. For hydration, check out the Kosas LipFuel Hyaluronic Acid Lip Balm - the hyaluronic acid will attract more water into the lips just like it does for your facial skincare. I like to keep both balms on hand for their different purposes. Very moisturizing without being too thick
