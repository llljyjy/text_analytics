i wouldn’t recommend as a morning and night cleanser, i only use this at night. i use origins frothy face wash during the day because it’s lighter. this helps clear my pores and makes them perfect for the next day without stripping the skin. it’s a little more harsh than the usual cleanser which is why i don’t use this morning and night, but it’s such an amazing product! definitely works on clearing pores and smoothing out skin, it doesn’t dry the skin either which i love good night cleanser !!
