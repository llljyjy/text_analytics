(I received this product complimentary for the purpose of reviewing. )Before using this product I was using a generic cerave knockoff. I actually like this product a lot better because it is so hydrating and feels like I’m plumping my skin with a good moisturizer to start the day. It’s easy on the skin and hasn’t bothered my sensitive skin at all. The only weird thing is, I would totally use this at night too and I don’t really understand how it is “energizing”. But that’s a pro too- because it can be used day and night. One other thing to consider is the ingredients list. I don’t keep up with clean beauty but the ingredients list is long and may not pass the test for our clean beauty gurus out there. Great for my morning routine
