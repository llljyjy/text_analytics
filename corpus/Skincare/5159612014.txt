I was gifted this sample complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling, and I adore it. This exfoliant is incredibly mild on my skin, which is sensitive and prone to acne. I like that the product lathers up effectively and has no fragrance or parabens. After only one application, my face feels cleaner and smoother. I may now truly need to buy the full size! nan
