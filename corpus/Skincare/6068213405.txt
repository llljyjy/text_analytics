Received this as a sample and Iâ€™m not crazy about the smell but honestly have dealt with products that smelled worse. The formula glides across your face and helps to moisture especially irritated skin. I work with a face mask all day long and where I have running and chafing this has actually helped calm and reduce the redness in those areas. I also have bad allergies and my nose and top lip get really red and irritated from blowing my nose and this is so much better than petroleum jelly or cold cream it stays in place and slowly is absorbed by the skin making it calmer and less sensitive. Not saying I would use it daily but would sure keep it in my arsenal Calming indeed
