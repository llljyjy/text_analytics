I love this stuff!! It’s perfect under makeup. It’s lightweight, absorbs quickly & leaves your skin hydrated and glowy. However, had I not received it in exchange for a review, I probably wouldn’t have ever tested it out because the price tag is so hefty. I wish I could give it 5 stars but if you use this daily, you’d be out $80/month just in the serum alone. It’s gorgeous & I adore it, definitely swipe it during a sale!! Pricey. But gorgeous.
