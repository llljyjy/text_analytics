I have never really purchased eye creams as I tend to not see a difference but with this, you can immediately notice brighter under eyes. I also get very dry under eyes so usually concealer accentuates that dryness more and looks cakey but putting this on beforehand means that doesnâ€™t happen!It is very nice and glowy and a beautiful texture.Only negative is that sometimes it can burn my under eyes but I think that is when I am using active skin ingredients that get under my eye by accident! Super glowy, hydrating and immediate difference!
