I received a free sample of Clarins Double Serum. After using this serum for a week, I found that it helped keep my skin moist for a few hours. I like that it contains 21 plant extracts, but I want more information on what each of those extracts do individually and how they are each beneficial. Since I have only been using the serum for a short time, I canâ€™t say that it has visibly reduced any signs of aging on my face. However, it is non-greasy and has a fruity, pleasant scent that is not too strong. Overall, this is a nice, refreshing serum that unfortunately lacks information on its efficacy. It remains to be seen how well it reduces signs of aging, but I will continue using it to see if there is any progress. A Moisturizing Serum that May Not Quite Work
