I know this is marketed for use just under the eyes, but I actually used it around my entire face. It is rich and creamy and I found it left lasting moisture on my face. I did not break out after use of this cream, which can happen after use of heavy moisturizers. Overall I am very pleased with this product and how much it moisturized my skin. nan
