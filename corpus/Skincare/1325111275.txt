I received a sample of this in a GWP sunscreen bundle, and loved it so much I bought the full version.  In the past I’ve been a religious Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen user, but this product is so incredible I’m switching to Shiseido. The formula ticks all my boxes: it’s super creamy and makes my skin feel so hydrated, there’s no white cast, it gives me great sun protection, and the price for this duo can’t be beat. Perfection!
