I tried this as I love my other BIOSSANCE products and had high hopes. When I first regularly for about a month, my skin was fine, no real difference, but also no negative changes. However, after continued regular use, started to notice large splotches of redness, sensitivity and a sunburned feeling. I stopped usage to have my skin repair and switched my other products as well. I then attempted to use it again at night with no other products and sure enough my skin immediately reacted the next morning. I’m so disappointed as I don’t have sensitive skin to any other products, including those with heavy fragrance. Will absolutely NOT use again! Big NO!
