I used this cream on my face and neck.  It was kind of thick and sticky at first, but it didn’t bother me after it was dried.  My face feels smooth and soft after using this for a week.  I have deep wrinkles on my neck, and maybe it was slightly improved but not very noticeable change. Perhaps I need to use the cream longer.  But overall, it’s very good as moisturizer. Nice moisturizer
