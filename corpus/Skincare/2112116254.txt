Absolutely love this retinol! I’ve already recommended it to all my girlfriends. It’s not harsh on my skin and I wear this in the AM and PM under my moisturizer! It’s a balm which is awesome because it glides on smooth and I can put it in my purse or when traveling. I could start to tell a difference within 2 weeks. Beautiful, highly recommend. Amazing!
