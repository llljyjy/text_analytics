I’ve only used it for 8 consecutive days and I see a little difference in my skin, but nothing with an “OMG Wow! factor“. It’s definitely hydrating and the texture is super smooth. It has a mild scent, which is nice and not overpowering like some moisturizers. I probably wouldn’t buy this product though, since the price seems a bit steep for what it is. I would recommend this to a friend if they were willing to pay that much money for a nightly moisturizer. nan
