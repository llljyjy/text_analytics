I used to be obsessed with nose strips because I thought that my pores were clogged and the only way to remove it was strip until I found out that was very damaging to your skin as the little bumps actually help hydrate your skin. I received complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling and started using this product and I have notice that my skin has less texture and help clear up my clogged pores without damaging. it gives me the same satisfaction of cleanliness that nose strips used to give me.  I have really enjoyed this step in my skin care routine and itâ€™s easy application! Must have product
