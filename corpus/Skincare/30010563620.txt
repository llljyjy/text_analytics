This lactic acidosis serum is very easy to use!! First it doesn’t dry your skin and retains moisture. It’s very light to touch and not oily at all. Furthermore the smell is very neutral which I like. You have to use the product for a couple of days to see the result. It works very well and makes your skin glow. Great product
