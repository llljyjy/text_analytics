This is a product that honestly feels silly to want and to buy. I’d eyed it for a while but it seemed like a splurge, and eventually I tried it for the first time because a mini was gifted to me. I don’t find it exceedingly useful or noticable under makeup or anything, on a typical day when getting ready I’m not sure if it is doing much, but I have found this product to be indispensable as it reduces puffiness around the eyes so quickly when I have been crying. I have issues, my life is tragic, whatever, so I cry a lot. I need this product after a cry when my eyelids are swollen. Works much faster than trying to put ice or a cold spoon or something crazy on my face. The mini seems good to me for around the eye purposes, the full size product seems like it would be cumbersome to use in the way that I do but I haven’t tried it.
