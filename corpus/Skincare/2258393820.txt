I have seen so many videos about this I wanted to try it. I have lots of pink undertones I wanted to neutralize and just give an even natural look. This did absolutely nothing except cause breakouts like I haven’t had in years.  If I could have returned it I would have. It’s thick and makes my skin feel pasty. Like I put desitin or diaper rash cream on. If I could give zero stars I would. Save your money.
