I didnâ€™t realize how ineffective my current eye cream was until I started using this one. I have extremely dry skin, so I appreciate all the moisturizing benefits this cream has to offer. I have been using for one month and have noticed some pigmentation lightening and reduced dryness, both which helps the appearance in my 30-something year old fine lines. I will continue to use and purchase this eye cream. Only Have Eyes for this Eye Cream
