I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox and I give my honest review.I have combination skin, It’s a rich texture cream, it feels very smooth and silky on my skin. It has only a light scent that doesn’t irritate my skin or my nose. you don’t need to use much for coverage of your face and neck. Leaves your skin feeling very hydrated throughout the day. smooth and silky skin
