I received this #freeproduct from #tryitwithtopbox in exchange for my honest review. I received a small sachet therefore; I was able to use it for one application. I used it in the morning, after my shower and before I used the CLINIQUE Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream. I used it on my face and neck area. It went on smoothly and was not greasy. In order to give a detailed review; I would need to use the serum for several weeks. Wrinkle Correcting Serum
