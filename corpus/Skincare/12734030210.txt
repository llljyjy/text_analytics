I have always been a fan of charcoal masks after my first - Boscia’s Luminizing Black Mask. However, I have found peel off masks to be really drying for my sry and sensitive skin. So when I got this charcoal and honey ash-off mask, I was super excited to try it. I have tried to original version without the honey in it, and found that to be a little too drying on my skin, so this reformulation with a humectant like honey had me super intrigued! And i was right - this didn’t feel tight on my skin after applying and neither did it feel too stripping after washing off. It left my skin with a natural glow and definitely brightened it as well over time (I noticed the brightening after 3 uses). The scent (a sweet honey) and texture (thick, jet black in the jar and a transluscent grey with a hint of gold/metallic colour on my face) were also added bonuses and really made me enjoy the experience of using this mask. I would, however, probably not purchase this mask at the current price point, because I don’t think it did anything too special. There are other masks in the market that do similar things at a better price point and show results faster than this one. I love other Origins products, but this one isn’t a total hit for me. Maybe it would work better on oily, acne prone skin that needs help with decongestion and shrinking of blemishes. NON DRYING OR STRIPPING MASK
