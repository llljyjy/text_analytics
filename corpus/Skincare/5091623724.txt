Absolutely a must have in my routine now!!I received this product for free in exchange for a review - but I will absolutely be purchasing more when I run out now!!I have tried a lot of toners for my skin, and have never found one as good as this one. It leaves my skin feeling clean & soft. It feels like it is really working and as someone with super sensitive skin, I have to be careful with new products. I’m always worried they will break me out but this one did *not*. My skin actually looks clearer and more even since trying this toner! Obsessed with this toner!’
