I was torn between getting the light or the medium but I am so glad I chose the light. I was going for a bit more of a slightly sun kissed look but was amazing as a full tan. It says to saturate your skin on the bottle but less goes a long way i find. It did get a bit sticky but I did apply lotion that I didnâ€™t leave time to dry. Applies on very fast, non blotchy, and even with a tanning mitt. Awesome that it does not stain and does not have a scent like most self tanners do. Only giving 4 stars because I cannot get the bottle to stop leaking. awesome colour and easy application
