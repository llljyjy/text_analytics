Would give this 5 stars but I think it’s such a small bottle for the price. With that being said, this has become a staple in my nighttime routine. I love this product but really wish it was a larger size for the price. I have very oily sensitive and acne prone skin but this seems to really help. After cleaning at night, I spray this on my face and neck then apply my curology formula followed by my night moisturizer. I do see a difference in my skin if I don’t use it, especially the redness. If you can afford it I think this product is worth it. nan
