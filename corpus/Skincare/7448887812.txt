I don’t get a lot of pimples but when I do they are BIG. Like painful, huge and red. I don’t like to use cotton swabs with this lotion because they absorb a lot of it. Instead I use metal ear-picker which is long and precise ( also works well to remove black spots) I put this lotion overnight and within two days my pimples are reduced by a lot and they don’t hurt anymore. I rarely use it for more than 3 days. It is amazing but it works every time! really works!
