I’ve been using the product for a week now, and though it’s not my exact shade ( tanner shade) I really do enjoy it. The smell of sunscreen is a bit strong, but I don’t mind the smell. It concealed nicely and preformed better, in my opinion, than it’s competitors. It is almost too dewy for my skin, but that wouldn’t change me from buying it again. Beautiful product!
