I’ve never been a huge fan of vitamin C as my skin doesn’t usually react well to it but I was excited to try this one. I’ll be honest, the size I received was tiny so I wasn’t able to use it for very long so this is going on first impressions. Texture wise, this was a lot thinner and runnier then other vitamin c serums I have tried which I didn’t love because it was a little messy and I kept using too much but I like that it wasn’t sticky. This one did not irritate my skin which is a first for me and did give me a nice healthy glow and sat well under make up. I think for this price this is a good product but again, I can’t say whether or not I was noticing any benefits from it. I would definitely consider purchasing this if I was on a budget but I feel like there’s better ones out there. Good for the price
