Rich cream. I received this product from #topbox. It smells great and is hydrating when applied. A thin layer is good enough to spread easily all over the skin. I did however notice that the hydration does not last very long even when I applied a thicker layer. The thicker layer was definitely not the most comfortable feeling on the skin. I did love the fact that this did not create any breakouts on my skin Needs a little more hydration
