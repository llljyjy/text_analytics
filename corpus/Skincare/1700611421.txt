I received this product free for my honest review from Influenster. As soon as I put this on my face I knew it was very different from any other cleanser I have ever tried. A little goes a long way. Lathers up quickly and rinses off easily and completely. I waste no time or water! I don’t feel any residue. I do use this after I use a cleansing balm to remove my makeup. I’ve never tried it alone when removing makeup. Only drawback is it doesn’t smell better. It smells like soap which is fine but I wish it had a “prettier” smell.The cost is a bit high but since I only need a very small amount (pea size) this tube will last me quite some time so the cost isn’t prohibitive. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys having a fresh feeling clean face that doesn’t seem to strip away too much oil from the face. I actually waited about 10 minutes before putting on my serums and moisturizer which tells me a lot about this cleanser. Cleans without stripping
