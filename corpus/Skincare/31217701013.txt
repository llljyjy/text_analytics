I love this product! It is luxurious enough to only need a little and powerful enough to keep you hydrated and moisturized all day long, yet light enough to not feel greasy. You only need a little of it. I love that it is fragrance and all the bad chemicals free so I can use it even on my skins most sensitive days. It reminds me of CeraVe but on steroids bc it has better ingredients and also has more lasting power. I would recommend it for ANY skin type. You could use it in a light layer for daytime or a thicker layer as a night cream. I truly donâ€™t know how you could find any fault at all in this cream. It is WONDERFUL Perfect for any skin!
