I received a sample of this with my last order. I applied it before bed and woke up with the most amazing skin I’ve had in my life. However, it smelled like an old lady’s purse. I kept waiting for the smell to fade, but it never did. I was almost at the point where I wanted to wash it off so I would stop smelling it. However, I can’t complain about the results! Works great, smells like old lady
