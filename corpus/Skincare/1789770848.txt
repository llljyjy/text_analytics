Tried this through FabFitFun. I have very sensitive skin. Canâ€™t even use retinol. I am a believer in this. My skin feels perfect after. Better than after a facial. Depending on the day I can use it between 3 to 10 minutes and my face is burning a bit.  I immediately put on a serum and thick moisturizer to deal with redness.  Use it about once per week. Highly recommended. major changes to skin texture and brightness
