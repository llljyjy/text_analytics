I have used many brands of blotting papers for thirty years with no issues but these actually lifted my foundation right back off my skin. In all areas, including cheeks not just nose. I have combo skin, my cheeks are dry. For $4 you have nothing to lose by trying yourself. Just saying I was surprisingly disappointed. Don’t know what I’ll use them for now. Pre-makeup? Lift entire face of makeup
