This product I use for under eye bags. I used it in the morning and at night before bed. My skin loves this vegan skin loving formula. It has a blue tint to brighten dark circles. It also firms your skin and dark spots and puffy eyes. I am so in love with this product. I purchased the product and I have also recommended this product and my friends and family. This product is key to my morning routine
