I was not impressed with this. I have very dry skin and got it to use on my face, and it was just OKAY, but didn’t seem to do much for my dry patches. Nothing to cry home about. I wasn’t huge on the smell, but that’s something pretty easy to look past. What I REALLY didn’t like is that when rubbing it in, the moisturizer would pill up, like it was sort of separating or something if I rubbed it in for too long. Not a horrible product, but I don’t recommend it and I will not be purchasing it again. Not The Best
