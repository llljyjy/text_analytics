I received this as a sample in a purchase from 2020. After the first use I fell in love with it. I am now on my second bottle. It easily breaks down my makeup and sunscreen and emulsifies beautifully with one pump. It has a slightly floral, almost rice-like fragrance, but to me is very subtle and I donâ€™t notice it much on application. I have sensitive, acne prone, combo to oily skin and it has not broken me out or irritated my skin. Came for the sample. Stayed for the product.
