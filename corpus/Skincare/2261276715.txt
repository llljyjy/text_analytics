Another winner from Dior. I swear their skincare can do no wrong. First, the bottle has weight and heft to it which adds to the luxury. The cap fully removes to expose the pump which keeps air out of the product. The bottle is opaque to keep light out and help to keep from degrading the serum. The serum itself is very lightweight and kind of a milky color and consistency; it sinks in quickly and fully. Be warned that there is the signature scent that Dior products have so if you’re sensitive to scents, you may need to avoid. A pump or two will cover your entire face after cleansing but before your  moisturizer. Skin is plumped, moisturized, dewey looking. Skin is so soft after using this and after prolonged usage my skin is glowing, even at 42. I’m not sure about increased firmness, but I swear some of the fine lines near my eyes have diminished. I would very much recommend this product. Great Serum
