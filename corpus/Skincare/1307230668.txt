I love this product! I have sensitive skin, and I have rosacea. Retinoids are very irritating to my eyes, even when used only on my face avoiding the eye area. This product did not upset my skin, and while I donâ€™t use it around the eyes, my eyes are not bothered by it at all! While it feels as if it would be oily, once applied I found that it was absorbed by my skin leaving only a beautiful, healthy glow. I was surprised, as I have skin that is definitely oily in my t-zone. After using for a week, I find that my skin has a luminosity that Vitamin C brings to my skin. I have used other Vitamin C product with very good results, but given how well this product works and its amazing price point, I am a convert! I layer it over a hydrating moisturizer every night, and sometimes in the morning as well. Works wonders on my sensitive skin!
