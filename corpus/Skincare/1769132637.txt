I received this product complimentary (sample size 17oz/5ml) from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I love Clinique products and was very excited to try this new cream.I really wanted to like it however, it was just not my cup of tea. Maybe that will be a great cream that targets much younger skin in the late 20s and mid 30â€™s. It felt like a light moisturizer but I could not get over the sticky feeling on my skin. It has gel like consistency and it seem well absorbing, but was just not the right one for me. Just meh
