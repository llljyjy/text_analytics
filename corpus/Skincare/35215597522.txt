I purchased this product after it was recommended by a Sephora advisor. Its smells awful. I have tried many unscented products and always go dor unscented ones but this was unbearable while applying. Also It didnâ€™t skin in well and gave me a few whiteheads. May work for some but if you are looking for something unscented, this is not the one nan
