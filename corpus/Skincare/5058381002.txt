I got this free to review and I have to say its really not worth the price.  I loved the rich cream and was so excited to try this, but have not seen any noticeable difference in my skin. I’m 32 so I really don’t have many wrinkles, but I do have some fine lines and there hasn’t been any improvement.  It looks like they suggest to use this for 12 weeks, but I ran out of the product within a month.  It’s not horrible, just not worth the high price IMO Not worth the price
