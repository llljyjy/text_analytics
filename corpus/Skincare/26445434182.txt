Love the smell and feel of product.  The container is perfect to use.  Some companyâ€™s containers have small openings that are difficult to get product out of. Not IT Cosmetics, they made the opening wide which is perfect for women with larger hands.   I was thankful my dry skin did not feel more dry after use, it actually made my skin feel moisturized,  I were waterproof mascara as an emotional mama, and the balm had not issues removing the mascara.  Some products I can wash my face after and still have lot of makeup residue, not the IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Makeup: 3-in-1 Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm. After proper use I can clean my skin with night cleaner and no residue. My daughter used product after a recent dance competition with all her stage makeup and eyelash glue, and was impressed how well it work,  She asked for a jar for her competition bag. We both agree the smell and feel is amazing. Product is easy to use.  I really like product and impressed with it. Look forward to continuing to use it.  I will be recommending the product to my friends and family. Miraculous Melting Makeup Balm
