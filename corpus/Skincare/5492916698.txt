I used this for yrs. At first with the new formulation I was excited to see all the new shades. But when I tried it, I was devastated. Totally pills, which I’m guessing is bc of the increase in titanium dioxide. It was my HG, but now I’m searching for a CC replacement, like SO many other reviews I’ve seen. They ruined a perfect product…Don’t bother
