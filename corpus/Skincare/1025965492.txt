I ordered this as I was looking for an oil free moisturizer with hylauronic acid.  It smells faintly of watermelon, although I’m not a fan of fragranced skin products anyway. My disappointment with this was that it’s sticky!  No matter how little product I used, it left a sticky, tacky film on my face, so I found it impossible to put makeup on after this.   Even without using makeup, my face felt too tacky, and that film lasts for hours.  It just did not sink in to the skin like it should, so hmmm, I don’t know what all the hype is about.  I won’t repurchase this. Not worth it
