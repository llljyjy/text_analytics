The first time I used this was when I was on vacation with my friend and forgot my own face wash. I came home and a few weeks later was sent a complimentary bottle of it from Influenster and Tula in exchange for my unbiased review.  My skin is very sensitive/picky when it comes to products, and this did not bother me at all! Iâ€™ve always struggled with dry flaky skin  especially in the colder months and this helped that issue so much! I finally have smooth & clear skin, where I feel more comfortable using less coverage foundation products. I recommended this to another friend as well & she loves it too! So definitely give this a try!! I have noticed only positive changes so far! New Holy Grail! So Happy I Discovered This!
