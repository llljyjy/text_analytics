This was a great serum. I could see some difference in skin texture and brightness fairly quickly. The serum itself was non-greasy, as someone with oily skin Iâ€™m particularly interested in finding non-greasy skin products. Overall thought it was very moisturizing and a good product for the price point. Great non-greasy skin serum
