This SPF is LIGHT protection from UV. Good for under or over makeup. I love to wear it just as a glowy finish to my daily skincare since I rarely ware foundation. However if you plan to be in direct sunshine iâ€™d opt for a full coverage spf. My cheeks got red while i was on a walk wearing this alone. Smells great and so easy to apply! Great light coverage SPF
