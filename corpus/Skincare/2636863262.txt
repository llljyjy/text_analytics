I love the formula, it’s incredibly gentle. I have combo but mostly dry skin with redness and it does a good job of hydrating. It doesn’t really help the redness but the formula is gentle and not oily feeling. It loses a star because the pump is awful. Dear lord is it bad. It just shoots out in a random direction for the first pump you take. Great Formula! Awful Packaging
