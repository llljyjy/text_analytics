Omg I absolutely love this! This is so easy to use, I put it on right after the shower like regular lotion and it creates the best most natural looking tan! No orange tones here! I love that this is so easy to use for someone who is too busy to apply tanning mousse, and it looks super natural. This is definitely my new go to gradual self tanner highly recommend! Soo good!
