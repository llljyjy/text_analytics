I received a sample size from Influenster. I liked the texture, there was no strong odor and the consistency was perfectly creamy yet solid. I used it twice a day as directed, however, after a week, I stopped using it. The product itself was fine but I ended up looking oily. I tried cutting down on the amount of peoduct. That helped but I then cut down to just at night. The oily look was better but not for me.Overall, the product is wonderful. My advice is it is potent, use it sparingly. You may look a bit oily. If you can get past that go for it! Really nice cream
