I received this product in a mini kit alongside the Watermelon dew drops serum and used as directed. my skin has never felt more hydrated, soft, and illuminated. It took a few days of using, however after about 5 days I could visibly notice my redness disappear. It has a subtle avocado scent to it that is not overwhelming at all, but actually quite refreshing. I got many compliments on my skin while using this serum and will most certainly purchase again! Great Serum for Redness!!
