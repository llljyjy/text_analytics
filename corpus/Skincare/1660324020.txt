Ok so listen…I’m not gonna say that I don’t care about SPF rating (which pertain to UVB rays, for those of you who don’t know, that cause sunburn and skin cancer), but as a Fitzpatrick V black woman, I care WAY more about UVA protection, the longer wavelengths of which wreak havoc on the skin (premature aging, immune suppression, and also possibly cancer). The problem is, UVA rating is hard to figure out with most US sunscreens (sorry, but “broad spectrum” just doesn’t do it for me). Since PA++++ is the best we’ve got here, and I’m not feeling our chemical filters, Murad City Skin Age Defense is one of the best options that I’ve found for an every day sunscreen. In addition to high(ish) UVA protection, it claims to offer blue light and infrared protection which, if it actually does this, is a bonus for someone like me with pesky melasma. It feels good on my skin and doesn’t leave a cast, and that’s all that I ask for. Four stars for the price because why is 1.7 oz of sunscreen $70?! But, until I get my hands on some European or Brazilian sunscreens with much better chemical filters, I’ll be rocking with Murad for the foreseeable future. My every day sunscreen
