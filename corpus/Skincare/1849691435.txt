So mind you I’ve only used it once so far, but that one time it worked wonders! When I was in the store I was debating getting the Clinique cleansing balm, but as someone on a lower budget and with super sensitive skin, I was hesitant and asked an associate what they thought. They said that their personal favorite was this one, and that it’s fragrance free which would work best for super sensitive skin, plus it was more in my price range long term. So, I purchased it and tried it out. I LOVED how smoothly it went on and just cleared away any sign of makeup, without any vigorous rubbing or anything like that. It was gentle, effective and he was right- no reaction to it whatsoever, so it worked perfectly for my sensitive skin. Definitely would recommend based off my trial usage of it. Perfect product for sensitive skin!
