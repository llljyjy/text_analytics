I have normal skin on my face but in the winter it can lean to the drier side. This serum is the holy grail to my morning routine. It has made a huge difference. My face feels much more hydrated and thatâ€™s a key preventive to wrinkles which is my main concern. The best method I found for this serum is applying the serum with a damp face, not a dry face. After the serum dries on my face I apply skin fx cream face cream. It keeps my skin hydrated till my night time routine. Prior to this method my face would feel dry mid day. I highly recommend and you cannot beat the price. Holy Grail
