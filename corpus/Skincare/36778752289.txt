I’m loving this essence for a hit of Vitamin C and moisture in the morning. I love that it’s in the essence form so I don’t have to fuss with another layer of serum or moisturizer. The smell is divine and the packaging is wonderful. It feels luxurious. So far I haven’t noticed any negative effects and I will continue to use in hopes of some brightening action. Lovely essence
