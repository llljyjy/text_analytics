I purchased this beauty line few days ago and I just used it for the first time last night. The container is beautiful. The cream has a mild scent which I really like and it feels luxurious on the skin. I used it with the rest of the line(eye cream and face serum) I only give 4 stars because I need to use it for at least a month to be able to give a full review. So far I like it. This I recommend for the night time routine and it has a slightly greasy feeling after you apply it. It absorbs nice but it doesnâ€™t dry completely, so if you run your fingers on your face you can feel it. Dry skins are going to love this cream. nan
