I think this lip oil is amazing! It is very balmy and slippery, not sticky or too thin or thick. I love the color of the product, because even though it doesn’t leave any pigment on the lips, it looks really pretty in the tube. It smells like candy fruit, but in a sweet way, not an artificial chemical way. I find it very nourishing on the lips but it doesn’t last all day. My one gripe! Otherwise perfect. Love it
