I bought honey in the old formula way back and the spf caused a bad skin reaction which is why I love this current formulation and was super happy to repurchase. It is a bit on the drier side so it gives a more satin like finish rather than glossy yet had no issues with hydration. This time I bought peony and plum and both are amazing colours for my medium skin! Looks super natural and polished. I see myself reaching for these these everyday and more often then any other balm or lipstick. love! great texture, colour, and formulation
