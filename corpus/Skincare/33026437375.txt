I really didn’t want to like this because it’s expensive but now that I’ve tried it, I won’t go back. I have combination acne prone skin and I’ve been trying to find a face sunscreen for a year with no luck. I finally caved and bought this despite the price after trying five other SPFs and they were too greasy, pilled, or broke me out. Not this one. The consistency is so nice, it stays put, it’s comfortable on the skin. I like this product so much that I actually use SPF everyday which is something I can’t say for some of the other sunscreens I’ve tried. Will be repurchasing when I run out Worth it
