I received this item to review for free from Influenster. Here’s my honest take. This product is pricey. And I am more than happy to spend money on products I deem worth it. In this case? I don’t see enough improvement to justify the price. That said, this product has changed my morning routine. The application process is both good and bad. It’s quite tricky to get the product to come out in the quantity that I want. It takes practice in precision. That said, the applicator tip is amazing! The cool metal soothes my under eyes and feels like a spa treatment every time. Once the metal end warms up from use, it’s not as great but still a reminder to nurture my under eyes more. I have always had puffy eyes thanks to allergies and sinus issues and this really helps with circulation. Of course I have a jade roller but I never use it in the mornings and for some reason this product changed my morning routine so that I actually tend to my eyes more. The product smells amazing— clean and botanical. I didn’t see a big difference but I really enjoy using it. Feels Great When Applying
