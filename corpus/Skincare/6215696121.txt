Look, this is far from the best cleansing balm I’ve tried. It works, but it does not work as well as some of the other popular ones out there. But in terms of bang for buck you can’t go wrong. This is a LARGE tub for a really good price. It doesn’t dry out my skin or irritate it. I use it as a first step at night in my cleansing routine and use a regular cleanser after, so I never use it on it’s own or experience residue. So, it’s fine. Will I repurchase this? I don’t know. I fee like the tub I have will last for a year and I have quite a few samples and 100 point perks of different (better) balms so my instinct is to say no, but I will use the entire thing up, no problem. I think it’s a decent choice for people who are price conscious. It's ok for the price
