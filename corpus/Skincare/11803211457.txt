Compared to other brightening creams I have used, this one just isn’t doing it for me. It’s not bad - it smells great and leaves your face moisturizer but I am not getting any brightening qualities or glow. I used another high end brand brightening moisturizer that smelled the same and had the same consistency but it left my skin feeling extremely hydrated and the finish was dewy - something I personally am looking for. I find this absorbs into my skin immediately and I can’t really tell if I have any moisturizer on. For this price point I would not purchase - I received this to try for free from Influenster. Not giving me the hydration/glow
