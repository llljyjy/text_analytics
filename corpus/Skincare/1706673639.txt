Flaw free. Amazing. I love her. Was using Drunk Elephant AHA serum but wanted to switch after their recent reformulation. Everything about this product is a 10/10. Gel consistency makes this easy to spread and apply, and you only need a small amount to cover and large area. No burning, peeling, or weird smells. Just glowy, soft skin. Massive bottle that has lasted me ages. Great deal for the amount of product. I use on nights that I don’t use prescription tretinoin (if you haven’t gotten on the prescription retinol train, I’m here to convince you that it’s better and cheaper than anything you could get from Sephora). If you have oily, congested, acne prone, late 20’s skin that is starting to get fine lines, YOU NEED THIS. Honestly idc what kind of skin you have, you need this. you need this
