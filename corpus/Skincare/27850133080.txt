I like the twist too packaging to keep it from getting hard at the tip. It goes on smoothly and has a good smell. I Noticed my under eye area looking brighter after just a few days of consistent applying. The only downfall is that it really burns if you get it in your eye. As long as you’re careful it’s great. nan
