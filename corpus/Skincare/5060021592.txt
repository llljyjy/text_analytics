Been using this for a few weeks and have to say I really love it. I have super sensitive skin (get itchy/dry/bumpy if I use a product that irritates my face) and this did not irritate me! That being said, I know everyoneâ€™s skin is different, but if you are oily and have some hyperpigmentation from pimples/acne, try this! I can use it morning and night (I mostly use in the mornings) and mix a few drops in with my serum or moisturizer, and I have truly noticed less oiliness in my t-zone area where I always get oily throughout the day. Also, my hyperpigmentation had lessened slightly on my chin. While this is not a miracle product, it definitely helps on the areas I needed it and i would recommend for anyone who wants to add niacinamide into their routine! Make sure to use SPF 30+ with it when using it during the day or the effects on hyperpigmentation will not show! Love it! Definitely a must-try!
