My mom gave me the sample of this that she didn’t use, I HAD to buy the full size. As it is a cold winter and often I find myself picking at my dry lips, this did the trick, it’s the most moisturizing lip balm I have and heals cracks while giving a perfect (but not over the top) shine and tint to my lips. Would HIGHLY recommend! IN LOVE
