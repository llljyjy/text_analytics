Not for fair/light skin tones. The beige color it transforms into is too dark, which looks weird when you’re on the lighter end of the spectrum. The product does a great job at correcting redness, so if your have a darker/medium skin, it might be perfect for you. I didn’t mind the smell or the texture, but Dr. Jart+ should definitely consider making a version of this with a lighter shade. I bought this while looking for the correcting drops, but they don’t seem to be available in Canada. Works great, but not for fair/light skin
