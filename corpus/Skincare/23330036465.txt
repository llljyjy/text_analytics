Crafted in small batches this beautiful purple Calming Herbal Repair Facial Balm is infused with ingredients used in Traditional Chinese Medicine. It’s serenity in a jar. Its soothing property Astragalus Root is perfect for calming inflamed, irritated, angry skin. The texture starts off feeling like a bit dense yet super lightweight balm that instantly melts into your skin as soon as it comes into contact with the warmth of your body. You can use this alone for a nice facial massage pampering session on yourself or someone else (my partner begs me for a relaxing facial  massage with this) and such a tiny amount can go on forever which amplifies the effects of massaging it into your skin with either your fingers or facial tools without having to apply more. Or you can use this as a smoothing, soothing, restorative serum between your essence and moisturizer steps. The Purple Gromwell Root accelerates cellular repair and healing while the other natural ingredients like the Licorice Root fight free radical damage and inflammation with antioxidants. The Squalane & Meadowfoam Seed Oils help balance and hydrate your skin along with the Murumuru & Kokum Butters that keeps that moisture locked in & your skin perfectly hydrated.It has a heavenly earthy scent that is so intoxicating and it leaves zero greasiness behind. Once you’re done, you just gently pat any remaining product into the skin & absorbs like any other serum. I’ve had zero issues with irritation or clogged pores, my skin just looks renewed and hydrated after each use. Such a beautiful product! Serenity in a Jar!
