It’s application consistency is nice but does feel somewhat like a gel which is not my preference. Unfortunately for me it’s not going to stay in my product rotation. Anything I applied over it, be it makeup, a moisturizer, or other product, it did one or two things. High moisture products rehydrated it and almost created a lather on my skin. If I applied liquid or cream makeup over it, it flaked so badly I had to basically wipe my entire face of it. Used alone it might be ok. Not for me
