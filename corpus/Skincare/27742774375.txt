I was ECSTATIC when I saw this cleanser. An avocado cleanser with ceramides!!!! I started dreaming of moisturized, supple and glowing skin. I quickly found that when I applied it to my skin my face immediately started feeling tight and dry. I’ve had this happen after I have fully cleansed my face, but not when I began washing my face. I love Glow Recipe, and my entire skincare routine, except my cleansing step, are products of Glow Recipe. I’ve tried every product, and I’m always looking forward to GR’s next launch. So sorry Glow Recipe, but the Avocado Cleanser is a hard pass for me. Still hoping for that perfect cleanser for ultimate nourishment specifically for aging skin. A Hard NO Thank You!
