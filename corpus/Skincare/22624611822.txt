We all know how indispensable moisturizers are for healthy and glowing skin. This dewy glow jelly cream with cherry blossom by innisfree which is gifted to me by innisfree is perfect for when we switch from creamy moisturizers to lightweight water based ones. This moisturizer is lightweight ,has cooling effect and gets absorbed easily into the skin without leaving any sticky residue. During this dry season I tend to get flaky skin and am surprised within a week of its usage I have been able to combat all dryness and flakyness. My skin glows and looks plump with all the hydration delivered by this moisturizer. It has a mild cherry blossom fragrance which does not bother much as it dissipates soon. The packing is cute but would have been much better if it came in a bottle with pump dispenser or there was a tiny spatula which would have prevented dipping fingers into the product. Perfect gel moisturizer for summers
