This product is lightweight and it easily absorbed into my skin. I had no irritation and I really did enjoy it. The only issue is that it does make my face oily throughout the day. I tried to solely use this product on my face and it still caused oiliness. I still do recommend this because it makes applying SPF painless and it has good ingredients. I may have to try the Ultra-light version for better results. Lightweight
