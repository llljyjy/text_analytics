My experience has been really good, smell is not the best however it works really amazing. I used to put it at night but i figured a different way to put it in the mornings as well by putting the watermelon moisturizer and makes the weird smell go away. ( this oil works really good for me) I have dry skin and I don’t need to wear any make up and that’s amazing because it makes my skin glow. nan
