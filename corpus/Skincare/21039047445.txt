It has a beautiful cream-mousse texture, it feels nice and comfortable to the touch, so easy to apply and spread and it gives me a visible brighter and smoother complexion, not noticing improvement in the puffiness yet.It is recommended to apply it ONLY over the lower part of the face and neck, not the eyes area and by performing Clarinsâ€™ exclusive Manual Auto-Lifting Method, which I needed to get used to and might be confusing at the beginning for some people.  It also requires a little bit more of  time, which it is difficult to have during the mornings, that it is when the puffiness is more visible and when I am busy, but it should be used 1-2 per week, so I am trying to find some time to do it, if not I do it through the day. After applying and basically exercising for 10 minutes, it needs to be rinsed off with cool water.It is a good product, but think the application method would be easier to understand with a video. nan
