I have fussy (dry, oily, sensitive *sometimes* to who knows what, perfect one day, red and irritated the next type of fussy) skin so before commiting to an entire jar, I sampled this product, and I will definitely be upgrading to a jar!The fragrance is light and fresh, and doesn’t bother my sensitive nose. Creamy and light with gentle exfoliates, it applies easily as a cleanser, and serves double purpose as a quick and easy mask that rinses off in seconds. My face was left calm and smooth, with no irritation from the exfoliation. My skin was clean and soft and moisturized, and I almost felt like I didn’t need moisturizer after it, but decided not to take a chance since fussy skin. I appreciate Alpyn for their natural ingredients and cruelty free facilities. I feel good about using their products and am always thrilled when something new is released. Calmness brought upon fussy skin
