Not sure how this has great reviews. I got it as a free sample 2 weeks ago and it’s not that great. The smell was ok it was trying to be fruity but it’s not. Ive smelled worse. But the product itself was thick and once applied it doesn’t sink into the skin very well and it’s very oily. After 3 hours I felt under my eyes and still greasy. And then it made me break out. So I stopped using it. Tried it again today, and same thing. I now have 2 small pimples under my left eye. Not for my skin at all. thumbs down
