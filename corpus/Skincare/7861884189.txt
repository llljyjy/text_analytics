I’ve been using this product for 2 years, sometimes 3x a week, sometimes 1x a month depending on where my skin’s at and it’s the only product that makes a difference for my sebum problem. I produce excess sebum, get a little greasy, and often have bumps around my mouth and chin and some hormonal acne. Sometimes the sebum bumps are hard for me to deal with because they just sit in my face until I pick them out or maybe after months they finally dissipate. As a picker trying to break the habit this mask helps me to reduce the sebum, prevent it from building up, and as an emergency mask to immediately dial back the redness and damage after a pick session. It smells gross, has a horrible texture and is hard to rinse off in the sink without making a dark, staining mess... But I don’t care because it works. My sebum-busting holy grail
