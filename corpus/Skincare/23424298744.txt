These pads sting at first, but my skin got used to them quickly. I’ve been using these in combination with the serum, and I feel that my skin feels softer after use. I haven’t noticed a real difference in fine lines and wrinkles, but I’m noticing that my pores don’t appear as large and filled with sebum. I’ve been using these 2-3 nights a week for 2 weeks. nan
