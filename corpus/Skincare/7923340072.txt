I was given the chance to try this product for free in exchange for an honest review. I will be the first to say that I do not take care of my skin the way I should. I was excited to try something that may help in repairing/smoothing out any issues I was having, namely uneven pigmentation, dryness, flakiness, and an overall dullness. The first day I tried it out, the smell was the first thing that amazed me. It is so smooth as it goes on the skin, and there is no oiliness, even though the serum looks oily in your hands. Your skin seems to glow as soon as the serum is applied, and by the 2nd day, I began to notice a difference in the tone, evenness, and glow. After a week, I could see a visible difference, and my husband even commented on how fresh I looked. I am absolutely in love with this magical serum, and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to bring some freshness, evenness and glow back into your skin. A must-have in my routine!
