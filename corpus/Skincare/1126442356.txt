I have tried so many primer-type products so when I got this one I did not have high expectations.  I was pleasantly surprised! I have been using it daily for only a week or so, and I’ve noticed that my combo skin looks so much happier! I have a glow and it truly helps cut down the oil that accumulates in my T-zone throughout the day. I’ve used it underneath my liquid foundation as well as powder foundation and it’s great with either one. I will definitely be purchasing this one. I received a complimentary deluxe sample of this product to test and review. A Treat for your Skin
