I always struggle finding a good moisturizer cream that hydrates my skin without leaving it greasy because one of my biggest problems is that I break out easily since my skin is oily, a while ago I was gifted with this confidence in a cream bottle to review and even thought I wasnâ€™t sure of trying the cream because of the problem with my skin I gave it a try and my surprise was that I end up love it! Not only leaves my skin hydrated, soft and glowing but also fights 10 signs of aging like texture, elasticity, lines, firmness, neck lines plumpness and more! and is clean & vegan. I have used it for the past 3 weeks and my skin feels so good and looks healthy and brighter! Confidence in a cream is a thicker cream so a little goes a long way and it absorbs really easy. I really recommend Confidence in a cream because is a complete cream for mature skin like mine! nan
