Thanks to Influenster and Estée Lauder for the sample product to try in exchange for my honest review.  I have dry skin.  Using this my skin felt hydrated and soft but it’s from the large amount of dimethicone (2nd ingredient).  It also has a lot of preservatives which aren’t on my usual list of skincare desires.   There’s lots of nice extracts in here though such as cactus and moringa as well as cucumber and watermelon.  The product is a lightweight gel-cream that sinks in quickly. Revitalizing Supreme + Youth Power Cream isn’t as heavily fragranced as most Estee products but it is fragranced with that same scent just lighter.  It was a small size so I can’t say I saw wrinkle improvement with only a 2 weeks use. My skin broke out from this hence the two stars. Nice extracts but..
