I was sent this product free to try out.  Let me tell you, I am so glad I did! I have been using the Dior serum for 5 days now and see a diffrence in my eyes already! One of my favorite things about this serum is the packaging the serum comes in!! The applicator the serum comes out of is so soothing and cooling to the skin.  It helps make sure that I’m getting the product all over the eye area and not anywhere I don’t want it! Also it helps make sure im not being too rough with my under eyes! The serum itself is thin and silky and melts right into your skin.  The serum has a beautiful clean smell to it but not too strong.  I can honestly say that I’ve seen a diffrence for sure in my eyes.  I have noticed in the morning my eyes are not as puffy as they normally would be.  The skin is also brighter with a slight glow to it.  Also the bags under my eyes have started to firm up! I can’t wait to continue to use this Dior Serum and see the magic happen! I most definitely will be reordering this!!! Another hit for Dior!! Worth it!!
