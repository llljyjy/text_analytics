I did receive this product free for review from Influenster and Ole Henriksen in exchange for my honest review. I really love this product, when it says brightening it really means it. I have dark circles and I look tired a lot and after applying my eyes do look less tired. It’s a thin formula, doesn’t feel greasy and you can wear it under your concealer and it won’t pill. It’s unscented, vegan and cruelty free which is very important to me. I definitely recommend trying this out. Try it
