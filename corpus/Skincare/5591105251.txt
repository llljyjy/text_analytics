I received this a complimentary product from influenster. The smell of this moisturizer is clean and you can tell it is of high quality. It is so creamy and a little goes a very long way. This is something you can definitely feel on the skin after applying just because it is so rich. My skin feels so moisturized even when I go a day without using it my skin doesn’t feel as dry as it did before. Now same thing as the glow drops, the price point is out of this world. I love that it is all natural, cruelty free but there’s a lot of options that do the same for half the cost. So creamy
