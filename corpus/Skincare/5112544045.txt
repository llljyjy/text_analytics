I have dry skin and this works great to keep my skin hydrated without the oily feeling. Since I received the product during Spring and Summer, the weather is not as dry as winter and I can’t comment on how this product would work during the harsh Canadian winters. It absorbs in your skin quickly and didn’t cause me any breakouts. nan
