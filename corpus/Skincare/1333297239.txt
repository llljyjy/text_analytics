Received a mini size as a gift. I was using Dermalogica at the time and just needed something new. due to my sensitive skin Iâ€™m scared to try anything new. But I decided why not!Thank the dewy skin gods that I did because I have never in my life had dewy skin until now. This cleanser feels amazing on your skin. It begins with a creamy lather, mild exfoliation. I use it with my pro PMD and it lathers perfectly. I loved it so much I went off and purchased the big daddy size. nan
