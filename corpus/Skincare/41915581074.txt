After using this serum for over a week, I have been loving the results. I have used many serums in the past but none can compare, I love the results. I use it morning and night, and my skin absorbes it really good I love the texture of it, itâ€™s as if I was using water, but the results are visibly showing slowly but surely. My acne dark spots have been fading away and my face has a good glow that even my husband noticed. I feel it has even helped me with my oily skin. Best serum ever
