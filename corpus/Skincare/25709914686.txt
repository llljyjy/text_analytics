First off, the packaging is gorgeous and the fact this is refillable is another bonus! This magic eye cream, is very moisturizing and thick and it goes on very nicely. A little bit goes a long way. I put it on in the morning after my serums and before my sunscreen. It instantly refreshes the eye area and gives a glowing dewy look, which I donâ€™t mind. I would buy again. I received this product for free from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review. nan
