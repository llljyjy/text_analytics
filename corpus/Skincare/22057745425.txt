I received this from Influenster to try and by golly gee… it’s amazing to use to give my face a more freshener and renewed look. I can’t justify the price though… but whatever magic is in that bottle, it works. It’s not super sticky and applies really smoothly. My skin also looks more alive after applying it. I would definitely recommend! Magic in a bottle
