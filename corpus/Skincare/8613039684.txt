I was expecting this to have a nice scent since the packaging is so chic but it’s completely scentless! Which I actually don’t min since I have very sensitive skin. I’ve used this 3 nights so far and my skin looks so much more awake in the morning and hydrated. I would definitely recommend to anyone who has sensitive skin and is looking for a nightly serum!! No scent but great product!
