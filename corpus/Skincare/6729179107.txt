I received my #freeproduct sample of Clinique’s Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum though #topboxcircle. While the sample was small, I just loved how this made my skin look and feel after the first use, leaving almost a dewy effect and feel without shine.  Highly recommended! I haven’t used Clinique products since I was a young adult, but I would definitely add this line back to my regime. A dewy serum!
