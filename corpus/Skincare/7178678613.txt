I used to really like this sunscreen but my most recent purchase of it was disappointing. Like others said, it has a whipped consistency which I donâ€™t mind, but it does leave a white cast even on my light-medium skin. The sunscreen adds a nice oily sheen to my dry skin right after I put it on, but overtime it dries out my face and causes redness and itchiness. I think this might be best suited for ppl with super pale and oily skin. Not great for dry skin
