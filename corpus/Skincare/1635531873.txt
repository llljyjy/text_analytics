I love this Willow and Sweet Agave Plumping Lip mask rom Alpyn Beauty. The scent is wonderful. I adore how hydrated my lips feel from the agave. And the hydration lasts! I honestly donâ€™t feel much plumping, though.  I wish it was in a tube rather than a pot. Overall a lovely lip product from a great brand. hydrating!
