I did not notice a difference at all after using this serum. My skin did not look smoother, firmer, or more radiant.  My skin looked exactly the same. I also did not like the scent. It was too strong for me. At first the serum felt nice on my skin, but after about an hour, my skin felt greasy and oily. This would definitely work better on normal skin. I definitely wonâ€™t be using this again. Not For Me
