Highly recommend for anyone with dry under eyes. This is the strongest moisturizer Iâ€™ve ever tried in an eye cream. It lasts all day. My under eyes look plump and nourished. It works like the way lip balm works on lips.. put it on and it instantly hydrates. It absorbs into skin. Has a satin feel. Not greasy at all. Overall I really like it. Very moisturizing!
