I received the Clinique moisture surge to try and I was pleasantly surprised with this moisturizer! I have combination skin so moisturizers can be tricky. This product is light and leaves my skin feeling fresh! It absorbs and hydrates the skin quickly leaving no trace behind! I will likely buy this product to see what kind of longer term effects it has on my skin. Skin feels fresh and hydrated!
