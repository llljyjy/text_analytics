I love the feeling of my skin after I have exfoliated and have traditionally used products with a bit more grain/grit than this so I was really surprised that something this gentle could produce the same results. The ingredients also really calm my skin making it easy to use everyday. I also appreciate that the packaging is made from 50% recycled plastic. #giftedbydermalogica @sephoracanada @dermalogicacanada Daily Milkfoliant - definitely worth trying
