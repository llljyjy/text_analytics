I love this retinol face stick! It is so easy to use and it feels so smooth and moisturizing. It does not irritate my skin like regular retinol making it peel or Red. I have been using it for a few weeks and I am noticing it softening my fine lines already. It has a nice blurring affect. I ordered another one because I don’t want to run out of this amazing stick and I walk around with it nonstop so I can’t live without it! I highly recommend this awesome product as I see results already and it is easy to use and inexpensive to boot! Can’t beat that! nan
