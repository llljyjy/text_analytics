This product has a nice medium thickness and a very light scent if anything at all. I’m 53 and used this product for over a month. It did moisturize my eye area but I didn’t notice any long term use benefits. I still had dark circles and puffiness which are my main concerns. So I do not recommend this for older skin concerns. Just a very low average product. I received this full sized product from Influenster for my honest opinion. Meh
