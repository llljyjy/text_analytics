This cleanser is a gentle yet offered a nice exfoliating aspect without being too abrasive on my skin. I’m not in love with the smell but it’s not super overwhelming that it bothers me. I really enjoy the packaging and the opening of the bottle I find it is easier to get a desired amount out without being wasteful. Overall I would recommend this cleanser I enjoy using it 2 to 3 times a week and I’ve noticed a slight change in my skin. I have a glowy aspect to my face now nan
