Good product. This is supposed to be used as part of a TWO step cleansing. Do not use this as its own cleanser you will most likely have a residue leftover and could get break outs. Use this first, emulsify, rinse and go in with your usual cleanser. Cleansing balms are meant to remove makeup, sunscreen and dirt without needing makeup wipes. Your skin will feel so clean! And this is formulated without micro-plastics! One of the reasons I purchased! Good! 2 part cleansing
