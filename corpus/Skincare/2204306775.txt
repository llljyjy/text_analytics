My absolute favorite moisturizer. I don’t understand the negative reviews, this stuff is great. I only use in the winter months and it really helps combat flakiness from retinol. I also only use at night- I think it’s far too thick to use under makeup. My skin feels plump and dewy every time. absolute favorite
