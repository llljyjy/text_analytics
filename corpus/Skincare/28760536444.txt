I’ve suffered from dark circles and bags under my eyes for as long as I can remember. I’ve tried everything and spent countless money on products. Even going as far as La Mer and considering a minor surgery to fix the problem. This stuff isn’t cheap, but I find keeping in the fridge, pushing on the metal applicator to get one pump that I use on both eyes. The coolness of the applicator, the ingredients in the product, and the visible improvements have made me fall in love to the point of already buying my second tube. Within 10 days, I noticed less dark bags, more firmness and the skin under my eyes felt noticeably stronger. Before trying out eye products like La Mer, or even considering a surgery, give this a shot first to see how you like it. I’m now a believer in Tula products and plan on buying this product as long as I have to to keep my eyes looking awake and healthy. Men, don’t fear these products, Sephora is truly an incredible company that’ll make you appearance and life better. ONLY THING THAT WORKS
