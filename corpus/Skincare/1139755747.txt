I really like how smooth and moisturizing this feels on my face. It is a little thick, but not too thick. It smells great and goes on transparent so you can’t tell you’re wearing a mask. I usually rinse it off after the recommended 10 minutes. My only complaint is that it contains two alcohols and I noticed my skin felt drier after using it. So I knocked off one star for that. I like that it is cruelty free and contains clean ingredients. Feels great
