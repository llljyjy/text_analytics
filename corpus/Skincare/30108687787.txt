I have received Caudalie Paris Vinoperfect Radiance Serum and Brightening Cream from #trywithtopbox in exchange for my honest review.  I have been using the serum every morning and night for a week now.  When I apply at night I add the the brightening cream over the serum.  The serum has a lightweight consistency and absorbed nicely into my skin this also has a very pleasant fragrance that it is not overpowering at all.   The brightening cream is thicker it goes on nicely and absorbs leaving my skin smooth and hydrated it doesnâ€™t leave my skin feeling sticky or greasy.  I feel after using these for a week my dark spots are less visible and my skin is brighter looking so much healthier. I am very excited to see the results after a few weeks.  I will definitely be purchasing these.  I love the fact the packaging ismanufactured with 50% recycled paper that is 100% recyclable and in 50%recycled plastic that is 100% recyclable.  I would definitely recommend these products. Love this product
