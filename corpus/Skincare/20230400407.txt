I literally just received this product and so far it seems worth the hype! I love the smell, it’s definitely like a cherry/strawberry candy scent which I surprisingly don’t mind. It’s not super pigmented which is also fine because Rihanna advertised that it’s not supposed to tint your lips very much at all. It feels very silky and moisturizing on the lips, and I love how even it looks. The applicator is also worth mentioning, I didn’t need a second pump and it’s very soft and squishy and wide. We’ll see if it actually moisturizes long term but so far, I am impressed. nan
