I was so confused on how to use this as it says mask but can be used as a moisturiser so why call it a mask? Anyways I have seen so many people raving about this one, so I did my research on the ingredients and found it good to use. I got mine from sephora promotional offers and was so glad to finally use it. Its thick but spreads nicely. I have a dry skin so I use a little and mix it with a light moisturiser so to avoid feeling oily in the morning and at night I use it as a night cream and then apply oil. On days I dont want to use it, i just apply a little under my eyes. the absolute best
