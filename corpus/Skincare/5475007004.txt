I was not very wowed by this essence. You didn’t make my skin feel any better nor any different than any different than anything that I have used in the past. When I’m looking for an essence or a toner I want something hydrating and plumping and I didn’t feel that this gave me that. I gave it 3 out of 5 stars because it did feel a little hydrating. Nothing to be wowed about
