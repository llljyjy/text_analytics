I really enjoyed this cleanser. I’m typically not a fan of bars and prefer more liquid cleansers but this lather and the feel were very nice. It didn’t leave behind any residue or dirt and my skin felt very refreshed and new. I do wish the packaging came with something to store the bar. Refreshing cleanser
