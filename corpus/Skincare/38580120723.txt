My skin hates the change of seasons, especially when it turns cold. During the winter my face and neck are usually dry and tight no matter the moisturizer I use. That is until I tried the IT Secret Sauce. The second it melted into my skin I felt wonderful. The fine lines that stand out in the winter were less noticeable. This moisturizer really does melt into your skin. There is no greasy feel, just smooth happy skin. Exceptional hydration
