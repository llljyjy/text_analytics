I received a sample size of this and have been using it at night for a couple of weeks now. I have very oily, acne-prone sensitive skin and new products often make me break out but this has not and Iâ€™d say it even helped calm the active breakouts that I had when I started using it. It helps keep my skin hydrated which is great since I also use acne-fighting products that can leave me feeling dry. I love this serum and will purchase it when the sample runs out! Love it
