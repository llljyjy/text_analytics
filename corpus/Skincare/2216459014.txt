II think this is my 3rd purchase. This is my go to moisturizer. It provides real moisture without being greasy or irritating my skin. I can layer it under sunscreen or makeup. I would highly recommend if you have dry skin.  My only complaint is that because of the design of the jar, you don’t know when you are running out. I believe it is designed to keep the cream clean/germ free. So you have to pump it.  So you can’t plan to buy it when you are getting low.  There is also ALOT of packaging.  My guess its meant so that you can refill jar.  However, as of last month Sephora was not selling the refills although I noticed a new gift pack that contains a refill.  Aside from the packaging the product is great! My go to moisurizer
