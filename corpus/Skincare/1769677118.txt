Even though I received Kiehl’s Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Correcting Serum #FreetoReview all opinions expressed are truly from my own personal experience with using the product.Kiehl’s Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Correcting Serum was a God Send product for my spotty, sun damaged, post acne mark skin. It applied so easily and absorbed quickly into my skin. My skin didn’t experience any redness, tightness or discomfort. The dropper bottle packaging was super nice. With each daily use I noticed a clearer improvement in my skin. I LOVE this product and totally recommend it to everyone wanting a clearer, more radiant skintone. Clearly One of THE BEST!
