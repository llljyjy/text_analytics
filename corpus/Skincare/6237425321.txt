I am loving this Dr. Zenovia moisturizer!  Moisturizers are tricky, as my skin is aging, and combination, so often attempts to overcome dryness result in extra oiliness all around, which is frustrating. Not so with Dr. Zenovia. The product is creamy, rich, absorbs quickly, and is not greasy. Makes my skin feel better than it has in a long time. Plus, it smells good, and comes in a very luxurious heavy glass jar that I love. Definitely a win! Perfect for me
