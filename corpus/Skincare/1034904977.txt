The texture is nice and it spreads easily; but this turned into 10 shades too dark (like that of the dark self-tan) on my face! Super disappointed in that. I tried another patch on my arm and it went even darker. Not sure how this works, but don’t even bother picking this up if you’re at all fair/light skinned. (I wear nc25 for reference) Super Dark
