I have used a number of products over the years that were supposed to have retinol in them and frankly never really noticed a difference. Partly my fault, because I chose lower strength options based on all the warnings about how you need to be careful when you start using retinol. I stretched that out to 10 years of being careful so was pretty underwhelmed with retinol. But all the dermatologists include this in their must use list so I knew I needed to end up with something. This retinol serum is the first one where I can actually see benefits -- blackheads disappearing, hyperpigmentation lessening, wrinkles diminished. I am sold on this as my pick for a retinol.  The price is great, and thatâ€™s important if you are going to keep a routine going long term.  I experienced no real issues using it, however I noted some tightness and drying at first if I used it alone, so started layering it under a favorite skin oil and had no more problems. Recommend it for those who are ready to see a difference from retinol. My pick for a retinol product
