The texture of this moisturizer is super thin! Like, if you tip the jar, it will spill out. Just be careful when peeling off the safety seal. It has a pleasant green color from the algae, and it smells nice and fresh. The main ingredient is aloe vera, so it absorbs nicely and doesn’t pill. It’s a very lightweight moisturizer and it makes mt skin feel hydrated and firmer. I think this is going to be my favorite summertime moisturizer. Great summer moisturizer
