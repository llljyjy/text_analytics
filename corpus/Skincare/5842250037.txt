I couldn’t love this more. I usually use a drugstore one but can’t seem to find it anymore so I went ahead and grabbed this one. I mix a little tinted moisturizer with it and tap on some concealer for the day and my skin looks so incredibly healthy and glowy all day. (I spritz sunscreen on throughout the day and touch up concealer and it layers perfect) It has a little bit of the sunscreen smell but it definitely wears off almost immediately. I saw some reviews about it being “tricky” to apply  and that just wasn’t how it was for me. It applied and wears under my makeup just like most moisturizers. I would say grab it! You won’t regret have healthy plumped skin all summer! IG @ missericalynn68 Perfect plumped and glowy skin all summer!
