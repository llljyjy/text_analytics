I love 90% of Glow Recipe’s products but I kept seeing the reviews saying it wasn’t worth the price and didn’t do anything or the reviews saying it broke people out. I’ve been combatting super dry winter skin for the last month and I wish I would have purchased this sooner. I’ve honestly tried 2 different cleansers and 3 different moisturizers and figured I would give this a shot. I’m only upset I wasted so much time before purchasing because I saw results by the end of the week. Don’t Wait
