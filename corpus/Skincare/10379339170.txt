I was sent this product free for review. It arrived when I was in between travel throughout the past month. I found that this easily hydrated my skin after plane rides. I would describe the treatment as having reset my skin each time I was away from home and thus my normal skincare routine. My skin felt supple and hydrated, but not oily. It sunk in within a minute. The product is described as a treatment lotion, but it is a runny liquid. I found it applied best either patted into the skin with my hands or using a bamboo round, similar to how one applies toner. The treatment had an herbal scent that may be overwhelming to those sensitive to scent, though it did dissipate over a half hour or so. Resets the skin
