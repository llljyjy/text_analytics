The packaging is a little confusing, but once they’re on these eye masks feel great! They don’t slip and are very hydrating and help with puffiness. Their biggest CON is that they are so expensive for one use only. I wish there had been multiple masks for $10/each, but they really do work, so I will use them again for special occasions.*I was sent this product in exchange for a review* Expensive, but work really well!
