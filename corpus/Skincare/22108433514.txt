I have been using this moisturizer for a few weeks now. I can honestly say I’m not a fan of the smell however it’s ability to moisturize as well as it does I cannot complain. It’s not an overwhelming smell as just not what I’m used to. haven’t had the chance to use other products from this line yet. but I do plan on ordering them in the future. AMAZING PRODUCT 😍 Recommend if you have Sensitive Skin, it was a godsend for my skin. I have combination skin and I’m also currently using retinol. Definitely Worth It!
