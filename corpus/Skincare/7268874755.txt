Got this product as a sample from one of sephora’s favourite sets. Didn’t think much of it, but it turned out to be the best thing ever. Been battling acne for around 2 years, and no cleanser i’ve tried has worked for my face. After the first week of trying this, I noticed a huge reduction in my acne. It’s been around a month now and my face is the best it’s ever been since. Maybe a little drying, but i’ll take that over my acne anyday. A lot of people have complained about the smell but I haven’t noticed it. nan
