This is my new favorite product. I saw the videos and reviews on the product so I thought I would give it a try and I am so glad I did. My skin has NEVER felt so clean.  It truly is like a vortex vacuum for your face. After one use, my skin felt tighter after one use. I was so surprised at what the tool pulled out of my skin. The discharge chamber was full of pores and other dirt pulled from my skin. I follow a weekly skincare routine and wasnâ€™t sure how much this tool would help but I was shocked. I now use this two times a week. Game changer!!!
