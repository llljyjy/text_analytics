This honestly works and I use it once or twice a week. I am of SE Asian descent and I get darker in the summer time or when exposed to sun for a long period of time. I have oily af skin and am acne prone. I am prone to picking my skin and Faded as honestly help my dark spots lighten up. They’re still noticeable if I look in a magnifying mirror, but with light tinted serums it’s like it’s not even there. It does a take a while to work, but it honestly works. I don’t use a moisturizer afterward because it’s also moisturizing weirdly, but I like it. The smell of the product isn’t that bad- I can tolerate it. I definitely would recommend this for skin pickers who are trying to stop and get their skin back! it works & the smell isn’t that bad!
