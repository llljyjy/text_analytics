Personally, this worked really well for me. It got off all my makeup when I wiped a towel on my face after washing it. Yes, it does NOT come off with only water since it’s a balm/oil so you need to wipe it off with a towel or napkin in order to get the product off, as you do with any other cleansing balm. I only use this to take off makeup and I use a facial cleanser afterwards as a double cleanse. It’s the same as any other makeup removing balm so nothing too special but it’s good. really nice product
