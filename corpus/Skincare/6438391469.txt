Oh I have a lot to say about this amazing cream! First I have to say, I love the smell of it!! I have combination skin so most moisturizers make my face either look or feel greasy after applying it. This did not, infact my face was smooth and soft all day long!!I wanted to try this for a good two weeks before I reviewed it and boy am I glad I did. I have skin that looks younger than me and I want to keep it that way so when I saw the first sign of wrinkles, I cried. This actually did start to reverse that so Iâ€™m buying more! I would and have recommended this to friends and family. TIP: I love using a small bit on the back of my hands. ADD THIS TO YOUR FACIAL ROUTINE NOW!!
