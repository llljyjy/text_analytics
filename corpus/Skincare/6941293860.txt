I wish it didn’t work so well because I can’t afford to buy this regularly. Lol. At first I was very skeptical. The cream is definitely on the thick side and the application process takes some getting used to. I did not see results during the first two weeks but after that, it’s a game-changer. My 5 ML sample lasted me a little more than a month - a little goes a long way! My skin feels smooth and slowly, I and other people have noticed my dark spots fade away. Just the past two weeks, two different have commented on how good my skin looked and couldn’t believe that I wasn’t wearing any makeup. However, it is overpriced in my opinion and consistency is key. So if you don’t have the budget for this, you won’t really see lasting results. I just bought the $100 mini jar after my sample ran out which should last me 3 months at least. That’s the good news - you don’t need to use a lot of product. TL:DR - It works when used consistently. Overpriced but a little goes a long way. Worth it if money is not an issue. nan
