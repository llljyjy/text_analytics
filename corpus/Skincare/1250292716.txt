Love it! This will definitely be part of my new night facial routine! The consistency is very rich and creamy, hence the cloud name. I was surprised by the blue color, but loved it. Has a very slight lavender scent thatâ€™s not over bearing. The cream felt soo smooth when i applied it to my skin and was very hydrating to my dry skin. It also had a very slight pleasant tingle. nan
