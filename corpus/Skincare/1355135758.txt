This vitamin C arrived just on time because my skin was feeling a little bit dry and dehydrated!I’ve had great results in the past with this type of vit c (THD Ascorbate) and I love this oil form because it gives me the much needed hydration and leaves my skin plump and looks like it’s back to life :)A little bit goes a long way and it gives me a nice glow, the dark spots are slowly fading away and I love the anti-inflammatory properties of turmeric. I can use it in the morning, it doesn’t feel greasy but I wait a few minutes to let it absorb and then I can continue with my routine - applying my sunscreen and makeup on top. I have combo skin and hopefully it will work during the summer months as well.This is a great oil! Even though it has an orange scent I haven’t had any irritation, I just wish it wasn’t so overpowering it came in dark/opaque bottle! nan
