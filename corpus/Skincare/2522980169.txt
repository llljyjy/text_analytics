I started using Great Skin this week, and I can already say it’ll be a staple in my skincare routine. I’ve tried so many products for my sensitive, acne prone skin, but this product provides instant results. My redness and pores look so much less inflamed, and my dry patches that won’t seem to quit were GONE in one use (especially mind blowing since I’m still acclimating to adding retinol to my routine). I’m not one to ever over inflate a product, but the last time my skin felt this good was post-facial. My skin is glowing and my acne scars look way less prevalent because of how plumping this is!! It’s instantly hydrating without making you feel oily, which seemed impossible for my combination skin. I’m so blown away that one product can make this much of a difference! The timing of this launch is impeccable with the dry, cold weather coming, but it’ll be something I’ll reach for all year round. Merit really knocked it out of the park with this one! Great Skin is a GAME CHANGER
