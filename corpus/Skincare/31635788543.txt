I have tried a couple of the ordinary serums just because of the price, they dont wow me enough in terms of formula. I have acne prone skin and all the products i have tried including this one have broke me out within a day or 2. I also didnt see any anti aging change. This serum is not tacky like the others so thats a positive. I wont be buying TO again This brand is not for me
