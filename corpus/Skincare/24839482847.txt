I am conflicted by this product, overall I didnâ€™t find it to be a moisturizing moisturizer but there were pros. Pros: smooth, non-greasy, smells pleasant, and easy to apply. Cons: it REALLY dried out my skin, I tried using it twice a day for a week so I have it a fair shot. My forehead has never been so dry. It may work for others, just not a moisturizer I would use on a daily basis. Not for me
