Recently have to move to a dry and hot city and that really messed up with my skin. I found Kiehlâ€™s Midnight Recovery Omega-Rich Cloud Cream and happily hopped on! It feels so light on my skin but then you can feel it locks in moisture because I know the cream was there even in the morning when I wash face again. My skin tone is more even now and the dullness reduced. Highly recommend for sensitive/dry skin! Midnight  Recovery Omega-Rich Cloud Cream Magic!
