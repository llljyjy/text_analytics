I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. A little goes a LONG way with this eye cream, which I love! It feels super hydrating, but absorbs quickly! I also love the applicator and that I can close it easily so that it doesnâ€™t accidentally get squirted out! So hydrating and not sticky
