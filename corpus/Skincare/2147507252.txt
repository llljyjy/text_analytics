I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I used it for about 1.5 weeks night and day and did notice a change. I naturally have puffy eyes so I didn’t expect miracles, but I did see a difference. I love the applicator because the cooling aspect reduces swelling. It does get stuck a bit, so you have to massage and spread the product well if you don’t want to use too much. But a little goes a long way. New step in night routine
