i’ve been using the lip sleeping masks for forever and i wanted a similar formula that i could wear during the day! this is probably the best lip balm i’ve ever used. i love the smell it’s so good but it’s not over powering. it looks really nice and moisturized but not super glossy, which i personally like. it doesn’t dry down weird and it’s not sticky either. bonus the packaging is super cute! now moving on i will say it was a splurge. i avoided buying this product for so long because of the price point. i only bought it bc i had some extra $$ and had my eyes on it for a while. at the end of the day though it is still only a lip balm. i recommend this only if the price point of 18$ is comfortable for you. if this is a product that would be a splurge item you could get a similar product for way cheaper. my recs are carmex, jack black and mario debascu if you want something that’ll have the same effect at a cheaper price point. the only thing that’s different are the smells n packaging imo. tldr: rlly nice and you’ll enjoy it if you like the lip sleeping masks but you could save money on cheaper products that’ll perform the same. AMAZING but pricey
