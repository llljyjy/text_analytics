Paula’s Choice never disappoints. This is the second product I’ve tried from them and I am obsessed! I love this eye cream because it provides the right amount of hydration. I love using it under my makeup because it leaves my under eyes hydrated so my makeup doesn’t crease. I love this! Paula's Choice never disappoints.
