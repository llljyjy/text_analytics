I’m a 63 year old male that works outside, my hands and arms take a beating in under the Mississippi sun.  The back of my hands daily look like lizard skin, arms to a lessor extent wearing long sleeve shirts with a high SPF rating.  Yesterday I didn’t have time to apply the cream and the tops of my hands look great.  The tube of Jurgens has hit the trash.The product might be for everyone, but I’m sold and will continue to use it. Great for old skin working outside.
