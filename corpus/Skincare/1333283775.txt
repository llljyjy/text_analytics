I’m on my second bottle of this……… I swear it helps help with hyperpigmentation. Three months prior to me trying this I’d stopped getting chemical peels. And hope that this product would continue to reduce my hyperpigmentation. And guess what…… IT DID!!! It’s gentle and the texture of this is even more impressive. You will start to notice the difference around week number 4 so be patient and wear sunblock!!! Buy Me!
