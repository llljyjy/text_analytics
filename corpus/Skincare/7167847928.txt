It is an okay product. I have oily/combination skin. My skin was fine no burning sensation at all while using it. I used this product a couple times and didnâ€™t notice a huge difference. My skin seemed slightly brighter and more glowy. I definitely will continue using this product and see if I have better results with longer usage. Id definitely recommend this product to people with dull skin. nan
