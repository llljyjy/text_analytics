Love this product!  Mount Lai calming herbal repair facial massage balm went on so smoothly, my face felt as though it was receiving a spa treatment. The product went on evenly and had a faint, pleasant smell. My skin felt extremely soft the next morning when I woke up. I used it every night and did not notice any repair to find lines or wrinkles, but it did make my skin softer which was a positive thing. I would recommend this going forward, I did not receive a spoon with the product. I was surprised to know how little I needed to use on my face after each use. When I received the sample in the mail, I thought to myself this would give me about two nights of use.  I still cannot even tell that Iâ€™ve used any of it. I would recommend! Best balm ever
