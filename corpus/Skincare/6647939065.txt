I got a sample of this on my last trip to Sephora. It was enough for me to use 4/5 times. I would say this is very gentle and would probably work well for people looking for that quality. I need something with a bit more oomph. I woke up each morning expecting to notice something…softer skin, improved texture, smoother appearance…but I didn’t see any noticeable difference. There are similar products out there (some at a lower price point) that do more for my skin. 2 stars for the cute packaging. nan
