This Peptide Moisturizer is SO soothing upon application, it is a relief to use after washing to restore the moisture barrier. The rosacea redness on my cheeks settles in no time with the anti-inflammatory properties of this light, fragrance free lotion. I have experienced no rebound redness. The instructions call for a pea sized amount for the face, which would provide an awfully sparse application. On clean skin the spreadability of the product is really good.  I use it on top of serums and other treatments; It does NOT cause pilling of my other products, but using it on top of them reduces the spreadability quite a bit, so I end up using more of the product. No big deal, but I hope they come out with a larger sized tube in the future. This lotion does NOT leave a greasy/shiny sheen, so it is a great choice to use under make-up or on makeup free days.  Iâ€™ve only used this product in the tube packaging.  I ike the wide mouthed tube, because when you get to the end, you can just snip off the seam and access the remaining product easily. Some products that come in pumps prevent you from accessing all of the product. I HIGHLY recommend this moustuizer! Phenomenal moisturizer that my rosacea cheeks love
