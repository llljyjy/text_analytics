I used this after make up as a setting spray and just loved the finish. I had been using other competitive brands before and I feel like the nozzle of the bottles hardly ever spray evenly and mostly. The Gucci one is light and sprays a must evenly and lightly. I love the glowy finish and didnâ€™t have to look like I got splashed in the face. Glowing finish, great spray nozzle and packaging
