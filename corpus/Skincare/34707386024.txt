I am so impressed with this product. The texture is smooth, it applies evenly, and doesn’t smell too much like hotdog water. My skin is very sensitive, and I suffer from Rosacea, to top it off. I can honestly say, no reaction to this product. Outstanding!  My skin felt clearer, with a more even tone than ever before. It’s the odour.  Honestly, not a huge fan.  Just kind of makes me feel like I’m boiling hotdogs all day… that’s why it’s not a Five. I would still recommend this to anyone though, especially those of you, share in the rosacea trend, with me. Fantastic Results - Hotdog Smell (Kind of)
