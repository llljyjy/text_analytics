I received this product from Influenster to test out and I must say that my under eye area is definitely more hydrated after 1 month of consistent use 2x a day. It’s a thicker formula then what I’m use to but it’s the perfect finishing touch to my skin care routine. It feels rich and luxurious. As for brightness, I thought at first that I couldn’t tell, but it hit me this week that I have not had to plaster on a ton of concealer in the mornings to hide my hereditary dark raccoon eyes like I used to so…I guess it’s working!! Give it a try!!!
