I have wanted to try this product for quite some time so I was very excited to receive it from Influenster! Right off the bat, this is HEAVILY fragranced. Very floral and I have sensitive skin so I did not have high hopes. Despite this fact, my skin was glowing immediately and it did feel extremely nourishing upon the skin. Did i enjoy it? Yes but I do not think this product is worth the money. There are plenty of other products out there at a much lower price point that can achieve the same results. I did want to note that my skin started to break out so I had to stop using this product but Iâ€™m 90% sure it was from the eye serum as it was only around the eye area. FRAGRANCED!
