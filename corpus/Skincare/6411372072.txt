As a skincare collector, this is one of my new favorites. The cream is not as rich as I would have hoped for my dry skin, but layering SkinFix or an oil over top at night supplements my craving for a rich finish. My skin has definitely improved in all the promised ways since starting this a couple weeks ago. Canâ€™t wait to see results after two months! lovely, could be heavier.
