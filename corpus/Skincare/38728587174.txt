I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CLEANSER! I have been looking for a new facial wash to replace my bar soap, and i’ve found it. It’s super gentle, gives a good lather, and smells really sweet! No harsh ingredients or little microbeads so your pores can breathe after. It’s a 10/10 for meeee! Run, don’t walk LET ME PUT YOU ON
