I received this product courtesy of Influenster and Biossance. Initially i loved the packaging it feels super lux. I have incorporated this in my skin care routine for the past few weeks and haven’t noticed a huge different bad or good. It feels really nice on my face but I can’t justify buying it at this price tag for meh results. I read other reviews and someone stated that the percentages of retinol aren’t given for this product so I wish we had more info. I like the packaging and the mission of the company but noticeable results wise it fell a bit flat. Just Okay
