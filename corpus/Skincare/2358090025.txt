This razor is just what I was hoping for! It works great and gets all that nasty peach fuzz. My face is smooth for makeup application. This unit also comes with refills. I just feel it is more sanitary (easier to clean) and will last longer than the plastic kind. One work of caution, however, if you shave your brows, this is a large, sharp blade and you will need to be extra careful or use a plastic shaver. GREAT FACE SHAVE FOR WOMEN!
