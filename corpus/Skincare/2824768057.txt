I really want to like Supergoop. This product went on smoothly and felt like velvet; it was immediately absorbed by my dry skin...except for when it didn’t and started pilling. I love that it’s matte. It doesn’t smell great, but it’s a chemical sunscreen, so what do we expect? Really the only issue was the occasional pilling, which happened no matter how long I waited between applying my moisturizer and this product. It was disappointing. Alright, I guess.
