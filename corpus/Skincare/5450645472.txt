Just finished up my second full bottle! This mask is a favorite of mine for many reasons. I like to relax when I put on a mask, not worry too much about a time limit and drying. This mask does not dry, goes on so smoothly, has a beautiful soft scent, and the color is so cute. The after affect is beautiful, as well. Radiant softer skin. And even noticed some pimples that were creeping up went away. This is a great mask if you love the luxury & donâ€™t mind a higher price tag! Well worth it. One of All-time favorite masks
