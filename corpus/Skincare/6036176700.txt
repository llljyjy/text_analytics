I received these pads from Influenster and was immediately excited because I’d been looking to add better retinol components to my skincare routine. I love the convenient application form and how it doesn’t feel drying or burn on my face! I definitely think there has been an improvement since I started using them, but the effect seems to be more likely because of the serum. Consistency was a little more difficult as well because the container is rather large and not great for travel. Overall though, in combination with the serum form, I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to try retinol products. I can sometimes be sensitive to new additions to my routine but as long as I moisturize and use sunscreen, I haven’t had any adverse effects! Very happy! Wipe Away Your Troubles
