I know everyone loves this product and I’m a huge SF fan and I want to enjoy this eye cream so bad…. However it’s just not for me. I’ve tried varying amounts and application methods but it just sits on top of my skin like a mask that should be washed off. I can’t wear concealer over it. It does not sink in.  It pills under my eyes.  I can see the tiny on my skin in a weird way.  I’m glad it works for other people as it’s a lovely texture. I’m just one of the few that it did not work for. Going back to my beloved belif eye cream. Wanted to like it
