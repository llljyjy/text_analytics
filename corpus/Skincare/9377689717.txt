I was surprised how much I loved this face wash! It lathers really well and has a light pleasant scent. I was afraid it was going to smell a lot more fragranced. The packaging was a nice squeeze tube and was a reasonable size. Would recommend! I received this complementary from Influenster for honest review. Totally loving this product!
