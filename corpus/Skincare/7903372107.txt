I have a dark spot that has bothered me for sometime, I don’t know that it was terribly noticeable to others but I could see it and it bugged me! I was offered the chance to try this serum and I jumped at it for that spot! Now of course it did not work overnight but after about 3 weeks I could start to see a difference and after about 8 weeks the difference was highly noticeable to me.The best thing was that the serum is gentle and doesn’t bother my skin. It works and it is easy!
