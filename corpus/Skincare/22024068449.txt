This is my first time using a serum. I have bad redness on my cheeks so I thought iâ€™d give it a try. Ive been using it for 10 weeks and here are my thoughts:Pros: Easy to apply, not sticky, feels nice on skin, helped calm skin. Cons: Havent seen major changes Overall, I will rebuy and continue to use since I know it has great ingredients for my skin. Hasnt been lifechanging for my redness. Makes my happy happy
