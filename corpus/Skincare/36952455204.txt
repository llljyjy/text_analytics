I’m not new to Dr. Jart sincere products so I wanted to try out the sample size jar. (I’m so glad I did).This might be the most ideal primer. And if you really think about it. It is so smart! Because the product is entirely green. And when it sets on your face, you just get a very pretty fair and clean skin tone. The consistency can’t be better. It is runny and dries so cleanly/matte. There is no caking. Just fresh and fluid. Very lightweight but offers smooth coverage.I like that there is no scent. It’s just a miracle product in it’s bare-ness but gives you such a natural look.And on top of it all, provides SPF 30. Bought the mini but this will be a staple! SMART
