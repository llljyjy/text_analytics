I got this as a sample and had high hopes yet it’s just designed for my 40-year-old drier skin. It also left my face feeling like a tacky facial or eye shadow primer. Sadly this product wasn’t for me.  Other notes about this product: it felt like a glaze putting on and washing off (no matter if I applied a little or a lot). This product had no bright smell to it which was nice. It's not for me.
