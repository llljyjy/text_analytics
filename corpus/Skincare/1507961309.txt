I have very very very sensitive skin. I suffer from rosacea and even a whiff of something my skin doesn’t like will turn into a full on perioral dermatitis meltdown. This cleanser is so gentle and so lovely. I purchased the largest size because I love it so much and I never want to be without it. Before this I was using a really gentle flaming face wash from my derm but I like this even more. My face is clean without feeling tight after I use this and the scent is lovely without being harsh or irritating. I don’t buy very much skincare at all outside of my dermatologist’s office because so much of it has heavy fragrance or irritating sulfates and I just don’t trust most brands anymore but this is 10000% worth it. Highly recommend!! gentle enough for my very sensitive skin
