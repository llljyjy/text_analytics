I really liked the feel and consistency for dry skin. I don’t know if this would be hydrating enough on its own, without a serum. I have dry to very dry skin. It didn’t irritate my face nor did it have any discernible fragrance. I would consider repurchasing it after I run out. I will say that there are comparable options at a lower price point. Good for dry skin
