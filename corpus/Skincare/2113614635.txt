I was pleasantly surprised by this product; to start off I’m an eye serum/eye cream addict and have tried everything in-between the price points of $25-$300 and let me tell you this product right here is extremely luxurious without the heavy cream feel or insane scent that many companies enjoy putting in their products; not enjoyable for us sensitive ladies. With my experience I noticed the texture is more of a souffle soft and airy; it absorbed beautifully with the tapping motions I always use. I saw immediate brightening and a slight lifting affect, and subtle de-puffing. Overall I am very happy with my purchase and will continue to update if I see more of a drastic change as I use it; so far it’s a very delicate and luxurious product for the eyes; gentle and soothing.
