This cleanser/ makeup remover would be fantastic in the winter months. It is creamy, non drying and turns into an oil when water is applied. I find that it is clogging my pores during this hot and humid time of year. While i don’t dislike it, I am not loving it for me, right now. I feel that it does not  get rid of the “dirt“ from my face. Better for winter months.
