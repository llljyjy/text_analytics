I’m in my early 40s and when the weather gets cold I get what I call my “winter skin” where I can’t seem to keep hydrated, my skin feels dry, flaky, and tight, and no matter how much I moisturize it doesn’t seem to help for very long. The Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Cream has made my winter skin feel normal and soft. I noticed a difference in the wrinkles under my eyes after the first use and it’s hardly noticeable at all now that I’ve been using it for a couple weeks! The lines and dry skin around my nose and mouth is also not even noticeable any more and I feel years younger! So glad I have this a try! No scent that I noticed. Creamy texture without being greasy. Amazingly Hydrating with Quick Results!
