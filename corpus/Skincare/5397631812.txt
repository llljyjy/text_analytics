I love the quick results of this serum. I noticed how the dull areas of my skin transformed overnight to a more glowy, pore-free appearance with a brighter tone. And after a  weekâ€™s use I noticed the texture of my skin was more smoother with even tone and improved clarity of my blemishes. I was pleased that even though it has lactic acid it did not irritate my sensitive skin, and is said that over time skin will be more supple with the boosted collagen of the lactic acid. Glowy skin and less pores with quick results
