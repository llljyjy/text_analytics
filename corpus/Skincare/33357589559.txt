I received this product for free in exchange for a review. The packaging was really unique and fun to use. The product itself contains both niacinamide and vitamin c, which are great ingredients for brightening and fading spots. The formula goes on easily and doesnâ€™t feel sticky or makes me oily, and I feel like some of my spots are really starting to fade! Vit C and Niacinamide in one!
