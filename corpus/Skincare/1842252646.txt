I’ve been using this product daily for a month now. I absolutely love this one and I’ll continue to incorporate it into my skin routine. I review a lot of products and this one it checks all the boxes: non greasy yet substantial formula, provides instant hydration and comes at a good price point. I’ve even noticed substantial diminishing of acne scars that I’ve been chipping away at for years. Worth the hype!
