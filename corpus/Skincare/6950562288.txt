I LOVE this stuff! I’m mid 20s and still have breakouts... I was trying to connect it to diet, make up, moisturizer, etc. Turns out it was my moisturizer!  I was using high quality and expensive moisturizers and even other products from The Ordinary. I bought this because it was super affordable and worth a shot.  I do not get breakouts anymore. This stuff has no bad scent, it’s thick enough to be super hydration but not greasy or oily in any way.  I usually get really try and flakey skin under my eyes and around my nose, but I did not get that at all this year!! Try it. Will use it forever
