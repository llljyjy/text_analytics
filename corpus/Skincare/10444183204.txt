Super shiny and not in a good way. Made me look so greasy. I don’t even have oily skin but it made me skin soooo oily that my eyeglasses won’t even stay on, it kept sliding because it was THAT greasy. Also ends up smearing my make up. Also stings the eye so much even after having it on for hours. a big NO
