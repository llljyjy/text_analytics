I used this product as recommended, AM and PM, before my regular skincare routine. I didnâ€™t have much expectations going in but I must say I was surprised. My main skin concern is dryness with fine lines. My skin feels softer and springier. I especially like how my makeup is creasing less. A definite win! Beautiful addition to routine
