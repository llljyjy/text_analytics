Thanks WASO and Influenster for letting me try this!I loved this serum a lot. It definitely made my skin dewy and glowy. It wasn’t too oily for my skin type. For Vitamin C, the smell was SO pleasant compared to others out there. (don’t forget your sunscreen!) This is a great addition to a morning skincare routine. Such a good serum
