I got this because I tried a sample of the original water bank moisturizer and was hoping they’d be similarly hydrating. This one doesn’t feel as thick as the original nor does it hydrate my skin as well. I put it on in the morning and evening and by the next morning and end of day I would have dry spots on my face again. This didn’t happen before they changed the formula. doesn’t hold up to the original
