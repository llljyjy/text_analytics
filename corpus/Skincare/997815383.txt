I wanted to love this cream, but unfortunately, my skin didn’t. I have sensitive skin and broke out in small, pin sized, pustules while using this face cream. I love the scent, which is a very subtle, clean scent. The product absorbs nicely when applied and feels really good and gives great moisture. I didn’t experience any burning or itching either, just the small pustules. I’m going to continue using this on my neck and chest, because I had no issues in these areas and truly love the feeling of this cream on my skin. Definitely try this cream if your skin isn’t super sensitive like mine and you will probably love it. nan
