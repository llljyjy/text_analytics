I received this for free from Influenster and have been using it consistently for the past few weeks. I have not noticed a change in my skin (perhaps I have not given it enough time?) All the senatorial aspects of this product are top notch. Wonderful light scent, absorbs quickly, layers well, feels amazing on the skin, and the bottle is gorgeous and expensive feeling. I am very happy with this product as a gift, however due to the lack of results I am unsure whether it is worth the premium price. Love the product, not worth the $
