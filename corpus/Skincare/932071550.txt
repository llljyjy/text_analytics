I love the the way this moisturizer feels on my skin. It goes on as a cream, but then turns into a gel that completely drenches your skin and feels like water soaking your skin in the most refreshing way.  it gives you an amazing glow, and your skin feels immediately quenched.  The hydration doesnâ€™t last as long as I would like it to, but I still love it, and have been using it every day. It works wonderfully prior to makeup. Glowy & Hydrated
