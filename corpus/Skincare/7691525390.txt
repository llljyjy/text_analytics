Received a trial size of this product along with the oil-free gel moisturizer and let me tell you, itâ€™s a game changer. I applied a small amount of the serum first and my skin felt nice and soft, I used my gua sha with ease. After that, I put on the moisturizer which was perfect. It was creamy but not too thick. As someone who likes thicker moisturizers this was a game changer as it felt light, not oily. Overall I may buy the bigger size eventually! Nice Moisturizing Product
