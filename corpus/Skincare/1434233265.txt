I’ve used this product for years and the most recent jar used has been a terror on my skin. Looking at other recent reviews I’m not alone, this moisturizer caused several dry spots on my face. FYI people- the Dr Jart tiger grass helps repair that quickly.. sad day, but never repurchasing this product again. Formula Change?
