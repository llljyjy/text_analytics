It’s true that the band isn’t adjustable and that it would be an improvement- however, this is the best eye sleep mask I have ever used. I just purchased my second lovely lashes contour mask today after my husband tried it and said how much better it blocks light than his previous Bucky padded masks. The magic is the extra deep room for your eyes and presumably extensions though I don’t have those. Plus, the silk is cool and soft. It comes in a sturdy storage box. I cut off the huge tags seem to the elastic band giving the washing instructions etc. I love this mask and look forward to wearing it, it’s so comfortable. Just a note of comparison, I did NOT like the basic Slip eye mask and ordered it by mistake - the flat shape actually put pressure against my eyeballs. Not comfortable. most comfortable shape, great light blocking
