I received this as a complimentary product in exchange for my honest opinion.I am religious about SPF and wear a moisturizer or primer with it every day. I started using this instead of my daily Murad Invisiblur.Let me start out by saying that if you do not like fragrance— this product is not for you. But I found the scent to be refreshing. It has a thick feel out of the jar and a little goes a long way. As thick as it felt coming out of the jar, I was concerned it would feel heavy on the skin or leave me greasy— but I was wrong. It had a lightweight beautiful feel and my liquid makeup looked flawless over it (see screenshot).Day 1 I noticed my skin was softer and that there were less flakies in my makeup (usually around my nose). I did touch my face more often to dee my softness in joy.The only reason I can’t give this a 5 star review is because as a 37 year old, I’m committed to sunscreen and I prefer a SPF30. For this reason, I would use this only in the winter when I tend to be outside less and move to something else in summer. If you’re layering with a SPF 30, then you’d be fine. Makes makeup application naturally flawless
