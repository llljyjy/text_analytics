I really liked the product itself. It is a great exfoliating scrub that I would use daily. I would recommend not over using product and doing only once so you do not irritate your skin if you have sensitive skin like I do. The price is decent for the amount of product as a small amount goes a long way. I am not a big fan of the scent but otherwise loved the product. nan
