I received this Dior Capture Totale Super Potent Eye Serum from Dior and Influenster in exchange to leave my honest review This eye serum comes in tube which is very handy. It’s suits for my combo dry and oily skin. I didn’t experience any breakouts. I loved the scent of this serum. The applicator is helpful in dispensing the right amount of serum on the right spot. The applicator is very cooling and  relaxing . I loved how light and easily absorbed on my skin.It has been 5days since I started using this and I could already see the results. It’s lessen the puffiness and fine lines on my eye area. It’s a great serum. Great eye serum
