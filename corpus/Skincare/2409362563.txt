I have oily, combination, acne-prone skin. This is the first time that I tried an exfoliating scrub that is made of red clay. The red clay ingredient helps draw out oil and dirt in my pores. The physical exfoliant is made of volcanic pumice. The chemical exfoliant is made of fruit and plant AHAs. For me, the volcanic pumice feels ok on my skin, but maybe too much for sensitive skin people. Donâ€™t apply too much pressure if your skin is too sensitive.The scrub has an interesting scent, I am fine with it because it is not too strong. I use this in the shower because of the orange color. The orange color seems to stain my hands, need to use a foamy cleanser to wash it off. nan
