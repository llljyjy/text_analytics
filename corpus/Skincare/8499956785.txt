I received this complimentary of influenster and korres for my honest opinion. I have never used Korres product before however this product is amazing. It’s light and soaks into the skin. I have oily sensitive skin. It didn’t break me out and didn’t cause any more oiliness. The smell was very light. I would suggest this product! Great moisturizer
