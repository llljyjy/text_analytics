I received this product for free from Influenster for my honest review. Although this was just a small trial size, I was still pleasantly surprised! There is barely any fragrance to this product unlike many of Estée Lauder’s other skincare. It was too small with few uses to be able to see a difference in my skin, but I am curious and will most likely buy the full size. I have sensitive skin so the less fragrance, the better! It felt smooth and very soft upon application and seemed to even work well as a primer. Will be purchasing the full size!
