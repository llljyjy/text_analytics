Spray products are always hit or miss. They either are amazing, lightweight, and effective or they just don’t provide enough benefit to encourage me to use them further. I have found that this Plump and Juicy spray, like many other Kosas products is truly beneficial and worth using more often than others. Beyond the Clinically Proven Results this spray is full of amazing skin loving ingredients such as moisture retaining Hibiscus Extract, vitamin rich skin tone evening Artemisia Extract, and relieving and strengthening lactobacillus ferment. There are peptides, probiotics, and amino acids along with wrinkle reducing and elasticity improving Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate. It is truly full of the good stuff. The mist itself is refreshing and light. It doesn’t feel drenching, but it absolutely is noticeable in its ability to provide quick hydration. I absolutely love the bottle. It feels luxurious and the ombre type color is truly gorgeous, perfect for displaying. I appreciate that it is dermatologist tested and really safe for sensitive skin types. Overall, I do recommend this for anytime you need a boost of hydration or some relief from redness or irritation. Great Hydration
