Packaging looks amazing! Love that is refillable. Some good ingredients like hyaluronic acid,vitamin C and E, Bionymph peptide complex, oat kernel extract, aloe vera rose extract. But there are also some not so great ingredients... First one of the top ingredients is vegetable oil.... Why? If am going to pay a $100 I want a good oil not vegetable oil, I want all great ingredients. Also has dimethicone and other stuff, I donâ€™t want that on my face....This is like an old ponds cream but where some good ingredients were added. Change the ingredients make it better...
