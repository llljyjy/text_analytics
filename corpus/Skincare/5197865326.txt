The IT Confidence in a Cream has a beautiful buttery texture, it glides on skin without leaving it sticky.  There is virtually no scent to it for those who are bothered by smells. I have been using this for 2 weeks, my skin is noticeably softer, and definitely more hydrated.  I would 100% recommend this moisturizer! Leaves skin very soft!
