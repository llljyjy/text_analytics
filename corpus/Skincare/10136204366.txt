As much as I love Glow Recipe and was looking for a new daily sunscreen, this dried my face out so much on my upper cheeks. Not even just normal dryness but literally dry patches and peeling. It also doesnt smell that good too but that’s not a big issue. If you have dry skin, keep clear of zinc oxide in sunscreens since mineral sunscreens depend on zinc. It makes dry skin even drier. I would opt for a chemical sunscreen which doesn’t depend on zinc. It’s been a week since i returned this sunscreen for the supergroup hydra-ceramide oil and my skin is back to normal with no dry patches in sight. I love Glow recipe and all their products but this was a no from me not for dry skin
