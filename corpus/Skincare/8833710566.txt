I got this because my skin’s moisture barrier was wrecked due to winter weather and I was hoping the ceramides would help my skin. I’ve found that it did to a certain extent help but that it really wasn’t as relieving as I had expected it to be.  Then, like all things with niacinimide in the ingredients list, it started to break me out and give me tiny pimples on my cheeks that went away when I discontinued use. It may not work great for my skin but I can see it being good for people whose skin actually agrees with niacinimide. Another note though, this bottle will not last more than a month with frequent use. I used 1-2 pumps, twice a day for 2 weeks before my skin started to disagree with the product and I’m already halfway through the whole bottle. Even if you do one pump once a day, I think this product will run out extremely quickly, so it’s just not cost effective. Not for me
