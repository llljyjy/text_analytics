Okay first off the picture I will be attaching is without primer, I always like to test my foundations without primer first and this girl needed some primer! But once you set your face and start your day you won’t be displeased! And it has spf built in! Love that. Especially since the fair just swept through my town over the weekend! This was the perfect foundation for those festivities! Love the finish as well and easily blendable She’s a good one
