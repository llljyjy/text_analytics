I normally buy the Farmacy Cleansing Balm, but since this was on sale and has great reviews, I thought I’d give it a go.Overall, it’s a great product. My skin is super sensitive and there are lots of products I’ve had to return because they’ve made me breakout, but this one’s been good to me. It does work really well for removing makeup, even the most stubborn gel liners or waterproof mascaras.I took off two stars because the smell is very unpleasant! It’s off-putting enough for me to not repurchase. I’ll be going back to my Farmacy balm. Good product, bad smell.
