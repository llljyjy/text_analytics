Lovevlovelove!!!  The stuff is heavenly.  Only, since i use tretinoin at night, i use this during the day as my day moisturizer!  Yea it’s thick and a bit greasy for day, but I’m putting on sunscreen over it anyway which also inevitably leaves me greasy.  Plus vitamin c can actually boost the efficacy of your sunscreen!  Win win.  My skin has been extremely prone to awful cystic break out but this has been part of my regime and i can’t live without it! the best
