Pros: Tightening sensation after use, “feels“ like there’s a difference after use, stays in position when applied properly, no breakouts or allergic reactionsCons: packaging [removal of product; not knowing which side should be skin down, no indications], amount of product for the price [6 pairs can easily get used up in 2 even 1 week][I have permanent dark circles. This reduces the swelling, not the discoloration] More product for the price needed
