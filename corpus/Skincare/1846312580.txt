Absolutely adore Aplyn Beauty’s efforts to create sustainably sourced products and was very excited to try their take on a cold cream cleanser. Immediately upon application I had serious nostalgia- it reminded me of using my mom’s cold cream as a kid but with a modern update. It’s creamy and cooling with a light zesty exfoliation and simply feels divine on your skin. Personally I liked it best when I used it as a face mask and left on for five minutes. My skin felt rejuvenated from the hydration  and it was excellent at removing my makeup. Added plus you’re getting plant based collagen and antioxidants to keep you looking your freshest. My skin is so soft and smooth, definitely worth trying! Not your mom's face cream
