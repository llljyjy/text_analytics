I love this product.  I used to hate on toner, especially the pricier ones, but it adds a layer of moisture that I really need with my dry skin.  I personally did not have any of the issues mentioned in other comments - I’ve never had any bits of rose come out of the cap because it’s such a tiny opening.  I’ve also never had issues with the cap. My favorite toner of all time
