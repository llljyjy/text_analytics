OK-so I couldn’t take a picture of my face before using this product as I was on a cruise.  But what a lifesaver this was on that cruise!  I had a sunburn on my face since I haven’t laid out for the entire pandemic!! :) So, when I realized I hadn’t put on enough sunblock, I was so happy I had thrown this in my bag.  It is cream, but absorbed into the skin without rigorous rubbing, a good thing for someone over 50-trying to not add any wrinkles.  I will also add that this product smells divine.  I have worked in cosmetics in the past and many times the smell of something impacts the usage since no one wants to have something that does not smell good on their face! Wow!
