I am also a reluctant one star review.  I love the patches, by the way.  Sadly this moisturizer on me dries and dulls my skin. I also have acne like I never had before. My fine lines are more pronounced now after two weeks of use than before.  I’m disappointed, but I’ll keep using the collagen patches very happily. Not for all skin types
