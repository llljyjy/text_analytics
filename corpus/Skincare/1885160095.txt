I love all her products except a few. This is one I don’t love, unfortunately. I thought I did at first, it went on well and I wouldn’t sunburn. However for some reason it drastically increased sun spots, something I have never had. I could have blamed it on getting older but after testing it was not the case! I stopped the product and over months my sunspots went away. I used it again and bam sun spots forming again so I immediately stopped. There’s something in here that leaves the skin more prone to sun spots even tho preventing burning. I’d recommend Coola face sunscreen instead. Triggers sun spotting for me.
