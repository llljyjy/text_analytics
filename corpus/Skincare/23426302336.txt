I usually never write review, but seeing how great it has worked for me, I feel like I need to. It really worked at depuffing my eyes in the morning. It has also worked at minimising temporarly (for the most part of the day) the small fine lines around my eyes. Probably not great for anti-anging, but good for “covering-up“ the early signs of aging without makeup. I didn’t buy it for the brightening effect, so I can’t really comment on that. Recommendation: Put only a small amount, don’t put it too close to the eyes or on the eyelids, cause it might irritate your eye as it did for me at the start. Good at depuffing and smoothing fine lines
