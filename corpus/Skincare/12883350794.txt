I absolutely love this product and it feels like all my texture is getting shaved away. The applicator smells a bit funky, but not abhorrent. I have very sensitive skin, and this doesnâ€™t irritate it at all even when I use it three times a week. My skin feels tight and clean after use and I want to buy more when my bottle is empty. I have moderate acne that has been hard to get under control, but this product has helped so much reduce the redness and grossness of acne scars. After washing, I can see the difference that this product makes. Acne and acne scars disappearing!
