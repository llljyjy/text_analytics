2 years later and I am still in love with this product. It evens my skin texture/tone and brightens/gives glow. I have normal/sometimes dry skin + sensitive. I layer this over the daily exfoliator (as suggested on the TH website) if Iâ€™m needing an extra radiance boost. I started off using it every other day, by now I am down to once or twice a week (depends). 2 years later - still gives that instant glow
