I’ve notice that it’s clogged my pores. I’ve had a few white heads but my black heads seem to multiply after just four or five days of continuous use. I wanted to like this because of the anti-aging benefits but not at the cost of clear skin. I usually don’t get broken out unless it’s around that time of month and it’s definitely not that time. I have dry skin so it did work well for that. Other than it being hydrating, I didn’t care for the clogging of pores. So I’ll pass. I wanted to love it… but couldn’t :(
