It’s definitely a lightweight moisturizer. So lightweight it feels basically like water and doesn’t actually moisturize my skin. It felt nice to put on but after a few minutes my skin felt dry again. It might work for someone else because of this but for $39 I was hoping for something more than just a pretty bottle. Kind of wish I never bought it. There are so many other moisturizers that are much cheaper and so much more worth it. NOT worth it
