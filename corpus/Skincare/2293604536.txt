i never believed in this product. for how much money it was, i couldn’t fathom that it wouldn’t irritate my face and go on so easily. i am so impressed with this product and am actually excited to use sunscreen now. it is also a great makeup primer! the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that i had some slight eye stinging but it was nothing compared to other face sunscreens i’ve tried. nan
