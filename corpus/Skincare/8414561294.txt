I love how the device makes my skin glow after cleaning, and the warm quartz feels so good on the face when putting on serum.The description says recharge in months, which is not true. The maximum it went without charge was around three weeks consistently.  I wouldn’t complain about the 3-week use per charge if it wasn’t advertised one charge would last for months.  Also, the design is not the most comfortable ergonomically. makes my skin glow
