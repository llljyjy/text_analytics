This serum is amazing. My skin is so glowy after using it and I have dry skin that tends to get dull. I am able to wear it in the day time with spf and have no issues of burning on my sensitive skin. The only reason I donâ€™t give this five stars is because it is expensive, but I will continue to buy it since nothing else has been able to recreate the results I am able to get. The glow is real!
