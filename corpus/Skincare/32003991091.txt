I’m loving this self-tanner to get my summer started. i followed the directions on the box and the process went smoothly. I made sure to put on clothing that I didn’t care too much about in case the tanner transferred. I also wore gloves and that made clean-up super easy. I let it sit for about six hours and immediately noticed results. I went into the sun and felt like gold. Golden glow awards
