I use this as a primary cleanser before using a gentle cleanser, such as The one from CeraVe. It has the best consistency and makes my skin feel so soft when cleaning off my makeup. The softness does fade I feel, but at the moment it’s divine! The reason I gave it 4 stars is simply because the fragrance is a liiittllle bit too strong and it’s hard to squeeze the product out. I don’t know why, but man I’ve been struggling. Send help lol!. Still love it though, especially because a little goes a long way! Love it!!!
