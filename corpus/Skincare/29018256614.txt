I want to like this but it didn’t work for me, I’m medium to tan and it looked like a have foundation 2 tone lighter, but the worse part is that no matter what moisturizer I applied it pills like crazy forget about putting make up on top, main reason I won’t be buying again. On the good part is very liquid easy to apply, did not dry my skin and did not gave me any break out. pills like crazy
