I received a sample of this moisturizer free from Influenster to test. I have dehydrated sensitive skin and I loved the consistency of this moisturizer; like a gel cream hybrid, that feels lighter than a lotion but still deeply moisturizing. My skin felt very smooth and hydrated but not oily, although my skin tends to lean normal to dry so it rarely feels oily. I’m taking off one star because it did cause some redness, but I have a sensitivity to sodium hyaluronate, so I could’ve anticipated that. Because of that, I don’t think this product is suitable for all sensitive skin types, but if you don’t have sensitive skin, I think it’s a really enjoyable, effective product. Great product but not for all skin types
