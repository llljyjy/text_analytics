I received the Shiseido Ultimate Power Infusing Concentrate for free in response for my honest review.When I received this product I got so excited because I’ve been using Shiseido products for years - ever since my Mother-in-Law sent me my first product as a gift- so I knew this concentrate would be a great addition to my skin care routine. I wasn’t wrong.You just put it on morning and night right before your moisturizer and it gives your skin an oomph of hydration and helps make your face more radiant. Love this brand. Love this product. Love this brand.
