I hate how expensive it is but I love love love this night cream. It’s light and not greasy but still very hydrating. When I wake up, my skin is so soft and dewy. The fragrance is a very light lavender and I like the way it smells! I like that it’s easy to travel with since it twists to dispense. I don’t like that I can’t see how much it left before running out but that’s minor. It’s a product that I look forward to putting on every time. Love using this product
