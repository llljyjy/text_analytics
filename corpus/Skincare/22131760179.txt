I was very impressed with this moisturizer. It’s got an incredible formula and I really noticed a difference in my skin while using this during the colder months. The texture absorbs beautifully into my combo skin and doesn’t feel greasy, and it has done wonders in repairing my skin barrier after breakouts and irritation. My only complaint is the packaging, the pump stopped dispensing product after one week of use and so I’ve been having to scoop it out manually ever since (which makes it impossible to use all of the product). It’s by no means an affordable moisturizer so I wish the packaging wasn’t so cheap and difficult, but the product itself is amazing. Great product, poor packaging
