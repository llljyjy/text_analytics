over night difference WOW! The women at sephora told me this was a vit c and retinol which ive never heard of but for the price its basically a two in one. my wrinkles were minimized, pores as well! I did notice slight irritation around my eyes but when I called they told me not to put it around my eyes which is my fault, i went back and bought the wrinkle warrior eyes and that with this product is an anti aging DUO BETTER THAN THE ORDINARY !!
