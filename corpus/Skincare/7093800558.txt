I received this as a #freeproduct in return for a review from Topbox Circle. I was curious to see what this formulation looked like because I had used the previous iteration and repurchased it several times in the past.Having only used this at night, I can say that it makes for a good layer in the skincare routine. It has a faint fragrance that didnâ€™t irritate me, and all that was needed was a thin layer. That being said, it would make a better summer layer than a winter layer, especially for Canadian winters because it gets really harsh and dry. I would buy this when I run out, but use it in the summer, or add something heavier for winter nights. nan
