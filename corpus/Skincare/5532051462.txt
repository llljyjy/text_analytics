This cleanser is the best for oily/hormonal skin! I have tried most benzoyl peroxide cleanser at the drugstore. Dr Zenovias 10% benzoyl peroxide acne cleanser worked differently on my oily skin. It cleared stubborn acne immediately without drying my face out. Regular continued use yielded great results! Truly a miracle cleanser, worth a try even if you think youâ€™ve tried it all. Cant recommend enough! A must try for oily/hormonal skin!!
