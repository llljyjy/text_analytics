I have been using this moisturizer for almost a month! Your skin will instantly feel the moisture stay captured! I have sensitive skin that can easily turn red depending on the products I’m using. I am 34 years old and have always taken care of my skin. I dont have many wrinkles but in the evenings or when I wake up I can get creases around my eyes,  crows feet area. This issue has completely resolved while using this product. It does have strong smell but it immediately goes away once applied. It doesn’t linger nor bother me. I know products can have smells but still be very good quality for your skin! It feels soft and plump on my skin! Truly a great product! I absolutely recommend this product if you are trying to prevent or already have wrinkles. Your skin can never be to moisturized and will love you for this! I did receive this product to try from Influenster & Biossance! BUSSIN MOISTURE
