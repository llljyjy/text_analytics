I tried a few sample packets of this product with recent orders, applying a small amount day and night consecutively for a few days, and the first thing I noticed was its foul odor; this stuff STINKS, like dirt or potting soil... the awful smell alone was very offputting. That aside, I do not believe there were any positive effects on the skin. My face just looked shiny (like oily, not a good sheen) and sunburnt. Would not recommend, especially at such a high price for that putrid stench... I don’t understand, because I’ve always enjoyed the flavor of ginseng tea, I did not expect it to stink so badly... Smells like being in a grave, I suppose...
