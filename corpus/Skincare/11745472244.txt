So happy to see this on the Sephora website! I’ve been buying this from Paula’s Choice (they have frequent sales) and using this for over 2 years. I have tried stronger retinols and it really irritated my skin. I introduced this 2 times a week after my moisturizer and experiences no irritation. This is gentle and hydrating. I’m now to the point where I use this daily after my moisturizer at night - sometimes before if I’m feeling like I don’t need the moisture buffer. My complexion is more even and bright and any dark acne spots fade a lot quicker. I also bring this down my neck and I believe it has softened my “tech neck“ lines. Overall this product is a must for anyone with sensitive/dry skin or anyone who wants to introduce a retinol into the regimen. Chef's Kiss
