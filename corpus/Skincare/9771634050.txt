im not sure why the reviews are so bad. i love this moisturizer! itâ€™s a great base for makeup. i enjoy the smell. i guess it does feel a little bit sticky, but to me sticky is better than greasy! i would recommend this if you have acne prone skin. ive never had a negative reaction to this. ive tried many expensive moisturizers and this is my favorite (behind tatcha). love love love
