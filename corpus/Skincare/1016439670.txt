Like most people, I try every serum and cream I can get my hands on. I was intrigued by this combo. At first glance, the container stands out for sure. As form follows function, the design does make perfect sense.  The scent is nice. I’m not one of those people that hates a scent so I’m good with it, but I could see someone being turned off by it if they’re sensitive.I used this product every day and night for three weeks and I really feel like it makes a difference. My pores seem reduced, and my skin looks and feels plumper and just a bit brighter. It hasn’t done much for the redness which I didn’t expect anyway, but using it under makeup has made the application much smoother and more even. I will definitely invest in this product. Surprisingly wonderful
