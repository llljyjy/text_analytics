I love this toner. It has really helped to clear my skin. I’m 38 yrs old and I suffer from adult acne and combination skin, but this toner (paired with Dermalogica Glycolic Acid facial cleanser) has cleared my skin almost completely. I highly recommend it. I’m on my second bottle and no, this is not incentivized. Love it!
