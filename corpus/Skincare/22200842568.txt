love this vitamin c!  feels VERY hydrating under my eyes.  i tend to not get the most amount of sleep, and ive noticed that it definitely of depuffs my eyes in the morning.  it also noticed it brightened my under eyes.  overall i like this eye cream ESPECIALLY because a lot of eye creams are super tiny, but i feel like this one will last me a while. super hydrating
