I was gifted by Algenist their new Liquid Skin Resurfacing 2% BHA Toner.  This resurfacing toner feels amazingly refreshing as it comes in contact with your skin.  After you are left with the clean skin.  The salicylic acid and azelaic acid exfoliate unclogs and smooths your skin and give you a radiant glow.  With prolonged usage you will see a more even skin tone and healthy great skin.  Also, this is perfect for those with sensitive skin as it has no harsh smells that will irritate your skin. Clean healthy skin
