i bought this after getting instagram ads for it, and super sad that this is totally *not it*. it is a very tiny bottle, about the size of a mccormick spice bottle which makes it great for transporting around for re-application in a small purse. however, i hate re-applying sunscreen with this. the mist is so fine that it goes every but where i want it to. literally i have to spray it inches away from my face and the smell is quite harsh that up close, not v cucumber-y. but $30+ for such a small product? super bad value. i have been telling all my friends who love sunscreen to stay far away from this product. oof
