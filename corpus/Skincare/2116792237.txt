I was lucky enough to be able to sample the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum. I loved pairing this underneath of the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Cream. Unfortunately the sample was too small to notice any difference in my skin. However, I think with extended use it would show great results. I would definitely consider this product when looking for new skincare products in the future. nan
