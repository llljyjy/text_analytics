Best moisturizer I’ve ever used. The texture is incredibly rich, and it absorbs into my skin like a dream. Unlike other moisturizers, this does not sit on top of the skin or feel greasy. It makes my skin feel so supple and bouncy and soft.Let’s talk about the smell. I am not particularly sensitive to bad smells. I am a nurse. Does this product smell bad, as a few other reviewers have noted? This product does have an odd, stale smell. I would not call it foul. But when your apply it into your skin, the smell goes away like magic. And let’s not forget why there is an odor: THIS IS A CLEAN BEAUTY PRODUCT AND THEREFORE IT HAS NO FRAGRANCES OR PERFUMES. The smell you’re smelling is the special ingredient that is good for your skin: SQUALANE. Do I think this product is worth using? Absolutely. Is the smell so bad it would deter me from purchasing it? Not in the least. I will continue to use this product. It makes my skin look amazing and I have been getting compliments. Give it a try. There is a small sampler size available. Worth it
