I received this #freeproduct from Topbox Circle. I used the wrinkle correcting serum at night with my routine. It felt nice on and was easy to apply. But the sample was very small, like for one application so I dont know about long term effects.  Scent was nice also. I used it with the other face products of the same line. Seems to be of good quality. I just wish the sample size was bigger so I have a better idea of full results of the product. Nice smooth serum
