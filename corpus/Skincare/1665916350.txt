Okay l purchased this product about two years ago. I use it sparingly and only in the Summer.  This is my summer go to facial cleanser.  Love the smell and feel of this cleanser on my face.  This is the top of the line cleanser.  However this cleanser does nothing for me in the winter.  This is my summer cleanser all day.  Love the glass bottle.  Excellent customer service this company.  Top of the line quality products and people.   Real people who are genuinely concerned about their customers and the environment.  I am up for a new bottle.  Will order soon. Quality
