I have been using this cream for over 2 weeks and I definitely see results. I do have dry skin, light to no texture. I still see the difference It’s repairing my skin looks bright and healthy. Nourished and it doesn’t feel heavy on the face and it’s light a silky. Very good night cream. A little bit goes a long way. Waking up with nourished skin never felt better.
