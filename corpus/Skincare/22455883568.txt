at first i was hesitant just cause i didn’t look at mount lai as a skincare brand with products outside of the tools but i’m so glad i got the serum. it’s so calming feels so comforting on my dried out skin. this summer has been rough. also i’m obsessed with the fact that they actually included a spatula, unlike so many other brands who don’t. and it’s a good quality metal one that you can reuse. y’all did good, definitely ordering another one a must for dry skin
