All u do is spray ur face - it makes removing makeup so much faster and easier . The only thing I don’t like is rubbing all over my face to massage In the product . Cuz then I have to keep washing the makeup off my hands before I can get more off and I feel like I’m just rubbing the makeup around all over my face . I tried this on my eye makeup and it worked ! It made removing eye makeup so easy . Be careful around your eyes tho because eyes are sensitive . I used a Q tip to remove my mascara and lightly massaged the oil on my lids . It feels so soft . If u like oils on your face you will enjoy this . If you don’t like that feeling , you might just end up feeling greasy from this product . Very good & easy to use
