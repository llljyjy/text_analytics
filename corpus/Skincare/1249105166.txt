This serum work well for the Bear but dries quickly to the point you have to reapply constantly to get through the full Bear routine. So I started applying it to one side of my face and using the Bear and so on. It helps. But the amount you have to apply not to get shocked is quite liberal- for reference- I e been using my Bear since December 1-2 per day (about 3 times/week I use the bear twice and the other 3 once and sometimes forget due to a busy career) and I’ve already gone through 2 bottles and a bit…not to mention a few samples I got of the serum. I was lucky I got the serum serum serum on sale but if I have to continue at this rate - it’s going to get very costly among the rest of my skin care. Also I don’t find it’s making my skin any better, I’m using it just for the Bear. I will have to try something else for conductivity purposes, because it’s too expensive for this purpose- with little effectiveness to my overall skin benefits. costly prospect for Bear
