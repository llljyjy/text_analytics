Bought this to use for under my eyes as a nighttime treatment because I was starting to see creases. It softens under my eyes. The top photo is before I started using it and the bottom photo is 2 months after using it on most nights. As you can see, in the bottom photo, my creases are less prominent and not as long. I love using this at night. I also put it in the ends of my hair and it smooths out frizz. Under eye treatment and Hair
