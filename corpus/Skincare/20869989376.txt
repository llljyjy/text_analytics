My skin has been playing games with me recently. There are days when it is soft and supple and then there are days when it is dry and flaky and stays that way throughout the day. But it all changed when I started using the clinique moisture surge 100h auto-replenishing hydrator moisturizer. THe cool jelly like consistency keeps my skin soft and supple even on the dry days and there are no surprises waiting for me every day. I know every day is going to be a good skin day. Going to repurchase
