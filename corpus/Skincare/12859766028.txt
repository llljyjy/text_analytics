Got this combo for bday gift and although it feels amazing on skin and hydrated (dry skin, somewhat sensitive) it gave me painful acne! I tried it the next day and got 2 more pimples- painful. I have used so many clean products that I can’t even remember the last time I had acne. Also didn’t notice a non-comedogenic description on box at all, I overlooked it. nan
