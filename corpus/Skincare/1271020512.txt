I received a generous sample of the mask. Applied all of it after my nighttime skincare routine and left it on overnight. Woke up this morning thinking I’d forgotten to apply moisturizer last night. This mask did nothing for my skin. I use retinol regularly (but not under the mask). Don’t think this mask is enough for winter weather + skin using retinol or other actives. nan
