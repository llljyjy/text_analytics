After adding Sephora Targeted Dark Spot Serum to my routine I’ve notice a visible change in the appearance of my skin. I use it on my face and neck, leaving both with a more even tone. My neck has always been dark and appeared dirty but after using this it is blending in with the other surrounding skin. It’s definitely a new favorite of mine Amazing
