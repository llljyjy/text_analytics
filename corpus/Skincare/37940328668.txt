Kosas Plump + Juicy Lip  Collagen BoosterI have being using this buttery collagen booster Day + Night lip treatment for the past 4 weeks, and have to say that it’s helping to deep hydrate, soften, smooth and plump my summer chapped lips. I didn’t feel tingling or any burning sensation while using the booster, but it was visibly working it’s magic. Can’t wait for its launch debut.During the day I combine the Plump + Juicy Lip  Collagen Booster with my Wet Lip Oil Plumping Gloss for the extra kick (now they are my new go-to lip combo), and at night I am using it as a mask. I also combined the booster with the Hotliner Lip Liner, also launching soon. Perfect simple combination.The ingredients are awesome:*peptides (plumps) *hyaluronic acid (attracts water and locks hydration) *jojoba oil (softens and soothes) *pomegranate flower extract (prevent collagen breakdown, smoothes skin, reduces the appearance of wrinkles and protects skin against UV exposure) *concentrate fatty acids (relieves dryness)Least to say that I threw out all my other chapsticks.I recommend it! #gliziaapprovedGlízia Roell ~ Skincare Expert since 2003, MUA & Verified Beauty ExpertSkin type: Normal (Mature) - Anti-Aging Treat & Repeat!
