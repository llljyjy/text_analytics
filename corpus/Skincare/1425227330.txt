I received this product to test out and love the lightweight feeling of it. It doesn’t feel super greasy or heavy on my face and my moisturizer applies nicely after, I can’t tell if it’s making me break out, or if I’m just breaking out in general right now. So when my skin normalizes I will try it again! Love shesiedo
