It works well and I notice less puffiness and a glow to my skin from improved blood circulation BUT this stone is too delicate. I’ve had it a month and it slipped out of my hand onto the sink counter and broke in half.  Too slippery and delicate had to replace it within a month 🙁 Depuffs but good luck not dropping and breaking it
