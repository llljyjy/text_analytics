I liked the consistency of the cream, feels lightweight not heavy at all and absorbs quickly which is perfect. I do see and feel an improvement, I feel my under eyes smoother and hydrated but honestly I donâ€™t see any major difference in dullness or dark circles. I will continue to use because those kind of effects take long to show on skin. I do recommend just has to be patient. Good!
