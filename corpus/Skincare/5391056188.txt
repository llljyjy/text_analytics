Not as hydrating/luxurious feeling as the Farmacy one but works VERY well for its price! It was able to remove my extremely waterproof mascara (heroine make kiss me mascara) and I am satisfied with that. There’s no fragrance but a slight waxy/candle smell which I’m not a fan of, but I can’t really complain much given its price. I will buying this from now on instead of the farmacy! Very good deal whenever SC is 30% off too! :) nan
