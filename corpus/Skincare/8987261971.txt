I love this cleanser! I have been looking for a face wash that works for my sensitive, red, acne prone skin and this is it. I love washing with this bc my skin fees immediately soft after, not tight, it does NOT break me out ( and almost everything does) and it does not make my face red. I also wear full makeup daily and it does  do a good job removing it if you use a wash cloth etc so I literally have no complaints.  Iâ€™m very shocked on how much I like this product. Will Def continue to buy,  it is worth the money! A must  have!
