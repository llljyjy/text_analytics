I had a great experience with Fruit-Tox Resurfacing Facial Remedy. I applied it on wet skin and left mine for extra 3 minutes to see better results. It tingles when itâ€™s on but nothing crazy, after washing it off my skin felt soft, brighter, and fresh so definitely will purchase another tube after I finish this one, because I love it! Soft Skin
