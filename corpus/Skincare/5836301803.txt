Gifted by EADEM. Barrier savior. Airy but very effective in calming down irritated skin. Offers plenty of moisturization even for very dry skin, which I happen to have (I do however top it off with an oil before bed). Packed with peptides and ceramides. I very easily see this turning into a staple in my routine. Barrier savior
