This is a medium thickness moisturizer that is a little thicker than the adaptogen but no where near as thick as the dream cream. It has no scent and it absorbs in so quickly and feels so good. I can wear this under make up with no problem and at night as my nighttime moisturizer. It makes my face feel plump and hydrating I am really enjoying it. creamy hydrating cream
