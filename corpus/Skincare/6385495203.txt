So I’ve been using this product for over 6 months now, and it has become my favourite face moisturizer I’ve ever used. It’s thick and hydrating without leaving my face greasy at all, probably too thick if you have any oil in your face. I have very, very dry skin if I don’t moisturize on a regular basis, and this has really revitalized my skin into a much smoother and softer surface. I’ve recently combined it with a more comprehensive skin care routine and I swear my skin is looking better as time goes by. I included a before picture (short pink hair) and an after of me in natural light (colour faded hair tied back). My skin really has a glow to it now without any makeup, and I’m definitely re-purchasing this after I use up my second jar. Worth every penny. My dry skin is transformed
