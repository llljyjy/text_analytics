i love the light, fluffy texture (you’re encouraged to shake the bottle before use)! i don’t wear makeup over it but i think it does well on its own. it’s not very matte on my skin but is a little blurring so it evens things out. they should probably make this in a darker tint as well; it disappears into my skin, but i cant imagine it not leaving a slight cast on someone more brown. very lovely
