I have combination skin, and this product was okay with it. I put it on after my serums in the morning, before applying my primer and makeup; I found it kept my face fairly moisturized for most of the day, but did not last all day. My skin was definitely dry by the end of my work day. The texture wasn’t my favourite, it was a bit slimy feeling but absorbed into my skin fine. I don’t know if I would buy this, I just didn’t feel like it was right for my skin and for how long I need it to last. nan
