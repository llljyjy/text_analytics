Damdam face oil is amazing add to my skin care routine! I’m using it mornings and evenings to keep my skin plump. I apply a thin layer before my moisturizer to lock in the moisture. My skin is usually on a drier side, so this rice oil serum is really helping with my dry patches and keeps my make up looking good! I’d definitely recommend to try it out. Keeps the dry patches away
