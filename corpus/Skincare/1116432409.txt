I have been using the Dr Zenovia Peptide and Ceramide Moisturizer for a couple months in and off. Its a beautiful clean looking glass bottle. It feel like a nice light cream moisturizer. It dissolves into the skin nicely and quickly. Its not sticky and has a great light summery sent. The only con is that it dried out my skin. I have combo oily skin a d very rarely get dry patches. This moisturizer gave me dry patches around my nose and cheeks. I started using it only once a day, and then had to stop all together. After the dryness went away I tried it again and the same thing happened. Its for unusual for my skin so I am not sure what to make of it. But I won’t be purchasing this moisturizer and I wouldn’t recommend, especially if you already have dry skin. Drying even on my oily skin
