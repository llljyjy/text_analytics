I have dry and sensitive skin and I have never had acne my entire life. I wanted to try this since I’ve been using the same face wash for years. I broke out right away but I kept using it because I assumed it was just purging and my skin would “get worse before it gets better.” I waited for over 3 months and it kept getting worse instead of better. It messed up my moisture barrier and my dry/flaky skin became super oily/greasy. I stopped using this about a month ago and switched back to my old face wash and my skin started to improve right away but it’s still recovering. It stripped my skin so much.
