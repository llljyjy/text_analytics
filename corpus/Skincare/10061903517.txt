Big breakout for me. Like real acne, more blackheads…my skin has white texture after applying the cream as if it was never hydrated properly, my skin was still dry as if I didn’t exfoliate it. Weird experience for me since people love it so much. I’ve tried it for months, I went back to my usual cream and guess what? No more breakout and less pores open blackheads or dry skin who is just humid after the apply. I have very dry skin and rosacea btw. Breakout alert lol
