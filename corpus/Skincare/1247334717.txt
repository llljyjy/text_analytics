This is the best moisturizer I’ve ever used!! I wish it wasn’t so expensive but I will be purchasing it as long as I can ! It makes your skin moistures without feeling heavy , thick or sticky . I definitely have soft glowy skin after using this that does not look greasy . It wears so well under my foundation everyday and my skin looks better since using this and the vitamin c serum for the last few months . I don’t usually use a full pump during the day as I feel too much comes out so I use a little less (3 mini pumps) . FYI : I’m 38 but everyone thinks I’m in my early 20’s . That’s not due to this product but this product definitely helps as I’ve been getting carded more often since using it and it really does make your skin look more youthful while wearing it .
