My skin felt smooth when I woke up. Using Hard water can mess up my skin but this revived it. The product texture is watery and light. My skin is definitely more hydrated and brighter and my pores aren’t as big. I usually break out from other products and this one made my skin look better/not breakout. I’ll use this a couple times a week before bed after I’m done with my skin care routine. It doesn’t feel bad over my other products. My skin feels a lot smoother. I like that it doesn’t feel sticky after applying. Great product!
