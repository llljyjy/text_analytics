This is the first product i’ve used that incorporates both bakuchiol and retinol. My skin typically don’t do well with most retinol products, but I like Paula’s Choice so I decided to give it a try. I have used this once only so I can only offer a first impression review. The texture is lotion-like and easy to spread across the skin. So far I’ve experienced no irritation, dry patches or itchy skin so I’m liking it. I think I need to use it for at least a few weeks to be able to see visible results. Since my skin is reacting well to it, I’m hopeful I will see results soon. nan
