Not as hydrating as Tatcha but a close second. I have received this complimentary in a small sample size so it wasn’t enough to test for a full month. I do experience dryer than normal skin in the winter and during season changes so I do like adding products like this to my routine. However, with the pricing I’ll stick to Tatcha. Just ok
