I was super excited to try Ilia’s serum. Since I work in the hospital setting, I do not have a whole lot of time to focus on my skin care routine in the mornings. So, a natural facial product that is an all in one serum plus sunscreen was like finding a unicorn. But I finally found mine! I love this serum. It hydrates my skin while giving me a healthy glow that does not make my face feel oily. While it does have zinc oxide as a sunscreen, the tint in the serum does a really nice job blending it into my skin- no white spots, no awkward looking residue. Application does take some minimal effort. I do have to shake the product really well. The ingredients naturally separate. In order to have it blend well, I would recommend shaking it at least 15-20 times. But that’s just a small price to pay for this all in one beauty. It’s a must try!!! Naturally terrific!
