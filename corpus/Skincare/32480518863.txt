I received this item free to try out though #topboxcircle. Despite this, all opinions are my own. First impression was amazing, the packaging feels really nice and looks cute. The actual product was really lovely!! I’m not usually an eye cream person because I don’t like having a lot of product on my face because it can feel heavy. But it was incredibly light weight and felt light nothing. It just glided on and sank right in. I barely had to use any product. It feels really hydrating and made my skin look very fresh. It also had no scent which I always appreciate in skincare. The eye cream is a gel cream which are my favourite type, especially In the summer because I love the light texture that feels weightless. #freeproduct. Love love love it!!
