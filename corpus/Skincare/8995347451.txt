My daughter gave this to me, as she has so many other cleansers. I wasn’t expecting much, considering the low price point. The gel lathers beautifully and I really like the scent. My skin is left feeling soft and not dry. I much prefer this product over Fresh’s soy face wash (much pricier). Definitely recommend! Pleasantly Surprised
