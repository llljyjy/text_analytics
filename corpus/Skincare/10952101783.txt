I absolutely loved the previous formula and packaging for this moisturizer. I thought I had finally found the moisturizer I would be using for a very long time as it had cured stubborn dry skin. I am so disappointed with the new formula as I find it not as moisturizing and the scent is quite strong compared to the previous version- I find this now causes my skin to sting and leaves a residue on my face. I also find the packaging is a downgrade from the old version as itâ€™s now plastic when it was previously a nice glass container. I think I will be searching for a new moisturizer after finishing this one. Bring back the old formula and packaging
