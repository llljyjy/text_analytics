I love the way this stuff hydrates the skin without making my skin feel heavy or oily, and this stuff is 5x more hydrating that hyaluronic acid!! I love applying this before applying moisturizer or foundation/concealer because it helps my makeup blend easier onto my skin. It also has a nice clean scent but I went through the bottle so fast! Obsessed but runs out quickly
