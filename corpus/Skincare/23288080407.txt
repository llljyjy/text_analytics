I received the Calming Herbal Repair Serum Concentrate Anti-Aging Balm totally free from PinchMe for trying out at home and providing my honest reviews in return.  This serum has a nutrient-dense, balm-to-serum formula that soothes, moisturizes, and nourishes the skin to address visible signs of aging like fine lines and wrinkles.The ingredients in this amazing serum are Plant Root Adaptogen Complex which targets visible signs of aging in the skin, Squalane: Balances and hydrates for smooth, supple-looking skin and Green Tea Extract which fights free-radical damage and visible irritation and redness.I have already recommended the Calming Herbal Repair Serum Concentrate Anti-Aging Balm to many of my friends and family and several of them have already purchased and used it, and they got benefited a lot from using it, since their skin is now smooth and beautiful just like mine. Amazing anti-aging balm serum!
