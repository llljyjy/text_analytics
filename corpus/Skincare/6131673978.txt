I have sensitive skin and my face did not like this product at all. It made my skin very hot, red and I broke out in bumps. It caused my face to completely dry out from the reaction. Besides my sensitivity to the product - the product comes out very oily and is hard to get enough on your fingers to apply to your face from the short pump. It also does not absorb well into the skin and feels very thick on - i prefer a lighter product for serums. nan
