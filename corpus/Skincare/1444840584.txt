As Iâ€™ve grown older I find my skin craves a deep drink of moisture. Lala delivers moisture without a greasy finish and is nearly immediately absorbed, leaving my skin soft and happy. I love the pump dispenser. You can control how much product you get, it keeps germy fingers out of the jar, and the top screws off so at anytime you can see how much is left or get the last little bit out. Genius. And an excellent moisturizer as well. Will continue to buy. Worth the dollars  to me. Excellent for dry mature skin
