I was a little nervous to use this after reading some of the reviews but I’m happily surprised. It is a little bit orange but the color (I didn’t do my feet so I could see the color difference) is much more even than it is with their tanning drops. I didn’t notice a huge self tan smell and it didn’t transfer onto any clothing or bedsheets. I’ve only had it on for 24 hours so I’m curious to see how it will fade. Happily Surprised
