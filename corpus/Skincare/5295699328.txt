So I’m not sure that I have been using it long enough to notice a huge difference. on the website it said some people saw changes after 4 weeks some people saw changes after 12 weeks I might be in the 12 week group but I have only been using it for a little over a month. So I definitely like how it feels on my skin it’s lovely it dries quick it’s not sticky. It also does not have a weird smell which is super important to me. So the website says it is supposed to help instantly depuff eye area I don’t necessarily have naturally puffy eye area but it does feel good on my skin. it also says instantly brightens I don’t know I could say there is a visible difference immediately. I will say I like it as far as the moisturizing properties go I don’t feel like my eyes are dry halfway through the day it definitely makes my under eyes feel better if I’ve been rubbing or anything like that. I might give it more stars after using it for a longer amount of time. Feels good, not sticky
