I love the idea of a tinted sunscreen serum. The product’s ingredients are also amazing. While this did provide an even skin tone, the results were short-lived due to pilling. I believe the serum has the potential to be great product, the formula just needs a little tweaking. I didn’t notice much of a difference after 4 weeks of use, likely because the product doesn’t absorb properly into the skin. As an overall suggestion, I would not recommend this product. The formula should be improved to provide better results. Just Okay
