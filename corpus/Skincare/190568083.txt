I love the black glass packaging, I love the pump. The serum has a gel texture and I love that it isn’t too heavy and doesn’t contest my neck/chest area. Too many neck creams are suffocating to my neck. This has a faint rose scent from the rosewater. This did help a little with my tech neck. It’s not as good as my beloved Alastin but it’s pretty decent and I like the texture nan
