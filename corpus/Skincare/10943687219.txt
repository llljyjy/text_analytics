I was so iffy about purchasing this product because my skin can be kinda sensitive to vitamin C products. I have dry, acne prone, sensitive skin and this is my new holy grail nighttime moisturizer. You need the smallest amount, itâ€™s so nourishing, and my skin looks visibly plumper and brighter the morning after using it. 10/10!! New holy grail night time moisturizer
