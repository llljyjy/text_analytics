I was gifted this product and I am OBSESSED! This product leaves my skin feeling so moisturized and genuinely soft. Previous to using this product I would get dry spots on my face that you could visibly see through my makeup - not anymore after using this! I started using this product at night but also like to in the morning as well. The consistency is oily and thicker than some others I’ve used but because of that it’s great if you use a jade roller or gua sha. My skin feels so hydrated after using this product! Great product for Jade Roller or Gua Sha
