I received this jar as a gift for my honest opinion. What a magical dream! I truly believe it’s called magic cream for a reason simply because it WORKS like magic. I love the way the cream kept my skin hydrated, which a lot of sensitive skin formulas do not because of being acne prone. I noticed my skin felt plumper & more freshened the next day! The ingredients that include hyaluronic acid make your skin regeneration faster, also receiving dry areas. I just love this! It also doesn’t really have a strong scent (which I hate with a lot of mid-high cost range brands) because you feel like you’re putting a lot of chemicals on your face. Overall a 10/10 experience & lovely moisturizing cream! But do be careful as this is thicker, so it does make your skin feel a tad bit more on the oily side. A Magic Genie!
