This is a great cleanser! I love that it includes exfoliating acids but manages to be very gentle and not at all stripping. It had a great scent and texture! Being a cleanser, it doesnâ€™t have a huge impact on acne but it does have very beneficial ingredients. Overall 4/5! Great Cleanser for Acneic Skin
