If you hate the smell of traditional sunscreen and hate chemical sunscreens burning your eyes, you need to try this one! Smells great immediately upon application, then scent entirely disappears after a few minutes. Absolutely clear and no white cast. I am a huge baby about sunscreen, I have sensory issues and absolutely hate being sticky or smelling like traditional sunscreen smell (gag). Also, everything makes my stupid eyes burn. Also, I am an oily gal and a sweaty gal -- very accustomed to sunscreen sliding down my face in a slippery sweaty mess and landing in my eyes and mouth making me want to absolutely scream and throw things. On top of this, I am VERY fair skinned (freckles, burn easily, never tan) so sunscreen is a must despite how much I despise it. Lately I’ve been applying this stick to my whole face and neck except for my eyelids to avoid irritation. The trick to prevent oiliness is that I do NOT use a moisturizer unless I’m pretty dry that day. I let the Shiseido stick sunscreen dry for a few minutes on my skin, then I apply Colorescience brush-on SPF on top, which provides a mattifying/powdering effect as well as providing more physical SPF. This totally takes away the mild oiliness I get from this stick. I reapply both periodically throughout the day. No stinging eyes, no weird smell, no stickiness! Perfect combo. This stick is worth the money and I will buy it again and again. I also like to use it to reapply directly to my tattoos. Yes, Buy This
