Thanks Estee and Influenster for sending me this in exchange for my honest review. This moisturizer is amazing enjoyed using till the last drop. This made my skin feel hydrated and soft like silk. The fragrance is beautiful and it’s so fast absorbing while still feeling very hydrated. I will buy again it’s amazing!!! The only reason I could see someone not liking it is if you don’t like fragrance in skincare. I could see this working for all skin types and the price is good considering a little goes a long way. nan
