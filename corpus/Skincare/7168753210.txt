I bought this in a self indulgent moment, and it is worth it! I use a scant 2 pumps over Bobbi Brown Vitamin Enriched Face Base. If it’s a big day, maybe a Trinny London or Bare Minerals sheer foundation will go over the whole thing-but that’s rare. My skin looks fresh and even, and feels good all day. Brown/brown fair and 55 years old. This will be a permanent addition to my routine :) Two Pump Wonder
