I received this product for free for a honest review. I really enjoyed the cooling effect this product had and it felt nice going on. I wonâ€™t be replacing it with my normal eye cream but it does work nicely as a refresher through the day. My only issue was it felt weird after applying it for a little while after but the feeling goes away after abit. nan
