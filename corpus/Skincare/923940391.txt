I received the Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Cream from Influenster,Sephora and Estée Lauder in exchange of my honest review. I have oily skin and I’m in my 40s. My biggest skin concerns are wrinkles and dark spots. I regularly use a moisturizer in my daily skincare regimen. I received a sample size of the Estée Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Cream and it was enough for two weeks of using nightly.  It has a light floral scent which I really like. The cream absorbed quickly and did not feel too thick. My skin felt soft and looked hydrated and radiance after using the cream.  This is a product I definitely recommend and will purchase in full size. Good for tired looking skin
