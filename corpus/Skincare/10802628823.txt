I love everything I have used from Tata Harper, and this resurfacing mask is no exception. The packaging is beautiful, and although the jar seems small at 1 oz, a little goes a long way. It smells fresh, which makes sense given its a clean, vegan product that uses natural ingredients. I am an experienced with using acids in my skincare routine, and I didnâ€™t have any discomfort from this product. After just one use, my skin was smoother, softer, and brighter! I received this complimentary from Tata Harper. nan
