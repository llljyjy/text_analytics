I like it so far! I put it on last night and I have a nice glow on my legs today. It’s easy to put on. I wasn’t shy with the amount I put on, so that I ensured I covered everything. It smells nice when you put it on but does start to smell like typical self tanner when it starts developing. I didn’t have any issues with it looking streaky. Nice glow!
