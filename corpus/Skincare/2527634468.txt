I initially tried out this cleanser as a sample and purchased it immediately after noticing a difference in my skin. I have been using it for 6 months now and it is by far my favourite cleanser. It does an amazing job at cleansing the skin and removing makeup without it stripping the skin. I have combination, acne prone skin and this cleanser does not aggravate any blemishes or dry spots. It is very gentle and has overall improved the appearances of my skin. Favourite cleanser!
