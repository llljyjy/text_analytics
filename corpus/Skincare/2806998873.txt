I’ve been loving this sunscreen! I have super sensitive skin however this Get Even Sun Milk Sunscreen causes no irritation. It leaves a beautiful radiance to the skin and can be either worn alone or under makeup. It’s not sticky and does not leave a white-cast on the skin. It’s a super lightweight, thin serum like formula. I love it! Gifted by Josia Maran. nan
