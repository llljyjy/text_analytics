I am 54 years old with combination skin. I do need a good moisturizer. Confidence in a Cream is great. I have noticed plumping and line reduction.  I also live in a hot, dry climate. When it gets very hot the cream feels too thick. I would purchase again, but for winter use when my skin is more dry. Great if you need a heavier moisturizer
