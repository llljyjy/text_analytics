ok, I took my time using this product to really see its potential and I can honestly say it has made a huge difference! I’m a first time new mom and sleep is a thing of the past, even with how tired I feel, my skin doesn’t look it! Obviously it’s not magic and I still have some lines like normal, but it has made enough difference to be noticeable. The smell is pleasant and so is the feeling of it on my skin after it dries. it doesn’t dry sticky which I appreciate. overall I would definitely recommend this nan
