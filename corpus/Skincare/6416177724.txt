This worked better than the Sunday Riley retinoid I was using prior. Although not super strong, I used this for over 6 months and I noticed smoother skin, softening of light forehead fine lines and no irritation. For the price itâ€™s amazing. I recently started Tret and it works amazing as a buffer to ease into using tretinoin regularly. I alternate the two until my skin gets used to it and I still get the retinoid benefits with less irritation. Love it Best low cost retinoid
