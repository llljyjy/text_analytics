First of all, estèe lauder tests their products on animals which I am morally against. So there is no way I would buy this, even if I did like it. It is a super heavy, thick cream consistency, which some may like (like my mom), but really isn’t for me. But it was really the smell that got me. It smells like perfume, like a rich, old-lady perfume. And I am not a fan. I’m not a fan of fave skincare being scented at all, but this is definitely an acquired taste. And it’s so damn strong. The first time I put it on my skin, I thought immediately that it would break me out. To it’s credit, it didn’t. At first. My face got a bit warm, and then turned red after applying it. A few days later and I had a few extra areas with acne (I am acne prone so it’s not too shocking). This is definitely not for those of us with sensitive skin. Not sure who it works for, except maybe Cruela or someone with more money than brains. Sorry to be so negative, but that is my opinion. Please choose innocent animals over this ridiculous stinky cream. Nope
