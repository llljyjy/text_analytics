I just couldn’t get into the product. For me it was way too oily after applying and since I have oily skin this just caused me to break out. I think this would be best for those who have drier skin and don’t mind a shinier dewy look after applying. There is no strong scent to this so great for those that are sensitive. Not great for oily skin
