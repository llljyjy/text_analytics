I really like this sunscreen!! I used way too much the first time though and it super irritated my eyes so obviously you want to use enough for maximum protection but definitely be careful around the eyes if you are sensitive. Also, it will pill if you use too much but since I’ve been using it on a regular basis, I’ve found that with the right amount there’s no pilling or irritation. I was also amazed to see skincare benefits from this. After washing this off at the end of the day I feel like my skin is brighter and clearer looking! Love it!
