I had used the Schick Hydro Silk Touch-Up razors before and they would nick my face and was barely able to get much hair at all with it (which left me with a pretty sour view of at-home facial razors).  However, I bought this little beauty because I was short on time before an event and it DELIVERED.  My skin felt so super smooth afterward, the amount peach fuzz that came off was unreal, and my makeup went on easily.  I did nick my face a slight bit, but not too bad so hopefully that will come with practice, but overall so good. Game Changer
