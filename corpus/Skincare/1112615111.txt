Im on my second bottle and thats rare for me. I was sold this item in the fall for my very upset skin. I had peeling, acne, lots of redness, and enlarged pores. I though this was just my new skin since turning 40. The sales rep at Sephora suggested this product along with an Origins moisturizer and within a few weeks I noticed a huge difference. It has taken time for my skin to heal but this product never burned and seemed to hydrate and soothe my sensitive skin immediately. I truly think this was a game changer. I have now bought bottles for my daughters and will not stop using this. I have combination skin and I use retinol for my aging and benzoyl peroxide for my acne. I also find Vit C inflames my skin and exasperated my acne. I have a history of having sensitive skin and am breakout prone. I love this product. Miracle worker
