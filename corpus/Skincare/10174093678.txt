I really liked this product. It has a very light lemony smell, very energizing. It has a nice consistency, not too thick or runny. I love a moisturizer that also has anti-aging science mixed in. After using it for two weeks, I have noticed the lines around my eyes seem a little less noticeable. I would definitely recommend this item, it could become my new go to moisturizer. Confidence is key!
