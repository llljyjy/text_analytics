I used to love this product, and I still like it as a serum, but I HATE what they’ve done to the packaging. I don’t want to do a science experiment where I try to correctly blend my own product. For this price, I can’t afford to spill it or not get it fully blended - which is hard to do. Not to mention that the orange twist cap to the bottle has broken on both of the last 2 bottles I have purchased. I really like the benefits of this product, and it doesn’t bother my sensitive skin, but if they don’t start blending it themselves again, I will find a replacement. No More DIY Projects!!
