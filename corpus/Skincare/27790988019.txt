I am always looking for acne spot treatments that work well in those flare ups or “emergencies“.  I like the pump dispenser on this Dr. Zenovia spot treatment as it lets you use just a little bit (as you don’t want to use too much for the price). It was just an average product to clear up my redness and flare ups.  I can’t say it was anything great or a miracle product, but it did help with the intensity of the redness. nan
