Bought the big size, as I love ceramides in general for moisturizers. This had a lot of hype at the time. It’s just okay- I used it all, and it did last me a long time as a little goes a long way. However, it wasn’t amazing, and for the price, that’s a disappointing result. Feel on skin is a bit greasy, and it didn’t provide my dry-combo skin with the hydration it really needs. Smell is a bit fragrance-y. I might buy a mini again at some point, but not the jumbo. The Naturium Plant-Based Ceramide Cream is much better. Just okay- overpriced
