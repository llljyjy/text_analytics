I LOVE this product. I use this as a precleanse at night to remove my makeup from the day. It feels so silky and luxurious and removes my makeup, including my eye makeup with no trouble. I love the smell and look forward to using this product, it is a perfect way to start my nighttime routine. The small tool they provide to scoop out the balm is perfect so you get just the right amount every time.I have read other reviews where people feel like they have an oily residue, but I cannot disagree more, I rinse with warm water and my skin feels hydrated, clean and soft and I follow this with the Farmacy Whipped Greens Cleanser. I am still searching for the perfect toner but top my routine off with a Drunk Elephant nighttime serum and wake up in the morning with hydrated, fresh, glowing skin. I will continue to buy this product! Must have in my routine!
