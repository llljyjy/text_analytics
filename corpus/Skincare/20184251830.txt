VERY disappointed. I didn’t realize this had zinc in it. That was my bad, but when I realized it I figured I would try it out since I had heard such good things about this brand. I did the application in patches to try and avoid the white cast. It did NOT work. I am very fair and even with that the white cast was real. Really gave it quite a while to sink in and absorb before applying makeup, and sadly it could not do it. My makeup applied patchy and I felt sooooo greasy like there was a thick layer of gunk in my face. In my lunch break I went home and washed it ALL off and applied my go to la roche posay ultra light 60 spf because I couldn’t even get through a whole day I felt so gross. On another hand the sunscreen stick from shizeido is amazing and I recommend it to everyone! The white cast is REAL
