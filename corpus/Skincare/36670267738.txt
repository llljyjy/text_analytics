I would definitely recommend this exfoliating cleanser. Not only does it get rid of all the dead skin, grime, and dirt off my face. It also leaves my face feeling minty, refreshed, and tingly. Another thing I love about this product is that I can pair it with their foaming cleanser and it leaves my face elastic and firm. You should definitely invest in this product trust me itâ€™s worth it!!! AMAZING PRODUCT
