I received this eye cream from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review. This cream feels really nice going on the eyes and absorbs quickly. I used it for about two weeks but didn’t not any immediate improvements during use or throughout the two weeks. In fact it caused little pimples under my eyes and I had to stop using. As soon as I stopped using they went away. I’m sure it would work for someone else but just isn’t the right cream for me. Not for me.
