Loving my Canopy! I love how stylish and compact it is. It doesnâ€™t take up a ton of space, so its easy to use in any room. I personally love the essential oil stone and use extra oil to fill the room up. I put it in my office because I find the scent and sound so relaxing while I work. I have found that I am not applying lotion throughout the day  because my hands and face are not as dry as they used to be. Stylish & Functional!
