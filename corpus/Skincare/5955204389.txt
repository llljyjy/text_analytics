I received a free sample for 7 days of the Clarins Double Serum from #Butterly in exchange for my honest review and opinion. I found the smell of the serum to be a little overpowering but it does subside after a few minutes. I deal with combination skin and I found the serum to be a little too greasy for my face. The serum took longer than other serums to absorb into my face and made my face look very shiny. Not sure it is a product for me but might work well for others. Not Suited For My Face Type
