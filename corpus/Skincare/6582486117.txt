i have combination skin, specifically i’m EXTREMELY oily in my r zone so i prefer that my moisturizers (or most things go on my face) are matte. Gel moisturizers are weird since they promise to be matte but their texture alone leaves a shiny sheen which i hate, but this moisturizer is IT.since it has niacinimide + is matte, it’s the only thing i’ll use in the morning along with sunscreen and i love that it combines an active product to make me less oily with moisturizer! ALSO THIS PUMP >>>. this is the only way face moisturizer should come in. it’s so easy to use one handed and makes my morning routine fast and easy. essential for combo+oily skin gals
