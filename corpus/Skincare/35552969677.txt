I received the Goop product complimentary from Influenster. Let me start of by saying I normal do not use facial scrubs because my face is sensitive at times. It burn a bit on the beginning however, after 10 minutes my skin was not red anymore. The smell is ok, light fruity smallish. It did leave my face soft and smooth. Smooth finish
