I received this as a sample from Influenster. Got into a fight about it since it wasn’t labeled as usual lol. I was scared of getting this product because I had a allergic  reaction to the face wash and hated the smell. I liked how I didn’t notice a smell. Easy to use pump gel felt nice on fingers. When I put it on it burned a lot and I was scared but it went away pretty quick. My skin does feel smooth after use and my skin looks cleaner. nan
