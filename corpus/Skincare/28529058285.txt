I’m absolutely loving this super lightweight Kiehl’s Super Multi-Corrective Anti-Aging Eye Cream. I love that it’s gentle on my sensitive skin and absorbs quickly. This doesn’t leave a greasy residue or feel sticky or tacky. I’ve noticed my eye area looks smoother and less puffy. Its anti-aging ingredients, collagen, peptide and niacinamide are great to improve fine lines, dark circle and under eye bags. I can’t wait to see how my continued results will look with this product. I also appreciate that this is fragrance free. A little bit goes a long way too. Dark cricles? Not anymore!
