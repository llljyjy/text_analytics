I am a medium skin tone with combination skin and been using this product for 8 days. It has a nice light lovely scent. I have had no hormonal breakouts and my pores feel tighter. I use this every night after cleansing my face along with the three piece kit that came with it. After the first night, I noticed a slight difference. My skin is clearer, brighter and pores look  smaller. it’s also helped get rid of some very small fine lines.With continued usage I am hoping to see improvement in the deeper lines. I wake up with brighter, smoother skin that looks more refined eliminating the dull tired looking skin I usually have. The JLO serum is lightweight, smooth and easy to apply. It’s not greasy and a thin layer is all you need. Use it following your beauty routine at night. I wake up with fresh hydrated and rejuvenated skin. Hydrates and leaves skin glowing
