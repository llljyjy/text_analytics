My first wasnâ€™t great. I washed and moisturized my face and applied the correcting cream like the video. It looked excessive and highlighted tiny wrinkles - making me look older. So I dabbed my face with a tissue and continued on with my day. However, throughout the day, I noticed that my skin and face looked really good. So, I exfoliated and did all the girly cleaning and gave it another try using a sponge and dabbing first my difficult areas then blending with the rest... Love it!!! OMG, a world of difference. Not only did it cover the red and dark spots, but it also levelled quickly and matched my skin tone perfectly. Love it!! definite keeper!! Took a second try, but I love it!!
