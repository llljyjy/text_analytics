After using this creamy lotion-like cleanser for 2 weeks I noticed that the dry  and rough areas are smoother , softer, and  more moisturized , while my entire face is impeccably clean.  Initially I missed the sudsy, bubbly feeling that I generally look for in a cleanser, however it still did the job. Great Cleanser for Winter Combo Skin
