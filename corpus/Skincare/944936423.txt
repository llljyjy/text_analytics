Product is fine, dispenser is terrible (which seems to be an issue with Herbivore). There is still product, but it wonâ€™t pump out because the tube is too short and the product is too thick to pour it out. This stuff is too expensive to waste 1/3 of the bottle. I will not buy again for that reason. nan
