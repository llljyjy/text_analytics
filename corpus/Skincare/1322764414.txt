I change serums often because there are so many on the market so why not switch it up! This serum was just okay for me. I didn’t see any difference in my skin after using an entire bottle of this but my skin also didn’t look worse so I guess it works? 3 stars because of the odd smell but I do like the little shimmer! Smells weird and not sure it works
