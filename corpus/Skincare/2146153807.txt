This goes on a little heavy, so I apply in the morning and then let it rest for about 15 minutes while I do my hair and get dressed, THEN apply moisturizer and makeup. After it’s been on my skin for that little “waiting period’, it feels really soft and healthy, and the coverage still feels good. I think this might be a little bit *too* heavy for acne-prone skin, but if that’s not a concern, I think it feels very rich and healthy and protective. One star off because while the wait is worth it to me, it is certainly slightly inconvenient when I’m in a hurry. Leaves my skin soft and glowy!
