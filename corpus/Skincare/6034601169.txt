I’m normally not one to bother with a toner as I think they’re usually a bit of a pointless skincare step, however this one is the exception. This stuff is super hydrating and calming, and I’ve used it many times when I’ve gone overboard with exfoliation or retinol and my skin has felt red and sore. It’s always made a noticeable difference! I use it decanted into a small spray bottle and have a spritz each morning at the start of my routine and any other time my skin needs some extra TLC. Also amazing to take on flights when your skin gets extra dry and gross! Great toner for non toner people!
