I received this from Merit to try out, I’m a big skincare junkie, 32 years old with very minimal fine lines but I do have dull and dry skin. This serum was very different. I really like the duo phase formula, and how it spreads out when you apply. I love the caffeine in this, and I feel like it’s made my skin more hydrated. I’ve been using it day and night and so far it has been great. No breeskouts or anything or that sort. I am truly loving this
