I love these wipes. They really helped me clean out my pores. After I use this product, my face feels rejuvenated. I am a huge skinfix believer and this is one of the products that I will always swear by. I also like how the AHA/BHA is in the pads already. Many other products just come as a liquid. This is way more convenient. One thing I would change is to have the wipes a bit more wet. Worth the money!
