I received this product for free to test out! Let’s start off with the positives, this is a creamy eye balm that do leave the under eye area super smooth, plump, and hydrated all day long. I also loved this for my smile lines as well it didn’t quite take them away but made them look less harsh cause it really moisturized them. The only reason that this gets a 3 star rating from me is that it burns my eyes. I don’t know why, I’ve read where other people had the same issue. It happened every single time I used it. I kept using it because I liked how it left my under eyes but I had to eventually stop cause It began to hurt too much. Id only use a small dime amount and it still would burn my eyes. Idk If I could recommend this, I loved the results just hated the burning effect. Will continue to use this on my smile lines though. hydrating but irritating…
