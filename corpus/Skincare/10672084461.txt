So, like some others had said, this burned my face the first time I used it on freshly washed skin. That’s because I have sensitive skin and I just went for it (which I shouldn’t have, but I needed to know what the hype was). After burning my face only a couple times (lol!) my face adapted and the benefits started to glowwwwww. My grandparents asked me if I was pregnant because after using this spray, I used the protini resurfacing serum and then a little of my foundation and that was the $$$$$$$$$ (moneyyyyy!). My skin looked so flipping good. I sprayed this again ontop of my foundation as a “setting“ spray and it was just insane how dewy my skin looked. Don’t be discouraged. You are literally spraying beer and kombucha on your face, it’s going to freak out a little. Ease into it and you won’t be dissapointed. My grandma (82) and my mom (57) purchased this after using it on their faces. Don't be discouraged! This is AMAZING
