I used to use this product years ago and I don’t remember why I stopped so when I saw there was a new formula I was excited to try it. It’s still as good as it was, maybe even better. I use it in the morning as an eye cream/under eye primer. It helps to brighten and moisturize my under eyes. My concealer went on nicely and didn’t cling on to any dry spots. Will get again!! nan
