Honestly the coconut lip balm is pretty decent! Ingredients are not bad and it does the job. All the other flavors are a HARD PASS just look at the nasty ingredients, literally plastic (polyethylene) is an ingredient! Seeing how we actually ingest a fair amount of lip products by virtue of them going on our actual mouths itâ€™s worth being a bit careful. So all those are a big fat no but the coconut is alright! coconut is ok but the rest are repulsive
