I Absolutely Love Love love this moisturizer!!! It should be called “Miracle Cream“!!! I wish people would put their age in their reviews. I am soon to be 60 and I purchased the small Secret Sauce. I put it on right away and it made my face soft as silk. It took the dullness away immediately! I haven’t used it long enough to say if it helps with fine lines or not. All I can say is I will Absolutely be buying the bigger jar!! I have probably spent thousands on face creams but this stuff right here is “The One“!!! This is the face cream I’ll be buying forever!!! It is just amazing!! Your face almost glows. I definitely recommend this product!! I rate it a 10 and a half!!! Love it!! Miracle Face Cream
