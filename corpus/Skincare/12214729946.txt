On the positive side it was hydrating on my dry skin  but that was about it. It didn’t really help my dark circle’s, I didn’t notice much of a difference.  I don’t really have that many eye wrinkles so I couldn’t say if it helped make them less noticeable either. My concealer also didn’t really last longer when applying this cream. On the plus side it didn’t irritate my skin and it did feel fresh on. It was ok
