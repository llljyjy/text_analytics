My skin type combinated sensitive , area around the eye gets kinda dark and dull sometimes. Texture of the eye creme is as if you make banana smoothie so creamy and rich yelowish .. has no scent . After applying it has slightly cooling effect for 60 seconds. I never used Vitamin C enriched skincare before and decided that banana eye bright creme just what I needed  , especially since it been part of the promotion from the Influenster app! After applying area around the eye feels fresh and lighter giving me a look like a slept for 10 hours . Good absorbency . Could be used with no problems as moisturizer and or a base for concealer. I love love love the new formula ! Worth a try
