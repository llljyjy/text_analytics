Skin is hydrated and glowing!!! At first, I wasn’t sure if I “needed” this product in my routine, but I FaceTimed with a friend I hadn’t seen in a while who said “you look great, what did you do to your face?!” and I knew it was a must have (it’s the only thing I’ve added recently) I have combo, acne-prone skin that is very sensitive to new products - no breakouts using this! Definitely recommend :) nan
