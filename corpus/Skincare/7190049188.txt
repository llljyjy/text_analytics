My skin has not liked other vitamin C products I have used in the past, this one however is great for my sensitive skin, and I have seen a difference on my dark spots on my chin. I do not use it daily as I am still a little scared of how my skin will react, but I am working up to it. Right now just 2 times a week, then starting 3 this week. I love the way this is absorbed right up on my skin. Great for sensitive skin :)
