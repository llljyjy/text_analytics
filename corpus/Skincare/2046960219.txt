I love and have great results from using the SOS spray and was excited to add this to my routine when I have a little more problematic skin. I like the thin texture but I donâ€™t like how it dries down and makes my skin feel super dehydrated. I also feel like I lose a lot of the product on my hands/fingers because it is so thin and dries very fast. It does work and has a slight pool water smell (initially, the smell goes away after it dries down). Considering this is 2oz, I wish the price was a little less, just because I feel like I need like 4-5 pumps to really make sure my face is covered. This does work and I can see myself repurchasing to have when I have more problematic skin. Works-Very Thin Texture
