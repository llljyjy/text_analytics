I bought this when I was having awful hormonal acne as a last ditch effort to help improve my skin, and while in the beginning it def did dry my skin out and I flaked severely, the end result only a good 4/5 days later was worth it. My skin is smooth and free of acne. I’ve always had a red face (according to dermatologists I’ve seen in the past it’s not rosacea lol even tho I’m skeptical about that diagnosis) so I don’t expect that to go away but when it has come to the acne that has plagued me for most my life this really did help out in getting it under control. The period where it dried me out did suck but I used first aid’s moisturizer to help negate the dryness. This is def gonna be a major part of my skin care routine when I have cystic or hormonal acne.
