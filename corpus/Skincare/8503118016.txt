I’ve tried so many cleansing balms. Elemis, Drunk Elephant, Clinique, Pharmacy, and more. I LOVED the Green Clean, it was my favorite, but I picked this gem up to give it a try and I’m so glad I did. This balm is amazing. Like all balms, it does make your eyes a bit cloudy, but this one has less of that and the fog is gone in less than a minute. It removes my waterproof eye makeup better than any other. Once I finish my Green Clean I will be picking this one up again. Highly recommend. The BEST cleansing balm
