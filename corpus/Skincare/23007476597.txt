I had read reviews about the previous formulation and avoided trying it, but this new version is great. The texture is light and watery, and my skin looks clear and glowy the next morning. I was nervous that it would be a little too much with my current routine of using retinol around 4 nights per week, but I havenâ€™t experienced any irritation or dryness yet. I do experience some flushing immediately after applying, but when I wake up my skin looks great. Clear, glowy skin
