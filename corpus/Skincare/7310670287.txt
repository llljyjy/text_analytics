I bought this to use along with the facial spray, and I’m very disappointed. The bottle and the pump are so poorly made that I don’t even want to use the serum, which seems to be working so far. The serum is pretty mild and water based, when you pump the serum onto your fingers or face is sprays all over and makes a mess. Would buy again if the design improves otherwise it’s not worth it. Terrible bottle design
