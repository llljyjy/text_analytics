I’m a big fan of DDG since the invention of the peel pads! Summer time skincare can be a little hard to come across , since most products tend to leave your skin shiny, greasy and can lead to breakouts. I LOVE the dewy deep cream for it’s almost gel like texture and softness it leaves behind. A little goes a long way and the product glides beautifully on the skin. Niacinamide and my skin are meant for each other because this ingredient truly transforms your skin!! After just one week of use my skin looked healthier and Glowy !! nan
