This is really nice I honestly had no expectations since they’re new and there are so many celebrity beauty lines but this feels really nice on your skin. It’s definitely a heavier moisturizer for sure- something to wear overnight really let it soak. Its lightly fragranced so it feels really refreshing it doesn’t feel sticky or heavy on the skin just really feels soft. Definitely excited to use this more in my nighttime routine seems like really gentle ingredients. *gifted by the outset Pleasantly surprised
