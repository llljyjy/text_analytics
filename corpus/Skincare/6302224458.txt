I never write reviews but this product broke me out so badly. Granted, I do have sensitive skin. But I returned this and I have been breaking out for at least 1-2 weeks after this product. I haven’t had a breakout in about 2 years until using this product! :/ it did remove my makeup though without burning my eyes! Caused breakouts that won’t go away
