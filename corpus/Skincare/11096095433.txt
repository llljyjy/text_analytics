I breakout easily with moisturizer so I have to be weary on what i use to prep my skin. I started using this product a year ago before applying my makeup and it makes such a difference. I wash my face with an organic cleanser and apply the serum. It helps my makeup go on much more smoother. I made the mistake of testing other products and stopped using this for about 2 months. The other products I used clogged my pores and caused breakouts. This is definitely worth the price. Great for Acne Prone skin
