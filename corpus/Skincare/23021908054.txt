this product was gifted by sulwhasoo & was quite surprising! itâ€™s an orangey color and has a slight scent to it. i used it before applying toner in my skincare routine, and i really think it helped my skin feel more supple and moisturized. it helped my skin absorb the following products i used after better and my skin did not feel dry all day, when it usually does. the texture of the serum itself is really lightweight too and spreads easily across the skin. good product!
