This cream is more than what I expected. I thought that because it was thicker than most moisturizers I use, I wouldnâ€™t like it and it would be TOO thick. But with this cold weather, my skin has been so dry, and the wind puts welps on my face when I go outside. This cream actually prevented that! And it keeps my skin very moisturized. I would definitely recommend this product to those who struggle with dry skin in the wintertime. Love it!
