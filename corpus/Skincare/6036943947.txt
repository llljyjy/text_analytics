DO NOT RECOMMEND THESE!! My face turns flush and burns after use. The rose scent is way too heavy, and lingers. Didn’t even remove eye liner or mascara well - photo is as good as I could get it off with literally scrubbing, and it wasn’t even waterproof makeup. Waste of money, and now my face feels like it’s burning :( nan
