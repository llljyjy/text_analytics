This stuff works really well. I have normal/oily skin and have started getting deep set wrinkles between my brows and my forehead. It works! I really regret not getting more before I moved overseas because itâ€™s been 3 months without it and my wrinkles are back. Just ordered more and will make sure my beauty routine is always stocked with this bottle. Works great for my 40 yr old skin
