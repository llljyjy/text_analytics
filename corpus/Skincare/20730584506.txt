I could not believe the change this Fenty Pre-Show Glow Instant Retexturizing 10% AHA Treatment has done to my skin within the past couple of weeks! My skin has been out of whack lately because of hormonal changes. I don’t have active breakouts right now but it has left some pretty deep scars on my skin. As you can see from before picture, I had redness going on as well. But within two weeks of using this product (4 times of usage to be exact), my skin had bounced back since! Not only my scars had faded away, my skin itself significantly has been brighter since! The best part of this treatment is it does not irritate my skin whatsoever. It actually feels more like regular face wash whenever I apply it to my face. I also appreciate the small scrubby cloth that this kit comes with, it’s pretty soft and not abrasive at all for exfoliation. My only wish is it had come in a bigger bottle. I’ll definitely will be repurchasing and recommend to my family and friends as well. Dramatic Change in 2 Weeks!
