I first received a sample for my birthday gift in January and quickly fell in love. I’ve been searching for a moisturizer that’s not too thin/not too thick for my sensitive skin. I can sometimes react harshly to niacinamide and I’m allergic to beeswax and bee products so it was a wild ride finally getting to the Tatcha brand. My skin feels more plump, glorious and dewy. I absolutely love this moisturizer! The consistency is perfect and the smell is lovely, IMO not too strong and I just love the way the packaging is. So classy. Made A Believer Out Of Me
