I love this Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Cream- not only is is thick and moisturizing (without being heavy or greasy), it had the most delightful, calming fragrance- maybe lavender?- that is perfect for applying before bed. It soaks right into the skin and feels luxe. A great way to pamper yourself! And I appreciate that Kiehls’s is using 50% post- consumer packaging and Is using renewable energy sources as I like to support environmentally responsible companies. Perfect soothing night cream
