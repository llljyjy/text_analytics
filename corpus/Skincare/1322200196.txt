While I liked the actual sunscreen, I had to return it because the second you take the cap off it just starts bubbling out and you can’t stop it.  I was losing so much product each time I tried to apply it and there isn’t much to begin with!   There is a reason bottles aren’t shaped like this. bottle leaks product every time you open it.
