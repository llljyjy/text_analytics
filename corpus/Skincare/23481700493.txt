So I’ve tried a lot of acne cleansers (who hasn’t?), and I was skeptical. I have always had mild but persistent acne, including whiteheads, blackheads, and papules, and Skinfix has actually started making it feel softer and smoother from just a few days of use. TBD on how impactful it is at preventing, but I definitely feel it’s treating my skin effectively without being too harsh. Definitely recommend! nan
