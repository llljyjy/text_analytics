Over the years, I have continuously bought this serum. I first found out about it via a YouTube review and decided to give it a try. The texture on the skin feels so refreshing and makes my skin feel “bouncy“, unlike any serum Ive tried. Its such a unique texture that I love. The smell is lightly of orange. I find it works really well on my dry skin under makeup and helps with dry patches. The most important and key aspect is that it actually keeps my acne away. When I dont use this, I immediately go back to having terrible painful breakouts on my chin. I have spent hundreds on various skin care, but I truly think this is a must have and a true gem. So thankful for this product and will continue to use for years to come! The Only Serum That Works For Me
