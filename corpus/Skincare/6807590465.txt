since receiving the product, i have incorporated it into my routine daily. it’s been about 3 weeks since i’ve been using it and i can’t tell if i enjoy it or not. i had some texture appear and one painful pimple which i never usually get. i’m assuming this is the purging process but if it continues i will stop using the product. aside from that, the texture of the toner is light-weight gel consistency. i use a cotton pad instead of hands so i use a little more product because it seems to absorb in the pad. overall, the product isn’t bad but i’m not sure about the effectiveness. not sure how i feel 🤷🏽‍♀️
