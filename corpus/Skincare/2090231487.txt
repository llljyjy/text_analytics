I was very happy to receive this product for free from Influenster. I’ve never tried TULA skin care products before so I was a little bit nervous to try this but I had read only good reviews. My skin tends to be a little bit on the dry side so I felt as though I didn’t need to use a full pad every morning and every night so I cut them into halves and use them every other night. It seems to have calmed down my random breakouts but it definitely has dried out my skin a little bit so I am taking a break for now. I think this will be of great use to me for the summer when my skin tends to be a bit more on the oily side. powerful
