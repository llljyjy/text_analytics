I use this mostly in the winter time when my face is feeling crusty and dry. I think it’s great for hydrating and giving your skin a nice glow especially if you’re doing minimal makeup. I wouldn’t recommend this for oily skin types because it can make you look more oily. However I find that for me, it does look oily but dries down afterwards. I also like this for foundation as it glides on smoothly. nan
