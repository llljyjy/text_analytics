One of my least favourite cleansers. Very waxy, drags at the skin as you apply, takes lots of rubbing to actually remove makeup and also to get this stuff back off your face. Much better stuff out there for this price point, TO Squalane cleanser and Pondâ€™s Cold Cream spring to mind. Not worth the $
