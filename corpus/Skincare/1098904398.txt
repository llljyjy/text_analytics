I’ve been using these and the sturm line for about 2 years and my skin has never looked better or been more under control. I am combo but def lean toward oily and some redness. The ingredients are worth the splurge and quite frankly if you’re gonna leave crap reviews because ur upset you couldn’t afford it in the first place you shouldn’t be knocking a product that works. Amazing
