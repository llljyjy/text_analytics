I purchased the mini version of this product in store and was happy with it so I decided to order the full size online and was confused when I used the full size for the first time. The mini I had originally purchased wasn’t grainy at all, however, the full size has what feels like thick exfoliating beads which I don’t like at all. I tried shaking the bottle up and rubbing it together very well in my hands- neither of which seemed to dissolve the beads. Then I thought maybe the opening to the mini sized bottle just wasn’t thick enough to get the beads out so I cut it open to see if that was the problem and it didn’t have any beads in it. I did however noticed I had a ton of the cleanser left in the mini bottle but due to the way the bottle was made there was no way to get it all out without cutting it open. I really liked the product in the mini bottle (which is why I’m still giving 4 stars) but I am disappointed in the texture inside the full sized bottle and am scared to purchase another and have the same result. Hopefully this was just a one time bad batch. But as far as an honest review on the mini sized bottle: it removes make up very well but does leave a very thick, oily residue. However, I use it as the first step in a double cleanse so my 2nd face wash removes the residue so I don’t mind it. I wouldn’t use it as my sole face cleanser due to the residue though.
