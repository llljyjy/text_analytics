I received this complimentary from Topbox to try and fell in love! I am a big fan of Laneige products to begin with but sometimes retinols don’t agree with my skin. I wouldn’t say I have sensitive skin necessarily but it gets red easily and alternates between oily and super dry. I loved this retinol around my crows feet, smile lines and forehead. It was a moisturizer type cream that sunk in quickly without drying out my skin. It felt nice and hydrated after using. I am still increasing the amount through the recommended schedule and it is working great. I am already seeing a very big decrease in the definition of my wrinkles especially around my eyes. It has a typical cream scent and the narrow tip helps to get precise application. You get half an oz which is a great size for the small amount you use. Overall, I can’t find one bad thing to say about this product! #freeproduct Excellent addition to the Laneige line!
