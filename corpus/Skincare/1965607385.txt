I received this cream as a complimentary sample in exchange for my honest review. My skin type is mostly dry with just a tad bit of oil around my nose. I often feel as tho my skin is dry or rough feeling and seek out formulas that are very hydrating that make my skin feel softer, more supple, plump, replenished and radiant. I also have concerns with fine lines. I find good hydration really helps minimize the appearance of my fine lines as well as products with anti-aging benefits too. I use a moisturizer both day and night. I prefer a day cream with spf and night cream obviously without spf. Immediately after using this moisturizer, I found my skin felt more comfortable and appear more radiant. In the morning my skin appeared hydrated and supple. I truly believe this cream improved the appearance and feel of my skin as I continued using it. I feel it improved the integrity and strength of my skin leaving my skin looking more radiant,  youthful, and plumped than prior to using. I also found the very sublt scent to be pleasing. It reminded me of Shea butter. It smelled lovely without being overly scented or very noticeably fragrant. It was a very subtle scent. I am very pleased with it and would highly recommend it to friends or family. I was very impressed. Highly recommend this cream
