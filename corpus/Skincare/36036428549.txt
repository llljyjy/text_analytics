I like it! It’s not a crazy life changing mineral sunscreen, but it protects my skin and helps even out my redness. It’s comfortable to wear throughout the day, though by the end of the day, my skin has been feeling drier than normal. I like that it doesn’t have a heavy makeup or mineral smell and goes on rather smoothly. It takes a little bit of working into the skin to avoid having little patches of darker tint here and there — mostly, though, this is because I have patches of dry skin. Overall, a good mineral tinted sunscreen. Good mineral tinted sunscreen
