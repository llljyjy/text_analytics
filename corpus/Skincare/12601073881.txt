I bought this product when I ran out of Sunday Riley’s Tidal and realized that Tidal is not being stocked anywhere anymore. This product looks a lot like Tidal (that kind of light green/teal color), and feels lighter than the Tidal cream. Within a few days, I noticed improvement in areas of dullness as well as pigmentation. Be aware, though, that this is not as strong a *moisturizer* as Tidal was, so either use a little more to hydrate drier skin, or use in combination with a stronger moisturizer. The lightness of this formula works well for my finicky skin, so I use it once a day with a stronger moisturizer another time. I’ve been very happy with my skin since I got this product, so I definitely recommend it to improve dullness and pigmentation in particular. Great replacement for Sunday Riley's Tidal
