Like many of the other reviews, I love the product itself but the package is bad. Product goes on smooth, is light and not greasy, and doesnâ€™t irritate my skin. Package spills easily and the paint flakes very easily. I keep the bottle in my cabinet (never on the go) and I still have the issue with flaking packaging from literally just touching the bottle to apply the product. Again, the product is great but Tatcha *really* needs to redesign this package...the package is completely not acceptable, especially for a product of this price. Great Product, Bad Package
