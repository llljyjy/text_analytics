I tried this product for a few weeks, semi-consistently (it’s hard to maintain a skincare routine every single day as a mom). It’s not super irritating on my skin and absorbs rather nicely. As a girl with oily skin, I have rather large pores around my nose and I was hoping this would help clear out that area and retexturize. While it didn’t help there, my skin does feel more supple and appears a little brighter. I may need to use it longer but first month results were ok. Nothing drastic or amazing. Decent, but not as effective as I'd like
