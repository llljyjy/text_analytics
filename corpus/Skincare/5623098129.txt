This is such a good serum!! It’s not a miracle solution but it’s really good for what it is. You only need a little bit since it is an oily formula, and I usually mix it with my moisturizer at night as well to offset the texture. My acne has been really cystic and deep from wearing medical masks but I’ve been getting less since I started adding this to my regimen. It’s taken a few weeks, but my skin is noticeably softer and smoother to the point where people have commented on it. Definitely great for adding hydration and getting rid of deep acne! Hydrating and helped with cystic acne!
