This stuff is magic in a bottle, my skin absolutely loves it!  Yes, it does have a distinctive aroma.  It’s like a combination of herbal and medicinal, but I really enjoy it.  If you are worried about the scent just smell it in-store before you buy it.  It has never left my face feeling sticky and I wonder, for the people who did experience that, if they were putting too much on.  I don’t know, but it has always sunk in beautifully for me.  My skin looks so alive and fresh when I use this.  My only complaint is that it’s in a glass bottle. It’s so weird to me that Kiehl’s would decide to put something you have to shake in glass.  I have broken a bottle, and cut myself when it slipped out of my hand.  I am not taking a star off for that though because the product is so wonderful.  I just had to find another bottle to decant it into. nan
