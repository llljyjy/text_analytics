Thanks to Topbox Circle, I was gifted Caudalie’sPremier Cru Anti Aging Cream Moisturizer, complimentary, in exchange for my honest review. The following opinions are 100% authentic and my own. This is such a lovely moisturizer. It’s creamy and rich, with a subtle rose fragrance. Initially, I thought it might be too heavy and thick for my taste in skincare, but Its actually surprisingly light and airy once applied. It moisturizes very quickly and easily into skin, providing lots of hydration. I apply it as my night time cream, and by morning, my skin is soft, smooth, firm, and my annoying fine lines are visibly diminished. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Caudalie Premier Cru Anti Aging Cream Moisturizer
