I bought this when they had the sample size and lip balm duo. At first I was using it straight out of the bottle and I didn’t love it. Then I read to mix it with a little tap water in your hands before applying it and I got MUCH better results that way. I feel like it’s really helped with redness and the overall feel of my skin. Great product. love it
