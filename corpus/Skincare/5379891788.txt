I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. I used this for a month before reviewing, not just a day or two. I have noticed an improved set of lips I they are not crusty or peeling as much as they used to. The product feels nice and is usually still a little bit there when I wake up in the morning. I dont notice a smell to it. Good moisture
