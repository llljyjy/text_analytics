I thoroughly enjoyed this mask. Sad it’s almost done but happy that I’ll be repurchasing. It does exactly what it’s supposed to do. Exfoliates. The clay does draw out white/blackheads and impurities. Manages somehow to shrinks pores. Everything looks snatched when I wash this off. Then comes a glow like no other. Love everything about this mask. Especially the price point. I will continue to recommend to everyone! Great Job YTTP. Run don’t walk to buy
