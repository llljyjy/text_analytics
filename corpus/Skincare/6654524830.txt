The first thing I noticed about this mask was how fragranced it is. A strong top note of Wildflowers with a back scent of honey, it almost worried me. Very smooth texture, charcoal color with a golden shift to it. I applied a thin but generous layer and waited about 10 moments before washing off, leaving me with  noticeably softer skin. The mask didnâ€™t overdry my skin or make it oily. nan
