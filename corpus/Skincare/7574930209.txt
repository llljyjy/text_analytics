I did receive this product free from Influenster for my review. I love this sunscreen, and has become my new go-to everyday while getting ready. I love the fact that it constrains hyaluronic acid which my dry skin just loves. The dewy look that it leaves after applying is great. I’ve had no issues when it comes to sweating and it burning/stinging my eyes like other sunscreens do. The only complaint that I have is sometimes if I don’t wait long enough for it dry down and put on my makeup, it will pill up. Otherwise, I love this sunscreen! New Go-To Sunscreen!
