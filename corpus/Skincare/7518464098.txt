This is a good product if you want that luxurious skin care routine experience. It makes the skin feel soft and smooth. A little goes a long way with this thick essence. It’s very spreadable and non-sticky. It has a strong fragrance scent, which I thought would be irritating but it didn’t affect my skin or the softness of it while using it, it might affect people with much more sensitive skin though. It produces no real change in the long term, it hydrates while it’s on the skin surface, making it plump for a bit, but after that it goes back to its usual state. nan
