This is my fav moisturizer right now. I’ve tried it all. My skin is combo/dry but mostly feels so dry and dehydrated. I have redness and such sensitive skin and I have to put on like 5 creams to feel hydrated and still don’t. This is SO GOOD!!!!! I can’t believe it’s only $10. I am running low and will be picking up a new one when I run out. I’ve tried the it cosmetics confidence in a cream, rose deep hydration cream, kiehls ultra facial cream, dr jart tiger grass cream, ole henriksen the new one, farmacy honey halo, Tatcha dewy skin cream, laneige water bank, all of these I feel like they don’t hydrate enough but this one is the best. better than $100 creams!!!!
