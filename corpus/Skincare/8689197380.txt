Used this for a few weeks and saw it was starting to work well with evening skin and minimizing pores. Its winter at home and I was using it as a part of my morning routine as I wasnâ€™t getting much sun exposure. I went on vacation and used it as a part of my morning skin routine as normal, and my skin has been bright red and breaking out for the past two weeks from the sun exposure/bha combo and over exfoliating:( hopefully it clears up so I can reintroduce this product at night since I was starting to see results. Watch out for the sun exposure!
