I love this face mask -- I love the heating feeling of the clay when activated. I live in NYC and find that my skin feels clogged/congested with lots of pollutants and this clay mask helps to clean that out and give you a fresh start. I like to use face masks often and will absolutely be adding this one into my rotation! Complimentary from Tatcha NON DRYING CLAY MASK!
