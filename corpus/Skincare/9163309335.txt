I really wanted to like this product, but the formula really disappointed me. After using for a few weeks I felt like it did make a difference in my dark circles, but I couldnâ€™t get over the mica powder in this cream. Once the formula dried, the mica would flake off and get into my eyes. The mica was super irritating and caused so much itching and redness, it really ruined the product for me. If inkey list came out with a night version/reformulated without mica I would be all over this. Sparkly mica irritates eyes
