I have been looking at many lip masks/balms/etc. trying to find one that was good for me. I was a little put off by the price of other lip masks and I wasn’t sure how they would work so I hesitated in purchasing, and boy, am I glad! I found this and based on the price point and the reviews, I just had to try it. So many say that it is a great dupe for the Laneige lip mask, and while I cannot say from experience, I think that for the price, it is better. I wouldn’t know if this was $20 or $5 when it is on your lips. I had these really cracked areas on my lips that literally just wouldn’t go away. I was using aquaphor every night and saw no major signs of improvement. The second I started using this, my lips felt like the moisture was finally back in them. Within THREE DAYS the cracks were totally gone, and I still applied it every night for about a week after trying to make sure they were fully repaired. I LOOOVE this product and please buy if you don’t know if the higher prices are worth it. I felt the Laneige and this one is thinner but still effective and very pleasant to wear, it doesn’t feel like a heavy mask on your lips, and has an amazing smell. And it is super glossy and not super thick, so you could even wear a thin layer as a daytime gloss! And now that I’ve thoroughly bored you, I’ll end this review here. Price point + product = Happy lips + Happy budget
