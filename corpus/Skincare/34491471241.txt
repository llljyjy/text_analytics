love love in love I would recommend this to anyone it left no residue and is a lightweight cream type serum that cleansed great. the best thing is no foaming and rinsed well. I immediately felt results and I use a lot of cleansers whether expensive or not. this is totally impressive how fresh and clean I felt words can’t describe the salon’s facial feeling. I totally recommend and with the moisturizer, it was unbelievable to wake up to my skin being still smooth and awake looking I so give this a great review. one try enticed me to buy it this stuff astounded me. it's lightweight.
