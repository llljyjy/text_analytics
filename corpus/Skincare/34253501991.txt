It was good at the beginning. Got rid of makeup as advertised but it’s not for me. It broke me out so bad that I had to go to a dermatologist. Full face breakouts –forehead, cheeks, chin, etc. I bought the full sized one too. Get the mini before getting the full size just to try it on your skin first. ☹ nan
