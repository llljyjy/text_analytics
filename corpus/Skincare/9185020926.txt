Top-tier moisturizer. Love how lightweight it feels on, the fragrance is light and my skin feels so hydrated. I love that it has SPF in it so I feel protected when Iâ€™m out! This day cream has never felt greasy or heavy which is so important to me. I had no breakouts using this, my face always felt so clean and smooth! Winter is tough on my skin so keeping my face hydrated was a must and this cream delivered. Would highly recommend for anyone with dry skin!! A total surprise!
