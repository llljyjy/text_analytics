As someone who has sensitive skin, this product was a skin savor. Depending on the weather, my face is either really dry or really oily. Now with the weather in full force, my face has been super dry. This Dior balm has definitely helped with that. It contains hyaluronic acid which helps with my acne. I used to mix my hyaluronic acid serum in with my moisturizer, but this product already has it, so it’s a win-win. With my sensitive skin, my face gets irritated a little if there is fragrance in my moisturizer, so I’m really glad this one is fragrance free. I’m so happy to have found this product. It works great and I highly recommend it. nan
