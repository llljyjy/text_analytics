I received this cream free from Topbox. I’ve been using it since I got it, but I can’t comment on how effective it is in the long-term. I enjoy it so far though. I like that it comes in a glass jar. It has a very pleasant, fresh green tea scent. I’m very sensitive to scents usually, but even though this one may seem a bit strong, you can’t smell it after a while. I like that my skin doesn’t feel tacky after using this too. My skin feels like it’s been hydrated for the past 2 weeks since I started using it. I would definitely try other products in this line. nan
