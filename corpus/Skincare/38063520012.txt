I have been using this product for a month now -like 1-2x per week. This is a very kind to skin product, gave no breakouts or redness to skin. I have noticed that my face looks more bright and less dull every day. Also, my face is less oily now! Iâ€™m so happy the purchase ! beginner friendly retinol
