At first, I thought I might have found my perfect sunscreen.  But, alas, no.  I initially liked the smell, slight glow, texture, and high zinc oxide content.    However, the more I used the product, I noticed several downsides.  Even though I don’t use foundation, as others have noted, the product pills quite a bit.   In addition, even though there isn’t a noticeable white cast, because I have a slightly darker skin tone, there is still a tiny bit of one.  The biggest problem with the product, though, is the lack of information regarding its short shelf life.  I bought it in March of 2022, but the expiration date was January, 2023, less than a year.  I talked to three people at Sephora but could not get a satisfactory response as to why the expiration date was so short.  Something about the natural ingredients?  Then I emailed the Glow company three times, and no one responded to my question.  I like to order products online, so I don’t want to risk buying this product with such a short shelf-life.   I don’t think I will repurchase. Just okay
