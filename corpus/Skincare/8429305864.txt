Algenist’s Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm with Multi-Peptide Complex is an overall good product. It glides and applies smoothly on your skin. It’s not thick and lasts for awhile, you feel the nourishment. There isn’t a noticeable difference on the dark under eyes but it definitely firmed up the area! I enjoy that feature and the ingredients are great for your skin. Great for firmness
