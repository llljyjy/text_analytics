I redeemed some points for a sample size of this moisturizer and was immediately hooked. This is thick enough where it leaves your skin feeling extra nourished, but at the same time it doesn’t leave your skin feeling oily. With a light layer of this, your skin will look hydrated and glowy, but not sticky/etc. I’ve purchased the biggest size of this since getting the sample and this will be a staple in my skincare routine forever! a staple in my skincare routine
