I wanted to love this product, but I’ve been using it for nearly half a year like every night, and I’ve seen no improvement. I get a very dry nose area, and this didn’t help hydrate at all. Only bonus is I liked the way it smelt! Hard finding nice night creams that smell great. I sadly wouldn’t buy again :( Mehhhh
