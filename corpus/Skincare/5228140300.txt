I feel this is really similar to Green Clean but at a fraction of the price, with the same end results. I do notice that this one doesn’t “melt” into the skin as quickly as the green clean balm, but I don’t mind that. It removes all of my makeup quickly and thoroughly and if I have lash glue on, I just use a Q-tip with this balm on it and it come right off! great quality great price
