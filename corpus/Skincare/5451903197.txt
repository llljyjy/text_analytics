I enjoyed the thick consistency of the product.  It felt nice on the skin and absorbed pretty well. Didn’t like the addition of fragrance that has a tendency to affect my sensitive skin. The size of the sample really doesn’t give the product it’s justice if it’s due. There isn’t enough to use long enough to see any progress. It is a whopping 0.17 oz / 5 ml sample. I understand there is always cost savings in R&D but sometimes spending money makes more money.  Thanks for the opportunity. Sample size too small for optimal review 5ml
