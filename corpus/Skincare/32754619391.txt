I recieved this #freeproduct as a part of a campaign from #trywithtopbox and #CAUDALIE since me and my daughter have acne prone skin. I have super oily skin at my 30 something and she has her acne prone at her 14. We both use the product 6 times in a 3 weeks  period and got some good results. In my case I have sensitive skin around my mouth area and I use the product even there and was very pleased. I absolutely hate clay items since are hard to remove and I can’t stand the odor but this Mask wasn’t like that, this feels gentle, easy to removed and gets your pores clean and tighter with continued use. To my daughter help her to clear her skin from stubborn acne due to hormonal changes, mine is out of stress for sure. I’m also using the serum hope it will clear my hyperpigmentation but that might take longer. This is a great Formula for sensitive skin and worth the price for sure. My skin feels deep way better!
