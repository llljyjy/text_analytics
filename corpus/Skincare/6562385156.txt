I have dry skin and my skin loves hydrating products so I wasn’t surprised to see that it responded well to this, the serum absorbed quickly, left no residue, nothing tacky. Easy peasy to incorporate it into your routine. Only con I think is the price, it’s expensive for what it delivers unless over time it does more than just hydration.
