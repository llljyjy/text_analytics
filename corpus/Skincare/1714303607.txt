I have always really liked It Cosmetics products. I find them to be of god quality. This cream feels great on my skin and applies nicely. The smell of it is decent. Its not too thick and hard to rub in and not to thin that it feels like it isn’t doing anything. I don’t really notice any differences, however I have used this cream for years and will continue to do so. nan
