I received this #freeproduct sample sachet in exchange for my honest review from #trywithtopbox. I was able to use this for several applications, and it feels very nice. The texture is silken and slick, not tacky at all, and I found it absorbed very nicely. I used this in tandem with the eye cream and other cream, and although my skin looked very healthy, hydrated and glowing, I didnâ€™t see a marked difference in the appearance of my fine lines. Perhaps a larger amount to use over an extended period would make all the difference. Fast absorption
