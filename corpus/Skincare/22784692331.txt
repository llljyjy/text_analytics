I got this Clinique Wrinkle Correcting Serum as a #freeproduct sample from #topbox to try out and give my review. It was only a sample, so only got to try it out for a few days, but it was helping my skin alot. I used it morning and night, and was really helping my skin feel more rejuvjnated and smoother to the touch. My fine lines and wrinkles werenâ€™t so pronounced, as this was really hydrating my skin, to give it a more youthful glow. Anything to help this 59 year old to feel and look more younger is a plus for me. Nice Anti-aging Product for your skin
