I’m in love! I received this product for free in return for my honest review. I’ve been wanting to try this brand since I saw JLo come out with her skincare line. First of all, the packaging is the most beautiful I’ve ever seen. This eye cream was so creamy and nourishing. It smells just perfect, not too strong…I notice my eyes don’t look as puffy when I use this. I can’t wait to try more from this line. nan
