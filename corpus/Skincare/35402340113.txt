If I am being honest, I have mostly been using this product on my hands and WOW. I cannot get enough of it. It has a neutral smell and luxurious texture yet it super absorbent and not oily at all. My hands struggle in the winter and I have found this product to be their savior. My face has drastically improved from other naturally serious products and that is why I felt my hands could use some TLC from this rescue cream. I know if my face needs some moisture this product is the answer Luxurious texture and moisture results
