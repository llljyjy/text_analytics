This product was perfect. It was creamy but not thick, there was a light sunscreen scent that wasnâ€™t overwhelming.  There was no white cast or stickiness after applying. It absorbed quickly into my skin and did not cause breakouts which I was worried about since my skin is super sensitive.  I have oily skin and sunscreens tend to make me look oily as the day goes on but this did not so that which was awesome. Light scent
