I usually have a zero tolerance rule when it comes to physical exfoliants after reading a while back that they can cause more harm than good, but this one has definitely changed my stance. It’s all in the way you rub-be gentle, and you will be left with the softest, smoothest glowy skin. My pores tend to “leak“ in the corners of my nose, and this has dried all that yuckiness up without drying out my skin. This is definitely a product I recommend. nan
