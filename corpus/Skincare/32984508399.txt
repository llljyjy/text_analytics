I absolutely loved this peel!! And I have tried many. This was first time trying the nudestix brand of any cosmetics or skin care and I was pleasantly surprised. I have normal to oily skin and huge pores. I used the peel at night, after removing all my makeup and washing my face throughly. The packaging was nice and the product itself has a light, natural smell, not too heavy, which I loved. It didnâ€™t take a ton of the product to get my whole face. After letting it dry it peeled off beautifully and I washed the excess off and moisturized. My skin was feeling great, looking great and there was a visible difference in my pores. Im already telling people about it!! Amazing peel!!!
