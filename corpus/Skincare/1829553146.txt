This is a very nice hydrating and versatile moisturizer! The pump packaging is very easy to use and dispenses the perfect amount of product. It smells like mandarin rind, but the smell goes away once applied. Texture is very creamy and the cream soaks into the skin well once applied. I have oily skin and this cream makes your skin glowing but not greasy. Overall, I think this cream is great to use in the AM or PM, and has excellent hydrating and plumping capabilities. Also gives a nice soft glow to the face. Definitely brightens the face up so I think it satisfies itâ€™s claims to combat dullness, but I think more long term use is required to really see a difference in my hyperpigmentation. Only negative right now for me is that the packaging is pretty huge though for the amount of product you get. Glowy but not Greasy for Oily Skin
