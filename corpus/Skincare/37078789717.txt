“Magic Cream“---lofty promise, right?That’s what I thought. What a surprise when I opened this beautiful box and opened the jar of Magic Cream. I dabbed a bit onto my face, and this stuff spread easily, absorbed well, and left my dry skin so glowy. There’s a very light--faint--scent, a little floral-like to my nose, but the scent doesn’t linger. I’ve been using this on my face and neck for about a month now, and I see a difference in my skin. My skin looks healthier, and my face is looking more hydrated. My neck has more sun damage, so the benefits are less noticeable, but it does appear a little smoother.  I would probably buy this (I received a sample) if I continue to see these results. Magic Cream? Oh, Yes!
