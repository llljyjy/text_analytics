I Stand by this lip balm so firmly. I tend to have dry lips and with most lip balms I find myself reapplying hourly. I use this lip balm a few times throughout the day and before bed and I constantly have plump, moisturized lips. It leave a nice glossy finish and isn’t sticky, it’s very smooth. I wouldn’t say there’s much of a fragrance either. I think they should make an overnight mask with a similar formula but thicker !! 10/10 would recommend. Holy Grail Lip balm!
