I’ve had this product for a while and just kind of left it to the side, because I thought it was so pretty there’s no way it would actually work. I have very acne prone skin and when I tell you this cleared my acne in a matter of days. If you want clear skin and have trouble with stubborn blemishes and texture YOU NEEEEEED THIS!!!! I’ve tried so many different things and I finally found something that worked! Couldn’t recommend this product more. BUY IT RN! (ACNE PRONE SKIN MUST HAVE)
