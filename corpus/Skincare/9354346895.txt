I have very sensitive skin, and am a little nervous about trying new products.  I was very pleasantly surprised that this did not give me any type of allergic reaction.  I don’t wear lipstick because it usually runs and looks bad rather quickly.  I tried this for 10 days, and my lipstick stopped bleeding after about 4 days.  I also noticed that my lips looked smoother!  I didn’t notice a lot of plumping, but I only used for a short time.  I will continue to use! nan
