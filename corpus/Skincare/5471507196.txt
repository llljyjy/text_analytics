this scrub feels great on the face and has filled the void that the st. ives apricot scrub left in my life, it isn’t too harsh to use multiple times a week and has considerably brightened and evened and toned my skin which i didn’t expect, you can’t use it with other chemical exfoliants though as it has aha in it love this!!
