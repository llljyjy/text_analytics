I bought this awhile ago and didn’t really like how it felt on my skin. But recently I’ve been just trying to use it up by adding about 3 drops to my Neutrogena hyaluronic acid serum and wow it’s made my skin look and feel so smooth! If you’re one of those who think it feels a little oily, try mixing a couple drops with another serum or moisturizer. A little goes a long way! made my skin so smooth!
