OMG! Soo so so thankful to the girl at sephora who helped me when i had asked for products that help with redness. I bought this the other day and it has improved my complexion & redness so much along with other skincare i have been using. Iâ€™m going to keep on buying this. I use it before my serum and let my face stay a little wet when i apply my serum. I feel it really makes a difference! Also had gone to the beach and got slightly burned, not too bad, but i sprayed this on my sunburn and it helped so much with the stinging! Better than aloe vera gel. :) Love it already
