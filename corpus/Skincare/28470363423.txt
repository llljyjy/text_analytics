Wow! I was skeptical due to having adverse reactions to other vitamin C serum in the past (the Inkey List), but this helped clear up month long acne spots OVERNIGHT! I have suffered from acne since 11, and Iâ€™m almost 24. This is magic in a bottle. I cannot wait to see how this helps with old acne marks, scars, and keeping acne at bay. I pair this with The Ordinary Niacinamide every morning before moisturizer and spf. It is worth every penny! Magic in a Bottle
