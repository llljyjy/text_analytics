Iâ€™ve never heard of this brand and am so glad I was introduced to this because I think I found my new spring/summer moisturizer! This is such a lovely gel texture. I have combo skin and am always looking for a good gel moisturizer that doesnt feel heavy or too dewy and this is the perfect mix. Great gel moisturizer!
