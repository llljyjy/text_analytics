Get this cream! That’s the review lol. My skin absolutely LOVES this product. I can literally feel it doing its magic and my face feels so soft and moisturized after. It’s a cream, but not heavy or thick. Doesn’t appear to clog pores. This will be a staple in my skincare routine. A little goes a long way for the price point. Maximum hydration
