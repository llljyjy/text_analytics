Love this! Best moisturizer I’ve ever used. I’m in my late 30s and I had a patch of skin that was going from fine lined to wrinkled that I thought was going to require Botox etc and used this on it and it plumped it right up!! I don’t even use my bottle of Good Genes anymore which is fantastic because it’s not exactly cheap. Try this for fine lines!!
