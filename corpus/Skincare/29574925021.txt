I received this product free from Influenster and Clinique in return for an honest review.   I am 40 years old and beginning to notice fine lines under and around my eyes.  I have tried many products that claim to help, but donâ€™t.  Many of the creams are moisturizing, but lack the power to lessen the fine lines.  I feel like I have FINALLY  found a product that lives up to its claim.  This wrinkle correcting creme is a thick consistency but melts into your eye area very quickly.  After a few applications, I noticed a plumping effect.  After a few hours, it went away and I simply reapplied the product.  After using this for about a month, I am happy to say I feel like my lines are less pronounced and I still have a ton of product let to use.  I would recommend this to anyone that is beginning to notice fine lines.  I will be purchasing when I run out Definitely noticed a difference!
