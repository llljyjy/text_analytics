I love this hydrating and balancing product. it is pure liquid and a little goes a long way, so $40 is a very fair price for how much you get! I have had chronically irritated and dry skin, and this stuff is the only thing that helps my skin feel better. it’s so refreshing and I really do think it does wonders. i’m also kind of obsessed with the scent, so that definitely helps. perfect redness relief
