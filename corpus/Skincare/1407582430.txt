Overall after using this for a few weeks I haven’t seen a significant difference in my skin. The standout is the awful smell! It’s so strange, I’m not even sure how to describe it. I didn’t have any adverse reactions but no noticeable improvements either. I have some hyperpigmentation and was hopeful this would help improve that along with my skin’s texture. It was disappointing. I received this for free from Influenster. I would not repurpose. Disappointing
