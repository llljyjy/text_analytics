Big fan of this moisturizer. I use it after the shower and/or after washing my face. A little goes a long way. It smells like sweet honey and is so smooth and spreads out evenlyover my face and neck. Iâ€™ve noticed lines on my forehead and neck smoothing out since applying this product for the past few weeks. Will be purchasing again forsure!! nan
