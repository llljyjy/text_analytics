It’s a very good sunscreen! It’s lightweight, leaves no white cast (note that I am quite pale though). I enjoy the watery consistency - especially because this is normally my 3rd or 4th product I’m layering on as my last step. So it doesn’t feel oily or heavy. It’s good, nothing mind blowing though. Solid sunscreen
