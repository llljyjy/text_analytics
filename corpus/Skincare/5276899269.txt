I love this sunscreen! It has been in my Sephora cart for a couple weeks now and I was thrilled to receive it from Influenster for my honest feedback. The formula is very liquidy and easy to apply. It sits on the skin beautifully and creates a glow. The formula absorb quickly and doesn’t leave a white cast! I skipped using my primer because it acts very much like one. I am obsessed! Highly highly recommended to any of my fellow dry skin girlies and guys!!! Stop ✋ grab this sunscreen while you can!!!
