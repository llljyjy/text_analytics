I donâ€™t use cleansing oil too much, but I do like how this product just melts my makeup off, making makeup removal much easier! It is a very gentle product. I only use it on days when I wear makeup to work; I use 1-2 pumps during my nighttime skincare routine. It leaves my skin feeling so soft and clean. Soft & clean!
