I received a sample of the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum in exchange for a review. I used the product at night as part of my skin care routine.I really enjoyed the texture of the serum, the formula is lightweight and easy to apply and it has a pleasant scent.I consider purchasing the product to see the long term effects in wrinkles. nan
