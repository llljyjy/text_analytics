I have very sensitive, acne prone skin so trying a new product is always nerve racking but this moisturizer didnâ€™t let me down. I used it as a spot treatment on dry areas of my face and neck, as well as a moisturizer all over my face to lock in my other skin care products. After using it for a little over a week I definitely have noticed a change in the hydration of my skin. It also works great as a hand moisturizer (it leaves my hands SO soft). Definitely recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin! Amazing for sensitive skin!
