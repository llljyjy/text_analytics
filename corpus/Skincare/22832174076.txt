I received this product through Influenster. I have been wearing it all summer under makeup as a primer and SPF. The quality of ingredients is great and I feel protected from the sun all day. The only downside is the smell of this product. It has a strange odor that grows stronger through out the day, especially when outside in hot temperatures. I do feel like it helped my skin though! nan
