Thank you to my friends over at Shiseido for sending me the Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Day Cream Broad Spectrum SPF 20 to test out! I have always been a fan of Shiseido products – they are a high end luxurious brand that always seem to work well with my normal to combination skin. The cream itself is thicker than I would usually use for a daily moisturizer, it feels more like an evening cream but alas, I gave it a go. After letting it sink in my skin for a few minutes it felt quite refreshed and it actually was a great base prior to my daily primer. As I am getting older I realize the importance of sunscreen (wish I would have listened to Mom to start wearing it a little sooner) and try to always find lotion and makeup with SPF. I am rating this lotion a 4/5 stars because of the thickness which felt a bit goopy and the smell had a strong scent of SPF which always annoys me. If they could change the formulation with less smell I’d go for a solid five stars. Thanks Shiseido! Thick and moisturizing!
