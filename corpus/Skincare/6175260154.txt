My acnes disappear every time I use this product! (I have oily and sensitive skin!) I stopped using it for a minute and I definitely noticed more breakouts without it. I got my roommate to try it and she decided to get her own too. It is pricier and I have not compared it yet to other SA containing cleansers, but I love it. I would say it lasts a long time since you only need a little bit and it foams up nicely, but the product itself loses its effect about 6 months after the first usage. Holy grail for acne prone skin!
