I received a sample size from Influenster to try for an honest review. The sample size provided was extremely small, not enough for nearly a trial but a first impressions. It goes on to the skin very nicely, absorbs well. However, Unlike the name suggests, it is not very hydrating. If you are someone who enjoys a lightweight moisturizer, it is worth a try. It was not irritating whatsoever, but was not hydrating enough for me. I have combination skin and is acne prone, but this didn’t do much for me since the trial size was very small. Not sure I’d get a full size to be honest nan
