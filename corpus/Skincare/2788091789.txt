I received this product for free from Influenster for my honest review. I do feel like his skin had more of a sheen or it made my makeup not look so matte. It does take some getting used to especially if you want more of a matte look. I have not seen a difference in fine lines but I don’t think any serum really does much for fine lines. I’m not sure that I would actually buy it to add to my routine. Just ok
