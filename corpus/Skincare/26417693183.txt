This is the first Sephora review I’ve ever written, but I noticed that this moisturizer has some bad reviews and because it’s my favourite, I want to boost it up. This moisture is one of the only beauty products I’ve ever re-purchased because for some reason many stop working for me. I have normal/oily skin, and I just love how easily this moisturizer absorbs into my skin, how nice it smells, and the fact that it doesn’t pill. It’s a great base for makeup or even just as a morning/night face cream. My boyfriend also loves it. If it weren’t sold out right now, I’d buy several. The best moisturizer ever
