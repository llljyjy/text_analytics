I got this in a Boxycharm, but I would repurchase. It’s a great moisturizer for sensitive skin. I don’t have particularly sensitive skin, but in the summer, I get a heat rash situation going up my neck, and most products irritate it further. This soothes it and moisturizes my skin. It’s also great for moisturizing my face during the day. I use it before I do my makeup and my skin is soft and takes makeup well. Perfect for Sensitive Skin
