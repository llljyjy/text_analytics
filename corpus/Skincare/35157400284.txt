Really happy with Moon Dew. Bakuchiol retinol alternative feels is what sold me on this product since I have been looking for a good eye cream that has retinol effects but us all natural.  I have been pleasantly surprised with the overall texture and smoothness of the cream. My skin is not irritated at all and I have highly sensitive skin.  I am already seeing a reduction in lines and skin feels firmer to the touch. This eye cream works great
