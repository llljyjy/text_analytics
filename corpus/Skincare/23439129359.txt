I’ve read a lot of really critical reviews online about DE and how a lot of their products can be perceived as being overpriced, though I have to say that this really won me over. There are a lot of “okay“ moisturizers out there that get the job done, but since I’ve started using this at night (might be a bit too heavy during for combo skin) my skin has felt so soft and hydrated. The fine lines on my forehead also don’t seem to be as prominent after a couple weeks of use. It is quite expensive (but the 100ml limited edition is a great deal) though I would say if you have a few extra dollars to spend on skin care then this is definitely a worthy purchase. This moisturizer won over a huge skeptic
