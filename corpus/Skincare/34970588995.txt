It’s a good product if you have oily skin, but I would not recommend for those who have normal to dry skin. I don’t think this product works for those two types of skin. I have a combination of oily and dry skin and I had to apply more product on the dry patches to make it work. My husband has oily skin and works really good for him, so I do still recommend this product. Perfect only for oily skin
