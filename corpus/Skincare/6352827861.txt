I tried this bc my usual Tarte Maracuja eye treatment was sold out in store and I was completely out. It sorta burned when I put it on but told myself that means it’s “working”. After about a month of using it I noticed my eyes were very dry and skin was peeling. Thankfully my go-to was back in stock. I think it is just not very moisturizing and I have dry eyes. For oily eyes it might work fine. dryed out my skin
