This Estee Lauder Micro Essence is a very nice product. I put this on before my serum and moisturizer. This makes a moisture barrier on your skin, so your skin feels hydrated all day. It doesn’t seem to have a scent. This is a very light liquid that absorbs quickly, and doesn’t leave a sticky residue. I am impressed with this Estee Lauder Micro Essence. I recommend this product. Nice product!
