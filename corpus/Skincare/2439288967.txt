This After-Dark Sleeping Cream was gifted by Naturally Serious for reviewing purposes. I have combination skin and the cream works pretty well for me as a night time moisturizer.  After using it, my skin feels more plump and refreshed in the morning. It features some excellent ingredients (such as Ceramides, Squalane and Peptides) and has a dreamy texture that absorbs quickly.For me the lotion works better in the winter months when my skin is more dehydrated. In the warmer months it can get a little too heavy for my combo skin.Also keep in mind that the cream has a faint scent. I find it quite pleasant and subtle but i know fragrance is not necessarily for everyone. Plumping and moisturizing but on the heavier side
