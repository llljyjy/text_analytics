Ole Henriksen boasts that this eye cream will “visibly improve dark circles, brightens undereyes, reduces crows feet, and improves + extends concealer wear.“ It also says users reported all this immediately after the first use. This was not my experience. I do love the packaging, it’s very pretty. The creme itself has a nice, lightweight consistency that goes on easily, and does leave my undereye feeling soft and moisturized. It also does not have any scent at all as promised. But after using it for twice a day for 2 weeks under my right eye only, I didn’t see any visible differences. I will continue to use it because I have it, and maybe with longer use, I will start to see an improvement. Disappointed
