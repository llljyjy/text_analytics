This is a product that I have been using since 2016 when I first bought it at the Montclair Mall in Ontario,  California. I went to the Sephora because I needed a Good Product for my face because it was becoming Dry. So the Sales Rep. Introduced me to Drunken Elephant and I have never changed. It did for me what I was looking for and needed, I wouldnâ€™t Stop Using this product for anything. Drunken Elephant, perfect Moisturizer,,,,,
