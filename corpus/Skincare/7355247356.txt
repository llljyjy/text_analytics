I received this product free of charge for my honest review. This was my first time trying a ‘Tula’ product & I loved it!! I’ve been using this mask now over the span of 4 weeks consistently & I’ve seen great results. This has really helped clear my skin & helped my skin achieve more vibrancy. First applying this mask I was a little leery because when applied directly to the face it had a bit of a tingling sensation to it, but this was the mask detoxing my skin also removing any impurities! I highly recommend trying this mask out, you’ll love it! Amazing product
