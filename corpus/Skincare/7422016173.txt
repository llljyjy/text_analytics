Absolutely love it. I never use self tanners because im already olive toned and brown but ive been very pale as of late and wanted to get some colour before a vacation. This stuff is so easy to apply, doesnâ€™t smell, looks totally natural and isnt orange in tone. Highly recommend this over any foam self tanners. buy it!
