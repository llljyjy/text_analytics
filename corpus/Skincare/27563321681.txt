The hype is real, guys. Gentle enough to use twice a day, yet powerful enough to only use a couple times a week. It has a bit of an hydrating, oily finish to it. Also with the price point of the mini, itâ€™s worth at least giving a shot. I think it would work with super sensitive skin, too! I mean, the hype is real.
