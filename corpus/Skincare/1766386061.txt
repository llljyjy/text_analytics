As I wear makeup everyday, I typically double cleanse with micellar water and a good cleanser. I was excited for the potential of this being a great cleanser. I immediately opened cleanser, squirted some on my cleansing brush and went to it. I was instantly taking over by an immensely strong and not pleasant scent. It was almost, dare I say, like an old lady perfumy smell. I finished washing my face and did like the way my skin felt, not rough or overdried, but the scent lingered so I eventually washed my face again with my usual cleanser. I will say I’m extremely sensitive to scents so if you are not, this may be magic in a bottle. Sadly, it wasn’t for me. Could Have Been Great.....
