When I bought my first one, the spray was very uneven from the first use. I tried clearing out nozzle, but it didnâ€™t help. I really wanted this product to work, so I exchanged it to the new one and specifically tested it in the store to make sure the spray is even. Unfortunately, the nozzle clogged up just after couple uses. There is no way of fixing it. Every time I open it, I see the product leaking from the nozzle, even though I clean it all the time.The product itself is VERY greasy. And to top it all off it started to spray solid particles, that can be absorbed, so now I have a ton of little grains of product stuck on my face.Absolutely not worth it!!! Terrible
