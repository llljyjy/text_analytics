I was sent a complimentary sample in exchange for my honest review.Disclosure: My sample was only a mere ..75oz/5ml teeny jar, so was only able to use for about 10 days (def not the 4 weeks most of their testing was done for, certainly not over my entire face/neck). Results may be better/longer lasting with long term use than my brief experience.I have VERY dry skin and their “indulgent textured“ formula is rich, i.e. extremely thick -a little does NOT go a long way. Scent on the “mature“ side, not great. Non-greasy, absorbed fast, no blemishes, it cleared up some dry flakes but my face just didn’t FEEL very moisturized or smooth after. However, immediate results were seen esp under-eye. Fresh, brightened and tightened (similar to -more affordable, just as effective- TF’s Plump & Prime). Bags/discolor lightened and appearance of wrinkles lessoned. BUT, this effect did not last. Maybe a few hours after applying in the am. Overnight a slight fresh look upon waking, but short-lasting. You’d have to apply every few hours to keep this up.Due to the consistency, I think a jar would be used up very quick, making the price (64-120$) not worth it. The refills are a nice option though.This may better benefit more mature and/or dry/sensitive skin. If you have the cash, give it a shot. Hopefully it may work better with long-term use. Me, I’ll be sticking to the cheaper, equally -if not better- options:). Meh, Immediate results short lasting, super rich.
