Influenster sent me a sample of Clinique smart clinical repair wrinkle correcting eye cream and I’ve really liked it so far. I use it before putting on my make up because my under eyes are dry and as expected my fine lines have gotten a little deeper. This satisfies both needs and it’s not heavily scented, which I appreciate in any beauty product. nan
