I received this #freeproduct from #topbox. Since the sample was kind of small, I only had enough for a few uses (3 max.). The consistency is more watery but it absorbed well on my combination skin. Nonetheless, I did feel it a little dry afterward so I followed with a moisturizer. I incorporated this serum during my nighttime routine and I alternated it with wrinkle repair cream. The scent is very light and it didnâ€™t bother or irritate me. I liked this product, but I cannot say I notice a drastic change in my skin afterward. Absorbs well, but follow with moisturizer.
