I got this in a sampler pack and LOVE it! It gets all off my waterproof mascara off without hurting or pulling at any of my lashes. It doesnâ€™t sting or burn in my eyes (I have trouble with other removers in my eye area). It also works really well for removing excess wax after waxing your face, I prefer it to the oil that comes with the packs since I have bad combination skin. Works Great for Waterproof Mascara!!
