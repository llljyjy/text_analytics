The packaging is simple and nice. And the box was very easy to open. The moisturizer it’s self smells really nice. It has a subtle rose scent to it. It’s a light moisturizer that’s good for people with oily skin types. So I recommend this to people with oily skin because it’s not heavy on the skin at all. After using for a day or two, you’ll notice a difference in the vibrancy if your skin. My appeared much brighter after two days if use. Pleasant rose scent
