I received my cream and I was very excited because I’ve had nothing but good experiences with all the IT cosmetics products. This one didn’t disappoint either! I have combo skin, and this went on smoothly and didn’t have a strong frangrance. I was pleasantly surprised it didn’t leave a heavy greasiness behind because it feels like a fairly thick moisturizer, but it absorbed beautifully and left nothing but a great feeling behind. The line around my eyes appear softer, and ill continue using to see a result on the rest of my face. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good moisturizer that can last day to night. IT cosmetics never disappoints:) nan
