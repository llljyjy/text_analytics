I wore for a week straight to test out and it was nice/moisturizing although i did feel more greasy than usual at the end of the day. So i took a break from it and used other sunscreens that I know work well for me throughout the day. I went back to use this on my drier days in the winter and it had separated terribly even after shaking and kneading the tube I had to pump out all the separated oil which is a waste of product and money. donâ€™t think i would buy it again because of this. If you are to buy it maybe use it more consistently and use for drier skin types. product separates :(
