Use to love this product as it was terrific at reducing the redness of my skin. Ordered it recently only to find that the soap has been reformultated and there is no mention of this on the packaging. The new formulation lists charcoal as the fourth LAST ingredient while the old product listed it as fourth from the top. Unfortunately, this new bar does not reduce the redness of my skin the same way. Will be looking for something now that actually works and has a decent amount of charcoal in it. Reformulated bar with less charcoal
