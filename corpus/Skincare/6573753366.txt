I found that this product was not matte but its not bad either. I thought at first that it made my skin look bad but then I realized that I needed to let it sink in before proceeding with my makeup. If I did it straight away my base makeup would break up! It’s super silky on, like a whipped silicone primer texture. It’s clear (at least it is on my fairer skin) and makes my skin look like it just has moisturizer on once it sinks in. Let it sink in!
