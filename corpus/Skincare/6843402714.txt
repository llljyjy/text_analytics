I’ve been using this for a couple weeks now and let me tell you it works wonders! It leaves those hard dried spots super soft and hydrated without having to reapply all day. It doesn’t leave a greasy feeling the skin absorb it well. I will definitely will repurchase this again. It is a bit overpriced but I really can’t complain with the results. Miracle Balm.
