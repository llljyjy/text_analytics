I’ve been getting dry patches and this completely took them away. It has a slight weird sour smell that goes away quickly so I’m not taking any stars away. I only use this at night cause of how moisturizing it is. But it really helped turn my skin around. Good amount of product too. This is a new staple for sure. Drink of water for your face
