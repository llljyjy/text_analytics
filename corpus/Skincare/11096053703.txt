I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. This product is very much luxury and you get what you pay for. First off the package is stunning and a piece you’d want on display. The product inside is just as amazing as the outside, it feels like I’m giving myself a facial and it feels super hydrated and plumped afterwards. I have normal to dry skin. I get breakouts every once in a while and this product did not cause any. If you have the coin to buy this I would highly recommend. Just like any other skincare product it’s not always for everyone but it’s worth a shot. Treat yourself in a bottle
