Admittedly I was skeptical when first trying this spray but I love it! The bottle itself is so Luxe, the cap and the bottle have a texture to it that you know youâ€™re using something special before you use it. Which oddly I love. I primarily use this as a finishing spray, it helps set my makeup and keeps my skin hydrated. I love the smell, and the feel is light weight, and natural (not waxy at all like some other finishing sprays.) I would definitely recommend. Love, love, LOVE!
