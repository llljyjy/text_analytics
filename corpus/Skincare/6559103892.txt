Overall I really have enjoyed this product. I took one star off because it did really dry my skin out until I was able to adjust to it. It has helped with plumping my skin though! And I love the clean ingredients. This is a really great starter product for this interested in retinol. I do intend to purchase this item in the future!I received this as a sample from Influenster Overall liked this product!
