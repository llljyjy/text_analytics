Definitely doesn’t feel like a gradual tan, more like an instant tan. I really like the colour it gives and that you don’t have to wait too long for it to develop. I tried applying it with my hands(washing palms after), a mitt, and a vinyl glove. Applying with hand and mitt made the product pill and be more uneven. The glove was by far the best I was really impressed with how it melted into the skin and was so quick to apply. I think because this is supposed to be gradual it doesn’t seem streaky at all and blended into the skin flawlessly. It looks very even, natural and has replaced the st tropez foam I was using before not gradual but it’s my new fav
