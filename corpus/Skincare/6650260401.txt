What a great easy to use product! Normally humidifiers are these big clunky objects that you’re not sure if you can keep clean. Canopy was so far from that! There’s no distracting stream of steam but instead a quiet nice hum that was pleasant while working from home. I definitely felt a difference in the air when normally this California dryness gets to me. The scents alone are worth getting this product! Smells so good! Great Humidifier! Easy to use.
