Super hydrating and luxurious feeling. My only complaint is it doesn’t seem to be much different from the regular cream in the same line. Perhaps it’s just a little thinner so it’ll spread better over the eye area. But I’d rather just pat the cream over my eyes too rather than pay for the separate eye cream at this price. Doesn’t seem worth the extra step or $. Great, but Redundant?
