I received this product for review.  I used it for 2 months to get a good idea of how well it works. I also took a before and after picture to compare the lines on my neck.  I have extremely sensitive skin, with rosacea so trying new products can be scary.  I used the product on my neck where I have fine lines and also some deep set wrinkles.  This product did not have a strong fragrance, which I prefer.  It is smooth on application and it sinks in quickly.  I didn’t feel greasy after application.  I’m sure you need longer than 2 months to make a dent in wrinkles, but I did see softening of my skin and after looking at the photos I see a difference in the depth of the lines.  The texture is beginning to look smoother and softer.  I did not have any reaction with my sensitive skin either.  I will continue to use because I believe it is making a difference on my skin Working on my sensitive skin
