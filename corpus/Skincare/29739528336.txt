This night cream is SO buttery and absorbent on my skin, but in a non-oily way. I love how my face looks the next morning, I look plump and healthy. I have oily skin but this doesn’t make my face more greasy. It really soothes my face as well. A little goes a long way with this product so it’s going to last me the whole year.
