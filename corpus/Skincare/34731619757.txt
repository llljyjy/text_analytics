I love this toner! I received this toner complimentary from Algenist. It’s so calm on the skin, but tingles a little bit because of BHA. There is nothing irritating. I apply it on my hands and then on my clean face.  I am in love with the mild scent.  My skin tends to get rough texture often if I don’t keep up with my exfoliation and this toner and its exfoliant are really helping my skin improve.  After the first use, my skin felt smoother and after several days, I notice my skin looks brighter. This was easy to incorporate into my AM and PM routines. nan
