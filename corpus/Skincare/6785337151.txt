The one thing I really love about this face mist is the pump. It claims to give a “gentle cloud of hydration” which it truly does. It comes out in a very fine mist so it gently coats your skin without soaking your face. So many other face mists spray too intensely and unevenly almost like spraying yourself in the face with a spray bottle, ruining your makeup and making a mess. But the pump on this is perfect and I really like the bottle. It’s a nice heavy glass bottle. I like that it hydrates for 48 hours and also protects your skin against pollution. I like that the ingredients include Black Rose Oil and Hyaluronic Acid which hydrates without clogging pores. I do get breakouts and this didn’t cause me any problems. I was able to wear a full coverage foundation over the top without any issues with pilling and it didn’t cause my makeup to break apart. However I do have oily skin and feel like it might be too hydrating for under or over my makeup since I get so oily (I never moisturize before foundation for that reason) but it works just fine in my nightly skincare routine. It’s a nice addition in your daily skincare routine or just to use throughout the day if you have dry skin for a little added hydration without making you greasy. Because the mist is so fine it’s very versatile and you can use it before or after makeup without it ruining your foundation. I wouldn’t use it in place of a setting spray but if you have dry skin and like to be able to add some hydration over your foundation it’s perfect. The only thing I don’t like is the added fragrance because I try to avoid that in my skincare but it’s not a deal breaker since it didn’t cause any irritation. nan
