I received a sample for free for my review. I was in the middle of moving so I didn’t get to use it for a very long time. But the time I was able to, I really enjoyed it. The cream was thick like spun honey, but glided onto my skin very nicely and my under eyes were feeling good! It’s very moisturizing! It does have a faint scent to it, but not overpowering or annoying. I can’t wait to use it some more! Moisturizing!
