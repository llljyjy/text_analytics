I received this product as part of a promotion. If you’re looking for a great overnight moisturizer, this is a solid option! It has a very thick consistency and is unscented. I will say the smell it does have isn’t the most appealing thing, but it fades quickly. Overall, I would compare this to the First Aid Beauty Ultra Moisturizer but less oily. I definitely feel Ike it keeps my face hydrated throughout the night! I would purchase this and recommend it. nan
