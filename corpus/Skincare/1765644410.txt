I really enjoy this mask! My skin looks plumper and feels SO much softer after use. I will warn that if you have sensitive skin, donâ€™t leave on as long during your first few uses as my skin became really dry. My only complaint is the pump on the product has been underwhelming each time I purchase. A skincare staple!
