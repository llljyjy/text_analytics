I bought this on a whim during the Rouge sale, and I am so happy I did! I didn’t expect to love this as much as I do. Within the past week and a half I’ve been using it, my skin has been soft to the touch and overall appearance is clear and bright. I love the soft strawberry scent. I know everyone picks up scents differently, but I do not think this is strong or gross like some other reviews. It dissipates within a few seconds of applying the watery serum. If you deal with rougher texture or uneven skin tone, I definitely think this is worth a try! My skin looks summer-ready, and I got compliments when I ran into Ulta yesterday on how clear my skin looks. This has been the only new addition to my routine! Best New Skincare Addition!
