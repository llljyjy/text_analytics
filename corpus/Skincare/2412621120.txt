I will use this stuff forever. It is by far my favorite face cream that I’ve ever used. It doesn’t leave my skin greasy or to dewy, just soft and hydrated. I love the little spatula it comes with so I don’t have to stick my fingers in the jar. It goes on almost as a soft hydrogel moisturizer, which I love, since I have some sensory issues with textures. There’s no weird smell, it really just feels like a nice clean product that does exactly what it’s supposed to and my skin loves it. For reference I’m 35, I have skin on the dryer side, and it’s trying real hard to age, but I’m not letting it! Love!!
