I recieved this product from @bzzagent in exchange for my honest review. IT cosmetics “confidence in a cream“ Anti-Aging Armour is hands down the most comfortable night cream I have ever used. I have dry, sensitive skin and naturally  spend a lot of time outside due to my work. I need soothing and to take extra care with my skin. My skin drinks this in and immediately feels great. Plus, a little goes a long way-- I’ve used it at morning and night for a month and jar looks full still. It has a light, organic scent that my slighty sensistive skin loves, Also as a man I do not like alot of fragrance in my skincare and do not like having to use 19 different product to achieveresults i want, with IT cosmetics confidence in a cream I can use a face wash and this cream and be ready for the day/night .I also love the texture. It is slightly balmy, very creamy, But the texture is part of what makes it so soothing. It isn’t sticky to me at all. Overall, totally worth it, already seeing plumper, healtheir skin! Bonus, more affordable than other high end brands while achieving same results. Exactly what the name says! Everything in one crea
