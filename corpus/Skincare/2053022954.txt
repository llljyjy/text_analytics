I received this complimentary from Influenster to try for my honest opinion. I honestly didn’t like the smell I tried to use it for about 2 1/2 weeks and I just couldn’t continue. The foam left my skin very smooth and felt soft but I feel like the results weren’t exactly what I expected it kind of irritated my skin and I’m not sure if it was because how strong it smelled maybe there was an ingredient that didn’t sit well with my skin. nan
