I have a very hard time finding products, such as sunscreen, that works for everyone in my household. I have a multiracial family and some of us born easier than others where as some that want to tan safely have a harder time. This sunscreen worked great for everyone here. My daughters that encourage getting a little color from the sun, but don’t want to risk sun damage or cancer used this and loved it. They protected their skin and were thrilled with the extra tan color they were able to get. My husband burns very easily, and when he used this product, no red was seen. I have an issue with getting sunspots and my face burning. I can’t believe that this actually prevented me from getting sunspots! I think the hyaluronic acid has a lot to so with that. And I forgot to mention that my youngest daughter has extremely sensitive skin and everything makes her breakout. But again this amazingly didn’t. All in all it’s just a great sunscreen.
