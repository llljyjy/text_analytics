The bottle is quite small. But it is kind of cute, and the cream is purple which is beautiful! I love it at least for its color. I also really using retinol. The cream can be absorbed very quickly. Its scent is very very light. I can barely sense it, it kind of like a berry scent. The texture is very unique, it is not cream but like a balm. The texture is quite solid. Kind of like solid perfume. as to its anti-aging effect, I will need to use it for a longer time to see. unique texture
