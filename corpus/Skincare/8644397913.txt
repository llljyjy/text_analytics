After using this for the first time it left my skin like a glazed donut. This was gifted to me by Dermalogica but regardless this exfoliant changed my skin for the better. I use a few drops, rinsed, then let my face air dry. I’m going to replenish after, it’s a solid product in my new skincare routine! Soft & Dewy like a glazed donut
