Before they changed the formula I receive the original as a gift and fell in love in. I was ready to purchase more but was hesitant to do it once find out the formula changed but I remained optimistic and gave it a try. After using it for over a month at a consistent rate I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s not worth the buy especially if you have sensitive/acne prone skin. And I personally wouldn’t recommend it to anyone. I feel as though it didn’t provide any hydration. I feel like it just sat on my skin to look hydrating but it didn’t FEEL hydrating. Very disappointing. Will not purchase again.
