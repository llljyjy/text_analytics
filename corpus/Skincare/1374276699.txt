Finally! This is an acne treatment that works for adult skin. Most benzoyl peroxide products over dry my skin and make me peel. This cleanser by Dr. Zenovia is different because it combines the acne fighting power of benzoyl peroxide with skin soothing ingredients aloe vera and green tea. If that weren’t enough, this cleanser also includes anti-aging superstars Resveratrol and Bakuchiol, along with additional antioxidants and vitamins. I’ve never found a cleanser that can cover all my bases like this one does. Do yourself a favor and get the entire Dr. Zenovia Acne Solutions System set. This cleanser, spot treatment and lightweight moisturizer will replace all the half-used bottles littering your counter because this trio does it all! Acne Care (and anti-aging!) for Grown Ups!
