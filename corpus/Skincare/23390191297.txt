Received the product from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. I was super excited to try as it has some really good reviews. However, as someone with sensitive skin, this moisturizer just sat on top of my skin rather than penetrating my skin. I had it on a full day and started noticing tiny breakouts and bumps by the end of the dayâ€¦ it took days to heal from the reaction. If you have combo sensitive skin, this product may not be for sure. I have combo dry, sensitive and oily skin and I guess the product just got stuck under dry skin and caused breakouts. Not for combination skin
