It’s hard to find a lip balm with spf that doesn’t taste gross, but this one’s great! It feels like a normal lip balm and has a very pretty glossiness. It smells nice but tastes like nothing - perfect! I’m very impressed with it and for such a good price, I’ll definitely repurchase. Favorite spf lip gloss/balm
