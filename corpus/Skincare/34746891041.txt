I’ve seen so many rave reviews of this that I wanted to try it. Didn’t see the results it said and after a few hour skating in bed with it in my lips were already dry. There was no leftover residue whatsoever in the morning. Kind of disappointed it didn’t work better. I also didn’t like the gummy feeling on your lips. I will give it one star for the smell but that is it. Not worth the hype
