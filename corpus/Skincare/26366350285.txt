this is my go to product! It gives the skin a beautiful natural glow and hydrates dry skin while also preventing oiliness, and layers PERFECTLY under makeup. It also SIGNIFICANTLY decreased acne, scaring and blemishes. I love the inky list and their affordability, especially considering the amazing quality of the products. The only negative thing I could say is that I wish they sold bigger bottles!! Highly highly highly recommend! AMAZING PRODUCT!! helped reduce acne!!
