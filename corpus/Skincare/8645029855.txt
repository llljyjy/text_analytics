this is perfect for small pimples! overall, after one use i noticed a decreased amount of redness in my face but within a few days the pimples are completely gone! this is a tougher acne treatment in my opinion so if you have sensitive skin, use a generous amount! this is a lower concentration of salicylic acid and i had no issues with it! spot clear!
