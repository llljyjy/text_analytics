I’m approaching 40 and the last handful of years I’ve paid extra special attention to my skin care routine, but I really love trying new products to see which one works best for me, my chemistry, and my needs. I’ve been using this every night since I got it following cleansing and serum application and I really love it so far. It’s got a nice texture.. kind of lightweight with a little thickness. It’s easy to apply an even application, but I do try to do this at least 30 minutes before I go to bed so it allows proper time to absorb into my skin. It’s got a very light, natural scent that reminds me of citrus fruits. Since I’ve been using this regularly for a few weeks now, I feel like I’m starting to see a slight reduction in the appearance of fine lines around and under my eyes and I’m overall waking up feeling like I’m looking a little more refreshed, even if I haven’t gotten the best nights sleep. This is something I will definitely be recommending to others and that I will absolutely consider buying in the future. Awesome Product!!
