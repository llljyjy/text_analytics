Rose Inc’sHydration Replenish Microencapsulated Plumping Gel Moisturizer truly took me by surprise when I first opened the jar. The texture is simply luxurious as the cooling gel-like texture has these beautiful microbeads. While gel moisturizers aren’t my preference for the colder, winter weather, this delivered on a hydrated and luminous finish. It did not have any residual feeling and was lightweight while absorbing into the skin quickly. nan
