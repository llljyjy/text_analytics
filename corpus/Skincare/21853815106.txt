Once more I was lucky to be selected for the @thisisbutterly & @chickadvisor review for the @clarinscanada #Doubleserum and #gotitfree! The #ClarinsSkinCare Double Serum is formulated for all skin types this is said to visibly firm skin, reduce wrinkles, revive radiance, restore evenness, and diminish the look of pores. We all know winter causes its slew of skin issues, so Iâ€™ve been dealing with a bit of that as well. Using the product is quick and easy. It applies smoothly to clean skin, morning or night and leaves behind a supple feeling of nourishment. With sensitive skin, I can say this did not cause any issues, and no breakouts or blemishes occurred at the site of use over the 7 days. From day 1 to Day 7 I did notice my skin retained more moisture and became less dry. It paired well with my other skin care products. Looking at the price point, it is a bit above my average range for a skin care product budget, but having it to try was truly a great week of skin. True to its Claims
