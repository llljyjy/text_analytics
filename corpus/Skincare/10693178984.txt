I actually don’t completely hate this product, the reason I’m giving it a one star review is because it’a not as advertised. It is extremely dewy and glowy, almost to the point of greasy. I think this is a great idea for a product, but I bought this under the impression it reduces shine, not add to it. very greasy, not matte as advertised.
