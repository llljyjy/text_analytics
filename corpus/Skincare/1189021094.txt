A Sephora advisor recommended this item to me. Unfortunately, it has caused such a bad breakout on my skin! Everytime I’ve used it, I have gotten more zits pop up and they’re also not pimples I normally get. It’s weird to describe. They’re HUGE under the skin ones. When I would stop using this serum, my skin would start to heal and clear up, but when I would incorporate this again, again my skin would have a massive breakout. Sad but it’s going back. NOPE
