*Purchased w/my own money*I was so excited to try this because I’m a huge fan of the Laneige Lip products & the claims sounded like my dream SPF. Pros: It is very lightweight, it adds a nice slight glow to dry skin. It wears well all day & looks great under makeup. It plays well with other products. No pilling. It really is a beautiful product! & I loved the packaging. Cons: It is pretty heavily fragranced imo. It wasn’t terrible on days around the house, but I wore it when I had to wear a mask all day. I incorrectly assumed the scent would dissipate, unfortunately that was not the case. It was so bad that I tried washing it off when I got to my destination, makeup & all, but I couldn’t get the scent off my face. It ended up giving me a wicked headache which rarely happens to me. Conclusion: If not for the fragrance, this would be my perfect SPF. I’m so disappointed that brands STILL put fragrance in sunscreen, skincare & makeup products. It’s such a shame, but I had to return this. I need an SPF that I can wear every day. However, if you aren’t sensitive to fragrance, you might really love this. Especially if you have fine lines, mature skin and/or dry skin. I really hope they release a fragrance free version of this. Great Except for the Fragrance
