This cream has helped bring my skin back to life! I have combination skin where it’s oily in the T zone areas and dry everywhere like my cheeks and around my nose. I have been using this cream consistently every night for 2 weeks and noticed my skin texture and appearance had improved. My dry areas are no longer dry and the uneven texture like tiny white bumps had gone away. I’m still oily but it feels under control. I can’t attest to fine lines and wrinkles since I don’t have them yet. I do have fine lines under my eyes and those still look the same. Since I don’t have fine lines and wrinkles yet, I’ll be using this cream as a preventative. The cream absorbs into the skin quickly and it’s not greasy at all. There is no strong scent just like any other Lancôme skincare products. My skin looks and feels very plump and hydrated, which having hydrated skin prevents wrinkles. I’m so glad I tried this product. I will be getting their serums to maximize the benefits. Highly recommend to all women of all ages! A must have in night time routine!
