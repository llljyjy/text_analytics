Main impression, it’s very fragrant. I could still smell it after an hour from application. The texture feels thin but as applied to the skin, it will feel a bit thick and sticky for five minutes until it gets absorbed. Observed nothing for a change but this is just my initial thought as I’ve only used it a few times from a sample. nan
