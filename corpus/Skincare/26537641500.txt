This cleanser is gentle, but really effective in cleansing my face and removing all my makeup. I was skeptical about it being hydrating but it really leaves my face feeling smooth and not dried out at all!! I use it alone in the morning and also as the first step of my double cleanse routine at night. A little goes a long way with this cleanser, I totally recommend it!!! Will be repurchasing!!
