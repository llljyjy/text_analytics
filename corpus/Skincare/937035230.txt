I have used this cleanser for about a week and it is ok. It did not have an outstanding effect on my skin. In the spirit of exfoliating cleanser, I’ve been using Dr. Hauschka’s Cleansing Cream and it has transformed my skin. It makes my skin glow, leaving it cleansed but not too tight. The glow was immediate after using it. And it costs much less than price of Tata Harper. Not worth the price!
