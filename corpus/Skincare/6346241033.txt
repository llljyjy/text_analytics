I received a sample of this eye cream from influenster in exchange for an honest review. I am very knowledgeable about skin care and have tried countless brands with all different types of active ingredients. I am blown away with this eye cream by Estée Lauder. The texture was like a gel that absorbed so easily and nicely. A little goes a long way. I immediately felt the hydration it gave my under eye and helped reduce lines, wrinkles, dryness and helped depuff. It feels like heaven on! It didn’t irritate my sensitive eyes and worked great as a primer before putting on concealer. I highly recommend this cream for all skin types and will now be purchasing the full size, the price seems absolutely worth it! Pleasantly surprised!
