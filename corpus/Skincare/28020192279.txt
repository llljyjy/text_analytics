i wouldnt have bought this myself bc of the price but my sister got it for me and i looovveeee it. the first tjme i used it my skin felt insanely smooth and looked very glowy. it only takes 60 seconds too which is amazing bc my other mask usually take 10-15 mins. the applicator isnt very rough and is stretchy, i thought it would be too rough for my skin but its perfect (just dont scrub too hard). i only use a drop on the wet applicator once a week so itll last a long time. if u can get past the price this is completely worth it SMOOTH SKIN
