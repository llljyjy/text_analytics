I received a sample from INFLUENSTER in exchange for my honest review. I am really impressed with this moisturizer. The consistency is thick and it is very hydrating. Even though it’s thick, it does not feel heavy on your skin. It’s perfect for these colder months where my skin tends to be dry. I have combination oily skin and I do not feel greasy. There is a scent it’s but not strong at all. After some time, my skin definitely feels firmer and more hydrated. I really like the formula and will continue to use this. The Real Deal!
