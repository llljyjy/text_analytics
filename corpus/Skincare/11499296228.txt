This product was sent for free as a promotion in exchange for an honest review. Gifted by Jose Maran.I am thoroughly impressed!! I have a light-medium skin tone and this product leaves NO cast for me. Not even a hint of one.It leaves my skin feeling supple, hydrated, and slightly dewy. I was worried this would cause an allergic reaction and acne due to fragrances and coconut oil, but Iâ€™m pleased to report neither. I enjoy the scent greatly as it reminds me of fruity peebles cereal (in a grown up, delicate way). This one looks nice under makeup too. So happy to have had the ability to try this one! I love the glass packaging and pump as well. 10/10 from me. Lovely
