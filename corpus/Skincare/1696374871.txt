This moisturizer is so amazing that I’m in absolute awe and can’t stop staring at my skin! I’m also slightly annoyed I didn’t discover it earlier. I’ve worked in the beauty industry for over 20 years, and have tried countless products. This moisturizer is now my ride or die, and moisturizers 5x its price don’t even come close to this magic! Ok, let’s start with the texture- divine! Rich, emollient, yet somehow has a luxurious weightlessness about it. The packaging- gorgeous, luxe yet elegant- and it’s refillable! The ingredients are all certified organic and until I researched this, I didn’t realize the massive difference between the claim of “Clean”versus “Certified Organic” -it blew my mind but makes complete sense as to why it’s so effective. Lastly but most importantly, THE RESULTS!!! Be warned, this moisturizer will give you the glowy, ethereal complexion of a goddess and it certainly will turn heads. I’m not kidding, after just a week of use I’ve gotten more compliments on my skin than I can remember and I’m using less foundation, and some days skipping it all together. TRY THIS, YOU’LL LOVE IT! (My skin is normal to dry and I like a richer versus a lighter moisturizer for context) So grateful I’ve found Kora Organics products- I will be ordering the entire regimen! THE REAL DEAL! WOW, I’M OBSESSED!
