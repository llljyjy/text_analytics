First thing I noticed is that this is truly scentless. Most non fragrance products have at least a little smell but this doesn’t which is nice. The packaging is smooth and simple which I like as it doesn’t come across as overselling the product. I love that this is a gel. I’ve never used one like this before, but i absolutely love how far a little bit goes. This is truly only a pea sized amount and it easily glides over your whole face unlike other moisturizers where I’ve had to use big globs. My face feels smooth and buttery after using it which I also love. Will definitely be making this a regular part of my routine. Love love love
