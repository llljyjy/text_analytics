I received this product free to write an honest review. This cream confuses me. Is it a face, body or hand cream. I guess all three. I find it basic. Nothing wows me about itâ€™s performance. Extremely expensive for what it is. Not much to go on based on advertisement & appears limited edition. I would expect unique skincare ingredients for the price. Unscented, not too oily/greasy. Just basic. nan
