This dark mousse is legit! I got it for a recent beach trip. The pump needs to stay up right like some said or it leaks, but the dark tan looks fairly natural on me. I’ve gotten a lot of compliments on how tan I am!! There’s no big mess and simple to apply with a mit.Apply with the mit and a rubber glove for sure! I apply it about an hour or two before bed. Apply and let it dry for about 30 minutes and you can put your pjs on. It’s nontransferable!! I go to bed and wake up tan the next morning.Even if you miss a spot or two, you can re-up and have a fairly seamless match from the first application. Come thru Isle of Paradise
