Beautiful bottle I don’t hate leaving it out on my vanity! Only downfall is it’s glass so I’m scared to take it with me, and I really want to. It feels so good on my skin I use it to prep and set and my makeup stays all day. Doesn’t give me a shine or make me overly matte like other sprays. Looks good feels good!
