Finding an eye cream that actually works, for wrinkles and anti-aging, is like finding a unicorn. I thought I was in unicorn heaven until about week 3 of using this, by itself, for my eyes twice a day. First the good stuff; this is a lightweight cream that sinks into that thin orbital skin and helps with wrinkles and flakes both under eye and on the eyelid. After letting it sink in, I used my usual Touche Eclat for undereye and it applied well and lasted all day. Moreover, it got rid of the flakes and deeper wrinkles on my eyelid, which made my eyeshadows apply beautifully. This was almost my Holy Grail, until I started to get milia in that eye area. I’ve had milia before, but never in skin this delicate. I was able to work them out with the help of a needle, but seriously, don’t try that yourselves. I’ve had 3 milia now, and the eye cream is the only thing that could be causing them. It was the only change I’ve made. They hit without any makeup too. So be advised. There is a risk with this product.Also, if any of you are as sick of 25 year old influenster reviews for anti aging products, please give this review a “like“. I’m sick of them. No 25 year old needs anti aging products. Nor can they review them with any helpful info. As a woman I wouldn’t review a jockstrap, so why are 20 something kids reviewing anti aging stuff. It’s a major time waster. Plus it clogs the threads so the rest of us have to search for real, honest reviews. In fact, the minute I see the word “influenster“ I change the page. Won’t buy that stuff. How about you? On the Fence
