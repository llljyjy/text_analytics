Im about a month into using this product for my dry, sensitive, acne prone skin and I’m loooooving it. Works best when I layer with a serum and seal it with an oil. It’s helped with irritation from both retinol and sunscreen and hasn’t given me any acne. The pump releases a lot of product - I find half a pump is usually enough for me! only use a half pump at a time
