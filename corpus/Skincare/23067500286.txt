I loved this Lancome Absolue Revitalizing Eye Cream. This is by far the best eye cream I have used so far. It only takes a little bit to go a long way. I noticed after 4 weeks of using this that my eyes had lost puffiness and looked firmer. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a revitalizing new eye cream! Awesome Eye Cream!
