Love the actual product. It is super liquidy though so it can get messy but omg the packaging is HORRIBLE. Peels off and gets stuck to your fingers and then it gets on your face. Ridiculous for the price. Just fix the packaging and it will be great! If not, I won’t be purchasing again bc it’s not worth it. Great product, horrible packaging
