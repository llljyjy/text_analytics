I was so excited to try this product and add it to my Drunk Elephant collection! I’ve been using it every night for 2 weeks and although I haven’t used any retinol product before, this oil has been so gentle and I haven’t had any sensitivity issues! I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to start getting into retinol without being too aggressive. The packaging is great and I love the dropper. I combine it with the lala retro moisturizer and my skin feels so smooth in the morning!! Great Introduction to Retinol
