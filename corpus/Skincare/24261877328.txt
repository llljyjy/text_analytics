This stuff is amazing. I got it in the Laneige birthday gift set as a freebie and I didnâ€™t expect to like it this much. I notoriously have very tough chapped lips in the winter months being that I live in a climate that gets extremely cold in the winter. I used to slather on chapstick and use scrubs but no luck. Within a day or two this stuff made my lips feel baby soft and took all of the dry hard patches away. I will certainly be buying this again as I think it is well worth the money. An absolute must for hard cracked dry winter lips
