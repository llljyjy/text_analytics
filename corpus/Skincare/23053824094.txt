I’m in love with this sunscreen, I’ve been trying it for almost a month and it’s really not greasy but moisturizing, it absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave that white layer on the skin, it also helps control oil and mattifies the skin and is compatible with makeup .  The container is quite practical, it does not have a lid, it seems to me a good product, I would buy it again.  I received this product as a free sample to give my honest opinion. Ideal for oily/combination skin
