This cream is very nourishing to the skin!My skin is super dry and takes 2 pumps of cream to feel completely moisturized but if you have dry or normal skin type then 1 pump should be more than enough as it applies nicely onto the skin! It also does feel very refreshing once applied! Super Refreshing And Good For Super Dry Skin!
