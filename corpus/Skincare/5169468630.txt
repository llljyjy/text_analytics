I just purchased my first lip mask from this brand & Iâ€™m so happy I finally caved in. This mango mask scent is not overbearing, and has a more authentic mango scent. It keeps my lips hydrated, gets rid of lines on my lips and overall glides on the lips. I definitely will repurchase when I finish. amazing purchase
