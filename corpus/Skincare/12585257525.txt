Omg this is AWFUL!!! “Gentle” doesn’t have to be “non cleansing”. My skin has never felt dirtier and oilier than after using this gross product for a couple weeks. I may as well not even be washing my face at all! I have broken out as if I was going through puberty again! I’m 44 this should not be happening. Not only does it not clean your face but it adds too much fragrance to it. Hard pass on this one. Sticking to my Farmacy Whipped Greens. Worst
