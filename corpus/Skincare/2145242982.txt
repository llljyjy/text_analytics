Really like this moisturizer. It’s the perfect consistency, thick but doesn’t feel heavy or sit on the skin. I normally don’t love these pump dispensers because I always feel like I’m left with wasted product, but this has an easy twist off top as well as the pump so you can easily access any left over product that won’t come out of the pump. I removed one star because the scent is just too strong for me. It also reminds me of a drink or flavored alcohol I used to have in university blah.  A softer scent would be perfect. nan
