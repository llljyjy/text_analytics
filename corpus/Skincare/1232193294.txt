So happy with the sunscreen. I have 3 different sunscreens that I like to use and this is the only one I reapply over and over throughout the day. I’m in my car a lot, driving between my work locations and this is the perfect top up. I was initially scared to leave it in the car thinking it would melt, however it doesn’t at all. I have been using retinol and moisturize pretty well in the am, but I tend to get drier throughout the day, this adds the moisture back to my skin also and feels soothing. nan
