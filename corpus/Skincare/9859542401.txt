I fell in love with the Milk Marvel serum, so my expectations for this product were high. Yet, it still beat those expectations. My skin had broken out a lot over the past few months since I relocated to a new city. Which left more dark spots than normal, but this product helped lightened them tremendously within a month. Itâ€™s also not too heavy and perfect for individuals with oily/acne-prone skin. nan
