I’ve been using this product for a few weeks now as a courtesy of a free sample program to get the true results from it and I can say that I do see a difference from when I consistently use it versus when I don’t. It makes my skin look plump and full.. I like to use this toner for the nighttime mainly but every now and then I’ll apply during the day. I also enjoy that the product does not have a strong scent and that the packaging is safe for travel. Very good product
