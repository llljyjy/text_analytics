I have mixed feelings about this product. I love that’s it’s extremely lightweight, doesn’t leave me feeling oily, and the price is great! However, I cannot get past the smell, it’s so gross. If you’re not bothered by the smell of products then I definitely recommend this moisturizer, but personally it’s not for me. Great moisturizer, hate the smell!
