I received right after Christmas and have only been using for around a week. Therefore, I haven’t seen any benefits yet. I believe in order to see the benefits of this product you need to be using consistently for at least 6-8 weeks. A plus is I have not had a breakout nor have any sensitivity issues. The oil is light enough to put on before your moisturizer. I have been mixing 3 drops with mine however as I believe it goes on much easier and is mixed in with the product. I’m giving this a 4 star rating because I have not seen the long term benefits of using this product. Additionally, the dropper is nice but the top of the dropper where you press to release the oil has turned yellow after using for a week. Other than that, I think this would be a good product to use if you’re thinking about using retinol but want something that still is moisturizing and more lightweight. Think of it as a gateway product before starting on the big guns. Moisturizing and Lightweight
