I really have enjoyed this. It is my first retinol, and it has not made me peel or break out at all. The lines seem to be slowly fading on my second bottle now. I do this every other night and it has felt very comfortable so far! I highly recommend.  I have very sensitive skin so I am impressed with this! I have no idea if it will be a cure-all to my 37 year old wrinkles, but it has given some improvement after a couple months nan
