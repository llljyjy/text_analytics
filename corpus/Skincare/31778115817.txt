This Essential Energy Hydrating  Cream from Shiseido absorbs fast into the skin without leaving greasy residue. My skin felt softer after use. And, most of all I love how it has SPF without that SPF smell. Plus the packaging is gorgeous! I was gifted this product free to review by Influenster and Sephora. Absorbs fast, non greasy! No SPF smell!
