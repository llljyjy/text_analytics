I’ve repurchased this product 3 times because it’s just so good! I have combo, sensitive, acne prone skin & this has been a lifesaver. My skin gets extremely dry in the winter & this hydrates it perfectly without making me look greasey. It has a very lightweight texture that disappears into the skin while leaving it smooth and plump. It gives my skin such a natural glow & doesn’t pill at all, so it sits well under makeup. My only issue is how small the bottle is, but honestly compared to other prices I can’t complain! nan
