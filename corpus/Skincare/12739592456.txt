I was excited to receive this product from Influenster because I had just finished the same sample that I got from somewhere else! So using two samples I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on it. I really enjoyed this moisturizer. It didnâ€™t irritate my skin or cause any breakouts. My skin felt nicely moisturized, even the next morning. I took one star off because the price is really high. I think you can find a comparable moisturizer at a better price point. Really nice!
