So far I have used it three times a week for about two weeks and I have enjoyed seeing the results of using this overnight moisturizing mask. A little bit of this product goes a long way and it is now incorporated in my nighttime skin care routine 3 to 4 times a week. Itâ€™s a very dry winter in New York City this year which makes my skin more dry and this has been the perfect addition to add more moisture to my skin highly recommended for dry skin
