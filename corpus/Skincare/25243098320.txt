This product was gifted by innisfree, but I honestly enjoyed this moisturizer! I donâ€™t like anything too heavy, and the jelly consistency was good for me. It leave my face feeling tacky which I also liked (perfect for applying makeup after). The little spoon it comes with is so cute too. Super lightweight and moisturizing!
