I received this product to sample for a free sample program. This product smells amazing and has many great skin benefits including vitamin E to nourish and strengthen skin, coconut and baobab oils, shea and cocoa butters, and plantain extract. All of these ingredients helped soothe my skin, but I noticed it was a little drying. I have oily skin so it wasnâ€™t terrible, but for someone who has very dry skin this might be too harsh. Excellent Smell!
