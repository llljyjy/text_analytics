I’m not going to give this a bad review because couldn’t give it a fair shake. I have sensitive skin and sadly this is something in this formula that irritates my skin and caused little bumps all over it. I have used other vitamin c and niacinimide serums and never had an issue before so I’m not sure what cause my reaction. Not great for sensitive skin
