I used this product for the past few weeks to help remove my makeup. I love the way it feels on my skin. It does have a natural oil smell to it and I’m pretty sure it’s not non-comedogenic be careful if you have problems in that area. Although it did a great job of removing my make up and my sunscreen, I did feel it left a residue so I continued to wash my face with my normal face wash. I did receive this product for free in return for my review. Gets the job done.
