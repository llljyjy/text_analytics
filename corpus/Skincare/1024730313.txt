I got this as a sample while I was walking through Sephora. I tried it. I do NOT like it. After I put it on, my hands have this coating all over them. I had to wash my hands two times to get the film off. Then I realized I have the same film all over my face. I am not at all surprised people are breaking out with this. I expected it to be like a barrier repair product but it just feels like I’m wearing a coating. I received 3 samples, I tried one, and I’ll toss the other two. Ugh ew
