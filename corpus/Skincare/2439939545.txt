I just tried out this daily cleanser by Dermalogica for the first time. I use some of their other products, such as their daily moisturizer. I like how lightweight the product feels on my skin. I also enjoy they mild scent the cleanser has, as I do not like to use perfumed products on my face. I will definitely be using this cleanser at least once a day as part of my skincare routine!
