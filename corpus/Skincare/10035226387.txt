I received this as a sample. I like other samples they actually give you enough to try it for a few days. I really love the feel of the product. It’s great for my dry skin. However, it has a very strong fragrance. So strong that it makes my eyes burn when I initially apply it. I wouldn’t buy it because of that Good product too much fragrance
