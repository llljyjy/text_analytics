Dr.Dennis Gross Vitamin C Dewy Deep Cream has changed my dry skin. I have been using this day and night and wow, the improvement in my face. It wears really well under makeup just make sure you give it enough time to sink into your skin, and yes it leaves a bit of a tacky feeling, but during the day I always put sunscreen over top of this. I have had absolutely no sensitivity at all. If you are looking for a good hydrating Vitamin C Cream you definitely cannot go wrong with this one. The Hydration in This!!
