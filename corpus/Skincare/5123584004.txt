What a wonderful surprising product this was! I have a very routine nighttime routine that I don’t usually deviate from in terms of types of products I use. Incorporating an oil based serum was newer to me. I used this before moisturizing and was blown away. My skin looked and felt so healthy when I woke after each use. I’ve used it by itself too with the same results. Love love love! nan
