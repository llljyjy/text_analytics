So I did NOT receive this product as a gift or promotion—I merely read the verified reviews and thought I’d give it a shot. Holy SMOKES, this stuff works miracles!! Truly, I have struggled badly with pustule rosacea flare-ups this year which look like acne but can’t be treated with harsh, drying ingredients. This product contains two of the best ingredients for my rosacea acne in a formula that has actually worked visible wonders on my skin in just 4 uses. In fact, I would say I noticed results literally overnight the first time I applied this product to my problem areas. Now I use it all over about 2x/week to keep my face bright, glowing, and best of all—CLEAR! (The photos are my most recent pics before using this booster and then after 1 (yes o-n-e) use!) A literal MIRACLE.
