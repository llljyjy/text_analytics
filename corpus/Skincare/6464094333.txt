This was my first time trying self Tanner so my experience may different. I have a natural tan to my skin, so I’m not super pale but I feel like this left a weird green tint to my skin. It was easy to use and felt okay but it definitely didn’t match evenly with the rest of my body. It does wash off pretty easily so if you need to redo it, you definitely can. Good Starter Tan
