Honestly, the product itself is not sticky, thick & long lasting. The scent is quite delicate, the reason this product didn’t work for me is mainly because of the oil like coating it’d leave on my tongue (i have a bad habit of licking my lips) for that reason it won’t be a product I’m reaching for in the future. Good product, just didn’t work for me
