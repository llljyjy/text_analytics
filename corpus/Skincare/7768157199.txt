I have been using this for a few months now and I absolutely love this product! It has a great vanilla smell. The applicator allows the product to glide on easily. The lip balm is not too heavy and stays on through eating and drinking. Also, it has SPF so it is perfect for on the go. It is honestly my favorite lip product at the moment and I use it every day. A must have in my lip-care routine!
