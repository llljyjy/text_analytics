I tested this cream every day for almost 2 weeks. I would say that it’s more of a heavy serum, or very light moisturizer in terms of consistency. I have enjoyed using this as a second serum, or beneath a very intensive facial mask or oil. It does not pill, it melts into the skin easily and wonderfully, and actually smooths out your skin tone and texture. I could definitely tell a difference when I had no make up on if I was using this. It contains salicylic acid, great for fighting acne and skin exfoliation. I do think I saw a reduction in like tiny bumps and acne while using this product. But I don’t think it was strong enough to fight off my menstrual breakouts. Not by itself Great Cream Serum
