The packaging of this moisturizer is very chic. I love that this moisturizer is super hydrating and does not leave a white cast on my face or oily residue as compared to other SPF moisturizers. Little to no scent, which I love and perfect for sensitive skin. Makeup glides right on when applied! Best Moisturizer with SPF
