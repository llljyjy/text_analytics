Bought it for hyperpigmentation areas, which is did not help, however after reading other reviews I saw that it helped blemishes on some. Last night I used it on my cystic acne along my jawline and it tremendously cleared up an area, over night, thatâ€™s been getting worse over the past month. I will continue to use it for blemishes/acne. nan
