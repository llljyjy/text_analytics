This moisturizer is very lightweight and is perfect for the summertime. It has a nice gel-like consistency and I also love that it uses clean ingredients. Doesnâ€™t leave a greasy or oily residue so I think this would be great for people with oilier skin types. My skin is a little on the dryer side but I think this is a great one for the warmer months! Great summer moisturizer
