received a free sample. nothing exceptional about this serum. it had a very mild scent (almost non existent) which was nice, and the finish had a nice glow. I did find it a bit sticky, but using it on a slightly damp face and not using too much product seem to help. I probably wouldn’t purchase a full size, but it’s not a horrible product nan
