Talk about a miracle product! I’m in my early 30s and my skin is definitely changing. While I no longer deal with a lot of acne, I’m noticing a lot more texture and discoloration with my skin. As a woman of color I’m always nervous about averse reactions to trying new skincare and make up products because I scar easily and hate using products meant to clear my complexion that end up making it worse. I’ve been using this for about two weeks and I already see a very drastic difference in the smoothness of my skin and the overall feeling of moisture and suppleness. I received this product for review and I honestly feel very lucky because I’ve had such a great reaction with a much brighter an even complexion in such a short time with this luxury product. 10 out of 10 I would recommend to anyone interested in improving the texture, tone, brightness, and overall look of your skin! nan
