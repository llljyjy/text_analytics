I loved this #complimentary serum more than I had expected! With it being winter, my skin dries out easily if I don’t keep a consistent moisturizing routine. I’ve been using this serum for about a month and no dry skin! I’m not so sure about the “plumping“ claim, but I do notice immediate hydration which could appear that way. It has also not caused any increase in breakouts either, which is a HUGE plus! I definitely recommend this to anyone else that wants a smooth, hydrated, fresh look for their skin! Instant hydration!
