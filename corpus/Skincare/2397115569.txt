I like the thick, creamy consistency that makes it easy to apply. It has a very mild scent which is lovely! After using it a few days, morning and evening, I noticed my circles weren’t as dark and my eyes weren’t as puffy. It definitely moisturizer well making my complexion brighter and smoother. Since my eyes looked better I tried it all over my face! My skin is softer,smoother and visibly brighter! It really eorks!
