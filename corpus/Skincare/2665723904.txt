This moisturizer definitely hydrates well. It’s very thick and noticed it decreases the look of fine lines on my forehead. It smells a bit odd, fruity like artificial blueberry. Not offensive but not my favorite scent for skincare. I do like that it’s “clean” in terms of ingredients. I have had some minor breakouts on my chin in the form of clogged pores but am not sure if it’s related to this moisturizer or not. nan
