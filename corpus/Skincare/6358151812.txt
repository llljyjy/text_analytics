I was so excited to try these products, and the face wash is amazing and works for my face, it smells so good very similar to the fresh soy face wash. I love the gel and how it foams up it feels SO luxurious. However the day cream broke me out which I checked the ingredients and it is not good. But the night mask shouldn’t have broke me out but it still did- I was so sad. But I just have extremely sensitive skin so this would prob work for anyone else’s skin. The face wash is amazing though and a great value so I will repurchase the face wash but not the small cream and mask. So one hit and two misses. But keep in mind higher end products still have these odds (for me at least). not for sensitive skin
