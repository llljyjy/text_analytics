i LOVE this sunscreen, probably a new fave, i thought the scent would bother but i actually really like it. It’s super light, makes my face look glowy, and not sticky at all. I might have to get the full size because i’m obsessed!!the only problem i had was with the moisturizer it came with, unfortunately it gave me a small rash around my mouth and it was super irritated :( Love the sunscreen so so much though !! new fave sunscreen!!!!
