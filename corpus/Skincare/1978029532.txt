Let me start by saying that I love tower 28 products, but this fell a bit short of my expectations.  Firstly, I donâ€™t see a huge difference between this and the facial spray. The spray is easier to use and seems (to me) to yield the same results. Secondly, the bottle is poorly designed and instead of pumping into my hand it squirts across the room, even with the slightest touch. I still love Tower 28 and applaud their innovative and clean products, however this was a miss for me.  I prefer the spray, but I will definitely keep (and use) the remaining product. Still a win as far as reducing redness and easing irritation. Like, not love.
