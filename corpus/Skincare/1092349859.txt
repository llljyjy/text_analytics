I’ve been using this as a part of a two-step lip care regimen. Add a tiny bit on your lips, wait until it dries a bit 30-60 seconds, then add some Vaseline over top. It’s honestly the best lip care I’ve ever done. It lasts pretty well all day, although I also use a lip balm with spf like once or twice a day, for what it’s worth. This two step system works better than anything I’ve tried- and I’ve tried a plethora of lip balms. nan
