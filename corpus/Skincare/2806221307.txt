I wanted so badly for this to work for me because everyone seems to love it. It feels lovely going on and fills in all the fine lines on my lips, but it doesn’t seem to do much else in the moisturizing department. When applied at night, I don’t see or feel any results in the morning - my lips will still feel dehydrated. I have better luck with cheaper petrolatum or lanolin-based treatments. not for me.
