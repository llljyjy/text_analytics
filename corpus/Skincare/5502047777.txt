I got a sample size complimentary from Influenster for my honest review. I have combination skin, but during winter is more prone to been dry. I’ve been using this for about 3 weeks and I use it after putting my serum and it’s helped my skin feel moisturized. I didn’t notice any other changes on my skin besides not feeling dry. Not sure if I would recommend it as it seems too expensive for just moisturizing your skin. nan
