I have major fine lines on my forehead. That is what I was using this product to target. This serum was easy to apply morning and night. It didn’t leave my skin feeling sticky or greasy. I thought this really made my skin feel soft. While I can notice a little difference in my fine lines, it wasn’t a huge difference like I was hoping. I will continue to use this serum though. Love the way this makes my skin feel.
