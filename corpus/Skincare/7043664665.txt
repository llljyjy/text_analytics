I love the product but not a fan of the pump/dispenser. Not sure if all are like this but mine shoots out product quite fast and sometimes it goes in a different direction, missing my fingers. The product itself absorbs nicely and my skin feels hydrated. Would buy again, just wish I liked the dispenser more. nan
