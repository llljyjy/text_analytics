I tried this product for Influenster. I have dry skin patches on my face. It worked great on those and they were gone within couple days. The product is thick and doesn’t require very much to cover whole face. It’s good under make up or even at night before bed. I have sensitive skin and it didn’t bother my skin. It has very light scent. I would purchase this and have suggested it my friends. nan
