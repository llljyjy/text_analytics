I like this one, itâ€™s better than the original one that is a little thicker.  A little goes a long way. Like others have mentioned, I use this on my no makeup days. I focus on the areas that are red and have imperfections. I have notice an improvement in my skin it looks clear and dark spots are less. This one does not cause me to get oily and it does stay on.  I do use moisturizer underneath, I like this one better then the original one
