This “cloud crème” is a perfect hydrating cream to wear at night. It is a thick consistency and is a perfect cover after a nighttime routine. I cleanse my face, add serum and this moisturizer is the final touch. Plumps and replenishes skin over night. Contains Omega 3&6 oils. Love the gentle lavender smell to help with sleep-mode. As I’ve reached my 50’s, I need extra nourishment for my skin and will be using this cream 100%! Perfect Nourishing Nighttime Cream
