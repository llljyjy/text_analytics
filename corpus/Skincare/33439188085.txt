I was gifted this Water Sleeping mask by Laneige as a #freeproduct from Topbox. I’ve used their lip sleeping mask before and it works wonders. So, I was super excited to give this a try, just in time for the dry winter air here! And I wasn’t disappointed. I’ve used it twice a week the past few weeks, leaving it on overnight and I’ve already noticed my skin is always super hydrated and soft after using it. The mask is gel-like, easy to apply and comes with an small spoon. Definitely recommend this. nan
