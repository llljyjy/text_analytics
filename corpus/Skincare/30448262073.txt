I was expecting a bit more from the product but I’m not disappointed at all. Al though it only made a tiny difference on the texture wise, my skin feels smooth and clean after using it. It doesn’t feel drying at all either! I didn’t know it could also be used as a deodorant until after I read the reviews, but it works!! I was pleasantly surprised. I think it made my underarms a bit brighter too. nan
