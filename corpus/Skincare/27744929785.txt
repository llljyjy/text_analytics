This brightening cream smells lovely and goes on lightly. I love the fresh tingling feeling that happens right when you put it on. It moisturizes well and does brighten my skin; however itâ€™s a bit too harsh on my sensitive facial skin and leaves it a bit reddened. Too harsh for daily use for me. I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. nan
