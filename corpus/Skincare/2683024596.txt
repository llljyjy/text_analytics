Extremely impressed with this beautiful product! Not only is the packaging stunning but the product definitely met all my expectations. It’s super lightweight texture wise like an essence and it’s super hydrating and glowy, I start off my morning routine with a vitamin C serum and after it dries I shake up Great skin and dispense 2 pumps into the palm of my hand and press this into the skin, I felt that not only was it hydrating but it plumped and gave my face a gorgeous glow! I then followed with my spf and found that I didn’t need moisturizer! It looked so good under my minimalist foundation stick, and would be a great addition to your skincare and makeup routine. I love using this product and it couldn’t have came out at a better time than the most wonderful time of the year, Fall/Winter. 🍂 The Glow!
