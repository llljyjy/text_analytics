This gel moisturizer is very light and moisture. It is very nice to use it during night since it will hydrate your skin and very light. It will not only moisture your skin but also help you to feel relax. Overall it is a good moisturizer especially if you donâ€™t like cream texture. Gifted by Laneige for my honest review. nan
