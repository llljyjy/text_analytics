I thought I was going to really like this product but the truth is that I’m very disappointed. There are other well known brands that offers a better SPF protection and with way more product in it. It doesn’t have a pleasant scent, is very herbal but not in a relaxing, smooth way  it smells more like bug spray, like citronella if you like. I sprayed my face before going out, and after 10 min my eyes were burning and itching so bad, imagine this happening while you are driving cuz that’s what I was doing. I know other sunscreen also run and get into your eyes sometimes but this is a spray is hard for it not to get close to your eyes, and this has happened every time I use it. Not with the other brand I got to test. It’s really not worth the price but since I had to pay full price for it I’ll just use it if I don’t have to go far and definitely not driving. I would NOT recommend this product. Not worth the hype!
