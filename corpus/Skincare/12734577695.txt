This product does visibly plump up the skin and keeps the skin hydrated for 24hours straight, PERIOD. I am on a vacation in Cape Cod now, and I am using it everyday once in the morning. This place feels more dry than NJ. And, after all those cruising and hiking activities it still keeps the moisture locked to my skin. My skin feels soothing and healing (from maskne scars). So, I am a believer now! Thanks to Influenster for sending me yet another tub of this magic potion! nan
