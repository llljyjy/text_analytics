I got a complimentary sample to try and it really did help with the redness on my face. I am a huge face of toner, essence, and lotion “mists“ because they work really well for me and reducing redness as well as giving my skin that dewy feel. This essence/lotion from Estee Lauder is more of a thicker liquid compared to others that I have used. Before getting this sample, I was using their Super Pomegranate Lotion Light and that worked better for me because I have oily skin. That being said, if you have drier skin, this would be a better option, more also more expensive. Since I have oily skin, I mixed this with a niacinamide powder to help soak up the oil. Great for dry skin and reducing redness
