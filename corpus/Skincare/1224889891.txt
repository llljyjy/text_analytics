I used this product years ago when it first launched and loved it. My skin was getting dry so I thought I’d try it again. The texture now does not absorb, it just sits on your skin like the molecules are too big. It used to be fluffy but it would absorb. I kept using it anyways, remembering how muc I loved it before and hoping it do the trick but unfortunately I had a reaction like I’ve never had to a skincare product. Bumps everywhere I applied the cream. I’ve been using this as my moisturizer for about 5 days but it wasn’t until I applied it to my neck and chest did I realize what was happening. Do not buy this ..I love this brands other products like Luna and UFO but this cream is really bad. Reformulated? Bumpy skin reaction!
