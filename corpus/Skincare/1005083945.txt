So far have used this for just over 3 weeks, day and night. I like how this feels and how quickly it absorbs, and I am happy to say that my undereye area does appear to have maintained moisture and “bounce”. However, I have seen no changes in lines or darkness whatsoever. Lines could sometimes appear smoother, depending on makeup and other factors, but the dark circles remain unchanged. I received a sample and will finish it but won’t purchase, doesn’t feel worth the price. Just Okay
