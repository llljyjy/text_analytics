First- I’ll start off by saying I was skeptical about this product. Instant glow in a bottle is a big ask- but I’m here to tell you, this product delivers. I have sensitive / drier skin that absolutely eats up this product. The first couple days, I noticed an instant glow, perfect for the morning under makeup. After a couple more days I started to notice how deeply it was penetrating my skin, the bounce and elasticity started to return. And at the two week mark is when I REALLY started to realize how incredible this product was. I would wake up with glory skin, my texture significantly went away, my dullness was gone, and my face was youthful. I am in love with this product and will definitely repurchase and grab a couple for Christmas gifts! A must try!! highly recommend I was skeptical...
