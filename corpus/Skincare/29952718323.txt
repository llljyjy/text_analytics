I always have had dark and puffy undereyes but I have long accepted that it’s my fate and there’s nothing I can do about it however it doesn’t stop me from trying products that could reduce the appearance of it under make up and this one actually works! It’s never going away but the darkness is visibly reduced and it looks so much brighter under concealer. Great packaging, great product that actually works
