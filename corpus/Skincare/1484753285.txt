I really enjoyed the texture of this moisturizer. It’s rich and creamy without heaviness and effortlessly blended into my skin. It feels so luxurious. It deeply hydrates my dry winter skin. No more dry patches around my chin:) plus, It has a light nice scent. The only reason for the 4 stars is because it’s a bit out of my price range. But if it was more affordable I would absolutely buy this. It’s a great quality hydrating moisturizer. Luxurious
