this year, the sun decided not to appear, and I have two sun protection products lying idle for testing. what a paradox! however, I was still able to experience the effect of these products on myself. the cream has a white color, almost imperceptibly and pleasantly smells like baby cream. It is well absorbed into the skin immediately after application, slightly brightening the skin tone. does not leave a sticky unpleasant layer. Skin is moisturized and soft after application. I consider the presence of hyaluronic acid in the composition to be a huge plus, a slight anti-aging effect is always useful. I also really liked the packaging, bright sunny colors cheer you up, and you can always carry a compact tube in your purse. So,I like this product,and will test it in summer for making my decision about itâ€™s protect activity Sunny protection
