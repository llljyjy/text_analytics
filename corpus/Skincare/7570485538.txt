Honestly, I LOVE this brand. Their moisturizers, all of them, are absolutely amazing. But, this cleanser is not my favorite, and I will not be repurchasing this product. It really doesn’t take off anything, especially sunscreen and mascara. I’m not a girl who wears a lot of makeup; so, I am a little disappointed. Buy the Clinique Take The Day Off instead.
