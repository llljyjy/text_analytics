I was so excited to try this product, but after only a few days of using this instead of my typical moisturizer it has my skin feeling horrible! My skin is patchy and red and rough and so irritated, I wanted to love this product so bad but itâ€™s a hard no for me! I only gave it two stars because the packaging is so pretty and the smell and consistency of the moisturizer is amazing. Not Great!
