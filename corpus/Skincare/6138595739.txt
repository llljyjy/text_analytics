I like this more than I thought I would! I was looking for a replacement of the Dior Creme De Rose lip balm I have missed so much since it’s been discontinued and watched a YouTube video where a gal said this was a dupe. I do not agree. This lip balm definitely has more of a glycerin-y feel to it than the Creme De Rose. It’s also not as creamy as the Dior. HOWEVER - I do think I love it just as much because the results are very similar. My lips are left truly petal soft and the moisture lasts a bit on my lips that are unbearably dry in the winter. It also has a great rose smell that I enjoy. Overall, 10/10! Nothing will ever compare to Dior, but this helps my lips out a ton and I will continue to use this! Dior dupe? No. Still great? YES!!
