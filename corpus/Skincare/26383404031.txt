I really like the YTTP spinach liquid cleanser so I figured I would try this out but I did not like it. The smell is nice and it did take off my makeup, but it left a slight residue after washing off with water, gave me noticeable eye sting, and eye fog after taking off my eye makeup. For the price, I did not expect these issues, and I ended up returning it. I much prefer the clinique, good molecules, and farmacy cleansing balm which give me none of these problems and emulsifies much better. Not worth it for the price
