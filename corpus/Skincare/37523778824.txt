Had something similar to this recommended to me and after doing research decided to try this one.  I’m so happy I did!!  I started to notice results in the first week and now, 3 weeks in, my skin has improved so much I can’t believe it.  Many of the fine lines I had before are gone and I’m noticing the larger pores I had on and around my nose are tightening.  I read somewhere not to use this in the same routine as some acids or vitamin C serums/creams so make sure to adjust your skin care routine appropriately.  Will definitely be purchasing again. Give it a try!
