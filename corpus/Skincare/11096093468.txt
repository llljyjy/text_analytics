Dry skin miracle! I started using this product a few weeks ago and omg. I use it right after cleansing and toner (and before my primer and make up) in the mornings and it is amazing. It moisturizes so much and I was afraid it might break up my make up throughout the day but it doesnâ€™t even crease it. It leaves skin feeling so moisturized, dewy and plump, even after makeup it leaves my usually dry skin with a beautiful glow. 1000% recommend. Another win for The Ordinary brand. if you have dry skin, get this!!
