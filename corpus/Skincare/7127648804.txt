I started using this product with a few small pimples on my forehead and hoped this cleanser would reduce them and perhaps clear up any dark spots. I have combination skin for reference. The pros: great texture! The cleanser is thick and creamy and is easy to use. A little goes a long way.The cons: broke my skin out terribly. I had to stop using it after three days and that was unfortunate. Great Texture, Terrible For My Skin
