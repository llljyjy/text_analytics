I was excited to receive this for product testing and review, but the results were just ok. I’ve been using it for several weeks now.  It does sting a little when you first apply it- and that is mentioned on the packaging.  I did like the way my skin looked right after applying, but overall, I didn’t notice a huge difference.  It was a little drying for my skin, and I had a couple significant breakouts while using it.  I don’t know if the breakouts were due to the product, or just coincidence.  I may try it on a few dark spots on my arms, but I likely would not purchase another bottle. It was OK
