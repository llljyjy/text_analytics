2 stars because it is a decent color and lasts a long time. Also 2 stars because no matter what I do I have terrible streaks in the most random places and it takes a long time to fade so there’s that. I’ve used many many different tanning products from gradual tans, to instant spray tans, and more, and this is probably my least favorite. I keep reaching for it anyway hoping for a different outcome because I do find it to be moisturizing so I enjoy putting it on, but I end up disappointed everytime. Save your $$$$. Buy something else. it really is bad
