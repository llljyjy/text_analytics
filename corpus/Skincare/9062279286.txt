The Sephora Prebiotic Clean Skin Gel is so wonderful. This gel cleanser is moisturizing with prebiotics and aloe vera. I really love that it removes my makeup and I can wash my eyes with it as well. That’s actually really important to me. There is no scent and it’s so gentle on my acne prone, dry sensitive skin. I really love this gel cleanser and would recommend it to everyone. Fantastic Gel Cleanser for everyone!!!
