I’m extremely picky when it comes to cleansers since I have extremely dry skin but am acne prone. I’ve been using this for the last 3 weeks and my skin has never been more clear. A little goes a long way since it foams up so a dime sized amount should do the job. My face doesn’t feel tight after and i’ve started to use it on my back/shoulders where I break out too. I’d love to see a body cleanser from this line! I’ll continue to recommend for anyone with acne prone skin or anyone who wants to fade post acne scars! nan
