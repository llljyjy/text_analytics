I’m ride or die for the tatcha water cream and I had just ran out when I got this moisturizer in and I’m so happy with it! I have combo skin and this is not oily and is super hydrating. The cherry on the cake is the spf! It’s so hard to find a good moisturizer with spf. This may just be my new holy grail. nan
