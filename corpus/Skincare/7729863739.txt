I got the Tula skin care eye balm by Influenster and I love it! I have a oily skin, so it’s hard to find a perfect eye balm for it. I’m glad that I use it, I can feel so many different in my dark circles under my eyes. I’m not sleeping so much, so after that, it becomes lighter in the mornings. I feel the probiotic is improving my skin and definitely I’ll keep it in my skincare routine. I would recommend it for people like me, with oily skin and is looking for a good eye balm. Fabulous!
