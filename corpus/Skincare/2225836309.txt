I loved the original berry lip mask so when I ran out I decided to purchase the gummy bear one to try a different scent. It is also amazing BUT it stains white bedding and pillow cases which is not ideal as a lip mask intended for sleeping. The stains do not wash out. I have to be more careful now to not have it come in contact with any bedding which is annoying. It is a great product overall, aside from the stains. The original scent one does not stain in my experience. I will definitely keep purchasing this product in the original scent, but will be avoiding this gummy bear one in the future! Amazing product but beware of stains
