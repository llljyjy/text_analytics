Feels amazing on the lips — such a great consistency! Made my lips feel soft and supple, which is great because this Indiana wind has made them so dry and chapped! Unfortunately, I’m pretty sensitive to scents, and the sweet oil smell of this made me too nauseous to wear it more than once. The scent didn’t bother my husband though! I would smell a tester in-store before purchase, but otherwise, it’s a great product that does what it says it’ll do! Soft Lips, but Unfortunate Smell!
