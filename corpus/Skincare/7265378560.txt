I have dry chapped lips not only in the wintertime but also in the summer. I am constantly applying ChapStick to relieve my lips. Since using this lip mask, I have noticed that I am using ChapStick a lot less. The sweet agave in the lip mask really helps hydrate my lips. I highly recommend if you have chapped lips like I do! :) Chapstick Who?
