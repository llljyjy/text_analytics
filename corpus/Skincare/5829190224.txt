I just purchased an eye cream at Sephora before receiving this complimentary in exchange for my honest review and I must say - I do like it. I haven’t noticed any difference in darkness or puffiness however the hydration is extremely nice and my make up seems to be going on a lot smoother. It isn’t sticky, which I love, and it glides on smooth with my metal tool. I would definitely repurchase! Not Bad!
