This is a really good product for spot treatment. I use it daily as a part of my nightcare skin and after 2-3 weeks I have seen noticeable difference. It doesn’t irritate or dry my skin which usually is a big problem with acne spot treatment products. I use to use two different products with BHA & Azelaic acid and this one has both so that’s a plus, give it a try I am sure you will like it. Great product for spot treatment
