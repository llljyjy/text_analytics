I received a 5 ml sample of this, which lasted roughly a week with daily use. I used it after cleansing, and before applying makeup. I have combo skin with dehydration, and I found I produced less oil after using this product, assuming because of the hyaluronic acid helping my skins dehydration, thus making my skin not desperate to counteract the dehydration with more oil production. I think I will be buying this, but the only reason I give it 4 stars is because it is a bit expensive, so I am going to try it as a secondary one to my original moisturizer, and use it every second day. No stickyness, no reactions to it, and less oil production because skin is way more hydrated. Worked well for my combo dehydrated skin
