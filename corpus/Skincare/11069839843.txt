I applied on half my face and a different serum on the other side at the same time. I realized this one was making my skin feel red and sensative and broke out 1 pimple. I never get pimples too so it’s kind of weird. I stopped using it I no longer have the sensativity and pimple. althought it feels nice putting it on, and delivers average results... it would be better if it wasn’t so pricy for a small bottle with a pump that forces me to punch it with my finger and make a chunk fly out LOL overall I think it’s pretty ok for majority of normal weathly skinned people. I’m just overly sensative skin type. nan
