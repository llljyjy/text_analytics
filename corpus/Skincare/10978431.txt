I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox in exchange for my review. I absolutely love Caudalie for being clean beauty that uses healthy ingredients plus itâ€™s cruelty free. This has no fragrance, another plus for me, metal applicator allowing for smooth product placement and distribution. My main issues are fine lines and puffiness. This eye cream is amazing for my concerns. My skin feels fresh and hydrated. Under eye concealer goes on smoothly with no creasing. I am happy I found a new favorite. Reduce fine lines and puffiness
