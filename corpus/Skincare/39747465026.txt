I’m so glad I tried this cleanser because it’s a new favorite for me!! I use it at the end of the day to help remove dirt and makeup from my day and it feels so clean and refreshing! It also helps hydrate my face again after wearing makeup for so long. I was not expecting the texture to be so smooth and creamy, and the little beads for gentle exfoliation make it even better. It doesn’t smell too strong and doesn’t leave any residue either. It’s the perfect start to a relaxing night! New favorite
