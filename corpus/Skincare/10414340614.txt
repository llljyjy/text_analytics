Just washed my face and had dry patches everywhere flaking off. Put on toner and decided to try this glow shot. Shook the bottle to mix the oil and it went on very lightweight. Didnâ€™t feel super greasy. All the dry patches instantly disappeared and it leaves this dewy glowing finish on your face. Holy heck, it looks like I just walked out of a spa facial. Would definitely recommend. Dewy spa finish
