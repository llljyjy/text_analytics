I have to admit that when I first received this item, I was not impressed. I have dry skin, so applying this moisturizer made my skin look dull. It is a lightweight moisturizer, and this aspect I loved. After using this product for one week, I decided that it was not for me. Then this thing happened... I chose to use this combined with facial oil. (Although I have dry skin, I hate when my skin looks and feels greasy. I prefer lightweight products that keep my skin hydrated all day.) This combination was perfect. This moisturizer helped dull down the oily look after applying the facial oil, and they both kept my skin hydrated throughout the day. Since trying those two products together, I have paired this moisturizer with other products that also make my skin look oily after applying, and they have all worked perfectly together. I donâ€™t know if I will purchase another when I run out of the Origins Matte Moisturizer. However, I am enjoying finally using the skincare products that (in the past) I have tossed to the side. I like it!
