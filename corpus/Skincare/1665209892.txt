I haven’t been compelled to write a review in a long time. I was a bit skeptical but the reviews really changed my mind so I thought I’d echo them. I have dry skin which I take exceptional care of. Even so, I often get dry patches that can be visible when I put makeup on. After a week of using this product my skin felt tighter and I thought it was dry, but it was super hydrated. It has changed the texture of my skin. My skin is tight, hydrated and makeup goes on flawlessly. Try it ! nan
