I loved this moisturizer but unfortunately I bought during the wrong time. I’m currently purging and my skin is extremely dry and peeling so this won’t do for now. I just finished the whole tub. As much as I love it , I won’t be buying it again. It’s a bit too pricey and the neutrogena water cream worked just as amazing for half the price. Great for combo skin
