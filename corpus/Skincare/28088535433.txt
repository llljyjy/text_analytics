I received this product in a free sample program. After using this product 2x a day for 2 months, I can say that I did not see significant changes in my skin. I did notice that after using this toner my skin would feel slightly more hydrated but it would not last / provide continued hydration like I hoped it would. The fragrance in this product is also extremely strong which I found to be irritating though I know others may not mind. Overall I would say there are other products with a more affordable price point which would provide the same or even better results. Not bad, but there are better alternatives
