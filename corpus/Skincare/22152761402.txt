It took me a while to get to write a review on this. I’ve been using it for quite a while now, as I got it soon after it launched. I’ve gone through different phases with this product. I’ve had situations when I’ve loved it and I’ve kinda disliked it, but my overall conclusion is that I love it. It is light, yet thicker than most toners, and you could probably get away with only wearing this on your skin in certain situations. What I don’t like about it is that sometimes it gives me the feeling of an uneven, kind of sticky texture. However, it does have a lot of nice products in it, it’s good under make up, it has niacinamide, and the packaging is big. It feels better than many other products with niacinamide. I’ve found that it works well on my body. I’ve been using it when my skin is slightly irritated by rubbing or after shaving. I’ve found a positive effect on my body and it actually feels softer there than on the face. For some reason it also helps if my skin is itchy. I would buy this even just to use on my body. It isn’t drying at all - my skin is quite dry and it doesn’t dry me out. I haven’t seen the pore-refining effect but I don’t really struggle with my pores most of the time anyway. I got it because it seemed like a unique formulation and I really wanted to try it. I just like it. You just gotta make sure to keep the upper part of the bottle clean, as the product touches its surface as it comes out. A little sticky, but good, non-drying,for body too
