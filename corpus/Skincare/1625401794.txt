I absolutely love the Farmacy cleanser but decided to try this one this time. First, it is very oily and feels like it takes forever to get off my skin when I’m washing it off. Second, it burns my eyes so bad every time I use it. Last, it doesn’t remove my eye makeup as easily as the farmacy brand. While it is more expensive than the farmacy brand the thing I do like about it is that you really need very little so the container will last a lot longer and that’s why I am giving it 3 stars. I really wanted to like it but my biggest complaint is that it burns my eyes and therefore, I will likely not repurchase in the future. burns eyes and very oily
