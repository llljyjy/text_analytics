When I first received this sunscreen my expectations were pretty high because of the quality of previous FAB products I had tried. It’s amazing! There’s a white cast when you first apply but it goes away quickly with no pilling. I have oily skin so it’s important that the products I put on my face don’t make me look shiny or greasy. This sunscreen doesn’t leave any oily residue and blends into my skin with no irritation. My only complaint is that the SPF isn’t higher but as most facial sunscreens on the market don’t exceed 30 SPF it’s not a dealbreaker for me.  I’ll definitely be repurchasing once I run out! Best sunscreen for sensitive skin!
