I have sensitive combination skin. My t zone gets a bit oily and my cheek area is usually dry. I get peroil dermatitis aswell. This stuff has made my face so even in texture and look smoother all over. I sometimes have the tiny bit of dryness on cheeks when I wake up but I exfoliate my cheeks once a week and it’s perfect. I have actually been using it morning and night, a little goes a long way. Velvety smooth feeling on my skin. Highly recommend trying if you have skin like me.I haven’t tried this threw the harsh winter yet, but so far so good and we’re heading into fall Highly recommend
