I like the look and feel of this eye cream. Although it’s not super hydrating so I do layer with a thicker moisturizer underneath. It has a slight brightening tint to it that makes the eye area look more awake. I don’t know if it’s making any long term impact of my dark under eye bags though. Will likely repurchase Good buy, not a magic fix though!
