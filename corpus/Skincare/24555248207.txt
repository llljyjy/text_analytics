I was super excited to receive the Estée Lauder DayWear Multi-Protection Anti-Oxidant 24H-Moisture Crème Broad Spectrum SPF 15. For a person having extremely dry and sensitive skin that turns chalky after every wash, this moisturizer is a blessing. It is extremely light and quenches your skin. The SPF is a huge plus. I even tried it as the base layer/primer with my Estée LauderDouble Wear Stay-in-Place Foundation and it worked great. Kept my face hydrated all day without caking up. I will love to add this to my everyday routine, except that the size of the product seems very tiny. Makes my skin feel real
