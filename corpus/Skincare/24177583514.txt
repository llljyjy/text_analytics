At first, I was nervous to use too much of the product in one go because I wasnâ€™t sure how much it would tan. However, it gives a very subtle and minimal tan if the lowest amount of recommended drops are used! I do like how it is a subtle tan and I never had to worry that it would leave streaks of color. nan
