I have oily-dehydrated skin that is starting to age, losing suppleness, and now that I’m getting older it’s leaning towards the drier side. I have tried all the skincare products out there. I immediately fell in love with this once I applied it. It alleviated all of my issues. I’m 38. Black skin. I don’t mind the smell
