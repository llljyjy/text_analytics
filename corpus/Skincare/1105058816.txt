Review of Estée Lauder’s New Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power CremeI received this moisturizer as a sample to try and give my honest opinion.  I really wish I’d had more than a tiny jar of this quite pricey cream to try. Without having more that 8 days worth of cream, I cannot honestly advise you, dear reader, as to whether I’d purchase this or not. But let’s talk about what I can tell you about this cream. The texture is thick & creamy, but feels light on the skin.  It is possible that this cream caused a new pimple on my chin, but that may have also been from re-starting Tretinoin. My face appeared more illuminated, but I did not notice a change in fine lines and wrinkles. This product has the typical Estée Lauder perfumy smell which is too strong for facial care products in my opinion. I felt a little like I was applying perfume to my face. Why?  Estée Lauder, why? Overall, it’s a fine cream, just nothing to write home about. #complimentary #EsteeLauderxInfluenster @esteelauder @influenster So-So Cream
