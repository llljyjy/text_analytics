so honestly… it could be just me. but this product did nothing for me. i wasn’t really looking for anything for fine lines or dark circles but i really just needed something to hydrate my under eyes so i decided to try this since i like the kiehls moisturizer. but thjs product did absolutely nothing for me. im also on accutane so my skin is bone dry right now but for the price i don’t think a little hydration is too much to ask for. nan
