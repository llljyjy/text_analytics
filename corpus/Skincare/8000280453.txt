Ok, I’m just going to get right into it......I love how it doesn’t make me feel oily. Works well under my concealer & gives you a natural glow. If that’s not your thing, a simple powder will do. Also, it’s light on fragrance. Which I love because I don’t like the smell of spf, especially on my face. I use this one daily and the waterproof one when doing sports or any kind of heavy activity. Awesome SPF
