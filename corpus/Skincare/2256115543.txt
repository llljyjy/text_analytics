I received this product complimentary in exchange for an honest review. I have dry skin so it didn’t work well with my skin. It did obviously help with minimization of pores (which is always good) This product would be great for someone with a more oily skin type. I’ll just use it after my moisturizer as a primer before foundation but I won’t be purchasing this product. not for dry skin
