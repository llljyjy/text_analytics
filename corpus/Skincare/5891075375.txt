I had used this product a few years ago and really liked it so was excited to try again. It does really help with eliminating darkness under the eye as I remember it always doing. It’s soothing but it does cause some dryness and flakiness under my eyes when transitioning into the product as I have sensitive under eyes. Vitamin C eye creams can be a bit hard but this is by far one of the ventless I’ve used. nan
