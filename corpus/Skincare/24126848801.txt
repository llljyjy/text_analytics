I love this for my hair ! I have bleached blonde hair and it not only repairs but it adds shine I use it in 4 ways :1) after shower, put a small amount to your damp ends, not roots as this will look greasy, and dry as needed2) as a hair mask overnight , add a bunch to your hair , wrap your hair with a bandana or a bunch on a pillow case you donâ€™t care about and wash the next day 3) when you are styling your hair in a bun to tame flyaways and add shine 4) when your hair is clean but you want to add a bit of shine , do not add it to your roots as it will look greasy Great for hair
