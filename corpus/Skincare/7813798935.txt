My skin type is normal to dry, pretty sensitive and can get irritated easily, and get hormonal acne on chin. I prefer light yet very hydrating moisturizers that are cooling and protect my skin from irritants (like weather, pollution, etc) as they tend to get very red.The texture is pretty lightweight and soft. It leaves my skin hydrated for about 5 hours which is impressive. If I want it to be richer, I add couple drops of rosehip oil. While it is lightweight, I feel as if there’s a protective barrier that isn’t greasy or oily; it feels really nice on the skin actually and my skin feels protected. I love the fact that it’s super cooling and it’s perfect after a steaming shower. I can say that it’s prevented my skin from getting irritated. Also no breakouts! As there’s no fragrance in this, the scent isn’t very pleasant, but almost dismissable. I prefer a nice smelling product lol so I add a drop of tea tree oil. but clearly this is a HUGE advantage for those sensitive to fragrances. I really appreciate the fact that all the ingredients are rated from 1-3 on the EWG danger scale and there are no “dangerous“ preservatives that can be found in almost all skincare products such as phenoxyethanol. And this is extremely affordable while being cosmetically elegant. Wow! Amazing moisturizer
