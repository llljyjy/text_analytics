The first few days of my 7 day samples were great, skin was glowly but by day 4 I started breaking out around my combo skin area ,so my nose and forehead. I do think the formula is really nice, definitely felt the serum tingling, it has a pleasant scent. However I think it would be better suited For a single skin type. nan
