I received this facial serum complimentary from influenster in exchange for my honest review of the product. I love Guerlain’s products so I was really excited to test this serum. When I first applied the serum I thought it felt a bit light but as I massaged the droplets into my skin I felt results instantly. The texture is was a bit runny as oppose to thick so I had to rub in quickly so I wouldn’t waste it. The golden specs and packaging are aesthetically pleasing, making the product worthy of top shelf display. I used the serum after shower before applying make up for best results. I was a bit paranoid that using it before bed thinking that it would absorb into my pillowcases. I adore the scent as well. It’s light, floral and airy. It’s a hint and doesn’t linger like many serums. Also, The dropper is glass and measures the correct amount for you. .. which I also loved. I would recommend this product as a self care treat. I think it’s a bit too delicate to use everyday. Guerlain’s abeille serum: new a self care secret
