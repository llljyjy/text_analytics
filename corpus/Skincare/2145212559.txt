I was really excited to try this... I have heard positive things about this and with the price tag I was very optimistic. I will say with 2 weeks of use in morning and night I feel a significant difference in texture, my skin is insanely soft and supple. As for fine line reduction I donâ€™t notice any difference unfortunately. I will continue to use the and buy again. I recommend giving it a try! I was really excited to try this...
