I received this Clinique serum from top box in exchange for a review. #FreeProduct.I serum had a lovely texture and it felt very nice on my skin - absrobed well and did not just sit on the top of my skin. No sticky residue either.  I wish the sample was bigger than a sachet as I would like to see the longer effects/results. I will definitely buy this product in the future. Not bad!
