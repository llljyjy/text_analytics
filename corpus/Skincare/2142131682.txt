I received this cream from Influenster for review. Normally, I’m a bit of a skincare snob and usually only purchase my products from skin spas. I’d heard so much about this cream that I thought I would give it a try. I love beautiful packaging and Magic Cream definitely has it! A heavy class jar with the classic rose gold lid. The box itself was very interesting as it was completely covered with writing! The cream itself has a thick, creamy, yet light consistency. The very subtle fragrance of white flowers is quite lovely. A little of this Magic Cream goes a VERY long way, so you will definitely be getting your monies worth! My skin feels smooth, supple and incredibly hydrated with use. I have oily skin and I have zero problems with this cream. It came with a Charlotte Tilbury serum sample that was enough for two uses. It was quite nice with a bold herbal scent. Whoa Ho Ho It's Magic!
