Iâ€™ve been using Premiere Cru The Cream for the past 14 days. I received it as a #freeproduct from Caudalie through #trywithtopbox in exchange for my honest opinion. The Cream has a faint, pleasant scent and is a nice, thick consistency (without being greasy). I added it to my morning skincare routine immediately after my favorite serum. I noticed on day one my skin was glowing, radiant, just full of life. My fine lines were hardly noticeable. My face feels smooth and overall great. I have combination sensitive skin and had no problems at all with The Cream. Great product! DIY FACELIFT
