I have been obsessed with this new spray serum from Kosas from the packaging to the formulation and the feeling of it on my skin! I have tried toner serums and oil serums, but not something as specific as this with it being a straight serum. I love the beautiful ombre glass packaging and the spray application makes it super easy to use. The nozzle is powerful enough that it sprays evenly in a few presses yet gentle enough that it doesn’t make the product drip out excessively. I was surprised at how easily it absorbed into the skin, and I’ve even tried layering it on a few times to get some extra hydration and glow. There was no pilling while layering nor was there piling with the conjunction of other products in my routine. It has a floral natural scent which I personally love and don’t find too often in a serum. I also love this because as someone who turned 25 last year, anti-aging is on my list. Collagen starts to decrease at 25 so ingredients like collagen, probiotics, and peptides are essential. The added proteins and amino acids will help strengthen my skin barrier (as someone who’s acne prone and tends to pick at their pimples - bad habit - I Know) and the Hyaluronic Acid will keep my skin plump and hydrated especially for the fall and winter months as a combo to oily skin girl (drier during the colder months). This serum is truly an all-in-one skin Saviour, and I will definitely continue to use it. It’s light enough to use during the summer months when my skin is a bit oily and it’s a product, I’d consider using for both my AM and PM Skin Routine. I’d honestly recommend this serum to anyone looking to reset or replenish their skin while having a fast, hygienic, and convenient way to apply it! A Must for Glowy & Hydrated Skin
