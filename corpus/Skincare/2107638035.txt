This essence was just ok. I tried this essence for about a month and found no difference in my skin. I do have dry to normal skin especially living in LOs Angeles, so I can take all the hydration I can get. But I didn’t feel like this product made much of a difference to my skin.For those reasons, I wouldn’t recommend for those with really dry skin ! Just ok essence
