I really liked this product! I was the most lightweight sunscreen I’ve ever tried, which is crucial for my acne prone face. It did leave a white cast but nothing too noticeable. I actually thought it made my skin look glowy and youthful instead of its usual dull look. I didn’t spend the entire day outside so i couldn’t test its Sun blocking ability, but for casual everyday use this is great! I really liked it!
