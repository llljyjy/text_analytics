great subtle coverage and of course the 50spf is awesome. Goes on easily with just your fingertips and blends well. The only thing is it definitely leaves a tacky feeling on your skin - which I prefer to the greasy feeling of most sunscreens, but I wish it just soaked in and didn’t feel at all. HOWEVER, since it is a pigment, essentially makeup, that’s not really a realistic expectation, so I still like it and prefer to use it over regular foundation! Lasts all day, too. Great solution if you want sun protection
