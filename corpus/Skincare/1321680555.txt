First let me say, I’m sooooo cheap. If I can save a buck I will. That said, these are worth every single penny and even if they were double the cost, they would still be a great value. They are super soft and non-irritating, unlike all of the other  cotton pads I’ve tried. Other types seem to give me a rash because they’re rough. Highly recommend these. nan
