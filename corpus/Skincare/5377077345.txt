I tried a sample sized tube that was a good size for traveling. It felt nice and hydrating going on, not too heavy or sticky, but the sun protection was basically non-existent. I applied it generously a few minutes before being outside in partly cloudy winter sun for about 2 hours, and still ended up getting a little pink on my nose and cheeks, which is far inferior to my normal SPF products. It also migrated towards my eyes and was a bit irritating, but not the worst I’ve ever felt. Won’t be purchasing the full size. nan
