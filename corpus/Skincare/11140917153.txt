I first used this face wash when it came as a free sample in a previous order, but I loved it so much I decided to buy it in a full size. My anxiety often causes me to pick at my face, and I have a fair amount of acne scars because of it. But I’ve been using this face wash for a couple of weeks now and I can literally see my scars fading and becoming smoother. I didn’t buy the face wash with the intention of helping my scarring, just wanted to try something new and liked the clean feeling the sample gave me, so this was a very unexpected but happy surprise. I would definitely recommend! Helped fade and smooth out my acne scars
