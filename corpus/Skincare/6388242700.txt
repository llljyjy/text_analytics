I usually get a few blemishes during my time of the month so I applied this treatment at night when the first blemish began to pop up and I was impressed! The texture is a very thin gel and doesn’t take long to absorb. I do get a little tingly sensation but that quickly fades, it doesn’t dry out my skin, and the results in the morning are reduced redness and size. I also noticed it helped speed up the healing process. Definitely recommend this treatment! nan
