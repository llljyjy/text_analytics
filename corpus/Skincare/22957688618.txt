After using this for about two weeks, I realized my under eyes were pretty burned. I use a daily retinol, so I think the combo of both the under eye cream and my day retinol was just too strong for that sensitive area. But, I loved how lightweight and fragrance free it was! I immediately saw that my circles were lighter and the area was much more moisturized. I unfortunately had to stop using, but Iâ€™m hoping I can try it again! Lightweight!
