This is great, my lips feel really smooth and hydrated. The only product I’d say is better in a similar price range is the bite agave balm (I’ve had 2 of those sticks over the last year and literally use every last bit with a cotton bud!), I thought I’d try this given the hype and it’s great, definitely lives upto it but yeah if you want something even more hydrating try the Bite product slugging addition! very hydrating
