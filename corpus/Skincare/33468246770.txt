I am blessed to be able to try this amazing Agustinus Bader The Light Cream through Influenster for my honest review. I have a very oily T-Zone and with the current scrotching summer heat, I have difficulty finding the right moisturizer without causing more oiliness to my skin and pimples. I was a bit skeptical about this product at first until I tried it for a week and I noticed that my skin looks healthier, less oily, more radiant and the pores on my nose and forehead are less visible. I shared this cream with my mom and she also noticed the change in her facial lines being less visible and her skin apperance  looks more youthful. We are both very happy with the results and definitely would consider this cream for our beauty routine. Amazing Hydrating Cream for Oily Skin!
