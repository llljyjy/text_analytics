I love the way this wears. I am somebody who needs to wear SPF every single day and this makes it so simple. I have had success with this brand in the past so I was very excited to try this out. It is super moisturizing and lightweight. You would hardly be able to tell it contains SPF as it doesnâ€™t leave a chalky white or super oily appearance that some other moisturizers with SPF do. I appreciate that they send a spatula with the product to prevent contamination from constantly dipping fingers into the jar. The product wears beautifully under makeup which is a huge perk. I love the light scent and the fact that a small amount goes a long way. I look forward to using it in warmer months to see how it withstands the sun/sweat. Overall I highly recommend the product! I did receive this product free for testing purposes. Wears beautifully
