Waste of money, and you get less product than the bottle shows and like almost half the bottle is a fake bottom, very deceiving. So not worth it, I saw no difference in my skin. Will never buy again, buy the ordinary one instead way better bang for your buck rip off, not worth it and deceiving packaging
