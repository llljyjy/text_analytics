This is a great essence for oily or combo skin. I found that for my dehydrated skin it was not enough when just used with cerve moisture cream. But when added into my 10 step routine it added more hydration and brighter skin. I like it but would not repurchase due to liking other essences that work better for a lower price point. But it is a great product for being introduced to essences. nan
