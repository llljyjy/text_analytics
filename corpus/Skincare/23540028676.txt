I got a sample of it and it was love at the first use. I have combo mature acne-prone skin and that moisturizer is heaven. Itâ€™s light, not sticky, and layers perfectly with sunscreen. Who has really dry skin probably is gonna need to combine it with one of the oils that they have. Best that I ever use!
