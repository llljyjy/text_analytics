Dry skin with texture. Been using this for a few months in the morning as my daily moisturizer, spf on top of course. I haven’t noticed a difference. If I stop using it for 2 weeks and come back, no big change. Not very moisturizing and can’t tell it has vitamin c. I might need an essence or serum with a little more oomph but this was just ehhh. Not bad, not good. pass
