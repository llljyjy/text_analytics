I was excited when I purchased the product for many reasons. Just to name a few, a suffer from mild-to moderate acne whenever my hormones are imbalanced (monthly), I also have combination skin (more oily than dry), and I have large pores.   After reading some of the reviews I became optimistic in trying the product. Some stated the product smelled of alcohol and others experienced a burning sensation. While most individuals loved it. I too LOVE IT!While using this product I would definitely say one would have to proceed with caution. One gentle cleansing and moisturizer is all you need. There is no need to exfoliate or pile additional products. The pad itself has dual sides. One side to apply the product and the other side to exfoliate the product into the skin. I highly recommend moisturizing the skin after applying. I’ve noticed a difference already within two days. I had a few blemish that were trying to surface, since using “PTR” the blemishes became non-existent. My skin feels so much smoother and healthier. I would have to say I’m a huge fan!! In fact I should’ve bought two during the “Oh snap” 50% off sale! OH SNAP!
