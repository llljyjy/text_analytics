I absolutely love this Balm. I’ve used it several times since I received the product, and as in ALL Dior products, I’m in awe! it goes on easily; it’s not oily but is very moisturizing.  I use it on my face, neck, hands, and anywhere I feel dry. A little bit goes a long way; you don’t have to use much at all. No fragrance (which I wouldn’t mind if it did have a little fragrance). Overall, it’s a great product, and I will definitely continue to use it! Best Balm EVER!
