I LOVE this exfoliating cleanser! It’s just the right amount of gritty without being too rough & leaves my skin feeling smooth. It also clears out my pores like no other exfoliater has been able to do. The scent is soft & not overpowering, a light citrus. This has been effective but gentle enough to use every day to every other day. It’s also very reasonably priced! I’m so happy I got to try this out! Great exfoliating cleanser!
