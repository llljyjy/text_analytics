I received this #freeproduct for my honest review from #trywithtopbox I had higher hopes for this product. I didn’t think it was very moisturizing on my very dry under eyes. I do like the applicator. The metal felt very cool and nice. It did not have a strong smell which I like for eye crème. I don’t think this product reflects the price point. This product may work better for someone with not such dry eyes. just okay
