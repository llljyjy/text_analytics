This product is very effective, and takes little time to see the results. Reduced freckles and/or sun spots on my cheekbones that, as I enter my 30s, started to concern me. I also use it mixed with my body cream at night on areas like my shoulders and forearms to reduce and almost eliminate hyper-pigmentation caused by the sun. Also effective on old acne pigmentation on my chin. I rotate this product with The Ordinaryâ€™s Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%, and the results are fantastic. Great product
