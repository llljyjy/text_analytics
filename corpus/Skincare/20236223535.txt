I loved this serum! It was gifted by Sulwhasoo. It had the perfect consistency and felt gel-like while still being light on my skin. Immediately my skin felt cool and hydrated. I’ve used it for about 5 days now and I can tell my skin feels firmer. I prefer lighter serums as I don’t like the feeling of having too much on my skin but even despite the light consistency I could feel the serum working amazingly. great!
