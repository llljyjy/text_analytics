First time using a lip oil and I love this. The applicator makes it feel so nice going on and it’s very hydrating. I don’t feel like the scent is super overpowering but it does smell decently like cherry. I really like that it’s also not sticky at all. Definitely going to routinely purchase this one! Looooove it
