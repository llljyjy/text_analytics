Influenster sent me a complimentary bottle of The Light Cream - a light daily moisturizer (for people like me with oily skin) from Augustinus Bader a few weeks ago for my honest review. I was familiar with the brand but had never purchased or used any of their products. Spoiler alert - I AM LOVING IT. As a late 30’s mom with oily, acne-prone skin, there are a few things I know I need from a daily moisturizer. It cannot make me break out, or cause additional oil production. It needs to contain ingredients that are proven to be effective, in a large enough amount to actually produce results. I need a light (but not weak) moisturizer that won’t be harsh on my sensitive skin, but will still leave it hydrated and help combat some of these knocking-on-40’s-door fine lines and wrinkles I’ve got going on. I need it to sink into my skin quickly and completely - without any lingering residue so I can move on to doing my makeup and living my life. We’re currently expecting another baby, so I also need high quality skincare with pregnancy-friendly ingredients. Sorry! Did I say I need “a few things”? I lied. I need ALL THE THINGS, and somehow Augustinus Bader has managed to deliver all of them with The Light Cream. Wow. YES to all of this.
