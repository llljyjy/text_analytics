So good! I had gone into the store to get a concealer and ended up also buying this eye cream on a whim. What an amazing product!! It is super hydrating and feels so soothing on my skin. My eyes are extremely sensitive and most eye products cause them to burn - not this stuff though! I am only two days in and my skin is already feeling so hydrated and soft. Totally worth it!
