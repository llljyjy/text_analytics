I noticed a difference truly after the first use. I used it on my exfoliation nights of skin cycling. I have textured skin due to some oiliness on my nose and it was smooth the next day! Overtime I noticed my skin overall becoming brighter.The packaging was very sleek- I loved the design over others! The product itself was very nice! The smell is similar to that of toothpaste, but not nearly as obnoxious.If you have sensitive skin not using more that 2x a week. A miat have for exfoliating nights!
