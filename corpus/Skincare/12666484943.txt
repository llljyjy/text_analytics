This is a cream serum light in texture. It absorbs quickly and does not feel sticky nor oily. Due to past experiences with other high potency retinol products that caused skin irritation and dryness, I initially mixed the serum with my moisturizer to build up my skins tolerance. I use it three days a week. A little of the product goes a long way so a bottle will last a while. As a result of using this serum I have noticed an overall improvement in my skins texture and reduction in my pores appearance. I definitely will repurchase and recommend to other people. nan
