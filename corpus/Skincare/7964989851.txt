First impressions:- I like the packaging, curious to see if it’ll be effective in getting all the product out- Smell is weird but not enough to make me not use it - Physical exfoliant, grains the size of a sugar scrub but not harsh - Skin felt smooth and soft afterwards- Noticed a difference with smoothing out my texture around chin area - Followed up with usual skin care routine and it was good! I have used this product about 10 times and I’ve been loving it. It is a very gentle exfoliator so it’s not too harsh to use daily. The rest of my skincare has been great afterwards, no weird reactions at all. Definitely recommend! gentle exfoliator
