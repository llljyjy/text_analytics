This Gucci Brume De Beauté Glow Hydrating mist has been a game charger when it comes to setting my makeup. It’s infused with Gucci’s signature black rose oil and hydraulic acid. I’ve used many setting sprays over the years but this one has quickly become a favorite due to how glowy it leaves my skin looking and feeling. This spray has also been perfect for refreshing and hydrating my skin during the hot summer days. Thank you to Influenster and Gucci for providing this free product in exchange for my review! The best setting spray I've ever used!!!
