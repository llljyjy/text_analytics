I want to love this so badly but like another reviewer said, it smells heavily of standard sunscreen smell =(  The watermelon smell is so light compared to the sunscreen smell. I wouldn’t mind if it smelled like sunscreen, except you can smell it all day and it’s worse when you have to wear a mask.Otherwise, I love the texture and and how light it is, with no whitecast. Gives off the perfect dewy finish. Haven’t tried it under makeup, but it’s great for a natural look.Unfortunately I will be returning due to the smell. Smells a lot like sunscreen
