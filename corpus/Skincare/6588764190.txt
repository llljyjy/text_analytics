I have oily acne prone skin that’s on the dry side Bc I use a 5x retinol at night. I’ve been using it for a couple months. It’s hydrating and absorbs easily. With consistent use and SUNSCREEN you’ll see a difference. I removed a star because of the price and the fragrance took some getting used to. The fragrance didn’t irritate my sensitive skin, but it would be a nice alternative. Works
