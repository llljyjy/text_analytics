PLEASE BRING THE OLD FORMULA BACK. If you want to create another eye cream to test, then just launch it as a separate product. No need to change an already perfect product. The old version was incredibly hydrating. This new product feels greasy but then also ends up drying your under eyes out. I recommended the old formula to a lot of my friends and now we all have to find another eye cream. nan
