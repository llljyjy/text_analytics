I received this #freeproduct from #topboxcircle in exchange for my honest reviews. I’ve really enjoyed other Clinique eye creams, so I was interested in trying something from the smart clinical repair line. The cream did moisturize the eye area, however, it did not provide any other noticeable benefits. The sample packet I used only had enough product to use around three times, so perhaps with long-term use or a larger sample size these benefits would become apparent and be more noticeable. There wasn’t much of a scent either which I prefer with my sensitive skin. I wish the sample was bigger to see results!
