So I’m going to reiterate a lot of what the other reviews are saying about this productThe GOOD: the product itself is fantastic and i love it. It is one of my favorite sunscreens I’ve used. The viscosity is low so it’s easy to spread, absorbs fairly quickly, and despite looking like a small amount of product, it will last you a long while. It’s a pale pink translucent color so it will easily blend into any skin tone and it wont leave any weird residue or white cast.The BAD: The packaging is absolutely atrocious. The paint peels off and the product will leak really bad if you dont have it upright 24/7. It supposed to be easy to travel with but its so prone to leakage that you wouldn’t even want to take it with you and will end up wasting a lot of the product.(For anyone looking to fix the chipping paint, wrap the bottom half in clear duct tape, it works as a temporary fix for it.)I love this product but if I’m spending $60 on a sunscreen, i expect the packaging to be suitable for its contents.I’m a huge Tatcha fan, however, i will not be purchasing this product again until they decide to change the packaging for this sunscreen. I’m honestly surprised nothing has been done about it yet… A 5 star product with 1 star packaging
