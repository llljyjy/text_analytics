I LOVE this product so much! This is one of my favorite creams. I have sensitive skin that tends to be dry, and this cream is soft, creamy, and gentle to my skin. I used to use the previous one and I was a bit scared when they said they were rebranding but this one is great too and smells like green tea which is very relaxing. nan
