I got this at the same time as the sample face serum and I loved the face serum so I was excited to try this one out. I didn’t really notice a difference until the 3rd day it applied well and texture was very light and I always like light texture it’s just much easier to put on face vs thick. Over all I give the product 8/10 wish it wasn’t as expensive Worth the try
