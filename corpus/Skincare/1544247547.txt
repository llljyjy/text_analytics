Okay so I’m camp “it works and will buy again.”  It’s like a cross between concealer and foundation, but you can apply a little with a brush and optimize your coverage. I really wish the packaging were different, not just messy in a pot. But otherwise I love it. I even put some on my son’s face since he had a scratch and it was picture day lol.  I’d say it’s worth buying and trying. It works wonders for me
