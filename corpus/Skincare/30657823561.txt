I have dark circles under my eyes and this product helped brighten those dark spots enough to make me happy! I love the texture of the cream. Itâ€™s so smooth and a little bit goes a long way. So that small jar actually lasts. I have been applying both morning and night. It works under makeup too, which is a huge bonus. I also like that it is hydrating so I know my taking care of the skin under my eyes. I would definitely recommend!*I received this product as a free sample. nan
