I liked this serum! Not too much fragrance, silky smooth texture and absorbs nicely. I could definitely see a difference in texture after two weeks, and radiance my skin showed literally after a day or so. The price point is super affordable for Guerlain as well! Super easy to layer with other products in my skincare routine and leaves me looking plump and pretty! Honey
