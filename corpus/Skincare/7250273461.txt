After loving the Génifique serum I had high hopes for this cream. My sensitive combo skin is in need of hydration, especially during the night, and though I find that this provides me with that, I also noticed that my face seems irritated rather  than radiant in the morning, and I’ve noticed a few breakouts. I like the benefits I’m seeing this far, such as plumping, but unfortunately I think the active ingredients might just be too much for my sensitive skin. I’ve been using the cream every other night instead of every night, which has helped, but the price is just not worth it for a cream that doesn’t leave my face feeling amazing. Good, but not great
