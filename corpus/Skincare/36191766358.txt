This is the first eye cream I’ve ever pruchased. I bought it because, well, I’m officially a quarter-century old and it’s the time to start focusing on these things! Been using it for about 3 weeks now and don’t see much of a change in brightness.. but then again, I don’t have super dark circles or any other issues. It’s got a nice cooling effect and feels like a little treat when I apply it with no major side effects. A nice added self-care step. nan
