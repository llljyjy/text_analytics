I’ve used this moisturizer alone in my skincare routine + under makeup and so far I love it. I have dry and sensitive skin and recently over exfoliated and had peeling. After using it morning & night, my skin stopped peeling, was visibly smoother & hydrated. Major difference. It also worked well under my makeup, super smooth base. It actually reminds me of the Charlotte Tilbury magic cream but bettrt because it’s less greasy & actually feels hydrating instead of just sitting on top of the skin. Definitely reccomend. nan
