As I’ve aged, I notice uneven skin and dark spots. This serum tingles a little bit, but nothing bad. I noticed it leaves my skin dewy. The first two weeks I only used it 4 times a week until my skin adapted to it. I would apply moisturizer afterwards. My skin felt so nourished. Now, I’m using it every night. I’ve noticed a slight difference as far as my spots, but I know all products need time to be fully effective. I will say, my pores look better. Overall, a good serum that will hopefully continue to help my skin. Leaves skin dewy, pores look better
