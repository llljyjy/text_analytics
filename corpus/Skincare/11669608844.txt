I should’ve read more than just the good reviews. I also want to say I do not have sensitive skin typically and have never had a bad reaction to a product before. However, within a few days of using this, I got huge red marks under my eyes that stung and burned. My dark circles looked WORSE, like two huge black bruises, and I even got tons of small white pimples near my eyes. Please be wary of this product. Everyone’s skin is different, but there are a LOT of bad reviews who have had the EXACT same issues. It’s not a coincidence. Made dark circles worse and caused red patches
