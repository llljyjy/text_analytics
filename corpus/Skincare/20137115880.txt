At first I really liked this scrub - it smells great! But there are little beads that I think may be shea butter or something, anyways, I ended up breaking out and I haven’t been able to recover my skin from it. I did receive this as a free sample from Influenster. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone with acne prone skin at all. Broke me out!
