I received this product for free  in exchange for my honest review. I liked the packaging of this product. The cream was thick / heavy and didn’t have a strong scent. I have sensitive skin and this did not irritate it at all, but I didn’t see or notice any major difference. I also used the product for about 5 weeks. Didn’t see any major difference
