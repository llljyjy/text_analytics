I started using Clarins Double Serum for about 5 nights now, and I’m already noticing results! Although I find it hasn’t really helped much with fine lines; it has made my skin feel soft, smooth, and hydrated without having to use moisturizer. This serum is very easy to use, and I love the unique concept. It absorbs fast, and evenly to the skin without feeling oily. I’m really enjoying the floral/fruity scent, and find it to be relaxing. It’s suitable for all skin types; even sensitive! This serum is easily a new favorite, and I definitely recommend it! A New Favorite
