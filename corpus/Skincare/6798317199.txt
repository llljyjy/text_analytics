Iâ€™ve been using this cleanser for over a month now & I love the way it makes my skin feel & look! I double cleanse therefore I prefer cleansers that are very mild and does not strip my skin. This did exactly that!! My skin is left feeling soft and radiant. I also love the packaging of this cleanser as well! If you are looking for something that is oil controlling and/or exfoliating this cleanser is not for you! FAV CLEANSER - GENTLE YET EFFECTIVE
