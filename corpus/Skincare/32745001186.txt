at first I was disappointed at how small the jar was… but when I used this moisturizer I immediately fell in LOVE. I realized it’s so small because a little goes a long way! It’s so rich & creamy, and not heavy, which I loved! It melted into my skin like butter in a pan! when I say my face feels like a baby’s butt! OMG lol and I only used it for a few days now!Highly Recommend, Will Purchase Again, 10/10 A little goes a long way, LITERALLY A DOLLOP!
