I first used this alone, with no skincare or makeup, on half my face to get a real experience if the full product benefits. When first applying it I was impressed at the mist, it is truly a fine mist, without the “splatter“ some sprays deliver. It has a soft, light fragrance that is lovely. I immediately noticed a difference in the glow, plumpness, and texture of my skin on the side of my face I applied it. Definitely does a wonderful job hydrating and refreshing.Next I used it for setting my makeup. The fine mist was excellent for not impacting my makeup application or creating wet patches as applied. The side by side when used as a setting spray were less noticable. But it does leave a beautiful finish. Beautiful
