Bought this to upgrade my Mini that I have had for a few years. Lasted 6 months and doesn’t work now. Surprised since I never even had to change the batteries on my Mini. Seems to be a known issue since Foreo doesn’t offer a warranty on this and everyone has problems. Assuming the water gets in through the contacts on the back and Foreo did no QA/QC on this in development. Works well until it doesn't.
