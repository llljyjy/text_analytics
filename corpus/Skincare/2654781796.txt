I am a little up in the air about this product. I try using it every day (whether just in the morning or even adding it in my night time routine as well). There are a few days I have skipped. But all in all I am not really noticing a major difference yet. I plan to keep using it in hopes I will notice a change the longer I use it. Up in the air
