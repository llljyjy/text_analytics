I received a sample of this serum from Top Box Circle. I used it every night for about a week. It felt really nice on my skin and wasn’t too heavy - it absorbed well. I need to be careful about the products I use as I can be prone to breakouts but I didn’t have any issues with this serum. The sample was not large enough to determine effectiveness at “wrinkle correcting” but I really enjoyed it for the time I used it. nan
