Yes, I received this product for free. No, I was not wow-ed like I thought I would be! Tingles on the skin, which I don’t mind. Leaves skin sticky afterwards, which isn’t ideal but I used it at night to I didn’t mind. Notice no difference in my pores, though it gets 3 stars because I think it’s helped keep my skin clear for a longer streak than is normal for me! However, I’ve never tried a Dr Jart product before, and I honestly expected more. nan
