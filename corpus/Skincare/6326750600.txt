My pump came broken with this product. Not even malfunctioned, broken. There was just the top cap with nothing to push the product out the cap. The smell is extremely potent & off putting. It’s one of the reason I’ve not stayed consistent with it. I’ve used it a few times & didn’t notice anything significant especially with the claims that Peace Out made with this product - instead I woke up with whiteheads. There are far better alternatives on the market for dark spots. Pass. Nope
