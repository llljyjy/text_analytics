I have historically had great luck with Origins products, and have really enjoyed their mega mushrooms line, which I think is very similar too.  It is a great day and night serum, it plays wells with other products, layers fine under makeup, doesn’t stay sticky or tacky for me but does help me stay quite hydrated and moisturized. I do not have particularly dry skin, so this is enough for me for days when I’m just working from home and not trying for a full face. I will definitely consider a repurchase! I already told my mom about it and she’s even purchased! I definitely would recommend, especially if you’ve enjoyed serums like Caudalie Vinoperfect. Loving this!
