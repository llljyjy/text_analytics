This product is received courtesy of Influenster. What I noticed right away when opening the package was the citrus scent of the Tula moisturizer. It smells so fresh, although it is a tad strong  for those who are scent - sensitive. I decided to give the product two weeks before reviewing. I do not notice a difference in hydration of my skin as compared to using another product. It does its job well for hydration but in my opinion was not superior. However, I enjoy how this quickly absorbs into my skin before makeup in the morning. No greasy residue and good as a primer. It claims to brighten skin and I was sceptical the first few days but then I seemed to notice a little difference in the eveness of my skin tone, so maybe with prolonged use I will see ever greater benefits. The packaging is interesting as there is no “straw“ attached to pump so I guess I will have to open the jar when it gets emptier. There is a good quantity of product. It’s a pricey product so I’m not sure the results are justifiable of cost at this point but maybe when I have a prolonged 6-week + use I will feel differently. Nice hydrating moisturizer
