I like the product I like the way it cleans it does a good job on my face I have really sensitive skin skin so I have not used it every day I’ve been doing every other day. But I do not like the smell at all. I normally like citrus there’s just something in there that I don’t like but I like how clean my face feels so trying to deal with the scent Great product funky smell
