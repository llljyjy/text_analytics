I am actually in awe of this night cream. I did not expect to fall in love with it the way I did. First, the texture is fantastic--It feels like a gel texture, but then instantly sinks into the skin when you apply it. Leaving you with a pleasant cooling sensation without feeling sticky. Definitely absorbs quickly.Second, the results. Wow! This has completely transformed my redness, and I used to get very red. Now, I wake up with even-toned skin. I can be very picky with moisturizers, because of my eczema, but this one wins! Fantastic!
