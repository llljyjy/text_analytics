I’ve been using this cleaning balm for about 8 months, and even when I try new ones I always come back to this one. Has a fresh clean scent that isn’t overpowering. Does a great job at melting away makeup, and doesn’t burn the eyes. This is a perfect cleansing balm for a two-step cleanse routine. nan
