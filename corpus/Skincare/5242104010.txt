I received a sample for free and used for about 2 weeks and didn’t notice a huge difference in my skin. However, the product immediately did hydrate my skin and feels great going on. Unfortunately the sample was just too small to be able to use consistently for that period of time so I can’t speak to long term impact. Nice product, can’t speak to long term effects
