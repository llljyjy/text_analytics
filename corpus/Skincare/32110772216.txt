I pick at my skin even though I shouldn’t, and it leaves scars obviously. Last year I had terrible skin I wish I had good pictures before I started this product and the La Roche-posay wash bc those two products saved my skin. And honestly if I ate healthier and didn’t pick at my face I would have Perfect skin. The photos are my skin now which is so much better, I had so much acne, scars, lack of confidence. Until now. YES FOR ME
