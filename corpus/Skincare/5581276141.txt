I received this as part of a free sample program. I like this product and could tell after one use that my skin seemed to a be a bit brighter. However, this product does have a smell to it and I am not the biggest fan of having fragrance on my face. Will I use this every day? Probably not. But will I use it if I want to look more radiant? Yes. I recommend this product if you are specifically looking for something to brighten your face and donâ€™t mind a little bit of fragrance. Pre-Show Glow
