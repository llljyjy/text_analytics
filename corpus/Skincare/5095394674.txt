I love how this eye cream feels when you first apply! It’s cooling and instantly refreshes. It absorbs nicely  and it wears under makeup well. As for correcting wrinkles I haven’t noticed a significant difference but I will continue to use. It does give me the pickup I need though. Instantly refreshes!
