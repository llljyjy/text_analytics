I’ve been using this serum day & night for a few weeks and have noticed my skin looking more radiant and healthy than usual. The formula has a good consistency that spreads easily without stickiness. 1.5 pumps is enough for my skin especially while it’s drier during these cold months. It doesn’t seem to make me too oily by the end of the day unlike some other skincare products. Smells good and great packaging. good formula
