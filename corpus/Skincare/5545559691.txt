I read all the reviews and made myself super nervous to try this moisturizer out. I was previously using tula for a moisturizer and I was reacting awful to some ingredient. This went on so nicely, didn’t burn at all and makes my skin feel super hydrated as well as giving my skin that dewy glow. I’m not disappointed as of yet so this gets a good review for myself! hesitant
