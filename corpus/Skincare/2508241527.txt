Big fan of this Laneige serum. First off, it has the loveliest scent that isn’t too strong. It also applies really nicely to the face. My face immediately absorbs the serum without it feeling sticky or greasy. I honestly can just wear the serum by itself or it also pairs great with a moisturizer. Using this serum these past couple of weeks I definitely feel my face is a lot more hydrated and hasn’t been dry at all (I was having a couple of dry patches in my cheek before and now it’s all gone). I also have to mention that I am a big fan of the packaging and color for this product line. Definitely recommend this product. #trywithtopbox #freeproduct Lovely Serum
