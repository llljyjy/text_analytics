I have been using this 2x a day for the last several weeks and I already see a difference. I am in my early 40s with combination skin, susceptible to mild hormonal acne and a few lines in the forehead and 11 zone. Mostly I have noticed a difference in my skins texture- it is smoother and brighter. I have only mild hyperpigmentation around the hairline and I haven’t noticed much difference there but it’s early. Lines look better after applying, likely due to plumping effect from the hyaluronic acid. Prior to this, I was using separate serums and had pilling issues. I have not experienced pilling with this and that is a HUGE plus for me. The bottle is attractive. There are 3 separate chambers housing the 3 main ingredients separately. It took a good four or five pumps for all of the ingredients to come out simultaneously on first use. I plan on purchasing this again and with the new bottle I will not continue to pump initially until all 3 products come out. Seems like a waste of extra product. As with all pumps, I feel like I will likely not get all of the product out and sometimes these pumps fail. So far so good but with 3 separate reservoirs I will be watching closely. Some may find the cost inhibitory. So far so good!
