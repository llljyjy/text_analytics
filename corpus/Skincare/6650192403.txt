I have used this product for 3 years at least. I have literally tried everything on the market (I used to have cystic acne, still prone to acne), and this is the only cleanser that is gentle, unscented, doesnt dry out my skin, and doesnâ€™t cause acne flare ups. Its such a solid face wash (this is my first review ever so I rlly took time out of my day to type this). I dont care for other DE products but this is the best. Using this for over 3 years!!
