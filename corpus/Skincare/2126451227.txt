I am a lover of most all of YTTP products (the cleanser and air whip moisturizer are my daily arsenal), but I still went to another company for retinal and exfoliation (wonâ€™t use their name but will say it involves an inebriated pachyderm). But  not anymore! This stuff is the holy grail. After just one week my skin feels smoother, my pores have shrunken, and I look one step closer to the way I did before raising a toddler and a global pandemic sucked the glow from my complexion. Thanks, YTTP! As good as it gets!
