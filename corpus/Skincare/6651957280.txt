I’m absolutely in love with this exfoliating cleanser it’s definitely unique from the texture and scent to the foam less formula. The texture is a jelly scrub that gently removes impurities from my skin, the scent is mild but I can’t quite figure out what exactly it smells like and there’s absolutely no foam/lather but it really works great making my skin feel so fresh and clean. I love how hydrated, revived, smooth and baby soft my skin felt after use and not forgetting the after glow. As most of you all already know I have dry sensitive skin but this exfoliating cleanser worked great for me, it didn’t cause any irritation nor didn’t dry out my skin like other cleansers I’ve tried. I honestly love that this cleanser did everything it claimed! Amazing Exfoliating Cleanser!!!
