I have really dry skin during the summer especially and get dry flaky patches. I use this morning and night and as soon as I started using it it immediately helped my dry skin. My only complaint is that I have had this about a month and a half and I feel like it is already running out. I thought it would at least last me a little bit longer considering I only use about one pump every time I use it. nan
