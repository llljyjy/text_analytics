This toner’s primary active ingredient is salicylic acid and while the product itself is not targeted towards acne prone skin, it is a great ingredient for those who want to keep their skin clear. I like that the toner doesn’t have any added fragrance and smells a little minty. It has a slight cooling sensation and has been working well with my normal skin. I have problem areas in the t zone so I like using salicylic acid in those areas to reduce the likelihood of breakouts and this so far seems to help. This was gifted by algenist but I definitely would have considered this product even if I were to pay out of pocket. nan
