I tried this in a Sephora store and I liked the feeling of it, so I thought about it for a few weeks and decided to buy it. Even though I first was expecting a serum-like experience it is DEFINITELY an oil. I was worried that it wouldn’t be clear how much I needed for optimal protection since it’s an oil. would i need a lot? would that make me look oily? So after reading the how-to I see they want you to layer it with the unseen. This is almost $50 for 1oz and they want you to LAYER IT? I’m not convinced this will be worth the high cost. I’ve only used it once and I already regret my purchase. Although, it doesn’t look too oily on, even after using more than the recommended 3 drops. Take it slow and be attentive while spreading it. See isn’t that dumb? i don’t want that much work into a sunscreen. Probably not worth the cost
