First of all, I’m a Lancôme fan. I have so many products! So when I got this Absolue Revitalizing Eye Cream as a gift I was excited to try it and after 2 weeks of applying it day and night I truly have seen good results, like the tiny wrinkles around my eyes are less visible. And I only apply a tiny amount, that’s enough to cover both eyes. I apply some concealer after and boom! Magic happens. It really works with tiny wrinkles
