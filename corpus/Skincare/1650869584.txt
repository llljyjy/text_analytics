I supposed to receive a complementary product to review but it never made it to me. But by being a loyal Estée Lauder customer, I went to my favorite department store and purchased the smallest product. The bottle is very pleasant to handle, the product is not sticky, very nice liquid with low odor. After winter my skin was thirsty and needed a good hydration and this Micro Essence did a fantastic job - the light texture is pleasant to use and I feel how my slightly dry and dull skin absorbed this nectar. The skin looks rested and refreshed. I like the ingredients and I trust Ester’s quality. It was a perfect addition to my routine (to the rest of Estee collection of the moisturizing care) and I am planning to continue using the Micro Essence from Estee since now on.
