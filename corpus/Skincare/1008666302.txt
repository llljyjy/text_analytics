I’m really surprised by the negative reviews I’m reading! I got this cleanser as a sample and I loved it so much that I purchased it afterward. I have combination skin and I also tend to get rosacea in the winter so I really need something gentle. I don’t wear a ton of makeup but I do wear a tinted moisturizer and bronzer and this product washes everything off. I also feel like my skin looks amazing after washing. Again, I’m so baffled by all of the negative reviews! I absolutely love this face wash, it’s all I use now, besides the occasional exfoliator a couple times a week. Do not be deterred by the negative reviews!
