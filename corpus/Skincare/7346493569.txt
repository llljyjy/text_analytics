This is a no frills moisturizer that does it what it’s suppose to do- give hydration to the face. The texture is lightweight yet the shea butter and oils makes it super hydrating. I have multiple steps before putting this on and this layers beautifully on top. It doesn’t make my skin irritated or clog my pores. I highly enjoyed using it but it is overpriced in my opinion. nan
