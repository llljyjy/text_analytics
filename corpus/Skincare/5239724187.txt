I was gifted by Hanni the Shave Pillow and Iâ€™m impressed! I used it for the first time after a shower deciding to test it on dry skin. It dispenses in a similar way as a deodorant stick. Very emollient and heavily scented, I rubbed it on my legs and it spread easily.  The Weighted Razor did glide easily over the covered area. My skin did not react negatively to either the shave pillow or razor.  I think this would be great on a vacation! Yes!
