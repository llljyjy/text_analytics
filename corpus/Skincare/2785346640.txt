I received this product courtesy of Influenster. I loved how gorgeous the bottle looked on the outside. It has some weight to it since it’s made with glass. However, I was surprised and disappointed to find that reishi mushroom, which was named as a key ingredient, at the bottom of the ingredient list. The application of the serum was fine but I didn’t not see the improvement after three days of use, which was also advertised. nan
