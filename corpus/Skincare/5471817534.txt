This one of my favorite cleansing balms! A little goes a long way. I’ve tried other brands and always make my way back to this one. It doesn’t have a strong smell and is easy to clean off. It’s travel friendly and the consistently maintains in the jar so I do not have to worry about it melting/spilling in my toiletry bag. I try to stock up during sales, I usually buy two and they’ll last me way over 6 months with everyday use. MUST BUY!
