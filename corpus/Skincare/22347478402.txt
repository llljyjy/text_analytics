Received this complimentary of influenster. But honestly, this item is so luxe. Shisheido is known for their amazing products and this one does not disappoint. The packaging is beautiful. But the product is even better. It has a slight scent, but not too overpowering and it smells nice and clean, not too perfume-y. I noticed a difference after maybe a week of using. Noticed a more even texture, more smoothness. Itâ€™s deff a staple in my skin care routine now! nan
