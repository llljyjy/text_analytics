This works well for my skin but I won’t be buying again. There’s no way there is the advertised amount in the bottle. I’ve used it a few times and it’s less than half full  now. The packaging is also REALLY difficult to work with. I can barely squeeze out the cleanser and it separates too. So I try to shake it up to mix it but that doesn’t work. I’m very disappointed because I like some of their other products. packaging sucks
