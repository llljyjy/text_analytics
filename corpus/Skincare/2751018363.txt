I really wanted to love this as the ingredient list is amazing for hyperpigmentation. They threw the kitchen sink into the formula. I thought the other reviewers were exaggerating regarding the smell but I did a patch test and dear lord does that smell have staying power. For reference I use fragrance free products (which this is) so I’m used to formulas that smell not amazing- but this I could not handle. If they ever reformulate it to address this I would absolutely re-purchase and try it again since this combines so many great ingredients and is well priced. On the plus side, the patch test I did didn’t irritate my sensitive skin so if you can handle the scent I say try it out. Great ingredients, tough scent
