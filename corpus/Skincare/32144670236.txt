I love this serum! I’m new to using retinol serum on a daily basis so I thought this Serum might be too much, but it was amazing! I saw results after the first use without any redness or drying.  It was a little intimidating at first because of the mixture process but it was easy to prepare. The directions make it easy to figure out how much to use if you’re a beginner or seasoned vet. I recommend this to anyone starting an anti-wrinkle regiment or just beginning. Delicate Powerhouse
