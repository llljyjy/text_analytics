I purchased a tube in April and I absolutely loved it!  It had a smooth silky texture and really helped clear my skin.  Then purchased another tube in May and it’s filled with these little white beads that DO NOT dissolve - I absolutely HATE this cleanser now!!!  The “new” formula just feels terrible and rough on my sensitive skin.  Super disappointed in how a product can change in the course of a month. They changed the formula
