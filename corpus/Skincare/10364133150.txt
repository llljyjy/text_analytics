I LOVE Shani products, especially the Retinol Reform, so I was really excited about being given this product in exchange for an honest review. I have pretty sensitive skin so the serum stung a teeny bit the first few times I used it (in a good way though because to me the tingling sensation means it was doing its job!) Ultimately, this product goes on smooth and feels gentle, and made my skin look less dull. Love that it didn’t dry out my skin during wintertime too.I’ve used this product a few times a week for the last 2 some weeks and will definitely be adding it to my weekly routine. nan
