Really wanted to like this product but I was honestly overwhelmed by the smell of it and couldn’t put it to use for more than a couple weeks. It’s a pretty well-known fact that essential oils aren’t great for your skin. You can become sensitized to them very easily. This product is full of them and whatever the combo is, the smell is putrid after sitting on your face for a bit. I had to wash my face again after using it. As far as the benefits go…it’s hard to say. It didn’t irritate my face but I also didn’t see much of a difference when using it. The bottle sure is gorgeous though. Not a favorite - couldn’t handle the smell
