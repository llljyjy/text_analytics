I waited to write a review for this product after using an entire bottle.  Unfortunately I haven’t seen any results at all.  Nothing even slightly improved.  I had hopes this would show some improvement in ski texture and would even use it after a chemical peel, but still nothing happened.  It does make your skin tacky.  However, I realized you really need to let it dry for a few minutes, maybe 5-10 mins.  And once it is dry the tacky feeling goes away, allowing you to put on your next skincare product like moisturizer.  I’m glad others are seeing benefits, but for me, the super expensive price tag with no results is quite obviously not worth it even if the product had been more affordable. A whole bottle used and no results
