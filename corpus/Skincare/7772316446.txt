This is honestly my favorite mineral sunscreen, but like the other reviewers, I have my issues with the package design. I feel like there was a slight reformulation or change in packaging, because on my 1st bottle I was able to get it out using the dropper with no problems. It seems thicker now, and the dropper does not always effectively pick up and dispense the product. I find that if I put it in the pocket of my robe in the morning and let it warm up, the consistency gets a bit better. I also am bummed about how little you get for the price. However, this is probably the best formula for winter as it feels lightweight yet is super hydrating, which is hard to find in mineral formulations that often leave a matte finish. I also appreciate that it doesnâ€™t sting my eyes (unless I get some directly in them) like most chemical sunscreens do. changed bottle or formula?
