I suffer with a lot of dark spots and hyperpigmentation on my face. I have used many products to help with this and was very excited to try this new mandelic acid treatment from The Inkey List. I love that it’s almost like a moisturizing cream. It’s a nice formula that I rub onto the dark spots and pat it in. I have only been using it for a few days so I can’t speak 100% on its effectiveness but so far, I have noticed that my dark spots are getting faintly lighter and less noticeable. I would definitely recommend this product as it looks very promising! nan
