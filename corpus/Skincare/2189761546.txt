I like this so much more than I expected! At first I thought the texture was a little odd, kind of spongey-kind or moussey, but itâ€™s great to put on and take off. I find myself reaching for it often as it leaves my skin looking and feeling cleaner and more refined. Overall I am very much enjoying it. Worth a try! nan
