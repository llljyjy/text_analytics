Firstly, I receive this as a sample to review. The sample received did not offer more than one application. What I did use, felt more like an emollient and less like a true moisturizer. It didnâ€™t melt into the skin leaving it nice and soft feeling. The feeling it left was greasy, although that did dissipate overtime. Since I was not able to use it more than once, I cannot speak to its efficacy overtime. From my limited experience with the product, I would not purchase it again. Moisturizer?
