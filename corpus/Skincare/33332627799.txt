I received this as a sample for my honest review.  The Dr. Zenovia Retinol Nigh Repair has worked great for me!  I still have small bouts of facial acne even as I approach 40.  This cream works wonders to reduce the appearance of the flare up, as well as beginning to reduce the appearance of some of the scarring I have from years of breakouts.  This works wonders, you will notice some redness after using the product but donâ€™t worry it fades quickly and becomes less and less noticable as you use it over time.  I would recommend giving it a try, as it worked wonders for me, and I sincerely hope it works well for anyone else that suffers from acne or uneven skin! Wonderful results
