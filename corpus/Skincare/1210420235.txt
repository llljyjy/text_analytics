I am a Retin A .1% user. I’m in my early 40s and have combination, acne prone skin with hyperpigmentation. I know, lucky me. I mainly used this product to fade my hyperpigmentation which it did. I was very pleased with the results. They didn’t disappear but the dark spots are noticeably smaller and lighter. The serum makes my skin feel AMAZING in the morning plus I had zero skin irritation using it. I really liked the fact that the consumer mixes the product. It was easy to mix and a unique concept. Great addition to anti-aging regimen
