This is a nice gel-formula moisturizer. I have sensitive combination skin and I use this during the day under makeup and it doesn’t make my skin feel oily or greasy, just well hydrated and fresh. The smell is pleasing. Can we just talk about the packaging for a second, though? What a waste of plastic. For the amount of product in this jar, the size is obscene. It wouldn’t fit into my medicine cabinet, so I put all of it in a way smaller glass jar and it was crazy how much thick plastic just goes to waste. I knocked off a star because I really like the product, but I’d rather buy a different one that doesn’t contribute to so much waste. C’mon Tarte! Huge container for not very much product
