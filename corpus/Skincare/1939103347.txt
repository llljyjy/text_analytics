I don’t even remember how I found this product because it’s been 5 years of using it. I love it so much I tell everyone I know about it. Day to day, I have very “normal” skin, not too dry or too oily but whenever I would wash my Face I’d  have this dry feeling like if I stretched my mouth my face was uncomfortable. This is still the only I product I have found to take that away immediately. It’s magical and I use it everyday and love it. nan
