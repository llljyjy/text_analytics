I love this sunscreen it makes my skin feel so much softer I have really dry skin I tend to be breaking out a lot from sunscreens I’m not having that issue with this one and I feel like my skin looks clearer I really like the smell of this one is not overly powering like some sun screens that I have used in the past I do like that this one smaller I don’t leave my house without it it’s always in my bag I would like to see a bigger bottle of this and one that you could use all over the skin I would absolutely purchase that if they had that available this is the first time I’ve use this brand I definitely will use other things from this brand because I really like it Tiny But Mighty
