I tried this serum for over 3 weeks and I was very eager to try it ! My mom has always raves about Shiseido products. The product smells great and it feels nice on the skin! I have sensitive skin so I was glad it didn’t make me break out and it didn’t irritate it as well. After using it the last 3 weeks, I don’t see any changes besides feeling my skin soft. I feel this product works best when paired with a whole system. If you do make the purchase, make sure to ask what other products can be paired for optimal results !! nan
