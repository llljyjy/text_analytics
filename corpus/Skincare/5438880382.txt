I have had positive experiences with Peter Thomas Roth products in the past so I was excited to try their new retinoid treatment. For reference I have combo skin and have used retinol products so my skin has a slight tolerance. For starters I like the squeeze tube package. It’s hygienic and ideal for travel. The consistency is very lightweight and sinks right into the skin. It hasn’t caused breakouts or irritation. If you’re new to retinol I would suggest starting out only using this 3 times a week till your skin adjusts. And remember Sunscreen! I haven’t been using this long enough to make any claims about wrinkle reduction but I have noticed that my pores are a bit less noticeable and overall the texture has definitely improved. Just make sure to follow up with a good moisturizer after applying this. I was gifted this item complimentary from Peter Thomas roth nan
