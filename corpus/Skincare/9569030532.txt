I really like the The INKEY List Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser because it leaves my skin super soft. It helps remove makeup very easily and keeps my skin hydrated. The formula is very gentle on my skin and doesnâ€™t leave my skin to have any irritation. I recommend this if your looking for a light weight cleanser that leaves the skin feeling very soft and hydrated. nan
