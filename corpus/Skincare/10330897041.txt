Had the opportunity to try this formula! Loved the way my skin felt after use and noticed reduction in pore size. Skin felt smooth and absorbed well on application. I liked the smell of the product, but I am sensitive to scent, and found it a little strong. Would highly recommend for over the counter product, a little goes a long way. nan
