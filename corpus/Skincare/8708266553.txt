This is my holy grail moisturizer. I wish the cost was lower, but I have tried switching back to CeraVe and broke out right away. I have crazy sensitive very dry skin and am also acne-prone. This is the only product I truly feel like nothing else can compare to. The price sucks, the pump can be finicky, and the refills are hit or miss if they even work with the packaging. But in spite of all those things I will always adore this product. The Best Skincare Product I Have Ever Used
