Definitely if wearing makeup use makeup remover before.  also I always wash twice if you have acne it will most likely get worse before it gets better. Using a proper skin care routine cleanser, toner , Moisturizer and using a exfoliating treatment once a week you will really see the benefits of this cleanser  and see a difference in acne and itâ€™s a steal for  the price. nan
