I received this product from influenster in exchange for my honest review. I really wanted to love this product but for me it wasn’t that great. I used it twice a day for 4 weeks before writing this review.  It did reduce the puffiness around my eyes a bit, but I didn’t notice any difference in the wrinkles around my eyes. It does absorb well without being greasy. Overall it was just OK in my opinion.  Definitely not something I would purchase, especially at the expensive price point Good but not great
