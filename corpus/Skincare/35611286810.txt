I was gifted by ALGENIST the Algeniist GENIUS Liquid Skin Resurfacing to test. It is a skin-smoothing and pore clarifying daily exfoliant. I have combination skin along with mild acne. My initial use was amazing! My pores were smaller and my face appeared a bit clearer. After ten consecutive days of use my skin is much smoother, acne breakouts are less and it looks so healthy! I highly recommend this and I absolutely love it! Amazingâ€¦
