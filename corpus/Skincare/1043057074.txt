This cream smells so good, fruity and lightly floral, but not overwhelming at all. I found it to be a little heavy and left a layer in my face that didn’t cooperate with my makeup, so I decided to just use it at night. It hasn’t cause any breakouts and my skin feels great in the morning. I can’t tell if my pores are any smaller, but it may need a little more time and usage. If large pores are a concern for you I would definitely recommend giving this cream a try. Smells Heavenly!
