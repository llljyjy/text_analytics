This is definitely my new go to moisturizer. I’m a recent east coast transplant and my skin is HATING the cold weather. This Kiehl’s advanced repair barrier creams has been a lifesaver. It’s thick but it rubs on super easily and doesn’t feel heavy or greasy. My skin feels moisturized and hydrated. I most definitely recommend to anyone who has issues with winter dry skin. This will be your go to! My new go-to winter moisturizer!
