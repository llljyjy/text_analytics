I have always been a big fan of Shiseido and I was thrilled when I received these 2 versions of sunscreen from Influenster!! Love that it’s spf 42 and a little is enough for the entire face! It has the regular sunscreen smell which fades away. I like the texture and it’s hydrating enough for my skin.#influenster #complimentary My fav sunscreen
