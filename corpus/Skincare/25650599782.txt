I think I bought this quite a few months ago, wanted an actually long lasting lip balm that wasn’t too sticky, didn’t taste like anything (I know it’s dumb but I hate tasting my lip balm when I take a sip of water lol), and actually kept my very dry and often cracked lips actually moisturized for once! And yeah, this one was juuust right. I can attest the the long term results, been using it for months (a little goes a long way, even for me) and my lips stopped being annoyingly dry all the time. From using this lip balm (original, your girl don’t do no scented stuff) my lips have stayed moisturized and I genuinely didn’t realize the difference until now, that’s how much I’ve gotten used to having soft lips thanks to this lip balm. Thank you, Mario Badescu Lip Balm Original Scent, now my sister can stop telling me “Your lips are so dry put on some lip balm.“ I don’t have to suffer that anymore. Actually works (not clickbait)
