I’ll be the first to admit I’ve been slacking in the spf department. I’ve always considered myself a connoisseur of skincare, but I just recently discovered how important sun screen is in a skincare regimen. This sunscreen makes my skin glow! It’s moisturizing with hyaluronic acid and doesn’t leave a white cast on your face, I have normal skin- not oily or dry and it was a perfect fit for me! Glow with shiseido ✨
