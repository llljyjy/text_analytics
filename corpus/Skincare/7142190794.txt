Let me start by saying DO NOT use this if you have dark skin. I’m the palest person I know and you can see this on my skin. I think that’s just the nature of zinc oxide sunscreens but I’m not totally sure. I used to really like this and I had bought it because of Hyram like a lot of other people. One of my biggest concerns with this sunscreen is the fact that it has Isostearic Acid which is a well known acne causer but I didn’t realize this until my dermatologist pointed it out and it was too late to return this. I have not noticed any breakouts yet that I can contribute to this sunscreen but just know it’s a possibility because of that ingredients, Cosdna actually ranks it as a 5 in the acne category. My other quarrel with this sunscreen is just the way it applies. This is not moisturizing even though it might seem like it when you first put it on. It dries QUICK and will not blend into the skin properly if you let it dry before it’s fully rubbed in and you’ll also have white streaks on your face. This also dries down sticky and will have a bunch of hairs and dust stick to your face. I’ve also found that throughout the day at work, I’ll have white flakes pilling and flaking off on my chin and it’s very noticeable. As for actual sun protection, I’ve never actually used this in a setting where I would get sunburnt, I use this for daily wear so I’m not sure how well it protects against the sun yet. Since I can’t return this sunscreen I will be finishing it but I am not happy with it and will not be repurchasing. Let the sunscreen hunt continue Not my favorite but not the worst ever
