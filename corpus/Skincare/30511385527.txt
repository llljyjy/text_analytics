I got this product as a sample. Before that I didn’t know about the serum. At night, I applied on my face after toning. In the morning, seriously, I felt the difference. This really helped my skin glow. And , it wasn’t dry. I must say it’s a must to use for the women who is in their thirties. There’s is only one problem which is the price. Really works but expensive.
