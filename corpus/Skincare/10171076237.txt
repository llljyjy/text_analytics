I love Glow Recipe, and I really wanted to love this product but it’s so hard to work with. It pills so bad, even after I read the tips Glow Recipe posted on their Instagram on how to keep it from pilling during application. I let my skincare products set in and dry before I applied the sunscreen, and I patted the sunscreen into my skin instead of rubbing it in, and it still pilled up. I don’t know what else to do. I really wanted to love this product...
