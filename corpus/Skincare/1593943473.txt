I love a lot of other Laneige products, but for me this serum is just okay. I like the bottle design and the mild scent, but the serum isn’t as hydrating as I’d hoped. It feels like it sits on top of my skin instead of absorbing. I have combination skin that leans dry most of the time, and this didn’t seem to mitigate the dryness much even when paired with a hydrating toner and moisturizer. On the positive side my skin’s a bit sensitive and this did not cause me to break out. Others’ mileage may vary, but I won’t repurchase this once I run out. Ok serum, not very hydrating
