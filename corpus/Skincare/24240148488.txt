This moisturizer pleasantly surprised me. I usually expect moisturizers with rich textures to be too greasy for my combination oily skin. However, this moisturizer was the perfect balance - nourishing enough for the dry winter air but does not make my skin oily or breakout. The scent is fresh green tea and not overwhelming at all.  #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Great winter moisturizer for combination oily skin
