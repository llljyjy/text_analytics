I have combination skin and this moisturizer was perfect for my oily zones. I put it on at night and woke up with significantly less oil in my trouble areas. I found that these moisturizer wasnâ€™t enough for my dry areas so for that I will have to bundle with something richer.Overall the salicylic acid helped with my oil control issue which if that is a problem you have this will be a good product for you. Great lightweight moisturizer!
