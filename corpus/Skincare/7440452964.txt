i’ve been using the product for a few weeks now. i generally like lancome products and never have any major complaints. my skin feels more hydrated since i’ve started using this serum (my skin is always dry and in need of moisture). in terms of fine lines and age spots, i haven’t seen much change but i think this tends to take months and not weeks.  i still enjoy the product and feel like it’s a much welcome added step to my nightly skincare routine. i’ll definitely be using this product regularly. nan
