I recieved from Influenster and Estee Lauder this sample of Revitalizing Supreme + youth power creme for my honest review. I have used it morning and night everyday for a month on only half my face. I haven’t been able to see a difference. I have even told I’ve always looked young so maybe just isn’t meant for my skin. It felt very lightweight on my face and the scent is nice but not too overpowering. Not for me.
