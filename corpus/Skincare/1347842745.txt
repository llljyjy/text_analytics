I have been trying to find a moisturizer to replace  my Amore Pacific which at $450 per jar is ridiculously expensive. I have VERY dry skin and nothing worked until I found this cream. If you are looking for a cream for your very dry skin that is reasonably priced and works even better than La Mer or Amore Pacific - try this. I love it. Better than all the expensive creams!
