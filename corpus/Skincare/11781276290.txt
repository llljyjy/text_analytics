I got a sample of this to try from Influenster. I like this moisturizer a lot but I think it will be better for me in the summertime. My skin is combination but it’s dry in the winter and this moisturizer doesn’t help my dry patches. I really like that it doesn’t have silicones and the scent is so nice but not from a fragrance. This really makes my skin feel smooth but I’m going to save the rest of it for the summer when my skin needs less hydration. Nice but not for dry skin
