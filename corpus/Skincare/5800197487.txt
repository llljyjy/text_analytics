I’m very picky when it comes to sunscreen because many of them make me break out or super shiny or wear off quickly. I live in Arizona so it’s really important to wear SPF daily year-round. I really like the way this feels on my skin and absorbs nicely. I like the high 50 SPF because the sun out here is brutal so I’ll definitely be repurchasing and using it daily. Must have high SPF moisturizer!!
