For such an expensive product I find it does not deliver. I’m on my second bottle and fine lines are not reduced, puffiness and dark circles after zero sleep are still prominent. It’s a thick formula with a light scent but when I wake up after 7-8 hrs my eyes feel dry and tired. Will be trying the caffeine eye cream from the Inkey List next to save some $$$. not worth $56.00
