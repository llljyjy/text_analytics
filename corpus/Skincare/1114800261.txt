I got this in a whim when I moved to Florida and noticed my extremely oily skin yo suddenly so dry and breaking out!  Within days of using this my skin was finally hydrated and it’s been about 3 months now and this might be the best my skin has ever been.  It’s so supple but not greasy at all.  My favorite base right now is a cc matte and works wonderfully with this moisturizer.  I have never used a moisturizer twice and have tried every high end product and I can’t believe how well and inexpensive this product is! The search is over!!
