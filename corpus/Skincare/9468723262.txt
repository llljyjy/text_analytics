it’s not awful, but it’s not the best, tried this one compared to my fav (drunk elephant cleansing balm) and this one felt very artificial and always left a film on my face. i cant tell if it broke me out of if it was underlying factors but i feel like ever since i started using it earlier this year i have been having a little more texture on my skin. beware of the film it leaves, that’s really the downside in my opinion. otherwise it is a good basic cleansing balm. ehhhh
