This product is good for the first few times of use. I love the way it made my face feels, it’s not greasy or makes me look oily. My only BIG problem is that it separates and there’s no way of mixing it. Like there’s two different parts of this separated inside the tube, there’s some kind of oil and cream. No shaking or kneading helps it mix it all together! So sad being such a great product for only a little bit. nan
