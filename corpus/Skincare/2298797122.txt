I really liked this eye serum. I liked the texture being a bit on the oily side as well as the light scent. I canâ€™t speak for it working on dark circles as I only tried for seven days and I did not see a noticeable difference but using it for longer, I may have noticed more of a difference. I received this product free from an Influenster promotion. Nice feeling eye serum
