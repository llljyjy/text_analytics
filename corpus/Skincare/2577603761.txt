I’ve kind of been ignoring this in favor of moisturizers that advertise ceramides because I thought that was what my skin needed, but this is an incredible moisturizer. It feels good, it makes your skin look good. It hydrates and locks in moisture so you don’t feel like your’e sacrificing one for the other. I’ve been using it at night and my skin looks visibly better in the morning. I think for my combination/oily skin, combined with the actives/products I use at night, this is great, perfectly balanced. It’s light but it still feels like I’m putting on a good cream that lasts me through the night. The only thing is, I’m REALLY not a fan of the scent. I hate it. I tend to stay away from fragrance, and I think that’s why I slept on this for so long. The fragrance is unnecessary and outdated, but it’s still a very good formula. This is a Gem.
