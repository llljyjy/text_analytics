I was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling their 7 day microfoliant and it was a very different exfoliant. I have Combination skin and this balanced it out and the cool thing is that it was a very lightweight powder. It didn’t scratch my face, it didn’t feel like sandpaper. This polished it. My skin was so much brighter and smoother than ever before. Dermalogica I love this Microfoliant. Thank you for allowing me to try this. Adding to my skin care routine!!
