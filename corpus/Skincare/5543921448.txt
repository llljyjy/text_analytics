I’m a face mask fanatic, so it’s hard to find a new mask that really wows me anymore, but this one is a game changer! I loved how smooth and creamy the product was going on my face and the little charcoal beads were fun to break down. It was cool to watch the mask change to grey as you rub it in! It didn’t dry all weird and crackly and I could actually still move my face as it dried and didn’t make my skin feel crusty or dried out. Rinsing it off was easy and my skin felt so soft and luxurious afterwards. I’ll definitely keep coming back to this mask! Cookies N Clean is a Dream!
