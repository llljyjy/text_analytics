The texture of this is nice super thick and emulsifies fine. To me the product reminds me of Vaseline with the thickness and smell of it, I don’t mind at all. The effectiveness for me is ok it takes of my face makeup and eyeliner but for mascara you kind of have to rub and rub to get off and it honestly bugs my eyes. Can’t open them or else it hurts. And with lipstick it’s not that great at taking off I have to go in with something else for my lips Ok
