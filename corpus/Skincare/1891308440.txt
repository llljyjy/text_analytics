I will say that the scrubby isn’t too harsh. It’s got the consistency of sugar. It left my skin feeling soft, but make sure you moisturizer after. I found that it made my skin tight and dry feeling once the water evaporated. It exfoliates so it does what it’s intended to do. But to me it has a “chemical” smell. Almost like cleanser to me. It doesn’t linger once you rinse, but I don’t like the smell while I’m washing my face. I should note that I am pregnant, so it could be just that it is unpleasant because of this. Exfoliates but smells like “cleanser” to me.
