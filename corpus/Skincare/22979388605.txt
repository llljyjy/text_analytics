I recently received The Shiseido Essential Energy VoxBox from Influenster and Shiseido for free in exchange for my honest review about one of their products, the Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream. This product is absolutely amazing! I live in a dry climate and despite always using some sort of other moisturizing/hydrating cream my skin was still very dry and dull lookingâ€¦ However, since I started using the Shiseido hydrating cream with spf 20 during the day and the Shiseido hydrating cream (without spf 20) at night before bed, my skin now feels and looks so healthy and hydrated. I definitely recommend this product! My New Fav
