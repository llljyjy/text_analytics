Love the results on my super sensitive skin! No burning, itching, or increased redness. This set is also a great value. The only two items in the set that I’ve already run out of are the pink drink and the moisturizer. Good Genes, A+, and Luna Oil are the most expensive items in the kit and they aren’t anywhere near finished and I’ve had the set about 3 weeks. This is a great set if you want a complete routine and want to try something without spending a fortune. Super smooth, glowy skin is in reach!
