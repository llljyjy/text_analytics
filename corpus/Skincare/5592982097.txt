I bought it after seeing a video of someone using it after a breakout of three large cystic acne pimples. I could relate as I get very big under-skin pimples from time to time. This product helped to reduce the size of the pimples over about 3-7 days. There is a noticeable difference after the first night as well. I would recommend you give it a try for the big ones. nan
