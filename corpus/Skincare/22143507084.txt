have been looking for a moisturizer that is lightweight and absorbs well and not heavy greasy looking. I received Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream and wow where has this been all my life, this cream is amazing. Compared to others that work halfway this by far is my favorite and it actually works for my dry skin. Owning this product benefits me in so many ways it’s lightweight, it absorbs well in my skin, using it has made my skin feel smooth, and lastly the usage and price point.  And it is 24 hours lasting. I’d definitely recommend this to friends and family.This is the first cream that I’ve tried that is unique in its own way, very soothing to the skin and rich and nourishing! It’s bit odorless smell, which most of us might like because that’s always a plus for cosmetics! I would totally recommend this! love it. Impressive Cream
