Not only aesthetically pleasing, the product leaves a nice smooth feeling when I wake up. I use this both in my morning and evening routine with no issues of piling or irritation. Gentle enough to use daily and effective. I love how there’s no fragrance as I’m sensitive to it. Some vitamin C serums can cause irritation, but the formulation of this has caused no issues for me. Only thing I would change is the dropper. The slight hook of the dropper can sometimes be hard to maneuver, but infrequently gets in the way. Effective and beautiful.
