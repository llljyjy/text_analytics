I was beyond disappointed that they discontinued the Sephora tanning mist. So I gave this a try.. I like that it’s pretty easy to apply, no streaks, dries pretty quickly and it’s buildable.. but the SMELL. Omg it’s atrocious. With the original Sephora spray I could put it on and not have to shower after and it had no scent. And this one looks so good when I wake up (some fades after the shower) but there’s no way I can not shower after leaving it all night, the smell is so bad that sometimes even after I shower I can STILL smell it. If they did something about the smell it would be a decent tanner. But it’s not for those who want to be really really dark, its a pretty natural colour and I don’t find it orange at all, after one use I have a bit of a glow, after 2 uses it’s more noticeable nan
