I never know what to expect with eye creams but this one definitely helped brighten my skin around my eyes. I have a toddler and are going through a phase where sleep is limited, so this cream has been helpful in brightening and helping my skin retain elasticity! Goes on easily with my only complaint being that it does take a little bit to absorb and until it does itâ€™s a bit heavy feeling. nan
