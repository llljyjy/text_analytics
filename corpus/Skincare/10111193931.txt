I have rosacea, so I was incredibly excited to try this kit out. I received it completely for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Step one is the serum, which was light, silky, and moisturizing. It absorbed into my skin quickly and didn’t feel sticky like a lot of serums I’ve tried. The cream is the second step, and it was the only thing I didn’t like it. It was very heavy and greasy, and I hated the smell. I also felt like it didn’t make any difference if I used it or not, except it made me more likely to break out.The third step was the color correction, and THIS is the really good stuff. I could put on the serum, the color corrector, and some face powder, and most days it actually hid my rosacea. If I used them and then put on my foundation and my usual makeup, it helped cover my rosacea completely, except when it flared up on really hot or really cold days. A little of it goes a long way, too, and I will definitely be investing in more. Really helped my rosacea
