This balm is amazing. I love the applicator and texture. I usually like a scented balm, and even though this isn’t its still very refreshing. It has a slight rose scent and no taste. I’ve noticed an improvement in overall hydration and smoothness of my lips. It has a great ingredients list and you get a really good amount of product for the price. I’ll never go without it now!
