Yes! Just yes! Order it! I just turned 40 and knew I was going to be cursed with skin that needed a lot of care. I already have fine lines and deep wrinkles, dark spots, uneven skin tone, etc. I received this product to test and I am so glad that I did. I have never used retinol before and now it has become a part of my daily skincare routine. I received this product to test and I am so glad that I did. Iâ€™ve used it about 4 weeks now, following the directions. I can tell that my skin is starting to look SOOOOOO MUCH BETTER! The dark spots are lightening, my skin is glowing, and my deep wrinkles ARE ACTUALLY SMOOTHING OUT! I truly cannot believe it! Never did I ever believe anything would help me when it came to the wrinkles. NEVER! Now I truly know that you should never say never. I may have received this product free to test, but I will now be purchasing it as part of my everyday routine! Hail to Shani Darden!!
