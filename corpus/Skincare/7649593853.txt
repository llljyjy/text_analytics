I’ve purchased this during the November Rouge sale when they had the old packaging. I loved it!! So I repurchased another in the Sephora kit but the scent was completely different. Smells like chlorine. They’re claiming it’s the same formula but I think so otherwise… I really loved this product but now I’m worried about putting this on my skin. Chlorine smell??
