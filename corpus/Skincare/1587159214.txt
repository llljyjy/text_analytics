I received this product as 7 samples from @thisisbutterly @chickadvisor @clarinscanadaI really was surprised and didn’t expect it to smell this good (smells like rose petals) and make my face feel so renewed. I have issues with my facial skin as soon as the weather goes below 10 celsius and this has made such a difference after only one use. It absorbs really quickly in the skin and doesn’t leave any weird greasy residues like some other products usually do. I am so happy with this. I will definitely be on the look-out for this product in full-size format. This make my face feel like brand new skin
