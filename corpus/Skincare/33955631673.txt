I really like the experience I had with these pads! I used them for two weeks straight. It helped a lot with my texture and gave me a lovely glow. I was looking for a dark spot treatment to so I wouldn’t buy it if that’s your main concern, but it would probably be great with a dark spot serum. I want to try the red pads next and use that technique. I definitely want to buy it again to use right before my makeup routine, I bet it would be great. Hope this helps! Nice results
