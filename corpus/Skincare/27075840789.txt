I honestly love this. Used it for several months last year and it gave me a wonderful texture, soft dew, glowing skin and faded my dark spots. I’ve seen some complaints about the smell but I think it smells wonderful, a nice light melon to brighten your morning or refresh your day. I only stopped using it because I began spending a lot of time outdoors and my only complaint is I wish the SPF was higher. I’m very fair skinned so I’m concerned about getting enough protection, which 30 feels too low..I have moved on to other sunscreens for now as I’m more comfortable with the higher SPFs and I’ve moved to a dryer climate and am using a heartier moisturizer this winter. But for people who don’t spend a lot of time in direct sunlight and don’t have to deal with the harsh Canadian winters, definitely worth a buy!I would consider repurchasing in the future. nan
