This is the first time I am trying products from Nudestix. I love how this is a three-step set that covers cleaning, exfoliating and moisturizing. These three products smell amazing and have my favorite citrus scent in them. The make-up remover really blends into the skin and takes off the foundation and eye makeup. I love how the exfoliator makes a difference in my skin. I feel that my skin texture is smoother after every use. The moisturizer pulls everything back together and gives my face a perfect hydrated feel without being too heavy. These three samples are large enough to bring with you on trips! I would definitely purchase this again and recommend it to my friends and family. Simple 3 Step Kit
