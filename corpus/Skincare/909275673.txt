Love!  Ordering a backup!  This is great at removing sunscreen and makeup.  I don’t even need to do a second cleanse.  This leaves my skin clean and soft. It did not irritate my rosacea/sensitive skin.  And I LOVE that it’s in a bottle with a pump, I can just keep this at my bathroom sink. This is sooo much easier and less messy that scooping out a thick cleansing balm. nan
