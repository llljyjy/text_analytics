I received this product as a free sample to try it out. I definitely felt like it moisturizes skin, and trust me my skin is dry and needs it!  But I didn’t feel it moisturizes through out the night, my skin still felt more dry in the morning.Also the problem is the sample size was so small it was enough for 2 maybe 3 moisturizes and that’s not enough time for a proper review in my opinion. But try it out I do recommend. You may love it! Moisturizing
