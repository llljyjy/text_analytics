Got this as a #freeproduct to try out but have always been a huge fan of Laneige and use their water bank cream as my regular moisturizer. This water sleeping mask is a perfect pair for the winter and is like a huge drink of water for my skin. I definitely wake up to super supple and soft skin and love the clean scent. Feels great and doesnâ€™t leave my face sticky! Highly recommend it for that extra oomph of moisture during the dry months. nan
