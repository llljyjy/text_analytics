This was my first Shani Darden purchase, but not my last. I’m ordering her resurfacing serum. This eye cream is truly amazing. I bought it on vacation and used it for the 6 days I had left. I can see the difference. I am very pleased with my purchase. I’m 64 and always looking for the best staple skin care product that I can get. I can’t afford super expensive and I think the price point is about middle of the road. It does deliver. In the past I have had prestige skin care that had a longer history and following, but I honestly love this more and will buy her entire line.  Keep this coming Shani. Great product that works!!
