I was gifted by dermalogica the “Daily Milkfoliant Exfoliant“ in exchange for a review. Thank you at dermalogica for giving me a chance to try this item.This is a calming vegan exfoliator that polishes the skin without damaging the skin barrier. It contains oat bran extract, coconut milk, fruit derived AHA and bha, and papain extract to gently exfoliate the skin. I add a small amount on my damp skin and then start creating a foam. It leaves my skin feeling soft and radiant. I love how a soon as you add it to your skin it starts foaming without scratching or irritating your skin. It creates a lovely lather that rinses clean without leaving my skin feeling stripped. This is a great exfoliator to travel with since it’s in powder form and a little goes a long way. So far I use it a few times a week but if you have oily or textured skin I don’t see any issues using it everyday. Gentle exfoliating cleanser
