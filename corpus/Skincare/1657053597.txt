The packaging is great and I love how they give you a little spatula to keep the product clean for each future use. Also. The bamboo booster was a really nice addition and I’ve been adding it to my other jelly and cream cleansers when I feel like I need an extra exfoliant boost. Who do we write to, to have this sold separately! Lol However, those are the best praises I can give for this product. I had really high hopes for this cleansing balm since I’ve loved my other DA products I’ve tried. Unfortunately, for me, this product just wasn’t the biz. When I tried to use it. I felt like the product didn’t remove my makeup properly. It kind of just lifted it and captured it inside the balm and smeared it all over my face. When I would go to rinse the product off,  it would just stick to my skin, leaving me to have to use a towel to wipe the makeup sludgy mess from my face. I’ve heard other people really enjoy this product. Unfortunately for me. I won’t be buying again. Meh.
