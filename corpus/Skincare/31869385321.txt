Before anything I need to clarify how sensitive my skin is- one use of a new cleanser leaves my skin irritated for weeks.

Now let me tell you it literally cleared my pimples and left my skin feeling softer than ever just by using it for a week. This is now a staple in my skincare routine. Skin Saver
