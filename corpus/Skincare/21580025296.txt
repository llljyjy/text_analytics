It’s my first toner ever and I did a lot of research before buying one because I have combination skin so I wanted something that was light but not too liquidy and I also wanted something wouldn’t be too harsh on my skin. I don’t have full-on acne but I do get pimples when i’m stressed and before my period, I also have uneven skin tone, dullness and blemishes. This toner helped with all of it!!! I wash my hair every three/four days so I use it after I get out of the shower and have washed my face. It has worked wonders for me! But of course, I do change my skin routine every now and then so my skin doesn’t develop some type of immunity to the products I use and benefit from. I am obsessed with this toner!!
