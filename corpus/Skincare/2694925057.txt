Credit where credit is due. I wore this to the beach for a tropical vacation on my face for a full week and barely even tanned and definitely didn’t burn the whole time I was there (I did reapply after heavy swimming or sweating). If you need strong protection this seems to truly offer that. For more regular use this is good, but not my favorite as the finish is a little heavy and drying for my dry skin type. Still, in the dog days of summer when I’m at my oiliest and the sun exposure is higher, this is a good one to have on hand. Just not great for winter for my skin type. nan
