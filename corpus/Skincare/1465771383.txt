I stopped using my prescription RentinA while I used this for a month. It works just as well. The formula is amazing and fresh. I love how you mix the powder to ensure you’re getting the most Potent product. It did not cause any skin sensitivities. It’s thinner than RetinA but just as yellow. It has no smell. I really love this product and will keep it in my rotation. As good as Retin A
