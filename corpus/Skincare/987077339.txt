My skin is very reluctant to try out new products as they tend to cause me to break out. I’ve never had that issue with goopglow products, which is nice. It has my skin feeling very smooth and refreshed when I use it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it has a very strong citrus smell. I love fragranced products but not a huge fan of citrus scents. I will definitely be purchasing in the future even if it only comes in this scent because I like the product enough to get past it(and it’s not a terrible scent just strong and not my favorite) 4/5 would recommend(for reference, I am a 42 year old woman with redness to my skin and it doesn’t affect it like some products do) Love goop
