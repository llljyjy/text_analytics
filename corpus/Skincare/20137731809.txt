Actually really like this product. Gives me a nice color not super dark but just perfect glow especially in the winter time. As long as I apply evenly I donâ€™t have streaks or blotchy. I have had really good experience with all idle of paradise products, some of them just take a few tries to learn how to perfect them. perfect subtle color
