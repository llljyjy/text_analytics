I’m not usually a fan of self-tanners (I’ve found other self-tans to be patchy, orange, and unflattering), but these glow drops are wonderful. My goal was to even out redness and discolouration in my face, so I added three drops to my moisturiser before going to bed and woke up with a natural, even, and subtle glow—and my skin has never felt softer! nan
