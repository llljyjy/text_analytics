I’ve never heard of a lotion that applies like a toner so I have nothing to compare this to, but I’ve been pleased overall. The packaging is pretty yet simple, and the smell is very light but pleasant. I don’t remember reading on the packaging that there was hyaluronic acid, but reading it online makes it even more of a plus for me! I have semi-sensitive skin and have a tendency to get red with the slightest bit of irritation, but this lotion hasn’t broken me out or irritated my skin at all. I will say, I wish the directions/description was a little better on the box and on the bottle. I’m a little perplexed as for when to use this in my skincare routine. Before toner? After toner? In lieu of toner? In addition to a cream moisturizer? It would be helpful if the directions specified this. I’ll have to play around and see what works best for me. I enjoy how lightweight this product is, as I can’t stand feeling like there’s 8 layers of products on my face. If I had to make any complaint, it would be that the product feels mildly oily on my skin after applying, but that seems to go away within a few minutes. I’m curious to see longer term results, as I know mushrooms have some great health benefits! I have combination to oily skin, especially in my T-Zone but I’m not sure I would recommend this to someone with dryer skin unless they were to use this product in addition to a heavier cream moisturizer. nan
