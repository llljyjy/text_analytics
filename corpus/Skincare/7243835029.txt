I started using this moisturizer about 5 months ago and I absolutely love it! I have mature skin that tends to get tight and is very sensitive. The luxurious texture goes on thick but instantly absorbs into the skin so it doesnâ€™t feel heavy or sit on top of skin. The fragrance is nice (not too heavy) and I love the little paddle that allows you to scoop out the moisturizer without having to put your fingers right in the product. A little pricey but a little goes a long way. Would definitely recommend. Must-have moisturizer
