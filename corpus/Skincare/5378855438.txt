Bought travel size version of this because tretinoin was leaving my skin textured, yet very irritated and red. I wanted a gentle exfoliant that wouldn’t dry out my skin like the tret. This is it. Buy this if you want the smooth baby-soft “glass skin“. Perfect exfoliator. I wish I had bought it sooner Glass Skin
