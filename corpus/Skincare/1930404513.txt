I received this product for free from Influenster and Clinique in exchange for my honest review. I used Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream for a month. I like itâ€™s creamy thick texture and it absorbs nicely into my skin. It was not oily and the smell is neutral, which I love. This product left my skin soft and helped reduce some lip lines. I would need more time with the product to see any major differences in my skin. Velvety Soft Skin
