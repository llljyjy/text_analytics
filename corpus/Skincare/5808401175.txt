I like this gel moisturizer. I have oily skin and am acne prone and this really helps with my moisture barrier! It did pill for me when I put an oil overtop after a few minutes but it provides enough moisture without using oil so I donâ€™t attempt anymore. I love the way my skin feels after using this! nan
