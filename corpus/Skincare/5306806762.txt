I used to use Coola’s old tinted mineral BB cream SPF 30 religiously before it was discontinued.  This seems to be closer to that formula, although it is different.  For one, the smell of this is absolutely WRETCHED.  Think rotten eggs and a chemical fire and it is slightly grippy on the skin.  Those two cons aside, I like the coverage, how smooth it applies, and the yellowish tint is very flattering on my skin.  I don’t wear foundation on a regular basis, but I feel like this would hold onto your makeup all day long while preventing oil breakthrough.  Overall, I like it. Smells HORRIBLE but works well
