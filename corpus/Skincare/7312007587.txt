Okay WOW, I first have to say that I have tried way too many skin products for dryness, my skin is hella dry! After just one use of this (with the rice cleanser) and my face has never felt better… it took me a while to try it because I thought it was just overhyped and def isn’t cheap but my gosh is it worth it. A little goes a long way. You won’t be disappointed, I promise! DRY BABES READ THIS!!
