Absolutely in love with this product. I used to have a really bad acne so Itâ€™s really difficult to find products for my skin and not to provoke another outbreak. I started to use this Serum because my skin was too dry sometimes. I apply it two times a Day: in the morning before Drunk Elephant Physical Daily Defense SPF 30 and in the evening before my night cream. My skin feels so hydrated and all glowy. Totally recommended Perfect hydrating serum
