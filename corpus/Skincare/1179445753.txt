Here’s an honest tell all - I did NOT receive any free product for this review!!! Pros are these are easy to throw in your bag, no messy powders and decent price. I don’t actually drink mine - I chew it up and swallow it with a drink in the morning. By doing this it lessens the prolonging of the taste and it actually fills me up like I just ate a protein bar.  The taste isn’t 10/10 but I prefer it to mixing messy powders that make me gag when trying to down it!! It’s taste is better than other products I’ve tried. That said, I’m giving it four stars only as I don’t see a huge difference in my skin - but I’m in my 50’s - so not dealing with acne. I’ve only been taking it for two weeks so hopefully will see results. Great concept
