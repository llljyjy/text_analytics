This product is what I was expected based on its description.  It has a nice creamy consistency without being too thick.  I mainly use it on my hands and arms where signs of aging have begun to appear.  I have l fewer dry patches.  Even after washing my hands once or twice, I don’t have to immediately reapply more.  I love that the consistency is perfect for my neck and décolleté.  These areas are beginning to show age. I am pleased so far.   I will be purchasing more.  **I received this product as a promotional item from Influenster. Excellent product for many moisturIzing needs.
