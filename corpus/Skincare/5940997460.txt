I’m not sure if I got a bad batch of this product or what but I felt it was very underwhelming. The product made my skin feel irritated and greasy once on. I didn’t have any break outs or redness after use but if you’re sensitive to products I would probably avoid this one. Even after the product absorbed into my skin my skin felt greasy and not nourished or hydrated. The best way I can describe the texture of this product is old school cheap sunscreen. I didn’t notice any smells from the product when I used it so I guess that is a plus if you are sensitive to fragrances. I have dry skin and am all about moisturizing products but this one definitely is not it. For the price point I was expecting a lot more. You’re better off getting the Laneige water bank for this price point if you want something hydrating and moisturizing. underwhelming and overpriced
