I am on my second container of this moisturizer and I love the immediate and lasting hydration it provides my skin. The moisturizer absorbs easily despite being a little thicker and it really plumps my skin. I can wear make-up without any pilling or caking. In wintertime it really helped my dry skin and in summer it keeps my skin looking refreshed and glowing. The new packaging is super cute and my softer and glowing skin is very happy! Yay for hydration!
