I keep hearing so much hype about the J-Lo line so I was super excited to get a chance to try a few things. The packaging of this eye cream is nice but it is also very bulky and big. The cream itself feels nice to touch but I think it is too thick for my under eye area. It takes a good while to fully absorb and a little goes a long way. I have used it for about 3 weeks now and haven’t really seen any difference in the puffiness or Darkness under my eyes. I do have a few smile lines or crow’s feet and I have not seen anything in regards to those either. I really wanted to like this but it was a miss for me. nan
