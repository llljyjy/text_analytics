I am a fan of the vitamin C products, the scent is always cheer me up, and I was really excited to try this essence. The bottle looks attractive and expensive, made of the glass.The pump is perfect, always got the right amount of the product. The essence itself is creamy and not too watery, smells amazing, easy to apply and dries instantly. After a week of usage, I have noticed that the skin definitely looked brighter and more healthy, also had some improvements with smoothness. I will definitely try the skin cream too to reach the whole potential. #trywithtopbox The skin definitely looks brighter
