I love a few things about this product 1) the stainless steel is great to avoid dropping and it breaking. I’ve had several gua sha’s that have broken in half from just dropping on the counter. So love that this is more resilient and 2) easy to clean as well. 3) I love that this has multiple sculpting tools in one. Although the price is higher for this tool, it’s able to be used in various ways rather than the standard gua sha. Skin is literally glowing after one use. nan
