Sorry Sephora. Was excited to try this little mushroom face serum, but hard to when the pump doesnâ€™t work, AT ALL. No damage to the bottle, the pump is clearly just faulty. Only way to use is to open bottle, dip tube in and dab on fingers. Not very sanitary and the liquid is light so not very effective. Might be good, can't tell....
