I received this product for free from influenster for an honest review. With that said, I really didn’t like this. The smell is not very appealing and it caused dry patches on my skin. I ended up giving this to my daughter and she loved it. It’s clearing up her acne prone skin and she said it’s left her skin feeling soft. nan
