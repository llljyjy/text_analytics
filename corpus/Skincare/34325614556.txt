I waited to try it for a month to give my honest review - this retinol oil when paring with vitamin C from DE is even more effective. I have dry skin and this oil helps so much on soothing my skin during the winter. One thing I don’t like is the smell of it, it’s not very pleasing to use but since it’s good then I would still recommend! nan
