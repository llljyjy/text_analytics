I purchased this product at another store before it was available at Sephora on a salesperson’s advice. This eye serum did absolutely nothing for me after a month of faithful use. Absolutely no effect whatsoever on my dark circles, and did not plump or minimize fine lines. It did not irritate my sensitive dry undereye skin, but it did migrate after application and made my eyes red and itchy when it got in them. Slightly moisturizing - not enough on its own, but it didn’t pill or clump under eye cream and it did not affect texture or longevity of concealer.  Big fat waste of money. ineffective and overpriced.
