I love this product!! It definitely gives off a subtle glow without actually being oily. I also notice it sits beautifully under my makeup (I wear the tower28 tinted sunscreen/foundation) and also works great by itself! It’s not really a need but I definitely don’t regret buying it I usually use every other day even by itself, my skin looks flawless. nan
