I have dry and acne prone skin which it difficult for me to test out moisturizers that would work. This moisturizer is lightweight and works very well with my dry skin which had me surprised. it soothes and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and doesnâ€™t leave my face burning which is a problem I find with some moisturizers. nan
