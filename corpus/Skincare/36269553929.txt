I use Obagi and swear by the brand. I had an extremely dry nose from a sinus infection this past week and was putting Cetaphil and Obagi on several times a day. No change. I finally put on my Dr. Dennis moisturizer and I kid not - my nose had no dry or flaky skin. I used this AM/PM with the cleanser and peel and my skin has looked and felt great. I’m unsure if it’s relate but I have felt slightly itchy on my cheeks which is uncommon for me but it could just be the shift in products. Cracked skin - GONE!
