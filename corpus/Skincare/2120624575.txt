I hate the smell of this product, smells like a man’s perfume or men’s aftershave. Disappointed that they changed the product and did so for the worse. I really, really liked the previous version of the cream (it was not “cell energy). I am barely using this one as I find the smell overwhelming, long lasting and offensive, which is quite frustrating given its price. Disappointing
