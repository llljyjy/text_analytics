I think this is the perfect night cream. My skin is combo to oily, so it’s a bit heavy for daytime, but at night, I find the texture and scent just the right weight on my skin. I feel like it makes me look glowier and really sinks in overnight. It sinks in right away, so I suspect it would work well for people with less oily skin even during daytime and/or under makeup. The fragrance is light and citrusy which I love, a bit like lemon cream. Another pro is that a little goes a long way! You don’t need much. nan
