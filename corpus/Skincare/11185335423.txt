I have tried a lot of different sunscreens and this one was definitely underwhelming. I was expecting greatness from this brand but it made me feel greasy and shiny…not “glowing” or dewy. Also, it didn’t sink it to the skin as efficiently as I thought it should at this price point. It definitely took a little more work to get it blended it compared to other sunscreens I’ve tried. I feel like there a lot better better ones out there. Not for me…
