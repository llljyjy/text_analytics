Just reading the reviews and wanted to add I just opened my trial size and it smells super neutral - definitely NOT a whiff of stinky feet. I hate smells of any kind (stinky feet, perfume, you name it) and this is very mild barely-there pleasant smell. Like, no smell really. Just opened & applied tonight for the first time so will update if it somehow spoils in the next few daysâ€¦ no smell!
