I received this as a free sample in exchange for my honest opinion. I really like the SPF 40 in it however, I feel that I have more cons than pros about the product. Pros: barely a fragrance, SPF40, cute bottle. Cons: even when shaking as instructed, the product still came out kind of oily and watery, dispenser could be better, face looked too dewy/greasy like, coverage was barely there, do not like that it cannot be smoothed on but instead patted on as otherwise it will pill up on your face. I was truly hoping to really like this product but with the many cons I have against it and the price, it just doesn’t work for me. It’s okay
