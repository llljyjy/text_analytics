I love this product! I have been using it in place of my toner after cleansing in the shower, and it has been a really lovely substitute for my normal glycolic acid toner. There is no scent, which I love! The pads don’t feel rough or scratchy, thankfully - they’re slightly textured and 1 is plenty to cover my entire face and neck. My skin doesn’t tend to be sensitive, and I’ve been using glycolic acid and retinol for a long time, so I’ve been using this every night. I haven’t had any sensitivity issues with these wipes, and my skin seems to love them. I would absolutely purchase them in the future! Lovely all in one pads
