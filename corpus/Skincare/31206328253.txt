firstly, the packaging is everything. which is something i’ve grown to expect from MERIT. this serum is very liquidy, so i would apply it on the hands then rub onto the face as opposed to applying directly on your face. and of course go in with a cream moisturizer after. also i can tell that the ingredients in this serum are ACTIVE because i had a pimple-turned-scab on my chin and always felt the sensation on that area when i used it (not in an irritating way, but like i said — active) and it didn’t irritate the scab any further. i actually think it expedited the healing process. LASTLY THIS BOTTLE IS DURABLE! i accidentally dropped it while shaking it one evening (a very hard drop) and this baby was still perfectly in tact. this is a great morning and evening serum, i love it! SO LUXE! SO GOOD!
