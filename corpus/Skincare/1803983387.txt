i am beyond obsessed with this oil cleanser - easily the best i have used and worth every penny. the texture and scent are lovely, it rinses completely clean, and my skin LOVES it. gets every little bit of sunscreen off and it is not drying at all. i have fairly sensitive skin and this has caused me zero irritation. will repurchase without question. the BEST
