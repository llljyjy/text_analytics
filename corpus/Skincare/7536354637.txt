This is hands-down my least favorite Supergoop product. It leaves your face incredibly greasy (and this is coming from someone with dry skin who prefers dewy finishes), and itâ€™s impossible not to get in your hair. On top of that, it burns because there is mint in it! My eyes are still watering. The spray nozzle is pretty bad too. All around terrible sunscreen product
