I like how hydrating this eye cream is for my under eyes! As a mom of 2, I feel tired often, and my eyes show it. This doesn’t conceal or cover my dark circles, but it provides a great base of hydration before going in with concealer. It gives a luminous, glows effect. Typically I prefer cooling eye creams, because I struggle more with puffiness than dark circles. Overall I like this product, but if you’re looking for a solution for puffiness I’d try something else. Decent! Room for improvement.
