I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. I wasnâ€™t sure where to use this sunscreen. Though I was given a sample size that was teeny tiny so could only use it on my face so I did. The product is good and did protect my face without it feeling slick or greasy. Overall, a good sunscreen that I would possibly buy again. Good Sunscreen
