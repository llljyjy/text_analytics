I just received my Rice drops Vegan face oil. This facial oil feels so good on my face and is definitely giving me a glow after using. It is my 3rd day of using it morning and night and my face feels so soft & glowing. I incorporated this face oil product for morning & evening use to give myself that glowing appearance. Though I do think that it was a bit too oily around my eyes. But I do feel that it has soften my face just after a few day, made my face glow, & it also has my skin popping. I would highly recommend this product!!! nan
