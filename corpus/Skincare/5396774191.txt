I was coincidentally trying to get rid of acne marks from recent breakouts when I received this product, so super excited. I love drunk elephant! This definitely helps. I love azelaic acid. Itâ€™s the next best thing next to retinoids. Gentle enough for sensitive skin,follow the instructions as is and it brightened my dull skin. I recieved this product for free in return for my honest review. Drunk Elephant for the win again!
