I’ve never used Dior skincare before, but I’m really impressed with this! I’ve actually been searching for a new moisturizer, and I received this one complimentary to review, but I’m really happy with it. I use it every night and it’s been really great keeping my skin hydrated through the night, I wake up with soft and moisturized skin without being oily! During the day I use one with SPF, so I don’t use this one during the day, but I love it overnight. A little goes a long way and it immediately makes me feel dewy and hydrated, if I ever have a day I don’t need SPF I’ll definitely be using this one too. I will say it is a little pricey for the size of the bottle, but I haven’t found a product that keeps me moisturized and so soft without being oily or too thick and sticky, so it’s worth the cost to me. nan
