I was skeptical about this product but it is amazing! I saw results after the 1st use, especially in my nasal labial folds which is my biggest area of concern. It is great if you are starting to lose that lifted muscle tone in your face to bring back that lifted look.For the reviews that say it shocked them. I noticed I had damp hair and it would shock me near my hairline which makes sense since it does use electro current. Also it explains in the instructions that the skin must be dry and both nodes need to be touching the skin at all times. There were times I lifted pressure from the nodes and got a little shock. So as long as you are following the instructions it is good! If you accidentally shock yourself it doesnâ€™t hurt even on the highest level. nan
