I have normal skin with very occasional slight dryness so was interested in trying this product. Overall, I liked it. It did provide  moisturization but for me it was a bit too much. It felt like a very thick cream. I did not notice a scent to it but that is fine. I would recommend this product for someone with much drier skin than mine. nan
