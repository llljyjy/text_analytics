I received this product from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. The serum is very easy to apply; it is absorbed instantly, the packaging is beautiful. My skin looks super glowy and healthy after applying it. The only problem it has and as many users have expressed, is that it cause some breakouts, it is for this reason that I have been using it from time to time and this technique has been working well for me. It is a very good product, only I do not recommend it to people with acne since it could make it worse nan
