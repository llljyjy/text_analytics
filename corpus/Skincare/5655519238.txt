It has been difficult for me to find a cleanser that cleans and doesnâ€™t strip my skin dry. This cleanser does just that. I have textured combination skin. An oily t-zone and dry on the rest of my face. My skin has not had any allergic reactions and I have been using this twice a day for 7 months now.   I also am prone to blemishes every now and again and this cleanser definitely helps with clearing up breakouts! I would recommend 10/10. LOOVE!
