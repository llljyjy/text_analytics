I love this eye cream but I think Laniege has changed the ingredients. When I first purchased this, the packaging was different; it was a much more durable glass container that was blue and had a much more luxurious feel to it. The cream itself would moisturize and snatch away fine lines and bags overnight. Now the packaging is cheaper and I donâ€™t feel the same snatched feeling but my under eyes are moisturized so not bad but not what it used to be. Good but not what it used to be
