Very nice and lightweight moisturizer. Kept me hydrated all day and didn’t break out my skin. Made it 4 stars instead of 5 for the fragrance it smells good and isn’t overwhelming but I tend to not like fragrances or only like a tiny amount in my skincare. Great choice to try if fragrance does bother you! nan
