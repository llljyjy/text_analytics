This product did not work out for me at all. It twists up and down way too easily, making for an uneven application to your legs, especially in the shower. Per the instructions, I applied generously and I did not enjoy the experience in the shower or out. This leaves a slimy, tacky film on your legs, even after rubbing it in. It easily gets caught in the razor blade, and I find myself having to rinse the blades much more often than when I use my less expensive (and better) shaving oil. Unfortunately, I ended up just throwing it away. nan
