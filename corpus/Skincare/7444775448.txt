for as long as I could remember I used makeup removed wipes until I turned 23 and decided I want to start a skincare routine and take care of my skin! I did lots of research, watched videos and learned about skincare, my skin type, what ingredients to look for and what ingredients to avoid etc. I gave this product a shot and I love it!! I love how it feels on my skin, it doesn’t burn my eyes like my wipes used to if the liquid got in my eyes, it’s super soft in my hands, it gets all my makeup off first try. I now buy the giant value tub so it lasts me a while. A little goes a long way which I love as well! with some products it’s expensive for a small container and then you need to use lots it’s a waste! this stuff is not! gave it a try, now I love it!
