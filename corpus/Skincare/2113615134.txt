I usually stay away from foaming cleansers since I don’t feel like they clean very well, but I’ve been loving this one from Dior that I received via Influenster.  It dispenses as a cream and then foams up once you begin rubbing it in.  I use a battery operated facial massager to massage the cleanser on and then leave on for a few minutes before I rinse off.  It’s hard to describe but I actually feel little bubbles on my face.  I imagine it’s like the little effervescent bubbles in champagne lifting the impurities off the surface of my skin and popping them away.  As for how well it cleans, I tend to wear waterproof mascara and this has actually been doing a bang up job getting the vast majority of it off along with the rest of my makeup.  My skin doesn’t feel overly dry afterwards either.  Overall, I’ve been very impressed by this product. nan
