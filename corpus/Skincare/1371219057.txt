For such an expensive sunscreen, you’d think Brandt would have managed their quality control better. It’s unacceptable that a product varies depending on batch. So then how do they guarantee that we are actually getting 50 spf sun protection? I first bought this product a few months ago and it was a beautiful liquid (hence their naming it LIQUID!!) consistency. It was moisturizing and settled nicely without much oiliness. It was so great that I gave it to my mother. I bought a second one for myself during the Rouge spring event and it was soooooo thick that the dropper didn’t even suck up any product. I shook it vigorously hoping that the solution needed to be mixed, but it was of no use. I held the bottle upside down and no product came it…of a little did it was like waiting for thick honey to flow down. When I finally got some product it was so thick on my face my foundation or powder just moved around. It is disgusting. What is wrong with their quality control??? nan
