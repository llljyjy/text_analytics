I regularly use a lot of DE products. I am a huge fan of protini and the butter cleanser, C firma... so I was curious about TLC Framboos. I will not criticize the price since we all know that DE is not in the cheap range. I used this product together with other DE following their smoothie concept. It destroyed my skin barrier, and I started to experience burning and redness (even if IHydrate my skin). I gave it a break, it was winter, and my skin tends to get drier during Dec-Feb. I started using it again, and it was a bad idea. I completely stopped using, and I am frustrated with the results. So if you have sensitive skin or dry skin, DO NOT USE IT; it will be more expensive to fix your skin after this. Destroyed my skin barrier/ dry or sensitive skin
