I am 51 with pretty good resilient skin -  this product was awful. It sinks into every fine line and makes my skin look ridiculously bronzed. It’s not subtle. I look at least 10 years older with this product. There are better options for sunscreen and some moisturizing shine that don’t aggressively age you. Skip it
