So I have been using a sample size for about a month now and I unexpectedly like it. Little background, I have normal skin starting to age and ttc so my hormones are all over the place. With that said I feel like my skin is more supple and has more bounce to it. When I broke out in hormonal acne the crème actually helped heal and get rid of those zits faster than without it. I only use the smallest amount or it would clog my pores and make me oily. I’m not sure about any anti aging claims but I am sure my skin hasn’t gotten worse. Will need to use it much longer to decide if it has helped my fine lines or not. I did stop all my other skin care steps while trying this and I can’t say that I miss the other steps or that I desperately can’t wait to try it with my normal toner or oils etc.  Overall, my skin looks and feels great and I will probably be buying a full size soon! Surprised that I like it.
