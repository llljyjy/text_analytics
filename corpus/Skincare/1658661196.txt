Love these masks. I wish they brought back the apple scent, which was my favorite. I decided to pick this one up because mangoes are my favorite fruit. To my surprise, the mango scent is barely there. It’s not as shockingly smelling like gummy bear, sweet fruit, berry-- I love all of these flavors, so I was surprised that this had a very faint smell.As for the moisturizing factor, these are SO good. I just wish it had a compartment to place the applicator because I get fussy sticking my finger in the pot. It will last you a long time if you don’t contaminate it by putting your finger in the container. Faint mango scent?
