I think the problem with this cleanser is there are ALOT of ingredients in it and I made the mistake of using other products with the same ingredients. So my skin reacted badly and got over exfoliated. The cleanser has BHA: Salicylic Acid, AHA: Azelaic Acid, PHA: Glycolic Acid in it and it is better to use this cleanser by itself with no other products with the same ingredients.Iâ€™ll be returning and will continue using my Youth to the People cleanser. nan
