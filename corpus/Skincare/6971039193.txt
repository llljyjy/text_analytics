I really love the cooling effect from this and it looks amazing under make up! Makes your eyes look so hydrated.  The only problem I had with it was it did burn a little after the cooling set in . But I do have very sensitive under eyes . I will continue to use to see how I like it in a few weeks Great under makeup
