I really wanted to like this product because of the fabulous reviews but unfortunately it breaks me out so much. Like clockwork, every time I use these wipes I get gross acne in areas I typically don’t. When I refrain, I don’t have these same issues. It’s just not the product for me. Breaks me out like clockwork
