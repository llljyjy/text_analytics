I wasn’t really sure what to expect with this product. However, I was slightly dissatisfied that it stung a bit upon putting it on my skin. It was lightweight, but I have pretty sensitive skin and rosacea. It seemed to firm my skin up but it did burn a bit upon use. I’m sure this would work better  for someone who doesn’t have skin sensitivity. Decent Product
