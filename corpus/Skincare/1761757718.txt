Let me start by saying that I have a vast amount of skincare products from a variety of brands. I have quite a few eye creams. The Kiehl’s Multi-Corrective eye cream is my new favorite! I am almost 46 years old, and after a month or so of using, I noticed a definite smoothing of some of the fine lines around my eyes. I also love the consistency of the cream. It’s thick, but not too thick. It has no strong odor, and did not burn my eyes like some eye products do. This is a product I will be re-purchasing most definitely. I would recommend this eye cream for anyone, honestly--whether you are trying to prevent fine lines or reduce them. It is fantastic!! Highly Impressed!
