I received this product complimentary from Influenster and I am already in love. I have been applying this moisturiser for over two weeks now and I am so glad I received a skin care staple in my summer beauty basket.I lovedddd the bottle and how neatly the pump works!!! It claims to be a clean and cruelty free product which is essential for me while selecting a skin care brand.I have been using it for over two weeks now and apply about two pumps both am and pm. I defenitely see an improvement in my skin texture and brightness.I am 33 and defenitely needed a hydrating moisturiser for my day to day skin concerns and I am so happy I found what I need.Defenitely buying this again!! My Summer Skin Care Staple!!
