THE BEST! I’ve tried so many sunscreens and nothing has ever felt as good as this. If you have dry skin, this is a must. It’s super moisturizing and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and supple. It doesn’t leave a white cast either (I have a medium tan complexion) which I’m normally always so afraid of when it comes to buying a new sunscreen. I cannot recommend this enough. a MUST!!
