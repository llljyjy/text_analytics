I received this product complimentary from Influenster for my honest feedback and I really enjoyed this moisturizer, it helped rehydrate my skin and I did notice my makeup went on very smooth over it and it didn’t break down my foundation either. I really liked the subtle smell too it’s very clean and not overwhelming. I have very sensitive skin and this did not break me out or bother my skin at all. Really liked this moisturizer
