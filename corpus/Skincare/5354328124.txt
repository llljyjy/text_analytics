I immediately placed these in the fridge when I received them, looking forward to my evening skincare routine.  They did not disappoint!  The shape is so perfect for all the contours of the face and neck.  The liquid and glass was cold and slipped nicely with my serums against my skin.  I especially appreciated the size of the ‘spoon’ shape as it fit perfectly over my closed eyes like a lovely cooling eye mask.  I wiped them down with alcohol wipes after, returning them to the fridge in their box for next time.  A real inexpensive way to pamper your skin. A true pampering experience
