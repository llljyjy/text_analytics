Bought this as an intro to using sunscreen on my face since I was starting to get into skincare. Pros:-Very light Nostalgic smell-No white cast-Does what it says it does -Price isnt bad compared to other Supergoop products-doesnt pill with makeup-Bottle Shape is neat/cute-I can use it on face when going to the pool-long SPFCons:-If you have combo/oily skin BRUH youre gonna feel this on your face. If paired with a heavy moisturizer made my face feel super greasy/sticky and made it look mega shiny. I stopped using the moisterizer I was using to see if it got any better but not really. -Hair would stick to my face because it wouldnt absorb at all. So i had to keep my hair tied up.-If you live anywhere humid itll just sit on your face-better for Dry skin types probably -You may not like the slight sunscreen smell-If you wear glasses, it might get on your glasses-if you touch your face then your phone; it 100% get on your phone.I wont be purchasing again. I personally stopped using it after about 4 weeks. Since I have combo/oily skin I ended up going with their Mineral Matte Sunscreen for makeup and Unseen sunscreen for no/minimal makeup. I like a weightless/light matte feel throughout the day so Im not sure why this was reccomended to me in store. HOWEVER, It is a good sunscreen, just not for my skintype. I have some scars and a bf with dry skin so I will use this on that instead. Will probably use it if I plan to go swimming for its water resistance and long SPF. Its okay...but not for oily skin
