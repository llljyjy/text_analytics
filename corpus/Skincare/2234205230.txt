I was a little nervous if there would be a learning curve with this product, as it was different than any exfoliant I had used before. However, I was happy to find that itâ€™s incredibly user friendly and super easy to apply. I was also relieved that the texture of this product (when mixed with water) is silky smooth, unlike other exfoliants. I also appreciated the many recommendations the brand gives you with the product, such as adding it to your cleanser (great tip and one I use frequently)! This product has changed my stubborn, flaky skin into skin that actually feels smooth, and is now a holy grail item for me. Where has this been all my life?!
