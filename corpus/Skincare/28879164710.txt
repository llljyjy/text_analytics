I was gifted this product for my honest review.  I’ve used several retinol products in the past and found this to be very gentle and effective in comparison.  Kiel’s is a great brand- I love many of their products and this one doesn’t disappoint.  The packaging is a lot different then many others- however don’t be intimidated!  The secret to results is the innovative way the retinol is released into the serum.  By keeping it fresh- Kiehl’s product helps go to work faster on those pesky lines and wrinkles.  Within a couple weeks I noticed a difference in my skins appearance!  Try this product if you are feeling your skin is looking tired and needs a reboot!  Highly recommend. wrinkles be gone!
