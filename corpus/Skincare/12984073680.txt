Amazing product. There are a lot of reviews claiming it’s too sticky, however, this product is very concentrated. You only need a pea sized dot to the forehead and cheeks. After a few minutes it sets in very nicely. I have very fussy skin and this is one of the few products my skin drinks up with no sass. I’m obsessed with this product. Smells great and is a favorite I recommend. Application technique review
