This could have been made better ... I had high expectations and was disappointed. It like a cheap sunscreen repackaged into a bougie bottle. It has a sunscreen scent, which I hate, and it tastes like sunscreen too .. you know hen you get some on your lip and then taste it on accident. The finish is okay - it dries down semi matte and had a glow to it. Im not going to pay $34 for something I can get for $5-10 at the drugstore. This needs to be reformulated. I will be returning this item. Not good for the price
