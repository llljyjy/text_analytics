At first, I didn’t think I would like this, but I was pleasantly surprised! As someone who has combination skin, leaning oily, this oil has worked wonders for my skin. I thought it would make it too oily or greasy, but it keeps my skin hydrated all day long. I have really enjoyed it for these cold days. I’ve been using this for almost a month now and will definitely continue! The only downside is the price. It is a bit pricey in my opinion. Besides that, I would definitely recommend. nan
