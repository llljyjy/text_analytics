love how hydrating this feels on the skin and blends out smoothly the end result is plump moisturizing feeling skin plus sun protection, sign me up ! the only slight drawback is that there is scent in this product, although the natural fragrance is lower on the ingredient list it still has lime, orange, and citrus oils so if you have very sensitive skin to those be cautious.
