I really liked this cream. It is lightly scented (not for everyone, but I liked it), and very smooth texture. It gets absorbed pretty quickly, so never has to go to bed with my face feeling sickly. Iâ€™m not sure if it would work for those live in dry climates, but if you live somewhere vinegar humid, this is a perfect cream to use during the warmer months. I highly recommend it!
