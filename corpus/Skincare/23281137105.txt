Thought I’d try this toner out as it’s much cheaper than the glycolic acid I was using before. Now I know why. The sticky residue that lingers on your face feels like you slathered yourself in glue. Going to stick with my Mario Badescu toner instead. It feels much more luxurious and does not leave my face tacky whatsoever. It also tightened my pores, while this one felt like it served no purpose on my skin. Who cares that it is 3 times cheaper when it’s so useless? I recommend skipping this product and investing in one that actually does something to your face. Going to return this as soon as possible. Sticky, cheap-feeling
