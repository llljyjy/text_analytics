The Double serum packaging is pretty cool and designed to dispense the product easily. One side of the Serum is clear, while the second is a little orange. The serum is easy to mix, apply and absorbed well. Skin instantly felt hydrated and soft. It also has a nice pleasant scent to it. Amazing ingredients. I would recommend this serum for sure. Super soft skin
