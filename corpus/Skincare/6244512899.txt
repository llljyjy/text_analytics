After trying hundreds of sunscreens and applying them as a punishment, this one is truly a pleasure to use. I have oily skin so when I tell you it absorbs into the skin and feels so light on the skin, believe you me, because I know what oily skin is, my eyelids would get oily. Additionally, I think people who are complaining that it pills, it usually happens when you apply a gel like formula underneath or over this. It has happened with other products in my skincare, so I knew not to apply something that is gel-like transparent and wet consistency. If you apply makeup, use a sponge, so as to not disrupt the sunscreen film. I don’t know the ingredients but that should be your clue, not to mix such products with this sunscreen. It almost feels too good to be true, so I have not tried this in summer, and since I tend to burn easily, I will edit my review after I have worn it in the summer. But so far it is a dream...I don’t want to jinx it :(( I think my search is over, supergoop who?!
