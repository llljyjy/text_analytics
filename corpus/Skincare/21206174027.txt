BEFORE I STARTED USING THIS I HAD GOTTEN A DEEP CHEMICAL PEEL AND IT BROKE ME OUT SO BAD!!! THE BREAKOUTS DIDN’T STOP, DARK SPOTS WERE ALL OVER MY FACE! MY FRIEND WHO HAD BAD ACNE AND MARKS FROM THE ACNE TOLD ME ABOUT THIS, I PURCHASED IT AND FROM ONE DAY TO THE NEXT IT LIGHTENED UP MY SPOTS, I HAVE NOW BEEN USING THIS FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND MY SKIN IS NICE AND CLEAR, AFTER I WASH I TAKE A COTTON PAD AND POUR SOME OF THE TONER ONTO IT, I APPLY THE TONER ALL OVER… ONCE I LOOK AT THE COTTON PAD ITS DIRTY AND IM LIKE HOW IN THE WORLD I JUST WASHED MY FACE, IT DOES HAVE A NASTY TASTE, NOT MUCH OF A SMELL. FOR $10 YOU CANNOT BEAT IT! AMAZING PRODUCT!!!
