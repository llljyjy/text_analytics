Really enjoying this product! The scrubbing beads have good texture and aren’t too gritty, so it’s more of a gentle exfoliation which is great for me. I have medium to dry skin so using this once a day at night works well. And the smell is absolutely wonderful - it’s orange peel but with a spa-like herby scent too. I received this product in exchange for my honest review. nan
