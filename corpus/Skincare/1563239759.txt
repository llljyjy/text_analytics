OMG I am not exaggerating when I say I immediately saw a difference.  I used it as spot treatment and rinsed with water after about 20-30 minutes.  THE REVIEWS ARE unfair regarding the smell it’s not that bad. at all. but it is UNDERSTANDABLE regarding the quantity because it is not that much for $20 but it was DEFINITELY worth it to me & if the price doubled, I’d still buy it!!!!! I first washed my face with the ceramic slip cleanser as instructed. Then I shook it up so it mixed really good and applied as a spot treatment and rinsed with water.  IMPORTANT I saw great results once rinsed but when I say, I saw freaking amazing fantastic results “after” applying the A+ high dose retinol serum (one pump) followed by the UFO acne treatment face oil (two pumps) then the luna sleeping night oil (two pumps) I swear I CANNOT STOP STARING IN THE MIRROR because it seems almost impossible that two hours later it looks like my acne disappeared… basically it appears as if the pimples have either disappeared completely or appear to be 95% reduced. I soooo regret not taking before and after pictures. I did this at night and I sure do hope the acne does not reappear in the morning because this just seems too good to be true. I mean wtf, I am amazed amazed amazed. The lady that helped me at sephora swore by the UFO oil and I am so glad I bought it.  I initially went in to buy the UFO oil and this saturn mask and asked her if she recommended the UFO oil or the multivitamin oil they have and she swore by the UFO oil and it did not disappoint. ps when I don’t have acne, I am in love with their WAKE UP WITH ME morning routine & the GO TO BED WITH ME evening routine… and their blue moon cleansing balm u get what u pay for & it’s worth every $
