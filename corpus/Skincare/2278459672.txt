I loved using the Triple Algae Eye Renewal Balm. I have very thin skin with puffy bags under my eyes and sometime they are a purple color.  I seen a slight improvement  over the days using this product twice a day.  Morning and evening.  I will have to use it longer then the samples they sent me to see for sure if it will improve it but for as long as I used it I think itâ€™s working.  It also feels amazing on.  You just use a little dap of it around your eyes.  It melts into your skin. nan
