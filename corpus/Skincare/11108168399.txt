I feel kind of meh about this (and for the price of this product I don’t want to feel meh!).  It’s ok, the packaging is kind of fun (but be super careful wit it, it isn’t very sturdy and you may be left with an unusable $135 bottle of serum).  I didn’t really see any changes in my skin after using this for a few weeks.  It felt ok, it did a fine job hydrating my skin but I wouldn’t say it did anything extraordinary.  Overall I think it’s to expensive for what you are getting. nan
