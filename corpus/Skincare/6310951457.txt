Don’t hate it, don’t love it. It doesn’t leave the hydrating feel of other similar hydrating serums but that also means it doesn’t stay tacky or feel like anything on the skin. If you prefer that, go for it. The scent is chemically and it doesn’t feel expensive or luxurious but I like that you know exactly what you are getting and that is what you are paying for. Hard to Judge
