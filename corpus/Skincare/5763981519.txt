I didn’t find this lip oil to be moisturizing or hydrating as it claimed. It goes on clear despite being cherry-tinted in the bottle, I was disappointed with this as well. It smells like sweet cherry candy, it may be too much for some people who are sensitive to smells. It was very average, definitely an overhyped product. I wouldn’t go out of my way to repurchase this, I’d recommend gisou for actually hydration or Kosas (for a tint of colour) instead. Overhyped
