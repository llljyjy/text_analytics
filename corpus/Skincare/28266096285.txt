Charlotte Tilburyâ€™s newest addition to her already fabulous skincare line is the GlowToner. I was amazed as from Day 1, the very first try, my skin was softly radiant with a healthy, vibrant glow that was simply beautiful. The claims of hydrating, younger-looking, glowing and plumper were 100% true! I have or had enlarged pores. I had tried so many products to visibly make my pores smaller and THIS PRODUCT IS IT! I continued to try for approximately 2 weeks and my skin looked increasingly healthy overall. My makeup even goes on more smoothly! I have had friends ask what I am now using for skinvare. I am a skincare and makeup enthusiast and I can honestly say, this is an Amazong Product! A definate Must-Have! ! I was looking for skincare that I could use and not even do a full makeup look during these hot, Houston, TX, days. Thank you, Charlotte Tilbury! From Dau 1, your Glow Toner shines above the rest!I received this product compliments of Influenster Amazing Product!
