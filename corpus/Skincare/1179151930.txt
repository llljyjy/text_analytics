I  received this product free in exchange for my honest feedback. I really really wanted to believe in it! It promised to “Visibly diminish signs of aging And help Reduce the appearance of puffiness, fine lines and dark circles.”Well, you be the judge of that. The first pic is before I started using the serum. The second pic is with the serum on 2.5 weeks later.  Also, when I first started using it I got little red bumps and welts all around my eyes. I kept on using it though and the bumps disappeared. So be cautious if you’re skin is sensitive, mine is fussy sometimes with new ingredients. I just don’t think this worked for me. Also! The Directions tell you to follow with their eye cream. So I don’t know if I was getting the full benefits. I did follow with my own eye cream. So all it did was just add an extra step for me, Putting the serum first and then the eye cream. But! The applicator was unique and Cooling, so it gets 1 stars. Sadly this Dior Serum just didn’t deliver on it promises. Don’t waste your cash
