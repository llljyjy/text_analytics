This sunscreen did not seem so bad at first, went on alright after the rest of my skincare. It was a little bit of work to rub it all in and I could definitely see this having a white cast over darker skin (I’m a light/light medium). The problem didn’t really start until I got to work and started my day. I live in San Diego, CA and it is June so it was a bit warm today. The second I started to even sweat a little, my face was BURNING! Additionally, it had a bit of that greasy kind of feel. Overall, it felt horrible. I got home and washed my face immediately. I’m unsure if it was just my skin having a reaction or not but my skin is also super dry after washing it off and even flaking a bit. The only thing changed in my routine was this sunscreen. Face Burner!
