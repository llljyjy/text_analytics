I got a sample sized jar of this for free from influenster for my honest review. It goes on smoothly feels nice on my face. Doesnâ€™t have an over powering smell and a little goes a long way. This little jar I have been able to make last for 2 weeks. I really like it. So much so that I bought it. My face feels moisturized and happy in this cold dry winter weather. Good stuff
