I did not notice any difference while using this product for over a month. I have sensitive skin and this product did not irritate my skin. The product itself is sticky and the packaging isnâ€™t the best as it does tend to get messy where the dispenser is. The product is absorbed into the skin fairly quickly and does not stay sticky. Overall, I would not repurchase this item as I did not see any difference in my skin. nan
