I use various rose water based products because they are gentle on my skin, and help soothe redness.The biossance rose moisturizer does exactly that and I could not be happier!It is surprisingly and happily lightweight so that it doesnâ€™t feel heavy on my skin. The scent is very very light and not overpowering as some others can be.It left my face glowing and soft, was very gentle and did not irritate my skin at all.I would highly recommend for anyone wanting a gentle moisturizer that soothes the skin and leaves it glowing! Absolutely love!
