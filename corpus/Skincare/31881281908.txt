This moisturizer absorbs quickly. It doesn’t leave your face feeling greasy and my skin doesn’t get as oily in my t-zone throughout the day. I feel like a little bit more sun protection could have been put into it. But adding another moisturizer with better SPF definitely wouldn’t hurt if you absolutely need it. It layers very well with other serums and works great underneath makeup. Definitely glad I was able to try this product. I would definitely purchase on my own. Great Moisturizer!
