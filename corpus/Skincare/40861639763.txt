I’m a week in to using this product and already obsessed! The dewy freshness I wake up with after my nightly application is fantastic. As someone who struggles with dullness and dark circles this was truly a treat to get. Even with several nights of little sleep my dark circles have become less pronounced, and I’ve had absolutely no issues with puffiness. I’ve also had trouble with milia from creams so I was a bit scared to try a new one, but I don’t see that being a problem with this! The gel cream texture isnt heavy at all, so apply without fear. Anyone with the same issues who struggles with the texture of thick eye creams must give this a try! A wonderful addition to my routine!
