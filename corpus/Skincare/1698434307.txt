This left a thick waxy residue on my skin and did not fully remove my makeup. There was still makeup on my towel after double cleansing with this and another cleanser. I was hoping it would be a dupe for the Farmacy Green Clean product but it was a HUGE disappointment. It also made me break out. donâ€™t do it!
