I was disappointed. The water feels oily, don’t recommend if you have combination skin or if you’re in a humid environment. I had to wipe my hands after applying because it leaves a “film” like feeling or texture on your hands and face. Leaves your face shiny even after it dries. Not in a dewey cute way, more like greasy.Don’t like the scent, and you will smell it all day. It’s a little overwhelming. Not a fan
