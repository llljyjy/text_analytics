After using this more or less regularly over a few weeks, my acne has gone down a bit. However, I don’t know if I can attribute too much to this serum, since I feel like I’ve just been washing my face more and that’s the main impact. It can feel a bit oily but once it absorbs, it’s not too bad. Overall, I’m sure it does good for my skin, but not as amazingly as I would hope. Not the worst, but not the best
