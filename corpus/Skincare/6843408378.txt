I was so stoked I got the review this before it launched. I’ve been using it for a bit and I’ve noticed my undereyes are super hydrated and refreshed. I love having this in my skincare lineup morning and night. I’ve noticed less dark circles too, which is great because this mama needs all the help she can get. Ceramighty eyes!
