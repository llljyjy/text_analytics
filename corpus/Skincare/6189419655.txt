I can’t recommend this product enough, it’s sooo good. It left me with a natural looking tan that was more pigmented than I expected. The smell is enjoyable and not overpowering like most fake tanning products. I had multiple people ask me if I had been out in the sun for a while because my tan looked so nice!! AMAZING!!!!
