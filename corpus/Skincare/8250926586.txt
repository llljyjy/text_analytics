Recently, I have been enjoying using the new Ole Henriksen Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer. I can truly appreciate how intensely moisturizing the formula is because it doesn’t clog my combo-oily/ somewhat acne- prone skin. On application, the thick balm formula warms up and turns into a gel-like consistency. There is a light citrus scent that isn’t overwhelming and the recyclable glass jar has a nice weight to it. My skin definitely looks and feels more refreshed but the best part is that it makes my skin feel pillowy soft. The formula is stellar thanks to the inclusion of multiple peptides, amino acids and ceramides, allowing for lots of long-lasting hydration. Overall, Ole Henriksen Strength Train Peptide Boost Moisturizer is a 10/10 for me. Intensely Moisturizing
