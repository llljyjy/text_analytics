Upon opening the jar you are greated with a mild but lovely scent of roses.The texture of the cream is smooth and silky. It went on smooth with no greasy feeling.Absorbed into my skin nicely.After using the cream for 7 days, my skin was softer, smoother, and brighter.Loved the effect loved the cream.Would definitely recommend. Would definitely buy. Rose's revive
