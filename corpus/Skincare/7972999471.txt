I live in the drier prairies. I have eczema on my face, whiteheads, and cystic acne as well as some visible pores. When I used this it didn’t help at first and it seemed to make things worse until I bought a good humidifier. Hyaluronic acid can dehydrate your already dry skin if there isn’t enough water in the air around you, so I started only applying this at night and running my humidifier beside my bed and oh my gosh the difference after one week was amazing and I’m always keeping with this routine. don’t use in dry climates
