For fresher acne marks the clearing solution helps to fade them faster and prevents darker marks from forming. But for dark spots that have been there on my face or body longer it was harder to get rid of even with using this solution. The marks lighten out over time but it didnâ€™t fade the spots completely. The solution was also sensitive on some parts of my face but on my body it was fine. I also felt a creme like solution would be easier to apply. Ok product but not perfect
