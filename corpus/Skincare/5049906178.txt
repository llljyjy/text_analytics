I have combo skin with hormonal acne flares and large pores. The bad: I have used this toner in the morning for the past 2-3 weeks and have seen no change in the appearance of my pores. My acne this week is the worst itâ€™s been in years, so perhaps this product does not work well with my skin or with the other products I use (I apply trentinoin at night). The good: love the glass bottle and the refreshing light feel of this toner. I wanted to try a clean ingredient option and this fit the bill. I just wish it provided results! Will not be a repurchase, and I may give up trying if my acne continues to worsen. No change in pore size
