I have a chronic illness that occasionally causes mobility issues. This cleanser has been a godsend on those days, in that I can just leave it in my bedside table and I won’t have to get up and go to the sink - I can do it all from my bed, and just wipe off with a dry washcloth. I will forever keep one of these in my nightstand. I just wanted to add this for anyone else who might have mobility issues! I also have dry skin, but this doesn’t leave my skin feeling stripped at all. Convenience + Utility
