I really tried to love this product, but it didn’t work for me. I loved the packaging, the texture, smell, but after using it every day I really didn’t notice a difference. I used it at nights and made sure it doesn’t react with my other skincare product. My skin is not sensitive, but it stained my skin under my lips. I’ve never had a reaction like that with other vitamin C products. Not for me
