I received some free samples to try this product from Butterly and I was surprised by the hydration. I like how it’s a double formula that mixes together. You really don’t need a lot and it doesn’t dry so fast that you don’t have time to apply it. Although it’s an oil, I find it doesn’t leave a greasy feel at all. The hydration is a quick effect, but I’d be curious about the long term advantages Love the hydration!
