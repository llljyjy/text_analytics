Honestly I thought this was a regular body lotion until I read the directions. I wish they Would’ve named this a little differently because it is a little confusing to me. The first thing is noticed was it was very watery, which was odd. Secondly, the fragrance. The fragrance smells like someone’s grandma and I am not a fan lol. I probably wouldn’t buy this for the price. I do feel like a little goes a long way and it absorbs well. Just not for me. Just okay
