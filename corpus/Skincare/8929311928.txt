I have been using this moisturizer ever since I had cystic hormonal acne few years back. I have not really found anything similar to this, and let me just say that it’s one of the best moisturizer I have ever used. You get a instant glow, and my skin doesn’t feel sticky or dewy. It absorbs so well into your skin. I like to wash my face with cold water after cleansing and apply Kiel’s ultra facial oil-free gel cream. Try it out! You won’t be disappointed. A MUST HAVE MOISTURIZER!!!
