After using Retinol Fast-Release Wrinkle Reducing Night Serum for about a week I definitely noticed a difference in my fine lines.  You wash your face and apply product to clean, dry face.  The product has no scent and a very thin close to watery consistency. A little bit goes a long way when applying. The directions to activate the serum are simple to follow. nan
