This creamy moisturizer is a great product that has been incredibly soothing and helpful for me and my dry, sensitive skin. I haven’t seen this much improvement in my skin with any other products before. I’m just SO glad that this ONE moisturizer has been able to replace multiple products. The moisturizer is a bit of a thicker consistency but it dries down almost immediately. I have used it under makeup and at night with fantastic experiences both times. This is one product that I highly recommend. I know it’s great for people who have dry or sensitive skin. You will be amazed by the results. 5/5, IT Cosmetics you have done it again! Amazing product
