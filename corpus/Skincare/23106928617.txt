At first I was disappointed because they updated it (previously was unscented white serum in a red bottle). However I’ve been using it for the past few months (just finished the bottle) and I’m not mad at it. My main complaint is the perfumed scent. It reminds me of one of the Escada perfumes- not something I want to put on my face. Other than that, it’s been good for my face. It’s seems to help with acne and moisture. I found it works best with the essence - otherwise it’s a little too light. I will be buying another bottle today, I just wish they did something about the scent. Beware it smells like Escada perfume
