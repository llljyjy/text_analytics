I love everything about this product except I find that the only thing that sits well on top of it is the dew drops. I’m a regular makeup wearer with dry skin (due to tretinoin applied at night), and would love GR to release a product that works as a dedicated makeup primer or possibly even a glowy cc cream for us makeup users. I know this would delve into the makeup arena, but come on, we’re all secretly hoping for some naturally derived, glowy, color corrected skin with sun protection (am I right y’all?)! GR Sunscreen is almost perfect!
