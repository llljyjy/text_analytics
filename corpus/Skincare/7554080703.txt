Please bring back the other nourishing moisturizer formula (3 Oils). This one does not feel quality and definitely does not moisturize my skin. I had to buy the gift set where a tiny sample of it comes with my preferred AMA face wash that I also like better than the PBT face wash. This must work for a different skin type, but it’s not a replacement for the one that was the “nourishing moisturizer” before. not the same quality
