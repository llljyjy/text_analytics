I received a free sample of this Mount Lai Calming Herbal Repair Serum Concentrate Balm from PINCHme in exchange for my honest review. I really like this balm and how it feels on my skin. And I really feel like it works. But I’m not a fan of how it smells. I wanted to love this product, but I can’t get past how it smells. It’s just too strong and overwhelming for me. A fragrance free option would be great. Strong scent
