I was very happy to try the Caudalie Premier Cru Anti-Aging Serum from #trywithtopbox #freeproduct. I had heard of and seen Caudalie, but had never really tried it before. I was immediately impressed with the lightweight serum. It absorbed really quickly into my skin. I only needed 3-4 drops to cover my whole face. I used it morning, night, and whenever my skin seemed dry. It immediately soothed my skin, softened my skin and seemed to hide my fine lines. It has a light rose fragrance that is short-lasting so it doesnâ€™t interfere with other perfumes. I love that it is in a darkened glass bottle as this will prevent oxidation. I definitely recommend this glorious Premier Cru Anti-Aging Serum and plan to be a dedicated customer. Lightweight, fast absorbing wonder serum
