I love the product, hate the packaging.  When you can get some on your face, the result is nice but the spray is so poor and weak that that mist of hydration effect I get from other spays isn’t there.  I wouldn’t repurchase because the result isn’t want I wanted and for the price, it isn’t worth it. I really wanted to love it, but I can’t with how the bottle sprays. Could be better
