I was gifted this #freeproduct to try out and review, and honestly, the timing couldn’t have been better! For years I had been shying away from using toners due to my past experience of using alcohol-based toners that completely dried out my skin. Only recently had I learned that those types of toners are a thing of the past and now most of them are really hydrating andare packed with otheramazingskin ingredients! I’ve been using this essence day and night for the past few days and only need one pump each time. The instructions say to use 3 pumps in the morning and 5 at night but trust me, that is way too much. Even one pump is too much and I end up just bringing the product down onto my neck too. The smell is super light and barely noticeable, which I like for my dry and sensitive skin. So far it has been really adding an extra layer of hydration to my skin and I love that it’s also infused with Vit C! The Vit C in this essence is in the form “EAE“, which is a more potent and stable derivative of Vit C! I love this stuff and will absolutely be using it every day!#tryitwithtopbox Gentle and hydrating essence infused with Vit C!
