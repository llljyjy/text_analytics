I moved from Southern California to the Midwest (insane, I know). It’s super cold out here and I noticed my skin was a little dryer than usual so I decided to switch up my moisturizer and give this a try. It’s amazing! I have oily skin though and wouldn’t wear this if I’m wearing makeup. This is my go to for my no makeup days and OMG I love no makeup days now and have no makeup days more often.
