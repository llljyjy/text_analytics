I get it… it’s pricey… but… I have used many many eye creams and every single time there is always one box that isn’t checked. Either it migrates into my eyes, doesn’t moisturize long enough, stings the skin, or just doesn’t do what it claims. High end to low end, I’ve never truly been in love. Well this winter, I’ve developed a super dry and flaky right eyelid, and nothing has soothed it or helped it heal. An artist at MAC recommended this eye cream and the Sephora advisor did as well. So I bypassed the price tag and took a chance. I am SO glad I did. Not only is my dry flaky eyelid almost healed after one night, but it feels great going on, it brightens and smooths my eye area, and I look way more refreshed and awake after application. 10/10. Worth it, does what it says, and is very healing. Thank you thank you thank you. Um…. Wow!
