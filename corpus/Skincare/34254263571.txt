I had never used a Vitamin C serum before but jumped at the opportunity to try First Aid Beauty’s new option since they are known for sensitive skin-friendly formulas. I’ve been putting this serum on in the morning every day for 1 week thus far. I’ve had no irritation, found this formula to be very gentle and there is no noticeable scent. It is a thin liquid consistency and absorbs quickly into my skin, is not sticky, and it has been layering just fine under my moisturizer and foundation. I think my skin has been looking more glowy than usual so I am going to keep using it. Gentle, feels very nice
