when talking about shiseido, the first thing that comes to my mind is a product of extreme quality, and it couldnâ€™t help but be the new formula shiseido urban environment, this sunscreen can be used with or without makeup, contains hyaluronic acid, moisturizes a lot, if your skin is not dry, it can be sticky and slightly uncomfortable, for people with oily to combination skin I would recommend the oil free version, it has a very mild sunscreen smell, nothing that is not bearable. nan
