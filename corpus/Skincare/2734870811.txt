This was a nice lotion that felt very high-quality. I have never used or heard of a liquid lotion before so initially thought I hadn’t shaken the bottle enough - I think it would help to explicitly call it a liquid lotion on the bottle, as it does on the website. It felt very nice on my skin and I had no issues using it. The smell is just okay - I don’t hate it, but definitely not my favorite. Overall this is a really nice product! Nice liquid lotion!
