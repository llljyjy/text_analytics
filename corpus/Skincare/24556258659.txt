I received this in the sun safety kit, and I am obsessed! It initially has a classic sunscreen smell, but the scent doesn’t linger for too long. No white cast for me, no eye stinging, and very moisturizing! I have acne prone skin, and while I’ve only been using this for a couple of days, I think this is a great choice for people who are acne prone. I know some people tend to think that sunscreen breaks them out, but if you are wearing spf daily (which you should be), then you should also be double cleansing your face nightly… it makes such a difference!! love!!
