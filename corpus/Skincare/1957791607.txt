I’ve been such a fan of the Fresh Nectar face serum for years and was so excited to try this one! I found this one to be great at repairing my skin’s barrier and it also provided a subtle glow under moisturizer in the morning. I would definitely recommend and think it could be incorporated morning or night. nan
