I have used many eye creams over the years. This eye cream is very nice. My eye area is smooth, hydrated and glowing. I have it 3 stars because I really do not like the packaging. Too many times the corners catch under my nails when unscrewing the lid and it hurts. There is probably a reason most eye creams come in a round package. I really like the product but really do not care for the packaging. Really nice eye cream, not good packaging
