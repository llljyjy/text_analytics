I wasn’t a fan of the thick gel texture for a hyaluronic serum. It is lightweight, but the consistency makes it hard to judge how much you need for your face. Too much can be a problem if you’re in a dry atmosphere. The feel of this product - I like that after a few min it dried to feel like nothing, but my skin itself did not feel hydrated when I touched it, and caused little bumps to appear around my eyes. When I added the Laniege Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic  Cream Moisturizer, my skin began to tingle and itch.  I was surprised at the packaging of this - it looks interesting and unique, but is kind of useless and awkward. You can’t see how much you have left, and the pump feels like you need to angle or turn the product or have it spill.There are no suggested directions of use on the package, so I tried to look to the Laniege website to see how many pumps they suggest for the face. It also isn’t clear which stage of skincare to add it in since it’s a gel.Although I received this #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox I would not buy it again, nor recommend it. Not impressed
