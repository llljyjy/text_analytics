pros: no white cast on me or my roommate (she’s about a fenty 485), easy to apply, cute packagingsubjective: pricey for amount of product (should be at least 2oz in my opinion), smells like old school sunscreen (seems like there’s very little fragrance which could be great for some, but i could’ve done with a hair more) cons: stings the eyes after a few hours, a bit thick feeling Almost great
