I received this eye cream for review from influenster. I grew up with Clinique products and have been overall fan my entire makeup and skincare routine life. I am very happy to try this eye cream as I am always looking for the new best thing now that I am in my 40s. So far I’m very pleased with this. The formula is very thick and I like that, it makes me feel like it will absorb into the skin with less used. I don’t notice any huge results yet but I still have more than half of the small bottle to go. I think that the price point is on market with other creams. Ohh, she's thick
