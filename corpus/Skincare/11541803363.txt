I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff.  As someone in their mid 30â€™s I am super self conscious of the acne and blemishes I get.   When I found this brand it was a game changer.  Within a few days I noticed my blemishes were clearing up and my skin felt clean and refreshed, not dry and oily.  I think I have weird skin - I am super sensitive to nearly everything.  My forehead and cheeks are not oily, but my chin jaw mouth area gets super oily and that is where my breakouts are.  I have tried NUMEROUS expensive name brand things, the dermatologist stuff like Spectro, etc., the Grocery store stuff (Clearasil/Oxy Neutrogena Nivea etc.) but this brand is the bee knees for me.It works great! plus its affordable.  My whole skin care line with this brand is $40 (The cleanser here, Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Serum, the Succinic Acid treatment, and the Omega Water cream moisturizer) It works, and is affordable.
