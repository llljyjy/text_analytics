This is the only mattifying moisturizer that truly leaves my skin matte all day without leaving salt/residue on my face or drying out my skin to the point of leaving patches (hot description, I know lol). Another plus is that you can’t feel this lotion on your skin once it dries, which only takes about 30 seconds. This is truly the best option for people who are trying to manage their oily skin and, as a bonus, I noticed I stopped waking up with new acne spots after I added it to my night routine.My skin feels so soft, well moisturized, and cushiony to the touch after applying. This moisturizer layers perfectly with both sunscreen and makeup too, and it cuts out the need for a primer for my foundation/cc cream/concealer folk!It does have a mild scent when you’re putting it on similar to a sweet jasmine mixed with white tea, which I imagine is the willowherb. The scent fades within 10 minutes and hasn’t caused any issues for me as someone with scent allergies and scent-induced migraines; it actually smells so delicious I wish I could wear it as a long lasting perfume! This moisturizer is a 10/10 The perfect matte moisturizer for combo skin
