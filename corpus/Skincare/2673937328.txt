I love Supergoop products so I was very excited to try their serum. I’m honestly not sure if I’ve noticed a change BUT I do feel like my skin is getting better sun protection than with just sunscreen alone. I did not find it greasy like other reviewers mentioned. I will be purchasing again! Supergoop Lover
