If you struggle with puffy eyes in the morning or in general this is a super good affordable option! The texture is nice and silky and it absorbs well but does leave a tiny bit of a sticky residue behind for a little while. I notice a difference pretty quickly when applying it after my morning serums and before my moisturizer. great affordable option
