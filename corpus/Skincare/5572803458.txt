This sunscreen is so smooth when applying. It feels like I’m wearing a lightweight moisturizer and doesn’t require really any blending to get rid of the whitecast because it’s tinted. I have very oily skin, and my skin did not look greasy at the end of the day (huge win!). It feels like a luxury sunscreen. Rating it one star lower because it’s a little pricey. Natural & Dewy
