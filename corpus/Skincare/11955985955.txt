This moisturizer has a very peculiar texture: when you apply it feels very watery and thin on the skin but it absorbs and ends up sitting quite oily and kind of thick on the surface. I was hopeful for this one but it is not for me: I don’t like the very present film of oil that’s left on my already oily forehead. I would say this is for very dry skin types that like a lightweight moisturizer, but it’s weird how my skin gets super dry in the winter and drinks up thick creams like the FAB repair cream without breaking out and this one just doesn’t work for me. Interesting application, but left an oily film
