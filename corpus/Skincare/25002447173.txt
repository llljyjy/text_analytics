This is a great product for someone looking to introduce retinol into their skin care routine. There are a lot of soothing ingredients like Ceramides and marula oil so it’s very gentle. I have extremely sensitive and reactive skin, this didn’t bother me one bit! I’ve been using it for a few weeks now at night and find that it helps keep my moisturizer locked in while I sleep at night, this dry winter weather is harsh! My only complaint is that it kind of smells like vegetable oil...like the kind you cook with. I would recommend other face oils over this one. Ok face oil, smells weird
