i had never tried anything from Tula before but was sent this toner from influenster. i’m a huge fan of the glycolic acid from The Ordinary and used this in direct comparison. all in all, i like it! it seems to work just as effectively as the toner i currently use. i did remove a star because the only way i’m able to use the pump is by turning this upside down ? i think maybe my pump was defective but considering the price difference between this Tula product vs The Ordinary toner, that’s pretty annoying. all in all i liked it and i felt it was effective with reducing the size of blemishes as well as reduce texture. if you love Tula and need a toner then i’d say it’s a great option! if you already have a glycolic acid that works for you though, i don’t think this is worth replacing. effective but my pump was broken
