I received this sample of Dior Cica Balm for my honest review. I first tried it on my hands. It absorbs very quickly. I have very dry skin and this was very soothing with no irritation. I then tried this on my face. I had no sensitivity. I do have small lines in my face and i felt this balm smoothed them and reduced their appearance. I am impressed with this balm and i do see myself adding this to my skincare regimen. I like the fact that this is an animal cruelty-free product and there is also no harsh scent. I would recommend this product. In the photo  I applied the balm to the left side of my hand.  I clearly see a difference. Smooths fine lines and absorbs quickly.
