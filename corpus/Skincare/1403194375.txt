Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream has a light, whipped consistency and very little scent. It has made the skin around my eyes softer and stronger because I don’t get those tiny little tears at the corners of my eye this winter since I’ve been using it! I haven’t noticed much difference in the bags under my eyes but my fine lines are softer with only six weeks of daily or twice daily use. My favorite part is that my makeup goes on more smoothly around my eyes. Although I probably will buy it again, I’ll likely try “All About Eyes“ by Clinique first as it is supposed to do more for bags and is less expensive. I’ll be sure to let you know which one I prefer! Smooth and creamy
