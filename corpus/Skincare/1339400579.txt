This seriously cleans out your pores and works better than any other clay mask I’ve ever used thanks to the salicylic acid. I’ve tried other salicylic acid masks but none were as strong as this. My face looked so much more even toned and clearer after using this once. I will now start using this twice a week forever, it’s a new holy grail for me. cleans up pores
