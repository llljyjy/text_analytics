I love the double exfoliant aspect of this awesome product! It performs both physical and chemical exfoliation that is very gentle on my sensitive skin! I notice that my face looks brighter, smoother and feels softer each time I use it!It contains skin-loving  lactic and glycolic acids! It has a nice scent that isn’t overpowering. I like the different sizes of the professional-grade crystals, as they perform uniformly and very effectively. I even notice some of my fine lines looking less pronounced. This product is great for all skin types, even sensitive skin like mine. It’s also vegan and free of sulfates, parabens or cruelty.Overall, I love the formula and ingredients in this exfoliator! It’s great how effortlessly it polishes away dead skin, revealing a more radiant complexion! I like how it renews dull skin and works on evening out skin texture. It hydrates my skin very nicely. My face always feels soothed after I use this exfoliator. It’s really beneficial and the results are amazing! I highly recommend it! Fantastic multitasker!
