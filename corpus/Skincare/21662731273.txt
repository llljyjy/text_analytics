2 stars because when first applied, it looks great. The smell is very rosy but in a subtle way that I like. However it pills so badly, I literally wipe the pilled product off my entire face, and it defeats the purpose of applying the moisturizer. I wish it didnâ€™t pill otherwise it would be my favorite. Pills so badly. Great smell though
