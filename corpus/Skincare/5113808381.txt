My stars aren’t for the product. It’s good, though you’re likely using nowhere near enough for sun coverage. If you’re using a pea size or even a finger strip, that’s primer, not sunscreen. My two stars are because Trader Joe’s Daily Facial Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF40 has MORE sunscreen and the exact same inert ingredients—save one—in the exact same order. They’re producing it, selling at $9.00, and making a profit. That means that at $36 for this sunscreen we are all absolutely being had by this brand (and so many others). I’m over it. I’m over these brands making a killing off us trying to protect our skin from literal cancer. This isn’t some unique, highly inventive formulation that warrants anything near this price. There is now an exact copy for nearly every single Supergoop sunscreen for a fraction of the price and still we’re given a tag of nearly $40 for most. Forty. No. I’m done. You should be done too. Trader Joe’s has a dupe for $9.
