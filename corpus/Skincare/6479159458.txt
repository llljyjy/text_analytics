I reviewed this product on my hand in my leg because I am not somebody who prefers an oily product on my face. This product is very light and refreshing in smell. The packaging is very cute and sleek. A little goes a long way with this product. It feels very nice and moisturizing on my skin made my hand in knee incredibly soft. Donâ€™t forget to wearSPF when using a vitamin C product! nan
