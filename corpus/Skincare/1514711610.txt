I’m 51 and began seeing fine lines under and on the sides of my eyes. I sleep on my side and noticed I developed a deep line under my left eye from my face being smashed on my pillow when I sleep. After about a week of using Kiehl’s Super Multi-Corrective Anti-Aging Eye Cream twice a day, I noticed it really made a difference in my fine lines. I would say the lines under and around my eyes decreased about 80-90%, even the deep line caused by sleeping on my side and the lines between my eyes. I did see a small improvement in the dark circles under my eyes. There wasn’t a huge improvement in that area but it did help somewhat. To be fair, I have always had dark circles and nothing has really helped improve them.  Also, I noted the skin under my eyes was firmer and extremely moisturized. The inner corner of my eyes tend to be dry but this eye treatment corrected that. I do have hooded eyes and have noticed drooping as I get older. I put the cream on my brow and 1/2 way down my eyelid and I was very impressed with the result. It really made a huge improvement. The skin on my eyelids became firmer and didnt droop as much. It kinda looked like I had plastic surgery on my eyelids. I was VERY happy with that. It is supposed to be fragrance free but I did notice a slight fragrance. It just had a very faint clean smell. Overall, I think this product is amazing and I will continue to use it forever! Seriously, you gotta try it. Works wonders. It really works!
