This is by far my favorite product from Kosas! I have very dry skin and lips. When they say a true hydration, they were not lying! It leaves my lips so hydrated and it feels like my lips are getting a drink of water when I apply it! It smells like orange Julius which makes me thirsty! Because it does have concentrated fatty acids etc, it almost breaks down your lip product if you apply it on top of lipsticks etc. so itâ€™s definitely meant to apply on your bare lips. I would recommend applying this at night for a night treatment and before you apply any other lip product. This is my go to when I have really bad lip days, before a big event. The packaging is also adorable. The color gradient they chose for this product was perfect because of the flavor they chose for it as well. Beautiful product, a must have in your kit! nan
