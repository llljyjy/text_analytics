I recently began using the Skin Perfecting Treatment BHA 9 by Paula’s Choice. I have small pimples pop up recently from wearing a mask and I wanted to try this formula to target my nose, cheek, and chin area. The formula is very lightweight and absorbs quickly. I was a little nervous using a high BHA percentage, but it contains soothing ingredients also and my skin had no irritation. My skin looks and feels smoother. I think some of my pores are less obvious as well. I haven’t really had pimples pop up recently and I think it’s due to this product keeping them at bay. nan
