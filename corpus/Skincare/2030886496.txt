The first time I bought it I would have given it 5 stars.Dig in, apply to dry face,  rinse off. It was amazing at removing all my makeup without a mess.I ordered it again after having to wait for it to come back in stock. I believe the product has been watered down, as it is now quite sloppy to apply/use. The entire consistency is just... runnier than the last one was.  A lot runnier.Iâ€™m not buying it again. 50/50 Shot. I'll Recommend Due to Price
