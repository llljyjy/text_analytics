This cream smells ah-mazing, it is sooo creamy and light. My face has never felt softer and I’ve only been using it for 2 weeks! I can’t wait to see how my face feels and looks after a month. A little dab goes a long way. I will be buying more of this cream for sure. Thank you BuzzAgent for allowing me to try this cream for free. It’s nice to be able to do this, that way I know if I like it or not without spending money. There’s nothing worse than spending money and finding out the product smells bad or didn’t work for you. I’m actually going to buy one for my mom when they come back in stock. I love it that much. Best face cream I’ve ever tried!
