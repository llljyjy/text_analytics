This is my trusted sunscreen for beach and pool time. Shiseido’s heat and water technology is the real deal. You won’t find the level of protection in any other sunscreen. You may say same spf level blah blah but I can assure you Shiseido’s sunscreen is at a different level. It leads the sunscreen industry innovation by a decade and is well known in Asia for its strength in research. Its sunscreen lines cover all needs. This one is heavy duty - you may find it greasy when applied but it’s designed to be so, once you get under that tropical sunshine and pool/ocean water, the sunscreen will transform into a thin film covering the skin and it doesn’t come off even if you try. It pairs perfectly with the stick version of the same line to reapply throughout the day. I am super conscious of uv damage and this sunscreen plus the stick version are the only things that would get me in the water or on the beach. If you are looking for something for daily use, try the white bottle urban environment line instead. Heavy Duty Golden Standard
