This moisturizer is impressive! I have mixed oily skin in the T zone, and I always try to look for products that won’t look greasy on me. Alpyn Beauty is finally the one. I love the silky, creamy formula that makes my skin looks healthy with a matte and velvety look. I’m very sensitive to scent, and this moisturizer has a very gentle one that didn’t bother me at all. It absorbs very quickly on the skin for its dense texture. I only apply approximately 4 drops on my face, and it covered everything which will make it last for months! I’m very happy with this product and I recommend it 100%. Perfect for oily skin!
