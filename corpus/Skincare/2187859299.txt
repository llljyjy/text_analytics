I was looking for a moisturizer that would help my skin recover from wearing lots of heavy waterproof SPF products and sun exposure, since it’s been a little dry and irritated. Frustratingly, despite explaining to the sales associate in the skincare section that I have milia and need to avoid heavy creams and silicone derived ingredients, she swore this would be helpful for me. I asked if the vitamin C in this product would be irritating, she swore it would not be. She was wrong. The vitamin C in this is quite harsh, making my face feel a little burned and irritated, about as much as before or more. This moisturizer should not be touted as some amazing “clean“ product when dimethicone is so high in the ingredients list and the vitamin C needs reformulation if it’s going to act like this on skin contact, it’s far too irritating. This product is all marketing and not actually helpful. Irritating and Frustrating to use
