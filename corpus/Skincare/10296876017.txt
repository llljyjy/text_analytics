I received this free product to try from Influenster. I am very excited to try this moisturizer because I have a few dark spots and uneven skin tone, and the fact that it has Vitamin C is a bonus. I love the scent it smells citrusy like an orange and the consistency is so light. It is also moisturizing and not sticky on the face which I like. Such an addition to my anti aging skin regimen. Definitely recommended. A must have!
