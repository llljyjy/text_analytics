The Ilia C Beyon Triple Serum SPF 40 Mineral Sunscreen with Vitamin C 10% and Niacinamide is a great product great quality, very durable. It is very smooth on my face the shade is a nice shade for my face and as well as non greasy. It hydrates my face well and I love the light medium shade on my face. The serum absorbs quite well and very lightweight non sticky, but leaves a nice glow. As I do not think I will get more of this product in the future. I do recommend it for others Lovely
