I’m always hesitant to try new sunscreens for my face because of my deeper complexion they tend to leave a white cast. But this one doesn’t! When its dispensed it is white but it just blends in kind of like a moisturizer. I’ve used the belif line before and am a big fan. Most likely will buy the full size. LOVE
