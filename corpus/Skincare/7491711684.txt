For me, this is a multipurpose spray. I use this to evenly dampen my face after I wash n before serums. I use this to set my makeup especially after any powdery makeup. I also use it randomly when my face feels dry or cakey or when makeup separates. Helps bring everything back to a natural dewy finish. Iâ€™ve repurchased this about 5 times. The cost is a turn off but every time I run out, my skin misses it. I spend $20 on crap almost daily. This is def not crap! refreshes dry skin
