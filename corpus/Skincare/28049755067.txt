I loved getting to try Caudalie Premier Cru Anti Aging Cream Moisturizer. I’ve been using it for a few weeks, mostly as a day cream over my serum since I have another night cream I really enjoy (but I’ve used it some at night and works well then too). As someone with sensitive and dry skin, I really love that this is a clean product. It doesn’t cause any redness for me like many products out there and instead keeps my skin looking even and feeling soft, smooth, and hydrated. It says it’s unscented, but it does have a very light smell to me, though it thankfully doesn’t bother my skin and I find it refreshing. The formula isn’t too thick or thin; it spreads well, meaning a little can go a long way, while still feeling substantial enough to make me feel like it’s actually doing something. I can’t speak of any major anti-aging results personally, but overall, I’ve been happy with this product. It keeps my skin looking nice and refreshed whether it’s a makeup or no makeup day. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox nan
