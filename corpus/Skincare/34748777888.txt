I’ve been using this for about six weeks, and I can definitely see results. The texture of my skin looks and feels softer and smoother, and my pores are smaller. I’ve also noticed that the tone of my skin is more even and I have less redness. I experienced a little bit of dryness in the first week or so of using it, so I used a more hydrating moisturizer at night. I will definitely repurchase this when I run out. Effective Serum
