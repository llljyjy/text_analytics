Works like a dream! For the past few months, my normally oily skin has been so dry and flakey. It was painfully dry and nothing I tried would relieve the dryness. Not even slugging helped! I picked this up on a whim while perusing the mini items by the checkout line and decided to give it a try. It worked a miracle. What has been a 4 month long journey to find anything to relieve my dry skin, was fixed after 2-3 uses of this mask. I put it on last in my night time routine and it feels so rich and hydrating. I cannot say anything bad about this item. A little goes a long way so even the mini size is really going to last a while. I will definitely be keeping this in my nighttime skin routine. This is the first product Iâ€™ve tried from this brand and I am impressed. Will definitely be checking out other stuff from them. Saved my painfully dry, flakey skin!
