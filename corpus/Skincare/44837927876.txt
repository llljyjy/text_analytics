After using this Dior serum I noticed a lot of changes. For 1 my skin had bumps that kept coming back but so far they haven’t came back. I had dark bumps after popping my bumps and so far they look lighter. My skin feels soft and clean and the smell is like no other! I used this serum and this serum alone, no moisturizer or anything just serum and I see results like crazy! The price is worth it because I’m starting to see a glass skin effect. Must have for bumps that keep coming back!!
