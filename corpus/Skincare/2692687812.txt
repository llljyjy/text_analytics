theyâ€™re selling you on the claims that it has mostly natural origin as well as fancy packaging, but you could find an eye serum/cream with the same key ingredients for a lot less. additionally, why is there added fragrance to an eye cream when this is meant to go on the most sensitive area of the face?? overpriced for what it is
