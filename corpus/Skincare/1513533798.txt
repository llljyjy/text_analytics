I didn’t look at review pictures before purchasing so I was happily surprised when I received it, it is big! I can see why they describe it as face and body. It’s large surface and the four different angles make it for a very nice experience. It also has a nice weight so it’s not flimsy or fragile, love the black color. Happily Surprised!
