I’m always scared to try moisturizers because my skin is SO sensitive and I end up hating most of them because they feel heavy on my skin and it freaks me out. But this one is… like magic lol. I got the mini size in a Sephora box and I’ve been using it nonstop for a month now. It’s gentle, haven’t had a single irritation issue, has truly moisturized my perpetually dry skin and left it feeling more hydrated, and melts into my skin super quickly. It’s a heavier cream but it fades to feeling like your skin so fast. I’ll definitely be repurchasing and it’s inspired me to try more YTP items! My new favorite nighttime moisturizer
