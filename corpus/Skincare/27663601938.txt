My favorite clay mask: the color is a really pleasant gray-blue, and you don’t need to apply a lot to get all over your face. I will say, I joke about how it is my “mold mask“ because when it dries it looks like bread mold a little, but it works so good that I don’t mind. The ingredients also make me feel good about it. I don’t usually believe in masks, but the Niacinamide and BHA really do their jobs here. Will say, if you have sensitive skin it will leave behind a bit of red stain for a couple minutes but it won’t burn or tingle or anything. Favorite clay mask on the market right now
