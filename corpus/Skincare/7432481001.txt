Y’all…this stuff is SO good! Seriously. It has completely saved me from the cold & harsh winter climate that dries out my lips completely. On top of that, I’m an anxious person who tends to bite their lips a lot and this has helped keep them moisturized and healthy looking! It goes on like butter and doesn’t have an overwhelming scent or taste. I like to use this as an overnight mask or as a balm when I’m doing a natural makeup look or just need an extra bit of hydration throughout the day! So so good. Saved my lips!
