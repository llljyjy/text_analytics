I use this on my face before makeup or without makeup. It’s a really great hydrating mist. Comes out super fine and has a light smell of roses. Nothing overbearing. I really like this stuff. My skin is so smooth after I use it and it makes it really easy to apply my makeup. Better than Mac prep and prime spray. Would recommend to anyone with dry skin that likes a dewy look. I did receive this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, but that doesn’t change my opinion that I will buy it to have it again. nan
