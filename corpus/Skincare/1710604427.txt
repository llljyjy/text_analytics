I got this product free from influenster and after 2 weeks of trying it, I noticebly seen my dark spot go lighter. The formula is so nice and lightweight, absorbs into the skin really well making it feel smooth and supple. The smell is amazing and the fact that you can apply it twice daily is a plus point. However, I do apply sunscreen in the morning after I apply this cream. Cute little product container as well. Worth a try!
