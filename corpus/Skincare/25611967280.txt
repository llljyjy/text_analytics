I have been using this soap for the past 6 days. It smells nice but a little too strong in my opinion. It lathers well and does not diminish quickly like some other bars of soaps I have used. It definitely leaves that squeaky clean feeling! After I shower, my skin is left very dry though. It is good but not life changing - gets the job done but I wouldn’t buy it again. It’s not significantly better than your average bar of soap. It’s a standard bar of soap
