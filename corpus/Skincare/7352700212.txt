When I first opened my bottle of Kiehlâ€™s Midnight Recovery Omega-Rich Cloud Cream I noticed how thick and emollient the texture was and was hesitant it would cause me to break out. But I did not break out! Instead my skin is more hydrated and plumper than usual. I am hoping to see a more even complexion with continued use! Great for hydration!
