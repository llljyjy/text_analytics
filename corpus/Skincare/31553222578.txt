I feel bad for writing this because I was sent this product to try out in exchange for a review but this didn’t feel like a premium skincare item at all. It was thick and didn’t melt or blend well into my skin. I have medium toned skin and you could see a white layer over my whole face that looked questionable at best with makeup on top. I’m not a huge needer of sunscreen because my skin is darker and I’ve never actually experienced a sunburn, but I enjoy the protection from fine lines and that kind of thing. However this one was heavy and smelled so much like sunscreen! It doesn’t seem to add much to my skincare routine, unfortunately Not my fav
