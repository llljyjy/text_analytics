This is the only cleanser I use when removing makeup now! It’s actually really good and the price is great. It leaves a silky finish on my skin after. I like to wet my face before applying which helps the formula expand. Texture wise: it’s a balmy substance that when applied to the skin, creates a foaming like cleanser. It's surprisingly good
