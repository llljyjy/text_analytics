I have sensitive, acne prone skin and this serum caused no issues or reactions for me. I can’t say I noticed any visible difference in skin quality with it alone, and definitely no visible changes to anyone else. My skin felt great with it on, it wasn’t greasy, and I could use it morning and night without issue. The product is beautiful, is easy to use, and for me was great even with sensitive skin. I’m a fan! A+ for my Sensitive Skin!
