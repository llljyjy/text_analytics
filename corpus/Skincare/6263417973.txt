WOW! I used the Isle of Paradise tanning drops for years — but when I went to purchase them they were out of stock. I figured I would give the mousse a try. SO IMPRESSED!!! It gave me fantastic color while using less product. I think this will last MUCH longer than the drops! I used 2 pumps for each of these areas: lower arm, upper arm, stomach, upper back, lower back — 1 pump for my chest area —  3 pumps for upper leg, 2 pumps for lower leg, and a half of a pump on my face. AND THE BEST PART IS IT BARELY SMELLS… the drops were SUPER smelly to me. This is way better. Can’t believe I haven’t tried it before!!! BETTER THAN THE DROPS
