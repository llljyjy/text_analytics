I was so excited to use this cleanser because of the minimal ingredients listed on Sephora. BEWARE! I immediately noticed a scent when I opened the bottle, which struck me as odd. I look at the box and not only does it have fragrant ingredients (not listed on Sephora’s website) but a significantly longer ingredient list. I will probably have to return this without trying it because my skin is hypersensitive to any fragrance, “natural“ or not. This should be updated on Sephora’s website so people know what they’re actually getting before they purchase. I’ll include a photo of the real ingredients for spread awareness. Ingredients Beware
