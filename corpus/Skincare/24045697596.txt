I received this product as part of a free trial program and I’m glad i did! I loved the smell of this soap it wasn’t overpowering at all. I loved the way this product foamed up it also lathered very well. The only reason for me I wouldn’t give it a 5 star is personally it made my skin feel a little dry and stripped after using but is still a great product and I will continue to use and repurchase! nan
