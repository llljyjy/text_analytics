Works well, not a miracle product for dry skin. I’ve had a dry patch of skin on my cheek for over a month, I’ve tried tatcha dewy skin cream as well as the charlotte tilbury magic cream, along with these products now for this past week and nothing seems to get rid of it. Does make the rest of my skin feel pretty soft. Does work wonders for the redness of my skin, definitely has eliminated a lot of it. Love
