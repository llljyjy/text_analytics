I got this for free for my honest review. I tried this with sample when I received and it made my skin turn red and breakout. I had to stop using it. This is the first time a product has done this to my skin. I didn’t mind the fragrance of it, but it was strong. Also, I’m not sure if I got all the product out of the package, as I got a 7 day sample in card form. nan
