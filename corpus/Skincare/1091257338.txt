I received this product complementary in exchange for my honest review. I used this every day for a month. My skin looks maybe a tad brighter than it did when I started. That’s probably due to the Vitamin C. I do like the high SPF and that this sunscreen is tinted, which cancels out any white cast a normal mineral sunscreen would have. I have oily/combo skin and did not experience any irritation or reaction overall. However, after about three weeks of use, my neck suddenly started getting a bunch of weird texture/dry patches. I immediately stopped using this product on my neck, and the dryness went away overnight. Overall, I thought this product was ok, but not the greatest thing I’ve ever used. I would not purchase this with my own money because I feel it is a bit overpriced. Ok, but…
