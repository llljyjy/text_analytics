I’ve used this cleanser for about the last year ever since seeing it hyped up on Tiktok. After trial & error w/ hormonal acne this really is one of the best cleansers if your skin is easily irritated. Other brands like Cerave give me deep pimples with no head for example, but this doesn’t irritate my skin like that. BUT I do not think it’s effective all on its own. I recommend The Inkey List oat cleansing balm first, and then this for everyday if this face wash works for you too. I think this is just a normal, nice, decent face wash that most anyone could use !! I still struggle with acne so personally i will be switching it out of my everyday routine for something that will target my problems better, but i will forever keep it in my routine for when i need a nice gentle cleanse <3 GOOD !!
