I don’t wear makeup very often because I just love to let my skin live and breathe as it is -- this oil is soooo perfect for that. I didn’t expect it to feel as smooth as it did because most face oils from beauty brands have a weird texture that feels almost to thick and greasy or thin and dry. This is an equivalent consistency to the oils I make for myself when I have the ingredients.Love the fact that it adds an added glow and real moisture to my skin. I spent 2 months without my skincare products in a different state; needless to say my skin got so dry and I started breaking out like crazy. It’s been hectic getting it back to how soft, supple, and glowy it  was before then. This oil, from the first day, has helped a ton!Of course, the packaging is gorgeous and MERIT never disappoints to deliver something that’s effective and looks great on the vanity. My only caveat about the pump is that it shoots out the product, the release isn’t slow and smooth. I think offering an option with an eyedropper would make this even better.All in all 10/10 recommend, esp for the girls who love to smother their face in moisturiser because their mothers/sisters/grandmothers taught them well <3 V honest review
