I incorporated this into my daily skincare routine and found it wears really well for me as an every day moisturizer. I’m pleased with the brightness of my skin & how hydrated my skin feels while using this. It doesn’t have much of a fragrance, which is fine with me (although I don’t mind fragrances!). It feels a lot more expensive than it was! A luxurious moisturizer
