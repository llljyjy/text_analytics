I have very ruddy skin, I’m a redhead with rosacea and always looking to tone down the red in my skin. I was hopeful with this product but unfortunately it doesn’t seem to help much at all for the redness in my skin.  It’s a nice moisturizer though and I’ve been using it twice a day every day for that, but as for toning do0wn the ruddiness in my skin I don’t think it’s done anything at all. nan
