I absolutely love this sunscreen it feels lightweight and itworks well under makeup. The texture is smooth so it helps creating a smooth canvas on my face for makeup or for days I am not wearing makeup it still looks good! Does not break me out or cause any irritation. This is such a perfect year around daily spf. Doesnâ€™t leave a white cast which is really important to me!! nan
