Lancôme is a prestige brand, but this is a hefty price tag indeed. I’ve been using this Absolue cream for about 3 weeks now and it’s a lovely formula. It has a slight rose/flowery scent but isn’t overpowering nor long lasting. I’m a bit scent sensitive and it didn’t bother me at all. It feels a bit like a gel, and applies very smoothly. It absorbs fairly quickly and doesn’t leave you greasy, but very moisturized. I’ve used both under my makeup and as part of my nighttime routine. It helps my matte formula foundations stay smooth and actually helps the application process of those foundations stay better. Best part with my sensitive skin is that it doesn’t make me break out. As for long term effect, I can’t say for sure yet, but in 3 weeks I can say it has made a difference with how smooth and moisturized my face is. The packaging is great, gold glass jar with plastic lid and I love that it’s actually refillable. I can’t say for sure if this will be a repurchase yet because the price is offputting but I’ll know for sure when the jar is gone. This jar will last a long time because a little bit goes a loooooong way. Great Moisturizer
