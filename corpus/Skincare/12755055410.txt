i love this moisturizer. i use it only at night during the summer time because it might be a little too rich for daytime use but in the winter I will definitely use am & pm. it absorbs quickly hydrates and evens my skin tone i have acne prone skin and it has never broken me out or burned. it has the best plumping effect in terms of making the skin look firmer and glowy and it works well under makeup, i would highly reccomend. Great Luminous Moisturizer
