I rub this stick in circles around my crows-feet area to warm it up, then swipe it under my eyes and eyelids. I haven’t really noticed a difference with my fine lines yet but I do notice that the texture of my undereye area is a LOT smoother. I used to have tiny bumps close to my inner corner area and I can tell that they’ve gone down a lot. I’ve been using it for about 6 weeks and will keep using it until it’s finished. So far, I’m pleased that it’s created a noticeable difference in my skin texture but I’m not sure how effective it is against fine lines. Noticeable smoothing of my undereye area
