This self tanner and firming lotion is really nice! I was most surprised by the evenness of the developed tan after application. I tried it and my partner, who is a darker skinned Asian American, did as well. The level of tan that developed for me (very pale, palest porcelain) was surprisingly a lot more pronounced than his. As will all self tanners, take care to use lotion on your dry spots (knees, elbows, etc) before application. The smell is nice and a little goes a long way! nan
