Good results and a pleasure to useI am very happy and  impressed with this serum!  It comes in a very elegant bottle so you can see the ingredients and how much is in it, very useful and a real benefit. You only need 2-3 pumps each time and mix it in your hands to appreciate the beautiful perfume-like smell. I found myself looking forward to applying it every day ! Usually use it only in the morning since I have another night skin care routine. It sinks in nicely into your skin and unlike some serums, you can apply moisturiser on top after a short period without it feeling too heavy or greasy on your skin. After a few weeks, some of the lighter lines on my face look lots better and my skin looks smoother overall. It gives your skin a slightly glowing look without making it look greasy. It Smells beautiful and does show visible improvement to skin after a few weeks. I highly recommend it for all skin types! Amazing well balanced serum for deep hydration!
