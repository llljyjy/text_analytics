I received this product for free by Influenster in partnership with Clinique and was asked to provide my honest review upon trial of this product; So here’s just that! The pros: Very moisturizing, luxurious velvet-gel texture, easily applicable and not greasy to touch, light in weight & fragrance; The cons: Can clog pores with oily buildup if naturally prone to oily-skin, sample was too small to form a long-term opinion, leans on the pricy-side for a moisturizer considering there’s a lot of similar options on the market for cheaper. Would I buy this product again? Probably not as solely based on my sample  , I didn’t botice amazing results aside for slightly breaking out, but that’s probably caused by the switch in my skincare routine and would’ve probably cleared up had I had enough product to test on the long-term. Is it good? It moisturized my skin so I can’t say it didn’t get the job done! Received as a free sample courtesy of Influensters
