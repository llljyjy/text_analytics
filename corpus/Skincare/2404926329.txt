So I surprisingly actually really like this soo serum. I got this complimentary to test and to be perfectly honest just based on my own preconception I wasn’t like elated to get this product. Don’t get me wrong, I’m always incredibly grateful for ANY complimentary products and I love trying new things. However, I don’t love Gwyneth Paltrow and didn’t have high hopes for any of these products based on how she recommended people apply sunscreen. That said, I gave it a fair shot as I do all of the products that I’m asked to test. I was really surprised how much I like it. I had been struggling with a bit of a hormonal outbreak a few days before this showed up and had pulled out the big mean benzoyl peroxide products which of course aggravated and dried out my skin like crazy - and didn’t even clear anything up. Last time I’ll do that. My skin was still broken out and now was dry and flaky. Awesome. After the first night of using this the flaky was resolved. Within the first 2 days my skin was pretty well cleared up (blackheads included). I have continued to use it almost every night since I started and I’m just really pleased with how happy my skin is. I will say it doesn’t smell great - it’s definitely smells like chemicals - but that’s what it is. I would rather have a product that smells chemically than one masked by perfumes which aren’t good for your skin. I didn’t know, prior to coming here to review, what the price tag was... Wow. It’s a terrific product and I probably will purchase it when I run out of what I have but it’s overpriced for sure. Really great product overall
