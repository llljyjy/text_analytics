I am really enjoying the texture of this product and the consistency. I feel that the cleanser does not strip my skin after rinsing. I use the oat meal cleaning balm then I go in with the lovely cleanser. I am so happy with this purchase. I have a whole inkey skin routine and I love them all. 30 y.o skin care routine hack
