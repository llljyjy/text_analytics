I was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling this 7 day sample of the Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant in exchange for my honest review. I have used another product similar to this before and loved it! This product does make my face feel nice and soft afterwards. This product does have salicylic acid, which is great for those of us who are oily/combo or acne prone. Little bit on the pricier side, but definitely worth it if you can splurge. Awesome daily exfoliant!
