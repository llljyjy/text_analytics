I’ve been applying this daily (morning and night) upon receiving the product. The texture is pretty much perfect for year-round use - it’s not too light, not too heavy, and your face doesn’t feel sticky after application. I do wish more moisturizers incorporated SPF, so you don’t have to apply another product on top of this, but I can’t complain. I received this product for free from Influenster and Dr. Barbara Sturm in exchange for my honest review. nan
