I almost prefer this consistency compared to the ilia skin tint - it’s more sheer and glowy, but still dries very well on the skin and I can feel it sinking into my face. For those struggling with pilling, keep in mind that the c beyond serum is an oil-based formula. All if my moisturizers are water-based, and when I applied the serum directly on top of my moisturizer, I definitely did experience some pilling as a result. Oil & water don’t mix!To combat this I started adding a *little* bit of my nighttime face oil (from honest beauty) on top of my moisturizer before then applying the ilia serum. This worked so well! No more pilling at all even after blending for a decent amount of time, and I didn’t have to work so hard at ‘patting’ it rather than rubbing it on my face. Hope this helps some who are struggling to apply the product! I love this finish for summertime and think the hydration will be nice in winter as well. Tone 2 works well for when I am tan, but I will probably need tone 1 in winter. I usually use shade ‘Shela’ in the skin tint for reference. Love this!
