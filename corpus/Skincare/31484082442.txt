The V-Facial Intensive Wrap mask has a chic souffl√© texture. Very pleasant to apply on the skin. Light fragrance. In my opinion, this is one of the most effective masks that I have used to get rid of puffiness. The face not only visually looks less swollen, but also feels lighter. To the touch, the skin after applying the mask is more elastic and toned. amazing mask
