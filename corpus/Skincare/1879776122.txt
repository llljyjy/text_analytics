This moisturizer is SO creamy and hydrating, it feels so luxurious on my skin and my dry face loves it. I’d give it five stars except the smell is kinda funky - it half smells bad and half smells like a cookie, but in the weirdest way. Aside from that, I love it. I’ve never used la mer but it feels like what I imagine la mer feels like Obsessed
