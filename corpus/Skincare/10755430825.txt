This is my favorite moisturizer! It offers amazing hydration that lasts all day, and in the freezing winter months it prevents my skin from drying. It also makes my skin radiant and glowy, which helps it serve as an amazing makeup base. I am attaching a pic of my skin before and after using the mask.The fact that it is anti-aging is the cherry on top!! Hydration and glow galore!
