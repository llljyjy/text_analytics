I received this free from influenster. I really wish I could have used this but it irritated my neck and a few small spots on my face. I dont care for the smell it smells floral in the tube but once it’s on your skin it has a floral playdough smell until it dries down then it just has a light floral scent. I normally do not have issues with facial products but something in this didn’t sit well on my skin. nan
