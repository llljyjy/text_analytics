It was finally sunny enough to use this in KY! I put this on early Saturday morning before being in the sun all day. I usually hate the greasy feeling that sunscreen leaves me. However, this sunscreen didn’t feel that way. It was light, didn’t make my face white and best of all, it protected my skin all day. Very impressed! Loved!!!
