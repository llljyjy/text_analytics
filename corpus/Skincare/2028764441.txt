This facial spray is really a rescue, being on the lake in the sun and on a boat can really dry your skin out. I brought this with me because I’ve already gone through a bottle and when you don’t want to apply moisturizer but need added moisture this really feels nice on your face. I know the ingredient list is fairly short and probably mostly water but I’ll continue to buy this spray for the summer. SOS
