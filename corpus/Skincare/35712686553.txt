I love this sunscreen so much! I’m 15 and this is the first sunscreen I started to use regularly. It has a subtle minty scent; and I like that, and it doesn’t feel weird on my skin like others say sunscreen usually would. It comes pretty small in size; but since I only use it on school days or when I go out while it’s sunny it lasts me a while. (I know you’re supposed to apply it no matter the weather but I had to save it) I only apply 2-3 fingers worth, and it does the job just fine. Some people said theirs came half full, but mines came normal. It feels a little greasy at first, but it dries down and it isn’t over oily when you reapply either! I will be stocking up on this for when the weather gets even warmer!! I LOVE THIS!
