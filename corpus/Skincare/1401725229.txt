love this Lancome serum! It is probably my favorite beauty/skincare product I’ve ever used! I saw almost instant results and after using it for a month, I can really see a difference! I have hyperpigmentation from pregnancy and this helped to lighten it. It also has kept my face plumped and hydrated. It has a very pleasant, light smell that’s not overwhelming at all! I use it morning and night and will 100% be repurchasing once I’m done with this one! My new holy grail!
