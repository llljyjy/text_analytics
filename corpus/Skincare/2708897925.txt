I received this product in exchange for my honest review and I gotta say I’m very impressed! It has a very thick consistency but it melts into the skin like water, it’s such a cool formula! And it hydrated, doesn’t leave skin super dewy but definitely plump and looking youthful and glowy! No shimmers or anything, just pure hydration. And it leaves skin baby soft! Smells nice although I would prefer the scent to be softer cause it does linger a bit— however, it didn’t irritate my dry eczema prone skin. And currently I have a patch of eczema and I applied this cream overnight and it helped my patch! I also woke up with actual plump skin and that never happens! I’m very excited about the results. I’ve tried many creams and none have made my skin wake up this way. My skin needs LOTS of Hydration haha Woke up with hydrated plump skin for the 1st time!
