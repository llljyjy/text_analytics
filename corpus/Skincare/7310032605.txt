Easy, smooth application and quick to dry. I’ve got sensitive skin as it is, even more so around my eyes, and this serum has been great. No itching or redness like I’ve gotten with some other serums, and I do actually think it’s brightened up my tired eyes some- nobody’s told me I look tired in like a week and as a mom of 4 kids 8 and younger, that’s an accomplishment lol. I’m on day 12 of using it every night and every morning after washing my face, and I love the little applicator- really does make it easy to apply to the eye area without pulling at the skin accidentally. It does get a little difficult to get out as it starts to get low, but that’s not a deal-breaker for me. Good application, visible results
