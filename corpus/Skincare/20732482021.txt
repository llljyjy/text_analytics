I received this product free from BzzAgent to try. I have been trying to wear face sunscreen more often lately in an attempt to take better care of my skin, so this was a great product to receive. The sunscreen is good. Consistency is nice, next-to-no smell, texture isnâ€™t sticky or overwhelming, and it does not appear to leave a white cast... which is a huge downfall to sunscreens typically. I would buy again! nan
