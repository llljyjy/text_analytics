I have been loving this hydrating mist! First off, the packaging is beautiful with the heavy glass bottle. It is very appealing and easy to set out on my vanity. As for the product itself, it has a very light fresh/floral fragrance and is very hydrating. I’ve mostly been using it to set my skincare in the AM/PM or to prep for makeup application. The mist is VERY fine, so I do find myself spritzing several times for full coverage over my face. For this reason, I haven’t been using it as a setting spray as the last step in my makeup routine; however, it may perform just fine. It leaves my skin feeling fresh, hydrated, and glowy. Definitely recommend if you can fit it in your budget! Luxe hydrating mist
