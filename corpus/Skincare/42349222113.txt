I received this tiny #freeproduct from Topbox circle and was able to use it for about two days. I used it in the morning and my skin looked plumper but I instantly noticed the tingling sensation this product left. It did go away relatively quickly but it was quite unpleasant. I wouldnâ€™t recommend or buy this product. Caused an uncomfortable tingly sensation
