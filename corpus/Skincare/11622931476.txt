This face wash is the holy grail. It left my skin feeling very clean but not dry like I have had with many other products. It smelled great and minty but there was no tingling sensation on my face which I liked. The texture is definitely different as it is thick and creamy which was not expected but very pleasant as it still spread evenly. I would definitely buy this product. So Refreshing
