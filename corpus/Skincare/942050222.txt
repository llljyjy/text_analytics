I received this as a sample to review by Influenster and I’m so happy I did! I’m 43 with very sensitive combo oily skin. I’ve been noticing more lines in my forehead and crease in the middle that was really starting to bother me. I was considering trying Botox which I have not done yet. After a week of using this cream my lines definitely seem to be lessened. I wake up with smooth hydrated skin that is not greasy which is a big plus for my oily side. I’ve also had no irritation.  This is a win for me! Definitely a winner for me!!
