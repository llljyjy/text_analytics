I personally loved this eye cream. I wasn’t sure at first, because although the product had a good weight to it, it didn’t seem that full when you looked at it on its side. However, a teeny tiny amount goes an incredibly long way. I see a noticeable difference in my under eye brightness and tightness. I absolutely adore my other eye cream from Clinique, and was skeptical that this could even come close, but I think this at least matched or surpassed it. I’ve used this for a few weeks now through moving and starting a new job, so my under eyes should not look as great as they do considering my lack of sleep!! I would recommend this if you have the funds, for sure. Note: this review has been incentivized by my receiving this product for free, but views are my own. #incentivized Surpassed my expectations
