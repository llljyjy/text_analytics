Okay moisturizer, not bad, not amazing either.  Goes on nicely, not heavy.  I’ve been using it as a daytime moisturizer this past winter.  I do however find the rose smell a little meh, -1star.I haven’t really noticed any changes to my skin.  I’ve been using it for just over 2 months.  Previously used the Lotus moisturizer and LOVED it, will probably go back to that :) Just “ok”
