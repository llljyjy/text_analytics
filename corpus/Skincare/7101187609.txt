My skin has suffered from dryness and breakouts the last 3 months while traveling across the country during the winter in different climates. I had tried Ordinary’s retinol treatment and experienced a lot of irritation even when pairing with YTTP’s new cactus hydration serum, so I was curious how this retinAl would compare. So far after using this a few times over a couple weeks, my skin feels significantly smoother, clearer, and calmer. My skin barrier feels restored and I actually find the bright yellow color delightful. I did receive this as a free sample, so the 4 stars is because while it certainly seems very powerful, I’m not sure yet if it would be worth the relatively high price.
