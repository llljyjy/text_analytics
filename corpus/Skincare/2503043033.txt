I was pleasantly surprised by this product as I am picky about my skincare.  I like that itâ€™s fragrance free so it did not sting or burn my somewhat sensitive skin.   The texture is luxurious and it melts seamlessly in to the skin.   It dries down to a matte like finish.  However, this left me feeling a little dry.   I think this would work beautifully under makeup.   I used it as a nighttime moisturizer.  I would not classify this as a balm.  This product was provided complimentary from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. Pleasantly surprised!
