So far I’ve been highly impressed with the Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream. It has a nice, thick consistency and subtitle but pleasant scent. It goes on well as in it absorbs into the skin and doesn’t leave a residue. I used this at night and felt that my skin still felt hydrated in the morning. There are a ton of amazing ingredients in this cream that should lead to positive changes in the texture and tone of the skin over time. Can we also take a minute to talk about the gorgeous packaging? Overall, this cream is highly luxurious and definitely one I would recommend. nan
