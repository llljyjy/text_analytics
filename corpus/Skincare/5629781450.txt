I am very particular about the brands and products I use on my skin as it is sensitive and acne-prone. To begin, the Origins Clear Improvement Honey Mask has a light smell that is divine. Next, when applying the mask, it was easy to apply and did not leave a big mess given the charcoal ingredient. After leaving the mask on for the said time, I removed it was a damp cloth and washed my face immediately after. To my purpose, my face was not irritated in any way. It felt smooth, bright, and clean. I would 100% recommend this product. Great for sensitive/acne prone skin
