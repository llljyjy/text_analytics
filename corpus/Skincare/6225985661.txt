This is okay. I don’t think it’s worth the price. It’s a thick moisturizer so not ideal for day time. I really don’t like the smell of drunk elephant. It doesn’t smell like much. It smells like I imagine a cardboard box smells like. I’ve tried to like their products but ultimately don’t think they are worth the price point. I prefer my Cerave or Trader Joe’s moisturizer over this. Not worth the money.
