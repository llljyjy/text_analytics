I just used half of the bottle for 1 application???? Directions say to completely saturate skin and that is impossible without using a majority of the product. A directional or guide video would be beneficial since I was not sure how much to use. The smell is hardly noticeable which I appreciate. The product also feels moisturizing to my skin. However, I cannot forgive the product considering how much product I had to use to ensure full coverage. nan
