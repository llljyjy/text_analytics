Another must have from Kosas! This brand continues to amaze me! A spray serum! What??!! Where has this been all my life??A serum that you shake and spray your way to incredible skin! This power packed serum is full of good for you ingredients to firm, life, plump, soothe, strengthen and hydrate your skin. Everything about this serum is beautiful including the packaging. A pretty peachy pink glass bottle adds to the luxury of this product. The mist that sprays out feels even and balanced. I should only need one maybe two sprays to cover my entire face but I find myself spraying more because of the feel and the pleasing scent, I canâ€™t help myself. Overall my skin looks much more improved since I began using this serum. Brighter, smoother and much more hydrated. This serum is good for all skin types including those with sensitive skin. nan
