Kiehl’s Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution is a treatment for discoloration and dark spots. It can also help visibly correct uneven skin tone and help the appearance of any skin texture. It doesn’t have an overpowering scent , rather it has a lovely light airy floral scent which was very nice. I loved how smooth and silky the solution felt as soon as it touched my face! I have sensitive skin and braced myself for any light discomfort or irritation that  most treatments of the same kind I have tried in the past usually gave me. I was pleasantly surprised that there was not a moment of discomfort and how gentle it was! It absorbed quite quickly but still left a lingering smooth feeling on my skin. I used this product for well over a week and am still using it, and so far not only has it delivered on its promises of clearing up dark spots and uneven skin tone but my acne I was experiencing cleared up, which was definitely the icing on the correcting treatment cake! In comparison, the other treatments I have tried in the past were too harsh on my skin, has an overpowering scent that never dissipated, made my complexion look ruddy, and definitely didn’t have the bonus of clearing up my acne, let alone my dark spots and uneven tone! My skin now feels smooth and looks great and I don’t even have to use my blurring face primer anymore! I will definitely purchase this again when I run out. Kiehl's: Clearly the Correct Choice
