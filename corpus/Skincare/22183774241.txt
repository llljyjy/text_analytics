The soap smells so good I could literally smell it through the box. I love the cocoa smell. It is a nice large sized bar. The soap lathers up good super sudsy. Left my skin feeling super clean. The only negative is that it wasnâ€™t very moisturizing. Kind of leaves my skin feeling dry compared to my dove soap. I received this product as part of a free sample program. Smells so good
