I went through two full jars of this and loved it! In the jar, itâ€™s a very thick balm. I use a spatula to scrape some out, melt it in my hands, and rub over my makeup. It turns into a smooth, silky oil that breaks down everything and rinses clean. The smell is super faint but lightly fruity. It leaves your skin feeling soft and ready for your second cleanser! Great gentle first cleanser!
