Most spot treatments don’t do anything for me, but I know sulphur works for me! I use a 10% sulphur spot treatment in the evenings but this is perfect for daytime. It has sulphur poweder, so it smells funky, but that dissipates quickly. And this really does work. It calms down inflammation, helps reduce the size of spots, and quickens recovery. The salicylic acid, succinic acid, and sulphur combination is excellent and I haven’t seen it in any other spot treatment! nan
