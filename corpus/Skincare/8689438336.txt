my first few uses i wasn’t sure, but i kept with it, and now i’ve used it every night for 3 weeks and it’s the best moisturizer i’ve used in so long. i have like really sensitive/reactive, dry, and red skin. and it’s MAGIC. i don’t even have to use my color correcting primer anymore. my skin has gotten less “textured“ and brighter.because my skin is dry and sensitive, a lot of even the thicker moisturizers will just be all slurped up and my skin is dry when i wake up in the am. not this one!!! it’s awesome for ME. and i know it’s pricey but it’s so good. i will for sure be a repeat purchaser.it does have a semi-strong lavender scent. but it doesn’t react with my sensitive skin at all. and it’s good for me bc i use it at night so i like lavender oil anyway. fragrance in moisturizer has never personally bothered my skin even though it’s very sensitive.this is VERY THICK. it is aptly named as a balm. if you have oily or oily-combo skin i would stay away. i think this could be a great nighttime moisturizer for normal-to-dry skin. and for dry skin in the winter months.i NEVER write reviews for designer/high-end skincare. but i just had to because i’m so into this product. MAGIC for my dry, sensitive skin!
