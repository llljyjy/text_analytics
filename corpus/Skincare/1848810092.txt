These 100% work for me on white heads. I put them on overnight and the next day I can see the difference. You see it on the patch (white circle where the gunk is pulled out) and flat spot on the skin where the pimple was. I have sometimes popped a pimple and then put a patch on and it still works and probably helps heal the skin more than my old routine (applying tea tree oil). I’ve applied these to my face and body and I have the same results. I have found this does not work on under the skin pimples. Also, be warned, this will pull out your hair (eyebrows, hairline), so be careful where you place it. I do find it’s a bit pricy for the amount you get. I’m interested in getting the 40 pack but the ingredients look different. It works
