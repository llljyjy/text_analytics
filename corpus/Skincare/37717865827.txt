Being completely honest with you guys I’m not a big fan of self tanners, I’ve never tried one before actually but I decided to give it a try to this one and it has a nice scent and good texture, also love the minimalistic package. I like the idea that is a gradual tanner that also hydrates your skin. I’ll probably give this to someone that would enjoy it nan
