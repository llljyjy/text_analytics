I love everything about this toner from the gorgeous quality packaging to its formulation with 2% BHA, Azelaic and Alguronic acid and vegan collagen. After the very first use I noticed how smooth and refreshed my skin was, but after continuous use for a couple of weeks I am seeing even the more impressive results with my pores being clearer and less prominent, my skin looking healthier, brighter and more radiant. Despite its effectiveness, this toner is not harsh at all and I experienced no irritation with daily use. nan
