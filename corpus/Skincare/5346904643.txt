It’s weird because a lot of people have mentioned that this pilled. I’ve worn this moisturizer over makeup and haven’t experienced any pilling. I really like this - I have oily/combo skin and it’s on the heavy/super moisturizing side, but I’m finding that it’s perfect for the cool, dry autumn months in Canada. The smell is light, which is perfect because I like some scent but heavily scented products irritate my skin. I liked it so much I just ordered the Christmas gift set with the toner and serum, and the hydrating spray. Love it
