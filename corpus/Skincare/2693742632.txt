I really have been enjoying this Hanni Razor. First of all it’s so beautiful and aesthetically pleasing I like the blush color. Also it really has a nice weight on it and feels very well made. It’s easy to place the blade with a simple twist to open the wings. The blade feels soft and gentle on the skin. But don’t be fooled by the cute design the razors are sharp. It gives a good result without having to go over and over the same place. Also I like that it comes with 5 blades. Check them out highly recommend it. Received complimentary from Hanni. Love it
