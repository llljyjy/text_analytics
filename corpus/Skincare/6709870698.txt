I got a free sample of this.  It’s thinner than the Superberry Dream Mask, but thicker than the Superfood Air-Whip Cream.  It has a very faint smell that’s hard to describe, but goes away quickly. It absorbs quickly and feels nice -- I like it! I was hoping YTTP would make a ceramide cream, and I’m glad they did. Good! Ceramides and peptides in one.
