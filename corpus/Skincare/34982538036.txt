I had the opportunity to try out Kiehl’s new Fast Release Retinol Wrinkle-Reducing Night Serum, and it did not disappoint! I am not a novice retinol user, and I think this is one of the better products with retinol I’ve used. This one clocks in at .3% retinol, which is a fairly strong retinol serum, particularly for beginner or intermediate users. What I like most about the serum is that it’s remarkably gentle and suitable for those with more sensitive skin who might have had issues with other retinols in the past. After using this serum for a few weeks, my skin appears smoother and the fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes are less apparent. Overall, this is a great product from Kiehl’s! An Excellent Retinol
