I have dry skin and I have issues finding effective face wash that are gentle but can still get the job done at removing makeup . I used it for a week to see how my skin would look and feel. First thing I noticed was how gentle it is, but also very effective at removing my makeup. To be fair tho I did have to wash my face 2x to feel like it got it all off. If you do the double cleanse method then you will enjoy if not then I would not recommend. nan
