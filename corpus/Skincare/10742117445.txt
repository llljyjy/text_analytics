I use a lot of high end products so I was doubtful I would really notice a difference. I tried this product alone on my skin and over my normal skin care products. What I noticed immediately is my skin felt moisturized longer than normal. Usually In the winter I start feeling dry around my eyes by midday.  This product layers well over all my normal products and doesn’t  pill. I also tried this product on my hands. Since I’ve had my thyroid removed my hands have been insanely dry. This product really made a noticeable difference when I used it. I would definitely by this product for the winter months when my skin tends to be drier. I was cynical but it works
