Iâ€™ve used a few other La Mer products and this treatment lotion was easy to incorporate into my regimen. It is a lightweight liquid that is quick to absorb and goes on after cleansing and before serums or moisturizers. The smaller bottle is good for travel, however, the wide bottle mouth makes it challenging to portion out the right amount to use, especially since the lotion is liquid, more so like a toner, and not viscous as other lotions are. Because it is so lightweight it will be great for warmer months in particular although suitable for all months in combination with a regular skincare regimen. nan
