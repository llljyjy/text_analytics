I used this as the first step cleanser to remove makeup (once it was warmed up, it did that great!) but had to use a second cleanser to remove the residue and finish cleaning my face. I also found that the product separated in the bottle so it would be really runny with more creamy ’chunks’. Would recommend the Ordinary cleanser or Farmacy cleaning balm instead, similar products without as much greasiness and don’t separate in the container! Better options out there
