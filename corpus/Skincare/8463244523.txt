I held off on quiet sometime to build up a routine using this product. I wanted to give a real answer as I always do. I definitely noticed after a week my skin was not as dry especially around my nose which is where I notice the most dryness. I also did notice my skin is much brighter after using and would definitely recommend. I still incorporate this into my current skincare regime. Also a little goes a long way. nan
