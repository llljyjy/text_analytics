I usually donâ€™t like serums at all but this product was recommended for my dry skin. I am in my 40s and trying to prevent wrinkles like crazy. I was so surprised at how smooth this product made my skin in just a few days. I mainly can notice my neck. It had little dry bumps on it and lines. I actually noticed a difference from using this product which is I think is rare! New go-to for the winter!
