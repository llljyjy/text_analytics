Totally loved it! Thatâ€™s all I have been using for the past month. Perfect works as a makeup primer, after using it, foundation just glides and sticks to your face. Also, my skin over all feels and looks smoother. Definitely loved this product. The bottle is huge, might last you for a long time! So worth it
