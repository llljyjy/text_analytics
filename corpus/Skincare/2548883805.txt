I received a #freeproduct sample of Clinique’s Smart Clinical Repair Serum to try out. I’ve enjoyed using this serum! This serum has a milky consistency and is a soft pink color. There is a bit of a scent to it but it is not overwhelming. I love how easily this serum applies and soaks right into my dry skin. My skin is left with a natural-looking finish after applying - no greasiness. This serum contains ingredients such as a vitamin C derivative, hyaluronic acid, vitamin E, squalane, and a vitamin A derivative. The texture of my skin has improved since using this product - my skin feels softer and looks more evenly toned. I did not receive enough product to test out for a longer time period to comment on how well it diminishes the look of wrinkles. A nourishing formula that soaks right into my skin
