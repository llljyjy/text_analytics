I really wish I couldGive this five stars! Unfortunately the shade was just not a match for me however it wore really well lasted all day gave really great coverage considering it’s not a full coverage foundation and a beauty balm love that it’s SPF 40 did not feel heavy at all just… The color was just not a match for me. Overall this is a great beauty balm and gives great coverage with really great SPFjust needs more range of shades. more shades please!!
