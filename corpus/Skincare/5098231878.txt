I’m a Sephora Community Ambassador and was given this product in exchange for my honest opinion. I’ve used many different types of cleaning brushes before from my Clarisonic to foreo, but this brush is the first I’ve felt comfortable enough to use every day. It feels nice and soft with the outer brush bristles, but the center gives enough texture to go for a deeper clean. I like that this is a manual brush because I never have to worry about changing a battery. I’ve been using this for about a month and a half now and the brush still looks to be in good condition. I love using it with a gel cleanser! Gentle yet effective
