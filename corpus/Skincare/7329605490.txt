I received this item for free for reviewing purposes. All I got to say is that I about damn near use the whole bottle already lol. Love it so much I have tried other lip conditioning oils and as other lip conditioning oils are really oily kind of just runs off your lips especially in the summer, this one stayed put added a lot of moisture to my lips especially when used after exfoliating your lips and putting the product on and sleeping with it overnight no more cracked chapped lips,absolutely love it. I highly recommend if you like a thicker consistency of a lip oil other than something that is a really oily that has a nice cherry scent to it. Love It
