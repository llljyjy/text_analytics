Received this mask complimentary for review. I really enjoy using overnight masks and thus keeping as no exemption. A little does go a long way. This is the consistency of a cleansing balm so j like to take a little at a time and smooth it over the skin, massaging it to help it be absorbed. I do try to let it sit for a few minutes before laying in bed. I read a review stating this came off the pillow, but I also think n when you place an overnight mask on, you want to lay on your back. Any product will rub off, if you have your face against something. My skin did slightly tingle when applying, but it didnâ€™t redden or irritate my skin and definitely has helped provide hydration in the winter. Great hydration
