I’ve been using this product for a couple weeks and have noticed an overall improvement in my skins hydration. It also leaves my skin with a kind of dewy glow I love! It goes on so smooth and is a great foundation to layer makeup on. Only downsides for me would be that it seems to leave my skin a bit oilier throughout the day but not really a bad way. I’m not breaking out like I was with other products. The perfume scent can also be a bit much. Photo is after I just applied it in the morning after washing my face. nan
