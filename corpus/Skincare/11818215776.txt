I have been wearing this daily to work instead of my regular makeup foundation. This reduced the amount of time I spend on my makeup routine in the morning.The first thing I noticed about this BB cream is the texture. It’s very light and airy, and nongreasy almost like a mousse. It blends out easily and doesn’t feel heavy on the skin at all. The shade Deep tan-deep superbly matches my complexion with no cast! keep in mind this contains 5% zinc oxide in addition to other sunblocks. It evened out my skin tone and covered up small imperfections without looking cakey or heavy. nan
