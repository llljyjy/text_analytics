This product was so light on my skin and felt amazing. It was so hydrating and brightened my skin. I love Laneige and their products, but this was by far one of their best! My skin complexion looks much better than before and it does not leave a sticky residue like other treatments. I would totally recommend this for individuals who want soft and hydrated skin, with a slight glow. The bottle itself feels very expensive and the product has a nice fragrance too. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox Loved this product!
