I’m 25 and have dealt with some acne/bumps/ keratosis pelaris on my face since I was about 14 and this is the only thing that I’ve seen make a real difference in my face that hasn’t irritated the heck out of it. I have very sensitive combination skin which makes it hard to find the right thing that isn’t irritating / makes things worse. Ive been using this for a few months now and haven’t seen a pimple in weeks (usually would have at least 1-3 weekly) and my face is smoother and less red. I haven’t been this confident in not wearing face makeup since before I wore face makeup. Cannot say enough about this product! I’ve also tried A LOT of different toners/ serums / moisturizers you name it and this is the only thing I’ve seen make an actual difference in my skin. I use cerave cleanser and moisturizer and this toner and my face has never looked better! Sensitive / combination skin YOU NEED
