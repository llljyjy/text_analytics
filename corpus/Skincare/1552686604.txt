I discovered this product as one of my Rouge Rewards samples.  It was love at first sight, smell, feel...  A little goes a long way and a dime sized amount is more than adequate to cover face and partial neck.  It glides on like satin and keeps my face moisturized all day.  I have combo skin and am accustomed to having moisturizers leave dry patches on my cheeks.  This  formula seems to have intelligence on where and how to distribute its silky moisture;  Will continue to use until I find something else superior... doubtful! Love at first smell, touch, feel....
