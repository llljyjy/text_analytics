I didn’t think this would do much, but I bought it because they marketed it very well and it smells amazing. However, to my surprise, this serum makes my normal-dry skin (dry skin in the winter) bouncy, plump, and hydrated for the whole day. My skin looks noticeably less tired, even with less than 6 hours of sleep. I’m in my early 20s, so I don’t have many wrinkles to handle, but I do have issues with dullness and some under-eye shadowing. I use this on my whole face and started to use it under my eyes too...and it instantly plumps/awakens the under eye area too! Pleasantly surprised
