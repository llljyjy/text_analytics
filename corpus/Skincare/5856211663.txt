To preface: I have very sensitive, super oily skin. Ideally this product would have helped curtail some of my oiliness but it did not. A few hours after application, I was fully oily all over. Moreover, it broke me out in milia all across my cheeks and chin after one day of using it. The 10% niacinamide is unnecessary, it seems because I use a different niacinamide serum that’s not as concentrated and it’s more effective at minimizing pores and oiliness and doesn’t break me out. Disappointing because people rave about this product, but it was not for me. If you have skin like mine, be sure to monitor how your skin reacts after application. pass.
