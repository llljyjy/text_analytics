I never review products but this one right here deserves one. I’ve had bumps on my face forever and I’ve tried many products with little results. One use of this product 50% of the bumps are gone or smaller. I’ve been using it for 2 weeks and almost all the texture of my skin is gone! Yes, the bottle is small but don’t let that fool you, a 2 drops does the trick. When water hits the cleanser it does smell like a relaxer which is a bit odd, but at this point I didn’t care. It works! Miracle worker
