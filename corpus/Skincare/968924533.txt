After reading reviews I was hesitant to purchase this because so many other people said their jar was half full. I took a chance and unfortunately it was true - the jar wasn’t even full to the halfway mark and it was really disappointing. I did try the cream twice before returning it and it’s a good product, but nothing more effective than other retinol creams I already have. It’s very mild in my opinion and I had no peeling or redness, which is a good thing - especially if you’re new to retinol. I have had similar results from Herbivore’s Moon Fruit night mask which even has a similar color. I wasn’t impressed with the fill level & the Sephora manager looked at me like I was lying when I took it back to the store. I told him to check all the reviews about the fill level on the Sephora site and he agreed to let me return it. Really off-putting experience! I would only recommend this product if Saint Jane addresses the issue of filling this jar half-way. The Jar is Definitely Half Full!
