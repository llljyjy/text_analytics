This review does not cover product performance, just my very first impressions upon opening the box.  Just noting that 1) this cream contains AHAs, which is not noted as a featured ingredient so you may just want to keep that in mind in case you already have an AHA in your routine—I’m going to have to adjust my routine since I wasn’t expecting those; 2) the packaging is plastic and not glass.  I love the Tata Harper glass packaging and that was honestly part of why I invested in this cream, disappointed to see it is plastic.  Right now I am not recommending this cream but that could change. First impressions
