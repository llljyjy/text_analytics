I’ve used nearly the full bottle and have noticed a faint difference. Dark spots have faded sutley. It feels a little thick & sticky until I apply a moisturizer. It did not irritate my skin at all, even when used with other actives so my skin personally took to this product extremely well. At the price point however, I’m not likely to buy but given how my skin responded I am interested in trying some other products in this line. I also shared this product with 2 friends who both really liked it. I did receive this as a gift from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. Overall, if price isn’t a factor for you I would absolutely recommend! Subtle Improvement
