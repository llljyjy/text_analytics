My first GUCCI product!! It comes in a nice glass bottle. The spray is a light floral scent mist. Very light on the floral scent, didn’t make my sensitive sinuses go crazy. I had use several more sprays than my usual setting spray since the spray is a very light, delicate spray. I did notice a little glow I don’t usually have, and that was nice. It lasts all day in this Texas heat. The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 - one day I did end up with mascara transfer to my eye lid at the end of a sweaty day - maybe operator error - not sure. GUCCI!
