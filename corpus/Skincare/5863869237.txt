If it were possible to rate 0 stars I would! I honestly have never left a review on any product before, but after my disappointment to finding out they’ve changed the formula from the original I absolutely HAD to. Mainly with wishful thinking that enough people agree & they bring it back ugh. Everything about this is in no comparison to the original!! I hadn’t realized it changed until after I went to repurchase as usual, after using it I noticed it wasn’t the same shortly thereafter.. upon research I came to be right. The original not only ACTUALLY hydrated & nourished your skin for you to feel, you could see it as well!! It gave a glass skin finish, cleared up blemishes & rejuvenated skin all in one. From personal experiences, the amount of compliments I got on my skin using the original moisturizer was outstanding! Not to mention, the look on peoples faces when I told them that it was Sephoras very own collection & the price for it as well, was absolutely priceless. PLEASE bring back the OG, maybe this new formula will work for others but I believe the original should still be available for purchase. BRING BACK THE OG! This ain’t it.
