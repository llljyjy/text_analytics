This balm starts out a thick consistency but melts once you rub it between your fingers.  The scent is too strong for me and somewhat unappealing.  When I applied the balm it felt very heavy and greasy. It ended up leaving oily residue all over my pillowcase.  The next morning I felt that my skin was quite soft and it had absorbed nicely. Over time I did not notice any reduction of my fine lines. Even though I appreciate the soft texture of my skin since using the balm, the experience of applying it and how messy it was made me not want to use it again. nan
