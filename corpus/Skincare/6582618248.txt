This is by far my favourite tan. It’s hard to find one with natural undertones, and this one has done that for me! I also hate wearing tanners for long periods of time, so the express was a game changer. It has great payoff for the short time it’s left on, and is super easy to apply (if you know the basics of application). The color usually lasts about 5 days before I notice the fade and also gets a bit blotchy on my chest around then. I think if I was better at using moisturizer regularly that may fix that problem though, so I can’t blame the product for that. Overall I really love this product and would recommend! Finally a natural looking tan!
