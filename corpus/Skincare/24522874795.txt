A good product but I don’t know that it’s worth the price.   There are probably a lot of other great exfoliators that are less of a splurge.   However I don’t regret buying this.   A little goes  a long way and I’m still on my original tube.  If you have very sensitive or dry skin, this might not be for you.   My skin is fairly sensitive, but I use this every 2-4 weeks as an addition to my regular routine.   It’s been good for me,  but I’m not sure if I’ll repurchase when I finish this product. If you feel like splurging, it's worth trying.
