Love that it’s a gentle exfoliate. Not a huge fan of the scent. It kinda smells and looks like glue. It does glide on nicely. I just did one pump and it covered my whole face and neck. I did notice a couple dark spots lighten but for the price there’s other stuff that works better for a more reasonable price. nan
