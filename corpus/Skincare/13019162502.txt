I received this product in exchange for my honest review. The product contained 7 individual sachets (0.9ml) of serum. There was enough there to trial the product for 7 days. Itâ€™s designed to help with aging. I can say after a week of use. I do feel my skin has more of a glow and is more radiant. Perhaps with longer use there would be an improvement in fine lines and wrinkles. I will certainly continue using the product because I like the way my skin looked. It was smoother and more radiant. Definitely recommended! Great Skin Care Routine!
