I just received this Shiseido Urban Environment Oil-FreeMineral Sunscreen complimentary from Influenster andShiseido in exchange for my honest review. I was veryskeptical about this sunscreen because the ingredientshave a lot of silicone and I usually do not like silicone in any face products. After using this, I am pleasantly surprised. First, the product comes out light nude, not pure white, it leaves no white cast on my fair/light normal/combo skin but I don’t think it would on any skin color. I place this sunscreen over moisturizer, so it dries down to a satin finish. It’s not matte, especially over skincare but it’s not oily at all. This leaves me feeling like I skipped sunscreen even though it’s on. It’s not greasy AT ALL, like a lot of sunscreens are. I would highly recommend this for all skin types, especially oily. My only issue with this is that the price is really high for the amount you get, but I do not expect anything differentwhen buying Shiseido. If you purchase this item you know you are purchasing a luxury item. All in all, this is my new everyday sunscreen!! Amazing undetectable satin finish
