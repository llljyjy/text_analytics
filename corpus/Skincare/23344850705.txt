I’ve been using this product for 3 weeks now. I hate that I loved this... so pricey, but so fantastic. It drastically helped my hyperpigmentation which I have struggled with for so long. I don’t know if it will make my spots completely disappear, but I’m already satisfied with the results. My skin feels hydrated and fine lines seem softer. I gave it 4 stars because I don’t like the dispensing mechanism. 3 different liquids come out of the pump at once and you have to mix them before applying... which wouldn’t bother me except for the fact the liquids aren’t always evenly distributed. If you store the container upside down it does help with that issue though. I received this product complimentary from Influenster. Fantastic
