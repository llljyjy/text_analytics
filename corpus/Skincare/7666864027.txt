It’s usually hard for me to tell with skincare if it actually does anything, but for this it definitely doesn’t. It adds barely any noticeable color and it’s very greasy where I definitely didn’t want my face to touch my pillow after using this. I’m returning and just using the drops even though it’s a bit more work! It smells good though Doesn’t work
