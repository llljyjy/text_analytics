This product has a light yellow-orange colour. It’s also quite thin so a small amount can be enough for the whole face. It kind of drys onto your face which sometimes feels a bit tight. This product is also scented and takes some getting used to. To me it smells just like a Clinique moisturizer I’ve had before and kind of like cardamom. It’s definitely water based and doesn’t make my skin oily. Overall I’d say it’s pretty good but don’t love it Light Moisturizer
