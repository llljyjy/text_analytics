First thing I noticed about the product is it’s beautiful colored packaging! I also noticed how emollient the product looks but how lightweight it actually feels on my skin. I especially love how quickly it. My biggest pet peeve with moisturizers is when they don’t absorb into the skin fully or take forever to do so and feel heavy. This cream definitely adds moisture without feeling heavy! Added bonus is it’s clean ingredients. I received this for free for testing purposes only. Love!
