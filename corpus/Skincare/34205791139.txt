The best sunscreen! I’m always on the lookout for sunscreens that aren’t harmful with chemicals/fragrance/etc. and this one is IT. It’s not greasy, it’s Hawaii/reef-safe, it goes under makeup very well, and it’s perfect for everyday wear. I’ve been using it for about a week now and I have had 0 breakouts from it & my skin is very sensitive to sunscreen (normally I get breakouts from them). Must Have Sunscreen!
