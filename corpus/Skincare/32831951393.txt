I never leave reviews . This is my first one ever . I love love love love this product . I have been on tretinoin since December which has been helping my cystic acne and closed comedones but not fully . I was still getting pretty heavy cystic acne on my cheeks until I started to use this product . After about a week of using this all of my breakouts stopped and my scarring started to get lighter . I haven’t had a breakout since using this product .Another thing worth mentioning, I have extremely dry/ sensitive skin and this didn’t dry out my skin terribly .
