After using this scrub over the past few weeks, I am loving the results! It has helped keep my skin feeling renewed. Application is easy, and the formula is thick but a little bit of product goes a long way. Itâ€™s a clay face mask that gently exfoliates while getting rid of any small black heads. It definitely has made my skin appear more smooth after each use! A must have in my routine!
