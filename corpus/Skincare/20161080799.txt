I was optimistic and excited to try this product, but I did not expect to feel a noticeable difference so soon! Within just a few days my skin was drastically smoother. I don’t yet have any deep wrinkles, so I can’t vouch for performance in that area, but I do feel like my skin is plumped and I’ve seen enough to make me want to continue using this serum. I have experienced absolutely no sensitivity with this product. There is a very subtle scent that fades quickly and is hardly noticeable. The price is a bit high, however you do use a very small (pea sized) amount. I was surprised to see that you mix the powder retinol into the serum yourself, but I honestly find that reassuring to know that the product is at its most active/effective when you start using it. Plus it was really fun and made me feel like a scientist :) LOVE this!
