I’ve loved biossance products in the past but wow I’m really impressed with this moisturizer!! Living in Chicago with harsh winters, my skin tends to look dull and get very dry especially my forehead. This moisturizer left my skin my glowy and refreshed after using! It’s not greasy and absorbs really well. I think it could work for all types of skin, but really is amazing for dry/dull winter skin Obsessed
