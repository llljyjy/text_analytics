Overpriced garbage. I bought this because I had a few extra bucks and I saw all the good reviews. I bought this a couple months back in the winter and it made my skin horribly dry with red patches. I used it just recently and I don’t even have dry skin at the moment, I just wanted to try it again to see how it worked. Dried my skin out again. Don’t buy this, I mean seriously. I have oily skin anyways and it dried it out so bad. makes skin so dry, too thick
