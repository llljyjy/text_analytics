Ok so the smell isn’t the greatest, but it works so I’ll    still give it 5 stars. I have oily, acne prone skin that breaks out with even the tiniest change in my skincare routine. This has not broken me out and my skin looks glowing by morning. It also doesn’t give me patchy red cheeks either. Would definitely buy again. would buy again
