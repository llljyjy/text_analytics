I have never in my life finished a lip balm before this. This is the only thing that has ever kept my lips from being dry and chapped (not even Laneige’s lip mask could do it.) I did have issues with the tube like others have said (no product would come out after a few months, despite there being product left) but this product is so good I still repurchased. It’s the only thing that keeps my lips soft enough to be able to wear lipstick - cannot recommend enough. Best lip balm ever
