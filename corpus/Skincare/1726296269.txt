Terrible. I have dry skin and rosacea. When I put this cream on, it’s oily and at first it might seem like it works, but then it just gets into every pore of my skin leaving white dots all over my face and making my face feel uncomfortable. I tried it with a light moisturizer and also following Guerlain’s Abeille Royale, Shiseido’s moisturizer and Belief hydration bomb mask. Always the same nasty after effect. Gets into pores and clogs them
