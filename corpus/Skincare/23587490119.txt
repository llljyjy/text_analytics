I used this product a few days after receiving it and I’m already noticing some improvements of the dryness of my skin! My skin normally gets really dry in the winter so I’ve been trying to find a product that would help with that. The smell isn’t super strong which is nice. It’s a good fresh smell and has a soft texture to it! I have extremely dry skin and I feel like this will help out a lot! Great product!
