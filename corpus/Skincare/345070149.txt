I have to admit, I wasn’t thrilled with it because of the smell. I honestly didn’t get chamomile from the strange scent. That being said, it definitely did a great job moisturizing without feeling too greasy.  As my skin is super dry on both my legs and arms, I was happy to see I did not need to reapply lotion throughout the day - once was enough. Just down a star for the weird scent. nan
