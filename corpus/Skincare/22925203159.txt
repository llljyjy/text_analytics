I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This wrinkle cream has been nothing short of amazing for me. I am 42 with no significant wrinkling yet, but definitely developing fine lines around the eye and mouth area, as well as between my brows. I used the sample provided to me via Influenster religiously day and night, never skipping a day. My skin has never looked so soft, supple, healthy, and glowing as when I was using this product. I emptied the sample sized container fairly quickly, but I definitely plan to purchase this regularly in the future as a daily addition/staple to my current skin care routine. Exceeded my expectations!
