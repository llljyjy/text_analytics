This was my first time at trying SuperGoop and I’m so disappointed. I was looking for an spf I could touch up with after work when I workout etc. The nozzle/diffuser on this is horrendous, it sprays uneven with random gigantic droplets. If you’re looking to spray over makeup don’t even think about this product. Nozzle/Diffuser Issue
