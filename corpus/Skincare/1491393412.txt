I needed a hydrating, oil free, nighttime moisturizer with no squalane (my skin reacts badly to squalane) and this was recommended to me. So far, I have been using it every night and haven’t had any negative reaction to it. I like the texture and it comes with a little spatula to scoop it out. I find a little goes a pretty long way, which I learned when I scooped and used WAY too much. Haven’t noticed a change in my skin really, but I will keep using. nan
