Since I already have pretty sensitive skin these peel pads I feel strips my skin and leaves it so dry although I follow up with the serum it comes with but had to use these just a few times a week as my skin isn’t acne pore and barely have any real breakouts until skin is irritated or lacking something! But can say I do like that some dry spots in various areas of my face are becoming visually clearer so that’s the only benefit I’ve gotten from using this for the past 2 weeks! I say can be great for you just possibly use in moderation!I did receive this product complimentary from Influenster for my honest opinion/review! Be careful if you have sensitive skin!
