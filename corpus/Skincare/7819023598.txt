Y’all. I have no idea what these other reviews are talking about. This smells exactly like watermelon and is unlike any other sunscreen texture. It glides on like your fave moisturizer. It’s amazing! I have a fair skin tone! And I apply it right after I wash my face. No need to double up on your am skincare plus this. GLIDES ON AND SMELLS LIKE WATERMELON
