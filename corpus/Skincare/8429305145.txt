This moisturizer used to be my favourite until they recently changed the formula. It’s still a great moisturizer although it’s hard to justify spending so much without the small touches that it use to have. Being fragrance-free the smell of the moisturizer is not the best although if you can get over that it does do a great job of giving you lasting hydration without making you feel too greasy. PLEASE BRING BACK THE PAPAYA SMELL, I MISS IT!!
