In comparison to the moisturizer I normally use, this is the exact opposite as far as consistency.As far as the claims of it plumping and brightening the skin, I think you’d need longer than the 14 days I spent testing this out. I didn’t notice any pore minimization either. If anything, it clogged my pores especially around my cheek area. If you’re prone to breakouts, I’d be wary of using this.I feel like this would be a great moisturizer for the cooler months when skin usually feels tight and dry. Good Not Great
