I have never tried an eye cream that instantly made me gasp but this one did. I find the price tag for such a small amount of product to be a deterrent but having tried it now I fully grasp why it is. My under eye area is smoother and more hydrated than the rest of my face which is double cleansed, lathered in serums, and moisturized heavily overnight. How? I’m obsessed with rubbing my under eye. It feels like silk. It’s truly incredible and unbelievable to me. I’m so incredibly amazed and happy with this concentrate. I want a face cream just like this now. Expensive but High Quality Results
