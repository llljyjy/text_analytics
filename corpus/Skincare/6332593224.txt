I used this cleanser and make up remover as both. First I applied some to a cotton round and put it on my lashes for a couple seconds and it easily wiped away my waterproof mascara. Some times I would even apply some to my face after I cleanse to make sure I got all of the residue off my face. Itâ€™s a great product and removes all the make up and even waterproof mascara! nan
