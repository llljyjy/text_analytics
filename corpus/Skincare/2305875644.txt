I am definitely a fan of the Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Eye Gel Creme. I love the brand already so I know its going to be good. This cream is very gel like, living up to its name, and goes on so smoothy and makes my skin feel refreshed. I’ve been using morning and night and I love it. Works amazing and doesn’t leave me feeling greasy. nan
