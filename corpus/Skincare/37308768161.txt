Well, the good part about this is that you  Get about 1/3 more product in this than you would in a regular eye cream. I haven’t used it long enough to see a difference, but vitamin C is supposed to be good for dark circles, so I’m hoping there’s some change it does have essential oils in it ,citrus ones, to be exact so you could be sensitive to this. nan
