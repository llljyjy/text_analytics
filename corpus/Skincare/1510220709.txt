With Lancôme Rénergie H.C.F. Triple Serum, you can restore volume, reduce wrinkles, and brighten dark spots. There are three different formulas that dispense from separate chambers but dispense together. The packaging makes this serum stand out from the rest.  I love how it feels on my skin.  In general, I’ve noticed that my skin is softer, hydrated, and my complexion is brighter. Despite its strong floral scent, I am not bothered by it. Those who are sensitive to smell should avoid it. 3 in 1 serum ❤️
