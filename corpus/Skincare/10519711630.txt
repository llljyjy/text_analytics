Some of the reviews have been claiming this product is oily, and while it does feel a tad bit oily I think it’s because they are using too much product, I only use a drop on each cheek and rub it in all over my face and it feels very lightweight and not too oily! I also have acne prone skin and I haven’t been breaking out as much while using this! When I do break out I use this all over my face and also on my breakout spot and it’s gone by the next day! Love this product!
