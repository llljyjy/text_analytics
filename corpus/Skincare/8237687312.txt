I’ve used this a few times now and won’t ever go back to a different brand. The color is fantastic- not orangey at all. It faded incredibly evenly for me, no blotchiness at all. Lastly, once it dries after a few minutes, it’s not sticky AT ALL. I used to use isle of paradise and would feel sticky until I rinsed off. This is so so so good. best fake tan yet
