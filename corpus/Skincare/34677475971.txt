I’ve used this for over 2 weeks and now and my skin just looks better! I haven’t noticed any color changes but I do seem to have smaller pores and softer skin. The bottle is pretty, but keep it upside down in order to get all 3 serums out at the same time. Knowing that ahead of time will save some product. I'll get more!
