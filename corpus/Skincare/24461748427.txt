I’ve been using this product for a week daily and it’s really helped hydrate my eyes. It hasn’t been bad on my sensitive skin. I think the packaging and the balm look sleek. I’m currently a first time user and haven’t had a steady eye cream in years; but I will definitely be a return customer. Strongly suggesting this to family and friends. Insta like!
