I usually use La Roche Posay cream cleanser for my dry skin, but this cleanser is a nice decadent break from my routine. It cleansed my mascara and eyeliner off easily, and most importantly was not overly drying after washing off - I have not yet experienced a cleanser that both cleanses without hydrating appropriately (no greasiness after the fact).
