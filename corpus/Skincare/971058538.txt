This product did help my skin I will say that. Smoother texture, softer skin.  However, it is very weird to rub in, I can’t really explain it other than I really had to work to move it around and get it evenly into my skin.  It clumps up or doesn’t spread easy. Also, every few days, I get a pimple which isn’t normal for me at all. I can feel that it’s better for my skin than my previous moisturizer, but this is not ideal. My friend tried mine and said she used to use it until they changed the formula. She said the new formula doesn’t feel the same and smells stronger. I won’t buy it again. I’m sad because I noticed a positive change, but it needs some tweaks. nan
