The packaging literally ruins the product!! My first time opening it I was so excited cuz I’d heard such good things and it literally exploded and the product would not stop coming out. It wasted SO much of an already expensive product, and any light tough would literally make more seep out. It shouldn’t be so difficult to use. The sunscreen is fine (nice, even) but the fact that so much product was wasted within my first 2 minutes of using it ruined the experience for me. :(
