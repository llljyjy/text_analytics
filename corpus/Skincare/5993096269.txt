I used the sample size of this product and even after a few uses noticed a huge difference in my skin’s moisture. Especially during the spring/summer months, my skin tends to be more dry and it’s hard to find a moisturizer that works without feeling too heavy. This has a nice gel-like texture that penetrative the skin nicely and is easy to apply makeup on top too. I noticed benefits even the next day when my skin still felt much softer and more moisturized. I will definitely be purchasing the full size product! nan
