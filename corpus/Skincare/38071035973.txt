I’ve never used a sunless tanner that’s felt so luxurious. The mousse is thick, and you only need a fraction of the amount as other tanners. The color is beautiful right on application and dries immediately, which is amazing because you can wear it throughout the day. The color after processing is even better and gives such a glowing tan. My skin feels smooth and there’s no sticky feeling at any point. This tanner with their mitt is the easiest and most luxurious tan you will ever wear! Worth ALL the Hype!
