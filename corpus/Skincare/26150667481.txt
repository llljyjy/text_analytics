I cannot say enough about this serum!!! I was intrigued with a sample of a different serum from Shiseido so I tried this along with the Benefiance wrinkle smoothing cream and WOW! The serum is thick and creamy but somehow does not leave any greasiness whatsoever. I also have sensitive eyes and skin around the eyes but have had no problems with this serum. Bonus is the gorgeous packaging which really makes you feel like you’re doing some major self care. All in all, it’s worth the price. Best serum I've ever tried
