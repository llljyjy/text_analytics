I actually really hate this makeup removing balm. It’s super heavy, greasy, and difficult to spread all over your face. When you rinse it off, there’s still this greasy film on your skin. If you use it on your eyes, it leaves a foggy film over your eyeballs that’s impossible to get rid of. I’ve rinsed out my eyes thoroughly with water, I’ve used eye drops, nothing helps. Definitely won’t be buying this again. Hate It
