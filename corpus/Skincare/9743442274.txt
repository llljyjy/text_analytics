This stuff changed my skin. I’ve had acne prone skin, rosacea, and even after accutane, I struggled with texture still. I got this in a sample and immediately fell in love. Have gone through a couple bottles since. THIS WILL CHANGE YOUR SKIN. It’s such a gentle exfoliant like I have never seen before, and trust me I’ve tried a lot. Leaves my skin polished without over doing it and without leaving my skin feeling soft but damaged if you know what I mean from other cleansers. Better than drunk elephant by a long slide, and worth every penny. Comes with a decent amount aswell! Changed My Skin
