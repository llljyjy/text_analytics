I love this product. Does the job of removing makeup while leaving your skin soft and supple.  I love that when I use it to get off waterproof mascara, and really rub it over my eyes, it NEVER bothers my eyes. It gets rid of all of the makeup without leaving a greasy residue. The best part is it rinses clean. Leaves my face feeling great. I love the scent of this balm: citrusy but not overwhelming. Anti-aging, skin-softening serum Anti-Aging, skin softening serum
