I absolutely love this. Really great for my oily and acne-prone skin. I’ve never experienced a more lightweight moisturizer. It also has a faint cooling sensation and smells a bit like mint and ginger. In terms of breakouts it doesn’t really do much but for over-all skin maintenance and hydration, it does the job. Also, I ordered this online and it arrived the next day so I’m very happy about that! On my second restock!
