Waiting for the miracles but happy until then-I decided to try this after I read the benefits of using argireline. I also saw argireline listed as a star ingredient in another ‘miracle mask’. I haven’t used it long enough or consistently enough to know how much improvements I’ll see, but my skin seems much more soft. I use this with a Matrixyl 3000, hyaluronic, niacinamide, retinol and B3 cream and they really compliment each other- and my skin! nan
