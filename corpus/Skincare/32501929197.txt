i love this serum! i have acne prone skin and this not only didn’t cause a breakout, but it cleared up existing acne and even lightened some older acne scars. i use it every other night mixed with my usual moisturizer and my skin always feels softer and smoother the next day. it’s expensive but for what it does i would definitely spend the extra $!! nan
