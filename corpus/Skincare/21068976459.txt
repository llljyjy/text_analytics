I received this sample serum in a purchase and I used it and I loved it my skin is dry and I have used many creams and serums and none of them worked for me this serum leaves my skin soft and hydrated I do not need so many creams or many layers with this one with little use It works for me, it has no color or smell, I really like the quality of the product, the only thing is that it is very expensive!!!!!!! hydrate and skin soft
