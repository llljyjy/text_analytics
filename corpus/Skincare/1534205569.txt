received this as a sample to try out. can’t say I love it. feels a bit tacky and I like something more moisturizing during the fall/winter months. I know this is an anti wrinkle service.,  but I saw little improvement to my skin or my skin texture as a whole. I think there’s better products out there. sorry clinic’s. you didn’t wow me with this one. I will pass on purchasing a full size product. meh
