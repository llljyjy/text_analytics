I love Ilia, and I was so excited for this, but this is a miss!! I don’t understand how they are actually selling this for $65 did they not test it? It pills SO bad!! I barely even rubbed this on my face and it started pilling A LOT. then I tried stippling with a brush and I had the same issue. I figured maybe it’s my product under so I tried it with just moisturizer under and waited about 15 mins before applying, still pilly. Then I tried it with nothing under and it was still pilling. I ended up having to take a cotton round and sweeping it on my face to get rid of most of the pillies, but then it obviously removed the product as well. I prefer the rare beauty one- it is hydrating, buildable coverage, does not pill, easy to blend with fingers or brush and more shade options and the price is better. nan
