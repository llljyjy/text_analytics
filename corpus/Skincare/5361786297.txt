This eye cream is really nice and a little bit goes a long way. The cream is nice and thick and goes on really smoothly. It sits nicely under makeup and I have noticed some improvement in hydration around my eyes. The packaging is cute and feels premium. Overall, it is a little expensive but delivers and should last for quite awhile. I received the Herbivore retinol alternative eye cream complimentary from Herbivore. Great product!
