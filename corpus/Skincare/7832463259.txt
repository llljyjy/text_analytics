I was very skeptical will all of the positive reviews of this product considering I have tried other BHA exfoliants that gave little to no noticeable result.  I decided to try it and purchased the travel size first.  I was shocked at the results I saw in my skin as well as my daughter’s.  My pores were smaller after using it on a regular basis.  There was a major improvement in my daughter’s skin.  She went from breakouts along her hairline and on her chin, to clear skin in about two weeks with daily use.  Needless to say, once we finished the travel size I immediately purchased the value size.  With the results we both have experienced from using this product, we will both continue to use this daily for our skincare. Worth the hype
