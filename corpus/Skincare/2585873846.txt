I wanted to preface this review by saying that I am a huge Murad skincare fan! This deep relief acne treatment with salicylic acid was pretty decent to use. It didn’t burn or sting like other salicylic acid products I’ve used. I didn’t notice much difference in my skin in regards to hormonal acne. It cleared up smaller surface level acne but that’s about it. I’ve been using it religiously for about a week after being gifted by Murad Skincare! Maybe I’ll see more results with longer usage! Works for smaller acne
