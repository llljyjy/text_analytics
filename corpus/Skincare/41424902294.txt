At first I didn’t like this product because it’s not really 3-in-1 product. But after few weeks I grew to like it. Pros:Blends really wellGives me a nice tan lookHelps cover my hyperpigmentation Adds and extra sun protection layerDoesn’t dry out my skinA little goes a long way so it will last for a long timeCons:It’s doesn’t hydrate and protects on it’s own as advertised You can’t substitute it for sunscreen You can’t substitute it for moisturizer Good concealer
