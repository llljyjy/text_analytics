This IT cosmetics confidence in a cream supercharged anti-aging moisturizer is overall pretty good. It is thick but more of a gel texture. It sinks into the skin well. I have noticed that if I use too much it makes my skin oily. And thereâ€™s a strong fragrance that smells like baby products lol Nice moisturizer
