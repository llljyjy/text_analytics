The sample was very small leading me to believe you’d only need a pea size for your entire face and unfortunately that’s not the case. It drys very quickly which is a good thing but too fast to effectively apply it around your face without needing to use more product.I didn’t notice any difference in the hydration of my skin and wouldn’t recommend if you have oily or acne prone skin. Seems to be a great option for normal skin without imperfections. Not recommended
