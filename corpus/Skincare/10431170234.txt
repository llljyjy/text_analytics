For years I had used the cetaphil daily face wash and was able to achieve such amazingly clear skin with it. However, once they reformulated the product I found that it had become irritating for my skin causing breakouts, thus starting my search for a new cleanser. With all the good things I had heard about this cleanser I had so much hope but was sadly let down. The sent is quite pleasing and it forms a beautiful lather but those are about the only good things I have to say. This cleanser caused me to beak out in several places I have never gotten blemishes such as my jaw, chin, and across my forehead. This product simply didn’t work for me, nor do I think it’s worth the price tag! (I have normal-oily, blemish prone skin!) not for everyone!
