As a mom of a newborn, sleep doesnâ€™t happen as often. I needed an eye cream that would help diminish the appearance of dark spots and bags. After a couple weeks of use, I noticed an improvement. I also enjoy the moisturizing element, while not being too greasy. The biggest turn off to me is the price. nan
