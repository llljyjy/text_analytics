i received this product for free from influenster in exchange for my opinion. I like that there’s HA and it’s a mineral sunscreen which is good for sensitive skin types. I found that there wasn’t any white cast unlike the CeraVe i’ve tried. It goes on very easy and doesn’t leave a sticky feeling. The only con is that it’s pretty expensive. nan
