I always switch my skincare routine twice a year to make sure my skin is well taken care of during the seasonal changes. Although making sure my skin is properly moisturized is very important year round, I like to switch my skincare routine twice a year to accommodate for the changes of seasons. I live in a place where we get super cold weather to super hot weather, so making sure my skin is properly taken care of is key. With that being said, I love trying products that can do more than one thing for my skin and can be used throughout all changes. I have been absolutely loving this product. It is different from what I normally use but has made my routine so much easier. It is a serum in spray form and it is packed with great ingredients like collagen and probiotics to really bring out the healthiest skin. My skin is more radiant, feels smoother, looks more even. It does have a scent, I personally donâ€™t mind it, it does not linger at all. But, as an esthetician, I always recommend everyone to be cautious of products that contain any kind of fragrance as it can cause sensitivity. It is also very easy to apply and it soaks in nicely. I love that it does not feel tacky or slippery. The texture of the product is nice. The packaging is super cute and vibrant, it looks great on my vanity. I recommend this product for sure. Skincare Must Have!
