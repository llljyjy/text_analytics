I’ve tried the majority of the top brand name retinol treatments but hands down Kiehls Fast release retinol serum is the BEST on the market! After the 1st treatment I noticed smoother appearance of my skin but after 2 weeks, I was floored by how much the lines on my forehead and around my mouth had diminished to the point they are almost nonexistent! Needless to say, all of my other retinol products have been moved to the back of my shelf and Kiehls is now a regular part of my nighttime skincare regimen!! LOVE this product and can’t say enough positive things about it! Buy it for yourself, you deserve it!! The absolute best retinol serum on the market
