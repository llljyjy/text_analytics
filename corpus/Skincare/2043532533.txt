Cleanses okay. If you have a red lipstick or liquid liner it didn’t work well for me. But the one thing I dislike the most is that you get tiny little hard chunks that just have a hard time melting into your skin. Thankfully I have a lil strainer in my sink. Gave it a 3 because it’s better than makeup remover but definitely won’t be buying it again. nan
