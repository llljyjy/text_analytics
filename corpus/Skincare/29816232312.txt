I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I really enjoyed using this cream and love the way that it leaves my skin looking and feeling. The formula is very creamy and absorbs into my combination skin without leaving it greasy. It has a slight fragrance to it which I rather enjoy. I apply it before bed as a part of my nightly skincare routine and by morning my face is very moisturized and even more plumper than before I went to bed. Great Cream
