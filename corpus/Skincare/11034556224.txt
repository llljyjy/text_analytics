This eye cream is bomb. I’m 2 weeks post op and had just tested positive for Covid when this magic potion arrived. The bags under my eyes had bags of their own. Although the cream is thinker than I thought it would be, it wasn’t “heavy.” It was actually quite refreshing. I had imagined a nostalgic scent of banana flavored Runts candy. Even though it is unscented, it has more of an earthy clay scent to it. nan
