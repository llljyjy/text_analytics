Why the price increase?! Absolutely no reason for it. Wonderful product but I go through it way too often to justify paying any more than the original price. Unless the formula has changed and the pilling has stopped? Now this is at the same price point as The INKEY List (when in stock) which is much easier to apply to skin. Price increase?!?!
