Honestly there’s been such a positive difference in my skin 😩❤️ I have loved this product! It’s insane how much of a difference theINKEYlist’s 20% Niacinamide Serum made in my skin. •Photos 1-2 are before ever starting. •Week 1 VS Week 3I have extremely sensitive combination skin, and this particular product posed zero issues for me. I wash & moisturize, but adding this to the daily routine shocked me. MUST HAVE!
