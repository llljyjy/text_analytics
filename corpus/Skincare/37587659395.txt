I have had an upper lip melasma for two years. I wanted to give it a try, since dermatologist on youtube have recommended this cream as a great over the counter product. I bought the small tube   just in case it was not effective or irritating. It’s been a month and I’ve seen a huge difference from day one. It adapts so well with my DAY/NIGHT routine. I don’t perceive the smell that everyone complains tho, I don’t think it is to bad.I love that it is a POC brand and they donate to mental health organizations. I suffer with psoriasis so it makes me happy that there are people out there that wants to do good with their brand love da product
