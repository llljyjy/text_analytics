I purchased this product because of the soaring reviews and because I’m an herbivore fan.  My goal was more even skin tone and reduction in scarring. A whole bottle later and the product did nothing.  Skin tone: the same.  Dark spots: the same.  I switched to YTTPs serum and noticed a difference in about a week.  This clearly wasn’t the product for me.Giving it three stars because the product itself is well formulated. I hate the smell of turmeric and it’s strong here, but the scent dissipates well.  It’s a hydrating product, non irritating, works well for sensitive skin, didn’t break me out.  I think if I wanted vitamin c for preventative purposes, this might be a better fit. But to get rid of hyperpigmentation?  No. Good formula with no results for hyperpigmentation
