The prenatal Vitamins i was taking until my third trimester left a bad taste in my mouth and the acid reflux was even worse.These have done the opposite! The reflux is inevitable but the taste is gone and I dont drag to take these each morning. I will continue to take these throughout the last few weeks of my pregnancy and continue to take them as I start my breastfeeding journey! Way better than the rest!
