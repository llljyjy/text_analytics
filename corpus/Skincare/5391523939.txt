I received this free from Topbox in exchange for my review. I got a sample to try that lasted about 4 days. I used this right after washing my face and I really didnâ€™t like it. I found it soaked somewhat in my skin but it felt like it was sitting on top still. I liked all the eye cream and moisturizer but the serum was not one i liked. It was too thick for my liking. nan
