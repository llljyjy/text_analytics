I received a sample of this #freeproduct Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum from Topbox in exchange of my honest opinion. I loved this serum specially because it is fragrance free, and also it got absorbed very easily into the skin. Since it was so small, I used this sample only once, so I canâ€™t say more than this. nan
