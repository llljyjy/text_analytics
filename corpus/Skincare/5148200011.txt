This powder is amazing for clearing up stubborn congestion on my chin and nose. I use the Niacinamide serum daily and put this on at night 1-2 times a week on my t-zone sealing it in with moisturizer. It is concentrated so a little goes a long way and using too often can cause irritation. I find if I put hyaluronic acid serum on after, it does cause the Niacinamide to pill. I highly recommend this for anyone who has struggled to clear their pores. It is also pregnancy/nursing safe also. Goodbye congestion
