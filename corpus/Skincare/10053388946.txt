This moisturizer definitely delivers in richness and in glow! For reference, I have a combo skin type and typically go for a richer moisturizer in  the evenings. This definitely fits the bill for me. The only downside is the fragrance. I’m not sensitive to it (and honestly like some fragrance occasionally), but it wasn’t my cup of tea and it lingers after application. Overall, I like it, but will have to think before purchasing a full size. Since this was a sample I can’t attest to long term effects. nan
