This is my first time purchasing the regular size… I had gone through 2 of the little size jars that come in a set. This is a great moisturizer but I hated the smell. i bought it again because i couldn’t find snything rlse that worked as well despite the smell but the new jar has NO smell!! The company must have changed the formulation after all the bad feedback on the stinky smell! No More Bad Smell!
