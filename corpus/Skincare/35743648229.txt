I was a bit skeptical of this spray at first, because I rarely believe product claims before trying something for myself, but I was blown away by how great this stuff is! It instantly tightens pores and refreshes your skin making it look fabulous! I used it as both a priming spray and to set my makeup one applied. It held up wonderfully and I even used it later in the day for a quick refresher. I have combination to dry skin, and this spray made my skin feel extraordinarily soft and smooth. I was very impressed that it didn’t dry me out like similar products do. I did not like the scent of it, which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. I can say it does fade pretty quickly though. I was also not a fan of the price point. It’s quite expensive, but I would purchase, because of how well it does work for me. Thank you #trywithtopbox for this #freeproduct to try out. I would absolutely hands down reccomend! nan
