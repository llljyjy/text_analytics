Writing this because, firstly, I’m sick of these ridiculous “this smells bad“ reviews. This cream has a scent that is a) not that strong, b) not bad, and c) doesn’t linger at all. If those reviews are keeping you from buying this, disregard. I beg of you.Secondly, I adore this moisturizer. I’m now a four-time purchaser for that very reason. It’s rich, but has a smooth texture that absorbs beautifully without feeling thick. In using it, I have noticed a difference in how hydrated my skin feels throughout the day. It is super nourishing. My only reason for 4 stars is that it doesn’t come in a larger size so that I can have a vat of it on hand. Scent is FINE, Cosmic Cream is wonderful.
