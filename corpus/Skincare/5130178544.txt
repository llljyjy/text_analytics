Toner always dried me out and when I thought “Let’s see what not-quite-a-toner will do for me“ I had no idea I’d be buying a lifelong staple. This moisturizes and plumps temporarily, but over time (I’m talking months to maybe a year or more) you will notice that is also re0adjusts your pigmentation without lightening your skin tone. Acne scars, freckles and redness are a thing of my past. Sometimes I do this first thing in the morning as a wake up call to the face, but usually I do it right after I cleanse my face before bed and before I apply my night serum and creams. Everything absorbs better if you do. I'll never go back to toners
