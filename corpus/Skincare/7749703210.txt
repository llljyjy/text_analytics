I bought this face wash because of rave reviews and wanted to try alternatives to my usual 2-step cleansing. Personally I find it doesn’t do a great job removing makeup. I also found my skin felt slightly dry after use and needed to add extra moisturizer. Not a horrible product but I won’t be repurchasing. nan
