I have combination to oily skin and this moisturizer is decent for me in the summer. I haven’t used it in the winter, so can’t speak to how it would hold up against indoor heating.It provides a good level of hydration without being greasy. I tend to get clogged pores fairly easily with products (especially those with lots of silicones), but this moisturizer doesn’t break me out or seem to clog my pores, which is a big win for me. I took two stars off because it is STICKY. No matter how much I put on, it seems to leave my face and neck super sticky. It’s honestly a pretty gross feeling and is a pretty big deal breaker for me. I won’t be repurchasing for this reason, despite the fact that it does a decent job moisturizing my skin. Decent moisturizer for combo skin, but too sticky
