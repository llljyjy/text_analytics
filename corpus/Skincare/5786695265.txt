This is definitely a product you miss if you don’t apply it. The women in my family tend to have dark circles and this is helping mine fade. Also my under eyes have never looked so hydrated (dry skin baddies check in). I wish it wasn’t so expensive but I just can’t let go of this product. Blessing in a jar
