I’m really really happy with this product. I read through a ton of the reviews and I know some people weren’t thrilled with it and others loved it, so I was a bit skeptical at first. It seemed like most of the negative reviews were with the dark shade though, so I went with medium to see how it would turn out. Well, wow! I love it! It felt great on my skin, it has your usual self-tanner smell after an hour or two but after how many self tanner products I’ve used in my life I just don’t think there’s any way around that. I love that you mix it in with moisturizer as opposed to putting a cream straight on your face, I feel like this gives the best advantage of getting a really even coverage/application. I have sensitive skin and this has caused zero issues for me, no breakouts (which almost every other “face tanning” products I’ve tried do - st tropez being the worst). And lastly, I love the dropper and being able to control the shade. I did 5 drops mixed in for my face, and about 7-8 drops mixed in for my neck and shoulders. It’s not tacky at all, and so far I have not had any of it coming off on clothing or bedding! Yay! Loving the colour, and if this is medium I’m glad I didn’t get dark lol! Highly recommend this! by far one of the best face self tanning products
