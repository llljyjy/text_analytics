I received this product a few weeks ago from Influenster to test. I noticed it didn’t dry my skin, it was easy to apply, it brightened my face slightly, and it leaves my skin very smooth. The only con for me personally is that it has a strong scent. I’m sensitive to smells so it affects me more than it might others. Overall it’s a good product.
