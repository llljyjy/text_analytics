I received this product sample free to try from Topbox Circle. It is a thicker cream but went on well and seemed to absorb quickly. Left my face looking and feeling soft. I did find it flaked a little around my hair line once it dried. I tried this first thing in the morning before heading out for the day. Skin was kind of dry by the time I returned home.I only received a one-day sample so I canâ€™t comment on any long term effects.#freeproduct nan
