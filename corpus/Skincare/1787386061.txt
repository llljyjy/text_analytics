A little goes a long way.  I use it overnight with my retinol so my skin has time to drink up all of the goodness and is already in recovery mode.  In the morning, my skin is plump, hydrated, dewy and radiant.  itâ€™s a miracle worker.  I keep a couple backups on hand just in case Origins stops making it or decides to change up the formula.  I have recommended this product to family and friends and everyone that has tried it, loves it.  A few with dry dehydrated skin actually choose to use it during the day as a moisturizer.  It works and makes my melanin rich skin look sun-kissed from the gawds! Absolutely Amazing
