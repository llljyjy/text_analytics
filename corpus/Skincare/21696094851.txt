I’m not sure if the quantity given in the sample was too much or if I’m doing anything wrong but it just was too much product on my eye area. It fine, I let it be and eventually dries up a bit, but keep it light or you won’t be able to apply any make up after that! :) smells delicious, and looks perfect for sensitive areas. Amazing eye serum
