I wholeheartedly trust this cleanser. I’ve never struggled with acne until recent years, and my skin is generally on the sensitive side of the spectrum. I’ve never experienced burning, tingling, irritation, or redness while using this. With consistent use of the cleanser, my skin has noticeably become less congested, and my pimples/ breakouts are kept at bay. My face always feels properly cleansed without feeling stripped or tight. I always follow up with hydrating products and have achieved the most beautiful results. I am beyond satisfied with the way this cleanser functions. Perfect gentle exfoliation
