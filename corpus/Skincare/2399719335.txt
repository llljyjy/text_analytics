This serum definitely shows potential! The formula is lightweight, creamy and absorbs fairly quickly into my skin with little to no residue left behind. I love the unique dispenser - itâ€™s really nice to be able to close it when not in use and it was super easy to dispense the ideal amount for my needs. The serum was hydrating and left my skin with a soft, dewy glow which was very flattering. The only area with some room for improvement is the scent! It honestly smelled more like a cleaning product than a beauty product. If alpyn beauty could make that less abrasive, this would become my go-to serum! Hydrating and dewy but I can't get past the scent
