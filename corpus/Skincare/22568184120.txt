I love this moisturizer!  I have oily skin and this is definitely a lot of moisture.  But, it feels amazing when I put it on.  So refreshing and lightweight feeling while packing a punch.  A little definitely goes a long way, so one box lasts me months. The scent is gentle as well. Great moisturizer, worth the price
