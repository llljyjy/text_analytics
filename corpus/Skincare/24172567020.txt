I always love a good skin care product so I was super excited to get this! I’ve tried it over the past few days & it’s wonderful. Makes my skin so soft, helps prevent breakouts. It makes my skin feel smooth & buttery soft. I love when my skin feels all clean & hydrated. I’ll probably use this as my main cleanser! Because it’s a new favorite of mine. A little goes a long way! Worth the money it is. I love how it makes my skin feel. Keeps me hydrated! nan
