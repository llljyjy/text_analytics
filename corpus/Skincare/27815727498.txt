I had to try this bc it’s supergoop and it has SPF 50. I prefer body mist sunscreen over cream bc it’s easier to apply and a little goes a long way. It has a very fruity smell and isn’t greasy. Surprisingly I can still get a little color even though it’s SPF 50. I’m very fair so I only burn I don’t really tan. My previous sunscreens haven’t let me get any color at all, but this one works for me. This has Vitamin C in it and I’m sensitive to that do I thought it might have a reaction but surprisingly I didn’t. Never switching and I hope they don’t get rid of this product like they have of some of my other favorite products. My Favorite Body Sunscreen
