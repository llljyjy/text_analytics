This makes my combination skin very oily.  After applying in the morning I get shiny, oily skin that is very hard to control.  Also after switching from the Murad vitamin C brightening serum to this, I have a lot more noticable dark spots and skin discoloration.  I do not notice any improvement in fine lines with this serum so far.  I will not purchase this again and do not recommend it.  This might do better for those who have extremely dry skin. Too oily
