I absolutely love this facial oil. I have combination skin, where my cheeks and forehead are very dry and my nose area is very oily. This is the only product that genuinely controls it all, and it’s been incredibly helpful in holding down my cyclical serum routine. It’s very light yet super powerful in how it balanced my skin within just a few days. My skin is sensitive so it’s also prone to redness, and other oils burned my skin or were too heavy, but this alone has been phenomenal. I use 4 drops on my entire face after cleansing and using toner/ serum. All in all, this is one of the best products I’ve used. Highly recommend nan
