I freaking love this. The scent is amazing, very refreshing reminds me of my childhood perfume. Dries fast and left my skin tight and smooth, it has a mat like glow after drying which I love. My skin naturally gets uncomfortably oily through the day without my usual routine but this elixir is a blessing  when Iâ€™m running on time. Not to mention how refreshed I feel in the morning after spraying it on at night. #freeproduct Adding this to my permanent routine!!!
