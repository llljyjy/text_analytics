WOW! This really removes makeup well and my face has a clean soft feel after I use it. I hate when face washes leave a film residue layer or squeaky dry feeling and this doesn’t do that for me. This wash in combination with Innisfree (diff brand) Honey Ginger moisturizer resolved my winter dry skin issues. I had literal flakes in my t-zone I couldn’t get rid of for the life of me. Now my skin is soft, clear and dewy looking. FAVORITE FACE WASH EVER
