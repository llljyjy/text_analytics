I was so happy to be able to test this out before it hit the shelves. This moisturizer is very lightweight, but don’t let that fool you because it leaves your skin plump and hydrated. I absolutely love the vitamin C and squalane oil so much and this has been a great addition to using it. It’s Winter in AK right now and it’s still keeping my skin Hydrated enough and I still have a natural glow to my face thanks to this. Excellent formula Biossance! Must have moisturizer!
