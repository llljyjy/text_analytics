Really did not enjoy this product. It did not moisturize enough for my liking even after putting on two layers. It also smells really unpleasent, like, hold your breath while applying it unpleasant. On top of all that I started to notice white chunks starting to form around the edges of the tub so I just ended up throwing it out. Hard pass.
