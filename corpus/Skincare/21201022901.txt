I love Est√©e Lauder skin care. This one is no exception. I received a sample size to try it complimentary through Influenster. It has a light scent to it. Pleasant enough. Not overpowering. Left my skin hydrated and soft. I noticed a slight improvement to my skin after a couple days of use. Definitely would recommend this product. Great Skincare!!
