I was warned about this product but I ignored it because I wanted to try it for myself. Ive only been using for a few days but its a no for me. I personally think this toner is REALLY drying. When you first out it on its nice and hydrating but as it dries its VERY drying. I’ve noticed  two or three bumps that MAY be a result of using this (although I don’t want completely point the finger at this toner). Im honestly just gonna return it . The peach slices snail rescue is wayyyy better, more hydrating, and a fraction of the cost. No shade. Regret
