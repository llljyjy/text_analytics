I really wanted to love this sunscreen, but I started breaking out. The coverage and smell is wonderful. I didnâ€™t even get a white cast on my face, and it went wonderful under my makeup without adding more shine. Unfortunately, my very sensitive skin does not agree with it. If you do not have sensitive skin this would work great. Great Smell
