I love this caffeine eye serum.  It has a light gel consistency and you don’t need very much.  I use it morning and night.  It dries so well that I can even wear it under my daily makeup which makes me so happy, as I find most eye creams I can’t wear during the day time due to them making my makeup application sloppy over top.  The Ordinary has done it again with a great serum for a great price.  I also noticed my under eyes feel fresh and possibly a reduction in noticeable lines and redness after about 2.5 weeks.  I’ll be buying it again, I’ve got tons of eye serums and nothing else is worth buying except this one! Amazing eye serum for AM & PM!
