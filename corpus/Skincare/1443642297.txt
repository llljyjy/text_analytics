This item was gifted by Laneige in exchange for my honest review. I really loved this cream! It will be my new go-to moisturizer (I was previously using Obagi). The container is really cute and sleek. It’s easy to open and the product is easy to apply. It came with a little scooping stick to get out of the jar. You could also use your fingers, but it’s a fairly thick cream, so you’d have to rinse your hands afterwards. After application I immediately felt a cooling, soothing sensation. My skin felt plump and fully moisturized. When I used this in my nightly routine, I did not experience any breakouts the next morning. It also reduced redness on my face. My skin also still felt moisturized the next day. The smell is faint but really lovely too. A little bit goes a long way, so don’t slather too much on at first. I’ll definitely be buying more of this when I run out! Really soothing and moisturizing
