I really loved this cream! It left my skin feeling hydrated and soft, without and oily or greasy feeling. I enjoy the scent, itâ€™s light and slightly fruity but not overpowering. I would definitely recommend this to those looking for extra moisture or hydration in their skin care! Great for hydration!
