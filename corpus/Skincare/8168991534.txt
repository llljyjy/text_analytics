I received a sample of this complimentary from Sulwhasoo   and I am really enjoying it! Itâ€™s is very light weight! I put it on before my moisturizer and my skin feels amazing! I do not notice a huge difference in my skin yet, but the scent is herbal and very pleasant. I am not sure if it worth the price without great results in my opinion. But it is still nice! Skin feels great after!
