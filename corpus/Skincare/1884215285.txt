I wanted to love this so much as I’m a big fan of Glow products but this just didn’t do it for me. Leaves a hint of a white cast, doesn’t dry down and smells heavily of sunscreen which I hate. Was really expecting it to be less “sunscreen” and more “skincare” but I feel like I may as well just wear something way cheaper to not love it. I didn’t love the texture of it either unfortunately. I don’t wear makeup daily so I can’t comment on how it wears under foundation but I feel like it would be far too greasy for my skin to do that Not a love
