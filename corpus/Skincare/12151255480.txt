The product was a little lack luster for me, I have combo/dry skin, so 100% of the time I reach for hydrating cleansers. I have about 2-3 tried & true hydrating cleansers I’ve been using for 3+ years now and it’s always great to find one that I could add to the arsenal that won’t break the bank. I found that this cleanser cleaned my skin fairly well, and emulsified great. But my skin afterwards just felt alright, it wasn’t giving that hydrated feeling I was really looking for. It’s not a bad cleanser, but feel as though it’s just not a product for me to have as a daily cleanser since my skin is on the dryer side especially during the winter months. Hoping to try it out again during the summer and see how I feel about it. nan
