So far I love this product! First night of using it I could tell a difference in my skin the next morning. It’s light and mixes great with your moisturizer! I would recommend 10/10.. It doesn’t have much of a smell so that’s a plus for me too.. Can’t wait to see results after a month! Results after one use!!
