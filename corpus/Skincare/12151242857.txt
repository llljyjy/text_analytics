I received this serum for free in exchange from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. love this serum. The packaging, innovation, and best of all, the ingredients. I put this on twice a day and my skin just laps this up. I love how it’s been able to tame my breakouts and congestion and at the same time, makes my skin look luminous. The product is creamy and such a joy to apply. The only reason why it’s a 4 instead of a 5 star is because I’m still in the process of trying it out to see even more long term benefits. On way to HG status
