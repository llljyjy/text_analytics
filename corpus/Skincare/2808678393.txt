This is perhaps my most fav product from The Ordinary! I have oily and sensitive skin but have been using The Ordinary 100% Plant-Derived Squalane for over 3 years. It is oil free but provides ongoing hydration especially when using products such as retinols and salicylic acid. I usually apply a few drops after using retinol and find that it works as a very effective moisturizer. The Ordinary also has a “Retinol in Squalane“ product. Simply the best moisturizer!
