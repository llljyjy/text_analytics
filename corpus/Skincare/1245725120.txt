This is an effective under makeup sunscreen/primer. It’s “glowy“ in that if you wear it by itself your skin has a glow, but it does not show through when you put foundation over it. Pros: light weight, dries down quicker than normal sunscreen, is not greasy at all (I have oily skin so that is a concern for me), SPF 50. Cons: Expensive compared to other products on the market, smells like cheapo drugstore cream. Also was a lot smaller than I expected (it is indeed 1 oz like it says, which I didn’t notice when I put it in my cart). nan
