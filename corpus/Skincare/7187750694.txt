Very nice and hydrating oil that gives my skin a nice glow when I wake up. My mom and I have both been using it, she’s in her 40’s and I’m in my 20’s and we both love it. I have some texture and I get a lot of blackheads but I’ve noticed it being reduced with this. The most important thing for me is to avoid dull skin and this does exactly that! I really like the mess-free packaging as well. nan
