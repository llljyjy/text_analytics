This is a decent moisturizer with good consistency. The smell was fairly pleasant, but on the stronger side so keep that in mind. Leaves skin feeling hydrated, but Iâ€™d be curious to see how well it moisturizes in the winter. I took 1 star away because it left my foundation a bit flaky. Unfortunately, this reason alone will cause me to not add it as a regular product in my routine. nan
