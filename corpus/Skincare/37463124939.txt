I bought this product looking for an affordable cleaning balm. I was a bit skeptical at first due to the fact that most balms come in jars and not in tubes, but purchased anyway. The smell was a bit weird, sort of like stale chemical oats? And the consistency is more of an oil then a balm. But overall the product takes most makeup off, and is a good price! Would recommend if you want a cleansing oil, and donâ€™t mind the weird smell. Good, not exactly what i was looking for!
